        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is the core of Conspiracy. And one we all need to unite on. Let me start by focusing on you, the person reading this. I want to say, from a complete internet stranger that I love you and I want the best for you. Because you are another aspect of myself, and deserve love and safety just as much as I do. You are my fellow man, and I do not care what skin color you have as you read these words or what view points of reality you have. You are a brother. You are a sister. We are a family. We are a human family. We are a creative powerful species capable of amazing feats when we come together. We bicker, we fight. We struggle, we compete. We survive. We do what we must in a world ripe with negativity. But in the end, when everything settles, creative light and love are at the core of who we are. We are meant to love one another, not hurt each other. We have the potentials for so much abundance for all, but a select group of power thirsty power over others, service to self group of psychopaths are not satisfied with what they have and always seek more. This is what greed is. Truly advanced technologies that could benefit all of mankind, suppressed because it would put these &quot;elites&quot; out of control and power. We no longer need to call them elite, for they are not. They are scum of the earth and are in direct harm to mankind itself and wish nothing more than for us to destroy ourselves while they laugh on the side lines.</p>

<p>These are the powers that were. The cabal. The Illuminati. The Shadow Government. Names come and go, but their dark tentacles linger in the shadows.</p>

<p>Their gig is up. Their time is over. The show is up for them and they know it. This is a Spiritual Play of Cosmic proportions and we are all actors in one giant awakening and remembering of divine consciousness and remembrance of what and who we are. Their negativity, control, fear, and war has done a toll on this earth, but it also back fired on them. When you go so far into the darkness, it only makes it that much easier to snap back into the light. We have been held in a dark quagmire for so long, have felt the emptiness of what dark truly is, and have made our collective choice to wake the fuck up and move the fuck on from this barbaric system we have constructed. Total chaos it may look like to all of us looking at reality right now. The truth is, change is always happening, and for a new reality that we all collectively want to happen, all old negative belief systems of control and patterns must break down. I have posted many times about the Mayan Calendar and how the 2012 end times scare was truly a new birth of consciousness for man kind. A golden age of consciousness if you will. This has been heavily documented and researched and has been a pretty interesting topic of discussion. </p>

<p>You may ask where I am going with all of this. What I am leading up to. When you make the personal choice to start finding the truth of our reality, things happen. Synchronicity, Mandela Effect, Law of Attraction, Numerology. You begin to notice patterns and realize things are a lot more connected than you realize and there is a hidden world all around us that we cannot see.</p>

<p>I love quoting Nikola Tesla to make a comparison for this. </p>

<p>“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.&quot;</p>

<p>We all exist on a certain frequency or wave length. Our bodies are dialed into this third dimensional time frame of existence. We all resonate to this frequency, thus we are all in tune with each other and the third dimension itself. If you have heard of Mass Consciousness, it ties into this. This is why group meditations can be so powerful. </p>

<p>Now, think about if you truly knew the truth of our reality, and could manipulate that global consciousness to your own will. Like a few Border Collies slowly leading a group of sheep in a direction. I hate using the sheep analogy but I hope I am providing a picture for you here. </p>

<p>Because of our Third Dimensional Reality, and the Universal Law of Free Will, this reality, or freqency, let&#39;s others experience and partake either in service to self or service to others. The Law of One is what this understanding is. Because we are behind a veil of amnesia, and do not truly know or remember everything we have experienced, it makes this illusionary reality seem &quot;real&quot; it makes it seem like you are your body and nothing more. It makes it so easy to think and believe that. I do not want to go into this too much but I implore you to think about the Possibilities that we are truly eternal souls that never die, and our Physical Bodies at this time are nothing more than a vessel for this time frame of existence for our soul and one of many life times we have and will live. Imagine such powerful perspectives, and then imagine what can be gained by keeping that kind of information from you. Imagine how much easier it would be to control a society that is unaware of what and who they are. Imagine how hard it would be to control a fully conscious self aware society that realizes we are more than our bodies.</p>

<p>This is where this all takes a dark, dark, turn. Some people think God is a fairy tale. That is all fine and dandy. But there is a legitimate group of people. These 8,000 - 8,5000 people believe that Lucifer is God and that he is the true light. They Rebel against creation itself and attack, control, destroy it. </p>

<p>A lot of them are luciferians. Some are Satanists. The thing is, this all boils down to Zionism. A long, long, deep rooted system of beliefs that has permeated mankinds existence even since the biblical times and has been documented in the Bible. The Israelites being casted away to Babylon. </p>

<p>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Russian: Протоколы сионских мудрецов) or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is an antisemitic fabricated text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion</a></p>

<p>This brings me to my next horrid truth of reality. &quot;Satanic&quot; Sex Rings. The inspiration for this post comes from the repeated comments I see of people saying &quot;Satanic Sex Rings are Fake&quot; and &quot;Satanic Panic all over again&quot;</p>

<p>There is a reason these tales exist in the first place. And I am going to provide proof to you that this world is run, and controlled, by these 8,000 - 8,500, and how they use Satanic Sex Rings, MKUltra Monarch Mind Control, to Split victims personalities. And how blackmail is collected on people wishing to get into power structures or into &quot;the top of the pyramid&quot; where access is only given to those that allow themselves to be taped having sex with kids. Or worse...  This is dark stuff, but it needs to be discussed. This is how these 8,000 - 8,500 psychopaths run the world, and also gives them protection from Good people trying to go after them because they ultimately control key positions of power and prevent investigations from going forth. This is why they hate awareness. This is why they hate Unity.</p>

<p>Divide and conquer is their favorite tool. Get your enemy distracted fighting themselves, and they are less of a threat to your own agenda.</p>

<p>Get mankind so hateful towards itself, towards the &quot;other&quot; persons skin color and sexual orientation of preference. They stand no chance to take you down when we are busy dividing ourselves.</p>

<p>This is their bread and butter. This is why we have share blue. Why we attract trolls and shills. This is why astroturfing exists. This is why you can follow the money and find out the truth. If you control the world, you control the money. If you control the money, you control the people. If you control the people, you control the world. You control media, you control Big Pharma, you control access to technology. You set up this big ploy of Russia vs United states then while the citizens of both countries are scared and fighting each other, the powers that were sit in the stands laughing and cheering as fellow man destroy themselves, completely oblivious to the spectators looking on and instigating us.</p>

<p>This game is rigged folks. This reality is controlled. The chains have moved from the physical to the spiritual.</p>

<p>This is the big conspiracy. This is where it all leads to.</p>

<p>Please. Watch these videos. Educate yourself. Bring awareness and light to this subject. Drop seeds of truth here and there with friends and family. Look for the truth and you will find it because the truth is within us. The moment you look outside yourself for the truth that is the moment you confirm you do not have the truth. Always truth your own intuition. Your own awareness and gut feelings. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s come together as one, as we truly are. And free this world from the shackles that it has been placed in for thousands of years. I implore you, a fellow human, to please ponder these things and find a way to help in your own manner. We can stop this TODAY if we collectively chose to do so.</p>

<p>Anytime someone says pedophile rings do not exist, link them to this thread. Share these videos and links with them. Let them come to their conclusion and realize that this is indeed happening. Some will refuse. The more mankind awakens, the further some will create lies to continue their safe reality they have created for themselves. This is fine. We cannot push judgments or opinions as we all have our own way of viewing reality and if people wish to remain ignorant to the truth, that is their choice to do so.</p>

<p>We do not need to waste energy attacking each other anymore. Pushing opniions and trying to create a i am right you are wrong scenario only further divides us and builds ego and fills our heads. I have been guilty of it countless times and will be the first to admit that we all make mistakes and I have given in to emotions more times than I can count. It is time we take responsibility for our actions and realize the consequences of the choices we sometimes choose to make. Mistakes are bound to happen and we need to use them as a learning tool instead of a thing we need to avoid at all costs.</p>

<p>Here are some hard hitting links regarding these rings, as well as various personal testimony from woman that have survived sexual abuse torture and trafficking and other horrid cruel things. This needs awareness. These links do not all pertain to International Pedophile rings but shine light and give context where need be. Feel free to copy this whole post if you wish and share it. No need to give credit.</p>

<p>I implore you to have an open mind and consider these possibilities.

I love all of you, and I hope we can get this awareness out until it hits critical mass. Much love, and Much Light. Thank you for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone checked the &#39;other discussions&#39; tab? We&#39;re being labelled as what they are, violent pyschopaths.</p>

<p>Some of the comments: 191 points and 89% upvoted wow</p>

<p>to be honest at what point do you start worrying about getting these people some help jesus, hard to believe people honestly believe and spend time on this</p>

<p>also lol &quot;This is why we have share blue&quot;, I like how it&#39;s always the liberals that are complicit, never the right</p>

<p>Ultimately, this is why I&#39;m legitimately worried about places like T_D, /pol/, voat, and Conspiracy. Conspiracy is definitely a recruiting ground to get people to join /pol/ or Voat and become further radicalized. Again, this reminds me very much of how Islamists recruit young men.</p>

<p>I mean, before crazy people elected Donald Trump, I thought, &quot;meh, it&#39;s just crazy people on the internet.&quot; But it&#39;s a lot more terrifying than that. A crazy person on the internet can ruin lives, kill, and do so much damage.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really about time we (eg, the police, society) did stop thinking about online hate crimes as online hate crimes and really thought of them as just hate crimes.</p>

<p>Other things that apparently exist include witches, vampires, werewolves, ghosts, dragons, ect. THOSE STORIES EXIST FOR A REASON, SHEEPLE!</p>

<p>Maybe you are just not attuned to the frequency and the third dimension...</p>

<p>Nah, you&#39;re obviously part of the second dimension&#39;s plot to turn the world into cartoons.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically an argument that&#39;s trying to unite the conspiracy community into an extremist religious cult.</p>

<p>It has it all. Pizzagate, Mandela effect, Satanism, pseudo scientific nonsense, blatant antisemitism, the call for &quot;awakening&quot; and unity against (((them))).</p>

<p>It&#39;s just missing the &quot;We need to do something now&quot; not so subtle call for vigilante violence. Maybe he&#39;s saving that for part 2.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a call for further radicalization. I wonder how far they are willing to go down this road. Will we see <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> bombings? attempted assassinations? more vigilantism? They are becoming increasingly unhinged.</p>

I see references to peace and love, though.  I decide I want to show OP support for those things and the effort he put in, without endorsing his specific comments.  That is why I left my specific comment, which I think is true.  It also was meant to point out that words aren&#39;t enough to make meaningful change and to hopefully (doubtful) make OP think, hmm am I actually making the world better or just writing about it.  Writing is so important for encouraging others, but some people are all talk and no action. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>yes it is indeed!</p>

<p>The solution? To be aware of this and realize &quot;if I&#39;m not part of the solutioon, I&#39;m part of the problem&quot;</p>

<p>The singular most important thing you can do is <em>act upon you knowledge</em> that &quot;humans&quot; are One group and the more &#39;separated&#39; we are, the less happy we shall be</p>

<p>it might sound ironic, but eventually the best thing that could happen to this planet is a &quot;one world government&quot; that is a responsible group of people who &#39;manage and distribute the planet&#39;s resources&#39; in such a way as to provide food, shelter and education <em>for everyone</em></p>

<p>But <em>the only way</em> that can happen is IF &quot;people&quot; stop being &quot;patriots&quot; of any country, and not only realize we live in a Global World <em>and only the financiers</em> can make bank from trading all the <em>different currencies</em> aka foreign exchange and the &quot;derivatives&quot; markets.</p>

<p>So If there was only &quot;one world currency&quot;, Bitcoin would be great (but it&#39;s still impractical to do/use worldwide) there would no longer be anywhere for this financial madness known as &quot;foreing exchange trading&quot; to happen</p>

<p>This would <em>effectively</em>  remove a LOT of the current banksters from the game as well as stop &quot;the Forex Highly Sophisticated Stupidity Game&quot; forever!</p>

<p>That&#39;s what the world <em>really needs</em> and asap! Alas, most people hear the words &quot;one World anything&quot; and their patriotic hackles rise, instantly forgetting that the internet has <em>already made it</em> &quot;one world&quot;! Look at you and I, I reckon we&#39;re probably half the planet apart (I&#39;m in Australia) and yet we share likely share very similar views onmany things, yet for some reason we have been taught that &quot;our country IS Best country&quot; ... which is the IDEAL WAY to <em>get the people to separate themselves</em>. Teach them to have some intense natiional pride OR religion, both create the perfect &quot;us Vs them&quot; mentality</p>

<p>and it&#39;s this &#39;division&#39; between us average people <em>that is allowing</em> TPTB to &#39;get together with each other and agree on how best they can <em>use</em> &#39;the people&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p>Which leads to the shitty kind of competitive world we live in, whose people have been so well conned, that <em>they believe</em> that it&#39;s quite fine for the US to <em>invade</em> other countries <em>and call it National Security</em> and the soldiers in fuckin Iraq are somehow &quot;defending the US&quot;, and fuck everyone else btw!</p>

<p>How are those ideas, to begin with? :D</p>

The scales have been tipped against us in the past, but that is now changed.  The bad actors will be locked up just like Satan.  The Devil&#39;s tool is fear, money, and more fear.  Remember, you can&#39;t serve money and God. And fear is not of the Lord!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Randal Turner2 days ago</p>

<p>Hello Craig, At the age of 16 I was used and abused by the people you claim you&#39;re going to hunt down. 
I carried the nuclear briefcase when Reagan was shot. Bush Sr. and Haig used me to get the codes then hold them hostage until Reagan gave Bush Sr. control over the US-China trade agreement. 
Bush wanted to sell arms to China and Reagan wouldn&#39;t cooperate. That&#39;s not all Bush Sr. has done. You claim you want to help the victims, well I am one of them. 
I am going to get justice on my own if nobody will help. Bring your camera&#39;s while I go around from bank to bank taking the money owed to me for what was done to me.<br/>
You can go to my facebook page and see a photo of me laying on the ground with the Briefcase when Reagan was shot. Link: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009933761469">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009933761469</a>. 
 I also added a video that proves I was there and it was me. 
The reason they couldn&#39;t open the cop car door to place Hinckley in the back seat is because I was inside with the Nuclear briefcase protecting it. 
Are you man enough to help a real victim? 
If not how about you bring your camera man and film me taking my money from the banks, I can guarantee you will get millions of hits on your youtube channel from the video when they know the truth of my past and what my government did to me.﻿</p>

<p>Business and Investing is where big money (100s of ml) is made (though the barrier entry is usually very high). Even the highest paying job will not get you more than 1m, be it banking, finance, etc. Except if you are C-executive in a Fortune500 (a few 100s of people) salary will not get you big-money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, pretty much everyone who gets money eventually wants to protect it.... Rebellious rock star with anti-establishment lyrics, maverick director whose films are about exploitation by The Man... They get rich and famous and they are told to &quot;grow&quot; their money. Same goes for successful small biz owners, well paid computer consultants, etc... Basically the 1%.</p>

<p>Some of them realize that having that money in a bank or a vanilla stock portfolio is simply buying into the support of a pyramid scheme with the 0.01% at the top. Or 0.001% or whatever.</p>

<p>But how many of them really care about the work, research, and risk entailed in alternative investment? They are convinced they can&#39;t just stick it under a pillow.</p>

<p>So without tacit approval, and besides the small fraction who really dig under the surface, yes the 1% <em>is</em> mostly serving the super elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok ...</p>

<p>1000 x 1000 = 1,000,000 x 1,000 = 1 Billion </p>

<p>1 Billion is 1,000,000,000 or &quot;One thousand million&quot;</p>

<p>1% of a thousand is 10.</p>

<p>0.1% of 1,000 is 1</p>

<p>0.01% of 1000 is 0.1</p>

<p><del>Profit</del></p>

<p>shit, I was . .. . Wrong! </p>

<p>bugger </p>

<p>But, 8,000 x 8,000 = 64,000,000 </p>

<p>x 10</p>

<p>= almost 7 billion! </p>

<p>And 0.1% of 7 billion is 7 million</p>

<p>and 0.01% of 7 or 8 billion is 700k</p>

<p>we&#39;d have to go <em>two more</em> zeroes in to get 7-8,000</p>

<p>0.0001% of 7 billion is 7,000</p>

<p>phew! that was refreshing in my baked state!</p>

<p>So I must&#39;ve meant to say, &quot;8,000  is 0.0001% of the world&#39;s population, but I forgot ;D</p>

<p>ergo sum;</p>

<p>I was/am still Wrong, even after writing that! </p>

<p>Hey! Never forget that two &#39;negatives&#39; equal a positive .... in maths! </p>

<p>And mathematics <em>they</em> tell us, is  &#39;pure logic&#39;. yup!</p>

<p>And yet it&#39;s all Lies, <em>damned</em> Lies I tell you!</p>

<p>TF I&#39;m bringing this up on the conspiracy sub, coz if that aint some kind of <em>cosmic</em> conspiracy hiding in plain sight, well, <em>I don&#39;t know</em> what <em>is</em>!! </p>

<p>Hiding The Great Math Catastrophe from us! whoa! There&#39;s probably some <em>supermassive number</em> heading towards earth, bigger than a Googleplex! </p>

<p>And knowing NASA, it&#39;s probably also an &#39;imaginary negative&#39; number that kinda looks like a Bitcoin account number, that will kill us ALL when it gets to our point in spacetimespace and cashes in!</p>

<p>If the purely logical maths is wrong . .. and the Blockchain .. <em>then what?</em> <sup><sup><sup><sup>see</sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>below</sup></sup></sup></sup></p>

<p>p.s. I&#39;ve heard that,  &quot;A fool can ask more questions in a minute than a wise man can answer in a lifetime&quot; </p>

<p><sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>No</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>more</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>drugs!</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> that&#39;s what!</p>

<p>There are also many factions within the 8000. But essentially each faction heads up certain areas of commerce and military and etc. They don&#39;t all work together either. There is no oversight or over seer. The DuPont family would be an example of one of the public families within the 8000. </p>

<p>One, not very public at all is the Farnese family. The Farnese family is the main architect of the Cabal as they have created the Jesuits with a little help of the Borja family back in the 1540s. Immediately after that, they have built their first Pentagon in Caprarola near Rome:</p>

<p>Dr. Neruda: “I’m not sure. <strong>Perhaps five or six knew the total scope of the project and another fifty knew elements of the project</strong>. It was, as I said before, a very well-guarded secret.”</p>

<p>Sarah: “How do you keep something like this a secret?”</p>

<p>Dr. Neruda: “There are entire departments within our government that have responsibility for this. It’s a very well-engineered process that includes legal contracts, clear penalty reminders, and known deterrence factors that include very invasive technologies. In the worst case, if vital information was disclosed, a different but related department would step in that would masterfully spread disinformation. It was, and still is, virtually impossible to bring this information to the public.”</p>

<p>Sarah: “They had invasive technologies even in 1945?”</p>

<p>Dr. Neruda: “Yes. While the invasive technologies were more crudely applied, they were certainly effective. There was nothing more vilified in these undisclosed organizations than traitors. The entire organizational culture was designed to reward loyalty and severely punish disloyalty in any form.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>project blank slate. Two points I would mention.</p>

<p>One is that yes you can alter the past but that would take an agreement of all involved with the event to also alter or forget the past memory.</p>

<p>Second, to actually travel to a past, it would create another probable reality for that person only. Basically that person would reenter into another timeline parallel to the reality they left.  They wouldn&#39;t be altering probabilities in This timeline. </p>

<p>This is a subject with a lot of confusion, time and reality are more multidimensional and expansive than our awareness of it. In order for a person to actually alter the past they would have to alter countless choices , not just one. Any person would be incapable of choosing again what others have already done.</p>

The idea is that more complex structures can form some interesting results as they grow and change. The thing is, for the majority of complex structures we are very aware of how the interesting results are the product of the complex structure, except for brain patterns. Now, could someone actually tell me what consciousness is and what qualities of the brain created it (AKA, how is consciousness created in a neural structure)? If you&#39;re the kind of person who thinks all living things have consciousness, please be aware that for certain flatworms we have mapped every single neuron, where they&#39;re located, and what neurons they&#39;re attached to, so it would be much easier to start there.</p>

<p>&quot;bioelectricity&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is bioelectricity supposed to be different from normal electricity, which also occurs biologically and is how neurons work? What organs or cell structures originate it? How is it mechanically contained or transferred? What quantum particles is bioelectricity composed of? What wavelength do they have? What affects does having more or less of it have on a variety of physical and chemical reactions?</p>

<p>Or, if you want to go down a different rabbit hole, what device does kirilian photography use? What is that device made of? What properties of the device allow it to read bioelectricity? How does one interpret the output data?</p>

<p>And lastly we can go through everything from my last comment with bioelectricity substituted in for neurons. What components of biolelectricity and its deployment in humans allow it to create a consciousness?</p>

<p>I&#39;m quite certain that all of these lines of questioning bottom out somewhere with you saying you have no clue, but that you will give up and stop replying long before then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cells manipulate chemical energy by transforming hydrocarbons down the mitochondrial cascade to manipulate the shape of proteins to create an ion gradient on different sides of a membrane, the release of which is used hydromechanically to smash phosphorous ions onto Adenine to create ATP, which can then be destroyed elsewhere to perform other functions. </p>

<p>One of these functions is to power protein pumps that move ions across a membrane to create a different ion gradient along synapses, the release of which generates an electrical charge which travels down the axon in a series of similar reactions until the end node of the neuron is activated, releasing biochemicals which start the process again in the next cell over. This is how our nervous system works, and I can give you relevant sources if you want some. </p>

<p>Now, nowhere in there is a mention of bioelectricity, nor anything that functions like a battery. So tell me, what am I missing here? What biological components within a cell creates and somehow manages to store &quot;bioelectricity&quot;? Be sure to give a description of what bioelectricity actually is so I can be sure the biological components would actually be able to do that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay found it. First of all I see that this website has no academic credentials whatsoever, and while it claims to be summarizing research it does not link to the actual academic papers the studies would have to produce in order to be legitimate. More troubling is the only journal they mention this study being published in is &quot;Alternative Therapies&quot;. Do you know what they call alternative medicine that has been proven to work? MEDICINE. It isn&#39;t alternative if it&#39;s a practice that can actually be used. They also cited the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, which was dissolved in 2013. Lastly, they do not give the time, date, location, or the author of the study, nor any of the participants, which makes it essentially impossible to verify that it actually happened. There is absolutely nothing to say that they didn&#39;t make the entire thing up. </p>

<p>On a more logical note the study makes no attempt to explain how the radiation stemming from the participant&#39;s hands is supposed to heal people. In fact I would expect it to make certain medical complications worse, including and especially cancer. </p>

<p>Unless you have better sources than this, we&#39;ve bottomed out. Keep in mind that we haven&#39;t gotten anywhere near the crazy lengths OP got to, his argument basically tripped over the starting block. </p>

<p>And the entire outside world seems to have disappeared. In reality it&#39;s just dark outside. </p>

<p>This works because there are measurable vibrations in the air, originating from the resonant frequency of the first fork, and inducing the same frequency on the second fork. This is all measurable and well documented. You have so far given me no mechanisms by which anything remotely similar occurs in holistic healing, or how this transfer of resonance is supposed to heal people. You are having on to the last thread and dodging my questions in the hope that you don&#39;t have to face the answer. </p>

<p>These are the only claims they make about the &quot;mystical powers&quot; at stake here.

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree, and through my observations I think OP is on the same wavelength.</p>

<p>Satan is more or less the archetype for the Abrahamic religions, but based on one (or more) of the mesopotamian/egyptian gods, also real people, Marduk/Hadad/Set/Baal etc.</p>

<p>Satanism is also a broad term used for Archonic ritual or communion with demons, which is technically Luciferian. Lucifer could be called &#39;satan&#39; as a title. But Lucifer is not physical and exists in plasma layer of the space around the Earth for the last 26,000 years.</p>

<p>A &quot;light-being/angel&quot; in form of Electricity-Plasma is a very likely assumption, because basically every being and object can be &quot;broken down&quot; to &quot;<strong>Power</strong>&quot; itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they are a mix of positive and negative. Some 5D and above groups that came did not want to be seen as gods, like the Pleiadians for example. Most of this happened right after the destruction 10k-12k years ago and was a continuation of events in Atlantis and Lemuria when everything was very different. The myths of Greece, Rome, Egypt, Norse are all stories of real people (higher-density humanoid non-terrestrials) and many of them are overlapping the same characters across multiple cultures.</p>

<p>Lucifer was an angel/archangel but all higher density beings can choose their form at will. I imagine Lucifer could once take a form, but I don&#39;t believe it can now. I think that it copies but can no longer create. In that sense we are more powerful, which it why it has to trick us.</p>

This has always been interpreted to mean that Satan rules all the Kingdoms of Earth since he can give them to Jesus. The Kingdom of God only exists in the Spiritual World. There is a verse In Isiah that personally reminds me of PizzaGate it talks about how because the people of God didn&#39;t wipe out the Cannanites that they would be a thorn in their side forever.

<p>Ephesians 2:2 &quot;In which you used to walk when you conformed to the ways of this world and of the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit who is now at work in the sons of disobedience&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting, thanks. But NT was written in Greek, and in Greek &quot;air&quot; means &quot;aether&quot; - perhaps it should be translated / interpreted differently?</p>

<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)</a></p>

<p>&quot;The word αἰθήρ (aithēr) in Homeric Greek means &quot;pure, fresh air&quot; or &quot;clear sky&quot;. In Greek mythology, it was thought to be the pure essence that the gods breathed, filling the space where they lived, analogous to the air breathed by mortals.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Kingdom of God only exists in the Spiritual World.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the  kingdom is within you (the Gospel of Thomas).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Aether&quot; seems to be something special and good, if you use it correctly, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>So why would Paul  (or whoever wrote it) connect this potentially good spirit with &quot;the children of disobedience&quot;? Why would he need to pacify the disobedient?</p>

<p>Check Ralph Ellis. He says that Paul was a Roman historian Josephus Flavius who rewrote the gospels to change the narrative. </p>

I do not want to go into this too much but I implore you to think about the Possibilities that we are truly eternal souls that never die, and our Physical Bodies at this time are nothing more than a vessel for this time frame of existence for our soul and one of many life times we have and will live. Imagine such powerful perspectives, and then imagine what can be gained by keeping that kind of information from you. Imagine how much easier it would be to control a society that is unaware of what and who they are. Imagine how hard it would be to control a fully conscious self aware society that realizes we are more than our bodies.  </p>

<p>No measurable brain activity doesn&#39;t mean no brain activity. It&#39;s impossible to measure very light brain activity without sticking electrodes in your skull. Not only that, hallucinations are known to distort the perception of time, such that the few seconds before your blood stopped circulating could feel like entire minutes, accompanied with the usual visual artefacts that accompany certain chemical being administered. As an aside, did you know massive amounts of opioids, endorphins and cortisols are release into the body when close to death?</p>

<p>Show me, just one of those. I&#39;d love to be proven wrong.</p>

<p>The reason you won&#39;t show me one is that you know that your belief in the spiritual realm isn&#39;t based in reason. You believe there is more to this world because it&#39;s reassuring. A cold, scientific world where you die and it ends? That&#39;s terrifying. But I base my beliefs on what reason and reality tells me, rather than on what is comfortable.</p>

<p>If you believe there is more to this world, more power to you. Spirituality can be a power for good. But don&#39;t try to convince anyone that your position is supported by physical reality.</p>

<p>Remote viewing is one such thing. The whole field of parapsychology in the 70s was plagued by bad methodologies, bad science, baseless conclusions and scientists putting their theory before the results.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tricksterbook.com/ArticlesOnline/PEARCritique.htm">http://www.tricksterbook.com/ArticlesOnline/PEARCritique.htm</a></p>

<p>Relevant parts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The PEAR remote-viewing experiments depart from commonly accepted criteria for formal research in science.  In fact, they are undoubtedly some of the poorest quality ESP experiments published in many years.  The defects provide plausible alternative explanations.  There do not appear to be any methods available for proper statistical evaluation of these experiments because of the way in which they were conducted.</p>

<p>Dunne et al. (1989, p. 13) specifically noted that targets were selected without replacement.  This has important consequences for statistical analysis.  It has been recognized for a long time that the analysis must consider the dependence caused by the without-replacement condition.  In fact, Puthoff, Targ, and May (1981) even published a reanalysis of some of the early SRI remote viewing-experiments so that this dependence was taken into account.<br/>
The consequences of these two problems can be illustrated by examining the ratings matrix of Schlitz and Gruber (1980, p. 311).  Their correctly computed probability value, by a direct count of permutations, was 4.7x10-6.  We can implement the PEAR method and form a distribution of the off-diagonal elements.  The mean of that distribution is 198.10 and the standard deviation is 92.21.  A z score can be calculated for each of the 10 diagonal elements.  The resulting composite z score is 6.410 which corresponds to a p value of 7.28 x 10-11. </p>

<p>We grant that the distribution is not normal, but it can be shown that the artifactual inflation of significance is not attributable to non-normality.  Fortunately we can compute an exact probability value for a virtually equivalent statistical model (making the same false assumption about appropriateness of the baseline distribution).  The sum of the 10 largest off-diagonal elements is less than the sum of the diagonal elements.  Conservatively, this results in a probability of p = 80!10!/90! = 1.748 x 10-13; the corresponding normal approximation gives p = 5.35 x 10-12. </p>

<p><em>As can be seen, in this case the PEAR method gives a probability value incorrect by about five orders of magnitude.  The statistical method of PEAR is fundamentally flawed.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If remote viewing existed, do you really think we could go 20 years without some psychology students trying to replicate some of those experiments? I go to a university, so I speak from experience: psych students would sell their mother and one of their balls for a chance to demonstrate remote viewing existed (And go collect their nobel prize afterwards). Yet, no one has managed to successfully replicate those experiments in <strong>20 years</strong>. Has every student, in the whole world, been silenced for twenty years? Or were those experience completed sloppily by biased researchers?</p>

<p>You are right though. About this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science still has a lot to figure out and they&#39;ve already acknowledged that the physical universe is a tiny fraction of reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We absolutely have a ton to figure out. Did you know that matter, stuff we can touch, stuff we can see, the stuff you, me, the Earth and the stars are made of, did you know that all of this constitutes only a small percentage of the universe according to our best models?</p>

<p>All the matter of the universe is <strong>4%</strong> of its mass. 23% is supposed to be dark matter, which we have never seen or measured, and 73% is dark energy, which, well... We basically have no idea what it is, except that it has to exist or the fundamental laws of physics don&#39;t work.</p>

<p>There is plenty to be amazed by and to wonder about aimlessly in real science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that was a really convoluted quote, and it only specifically referred to the Princeton program (PEAR). There are still universities actively researching paranormal phenomena (<a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/54450/13-university-sanctioned-paranormal-research-projects">http://mentalfloss.com/article/54450/13-university-sanctioned-paranormal-research-projects</a>). I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s hard to demonstrate the validity of remote viewing because only a tiny rare percentage of people are able to do it and control their ability to that great of a degree. You can brush off thousands of unique accounts as merely anecdotes if you like, but to me it&#39;s significant evidence. Ball lightning is a similar thing. There were many many accounts in history of it but science/skeptics always said it was bullshit until proven and then finally in 2014 they got their proof because it&#39;s such a rare occurrence. People dying and coming back to life are rare occurrences, and same with the other stuff in general. It&#39;s hard to get a scientific method on these events but that doesn&#39;t mean they should just be discounted as nonsense. Unprovable for now, sure...but most likely possible is the attitude I&#39;d like to see more people getting on board with instead of just clinging to proven science only as what&#39;s possible when we know nothing and science is constantly updating and changing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to come across as an asshole. I really don&#39;t. You seem genuine.  </p>

<p>But there is no substantial philosophy or science of any kind here.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because of our Third Dimensional Reality, and the Universal Law of Free Will, this reality, or freqency, let&#39;s others experience and partake either in service to self or service to others.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Questions I have:  </p>

<p>-What does a third dimensional reality have to do with helping yourself or others?<br/>
-What is the universal law of free will? What are the implications or predictions of the law? How would a universe where the law is true be different from a universe where the law is false?<br/>
-The only law commonly referred to as &quot;universal&quot; is the <em>Universal law of gravitation,</em> which has remained a core fact of physics from 1687 to the present. Does the universal law of free will have a similar pedigree?<br/>
-If we live in a third dimensional reality, E=mc<sup>2</sup> is clearly false. Was Einstein merely part of a Jewish conspiracy? If so, how does GPS <em>really</em> work?  </p>

<p>See where I&#39;m coming from? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The OP is referencing information from <a href="http://www.lawofone.info/">The Law Of One</a> available for free on that link which will answer your questions. I&#39;ve read it...I&#39;m sane. It&#39;s quite fascinating material for those with an open and patient mind seeking truth.  </p>

<p>I can perhaps clarify a couple of things for starters. Your first question. Third &#39;dimensional&#39; I believe OP really means what the book refers to as &#39;density&#39;, meaning the frequency/vibration level of the physical matter in our observable universe. Supposedly there are many densities/octaves from low to high and the higher you go (through &#39;spiritual&#39; &#39;evolution&#39;) the closer you are to returning to the source field/god. Our realm and particular planet are supposedly very rough/dramatic which ultimately enable more opportunities for growth. Supposedly there&#39;s a &#39;harvest&#39; every so often, which has to do with waves that are emitted from the black holes in the center of galaxies that carry higher charged particles that increase the frequency of our planet/solar system and population. Definitely sounds crazy as I&#39;m typing it, but there is some scientific evidence behind some of the theories in David Wilcock&#39;s books.</p>

<p>And I apologize if my initial comment came across as snarky. I re-read it &amp; the &quot;Like you, maybe&quot; reads harsher than I intended. I did genuinely mean that perhaps you might get so turned off by the stuff you&#39;re highlighting that you might not see the rest of the post as worthwhile. I tend to do the same thing &amp; try not to.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong> I certainly don&#39;t fault you if read that kind of stuff &amp; <em>do</em> get turned off. I think it&#39;s more the responsibility of the poster to edit him or herself. That material is entirely unnecessary for his/her point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worshipping yourself and looking down on others is not a how this world should be. Every man, woman and child for themselves. We can unite and make this Earth ours, we can become the gods of the Earth, I believe there is an inner good in every being, all it will take is a united humanity. They have turned us against our true selves. They have turned us against our right to rule and rule over us with no authority. This is our Earth and reality, it is our divine right to make Earth one. A unity of all minds and beings striving for the good of everyone. We are being oppressed as a species. There are few beings left that strive for the greater good, for the benefit of everyone. Ego has killed Empathy, Greed has consumed souls for all of time. Now it&#39;s time to wake up. Our true selves, it&#39;s time to shine.</p>

<p>I also shed many tears whilst I was reading your post.

<p>Neo: I know you&#39;re out there. I can feel you now. I know that you&#39;re afraid... you&#39;re afraid of us. You&#39;re afraid of change. I don&#39;t know the future. I didn&#39;t come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it&#39;s going to begin. I&#39;m going to hang up this phone, and then I&#39;m going to show these people what you don&#39;t want them to see. I&#39;m going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrote this yesterday and felt it applied to this post, today:</p>

<p>Ultimately, isn&#39;t awakening (not political &#39;woke&#39; awakening; but the more intimate awakening when consciousness becomes conscious that it is conscious, rather than believing it is &#39;you&#39;) the goal, despite which intellectual category you find yourself in?
No matter how much we study what&#39;s going on out in the world, we will never find the ultimate truth. That truth lies within and is the answer to everything. I really think it&#39;s time we start spreading awareness about the hidden truth behind what we are (consciousness/awareness/self-aware manifestation of the universe), rather than spending so much energy trying to crack the unsolvable case outside of the self. They seem to have already won that game.
Once we start awakening to the truth within (enlightenment), the world will change miraculously and with ease. But it&#39;s the hardest thing to do because we live in an era in which we cherish the ego, as our entire lives have been founded through the illusory motive of having a self that tells us what to do next. We&#39;re addicted to it. We&#39;re addicted to our thoughts. But it&#39;s time to let go of every fathomable attachment so that the truth can finally set us free.
&#39;Seek ye first the kingdom of God.&#39; Study thyself and recognize that the &#39;you&#39; that you have thought you were since birth is, in fact, not you at all. Find that truth. This should be where we turn our attention, now.</p>

<p>Thanks, OP. Great stuff. Soon enough, this community will have ventured so deeply into the rabbit hole that the collective mind will inevitably begin to question the nature of its own self. Soon enough, we will awaken to the one truth, the most profound truth, and it is <em>then</em> that we will begin culminating unfathomable change. I&#39;m excited for the impending time when the masses begin to realize (or remember, rather) that this reality is, in fact, pure spirit. Consciousness is nearing the moment when it finally turns the mirror around, recognizing itself as the player, the playing, and the played.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone checked the &#39;other discussions&#39; tab? We&#39;re being labelled as what they are, violent pyschopaths. </p>

<p>Some of the comments: 191 points and 89% upvoted wow</p>

<p>to be honest at what point do you start worrying about getting these people some help jesus, hard to believe people honestly believe and spend time on this</p>

<p>also lol &quot;This is why we have share blue&quot;, I like how it&#39;s always the liberals that are complicit, never the right</p>

<p>Ultimately, this is why I&#39;m legitimately worried about places like T_D, /pol/, voat, and Conspiracy. Conspiracy is definitely a recruiting ground to get people to join /pol/ or Voat and become further radicalized. Again, this reminds me very much of how Islamists recruit young men. </p>

<p>I mean, before crazy people elected Donald Trump, I thought, &quot;meh, it&#39;s just crazy people on the internet.&quot; But it&#39;s a lot more terrifying than that. A crazy person on the internet can ruin lives, kill, and do so much damage.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really about time we (eg, the police, society) did stop thinking about online hate crimes as online hate crimes and really thought of them as just hate crimes.</p>

<p>Other things that apparently exist include witches, vampires, werewolves, ghosts, dragons, ect. THOSE STORIES EXIST FOR A REASON, SHEEPLE! </p>

<p>Maybe you are just not attuned to the frequency and the third dimension...</p>

<p>Nah, you&#39;re obviously part of the second dimension&#39;s plot to turn the world into cartoons.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically an argument that&#39;s trying to unite the conspiracy community into an extremist religious cult.</p>

<p>It has it all. Pizzagate, Mandela effect, Satanism, pseudo scientific nonsense, blatant antisemitism, the call for &quot;awakening&quot; and unity against (((them))).</p>

<p>It&#39;s just missing the &quot;We need to do something now&quot; not so subtle call for vigilante violence. Maybe he&#39;s saving that for part 2.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a call for further radicalization. I wonder how far they are willing to go down this road. Will we see <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> bombings? attempted assassinations? more vigilantism? They are becoming increasingly unhinged.</p>

<p>What really motivated me to include that number was the fact that that ex banker mentioned that number in his interview, I think it&#39;s the first link. It&#39;s also kind of widely been regarded to be around that number but it is really hard to pinpoint it for sure really. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d bet it&#39;s less at the very top. Obviously you have various levels. But when the people who have been &quot;briefed&quot; start explaining how there is this group of people that is somehow communicating with a higher dimension, or at least BELIEVE they are, it always gets hazy because there is just no evidence.</p>

<p>The best evidence I&#39;ve ever come across is a couple interviews with people that supposedly witnessed some type of entity during a satanic human sacrifice ritual. But there are so many people that just make shit up, or believe they are seeing things they really aren&#39;t, so who knows.</p>

<p>All that being said, I think the real number of people involved with that at the VERY top is smaller. I would think less than 300-500 at any given time as people die off and new people are brought in.</p>

<p>You are my fellow man, and I do not care what skin color you have as you read these words or what view points of reality you have. You are a brother. You are a sister. We are a family. We are a human family. We are a creative powerful species capable of amazing feats when we come together. We bicker, we fight. We struggle, we compete. We survive. We do what we must in a world ripe with negativity. But in the end, when everything settles, creative light and love are at the core of who we are. We are meant to love one another, not hurt each other. We have the potentials for so much abundance for all, but a select group of power thirsty power over others, service to self group of psychopaths are not satisfied with what they have and always seek more.</p>

<p>We are all starstuff. We share the same matter and molecular makeup. We come from the same place, we die, our physical forms go to the same place. Being a person is temporary, and so we label under this illusion that we&#39;re separate from one another, when really we&#39;re all connected, all sharing this same planet. </p>

There is no lucifer, there is no God, and there certainly isn&#39;t any truth to what you are saying here. Is there a plot to control the masses and their thoughts? Absolutely. But it is much more grounded in reality than this would have you think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wonderful writing, your style is very nice to read however you lost me at</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Russian: Протоколы сионских мудрецов) or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is an antisemitic fabricated text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should take a good look into the Talmud and read what it says about we &quot;goyim.&quot; To give you an idea, Jews who live by the Talmud&#39;s teachings believe that non Jews are not human; we&#39;re animals whose only purpose is to serve the Jew. It says that eating at a table with a goy is no different than eating with a dog. Makes you wonder why you never hear any outspoken atheists like Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, (R.I.P.) or Matt Dillahunty criticize this particular book. </p>

<p>We ought to stop carelessly throwing around words like &#39;antisemitism&#39; because all it does is shut down debate. I really enjoyed reading your post but your comment I quoted forces me to wonder...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused, and have a few questions. </p>

<p>How did seeing hidden patterns in the world lead you to believe in an afterlife?</p>

<p>If the illuminati don&#39;t like people knowing about immortality, why do they let religion exist?</p>

<p>If knowing the truth about reality is all it takes to start controlling it, why haven&#39;t you done so? Why isn&#39;t advertising more effective?</p>

<p>How can there be a &quot;Universal Law of Free Will&quot; if people are driven like sheep?</p>

<p>What is the &quot;Law of One&quot; that you referred to?</p>

<p>How did you come up with the number 8,000? Was it numerology?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Russian: Протоколы сионских мудрецов) or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is an antisemitic fabricated text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it&#39;s fabricated that means people made it up. Is that really what you meant?</p>

<p>Why are you so liberal in your philosophy on human beings?</p>

<p>What is &quot;share blue&quot;?</p>

<p>Is there any difference between this post and previous posts on Pizzagate? Is Pizzagate all you were really trying to say here?</p>

<p>Why are some of the links your provided completely irrelevant? Like the mass grave at the orphanage, the article says absolutely nothing about the illuminati or satanism or pedophilia or anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the &quot;Light Electrical Reality Matrix&quot; aka LERM</p>

<p>This interview was done in 1998 ... now check out <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> and read about the &quot;electric universe&quot; ... which is <em>exactly</em> what Dr Neruda is talking about when he mentions the LERM</p>

<p>The whole story is there! BUT it will take you several hours to read it all. There&#39;s a LOT of info there, </p>

<p>And remember, this guy has <em>defected</em> from a Super Secret and <em>very powerful</em> group of people  known as the ACIO (who don&#39;t want him talking about such things!) </p>

<p><em>Becoz he felt he HAD TO share</em> with &#39;humanity&#39; the discovery of the Ancient Arrow site in Mexico and the things he learnt there!</p>

<p>Things he considered SO important he put his life/mind &quot;on the line&quot; to make these interviews. Considering the power of these people, that&#39;s one hell of a decision to make! </p>

<p>He had worked there for over 20yrs before this happened!</p>

<p>what&#39;s really cool is they are 20 YEARS Old, which means we <em>can look back</em> with &quot;20/20 hindsight&quot; and see for ourselves &quot;how correct&quot; his statements <em>back then</em>, are today! And he nailed it with a number of comments.</p>

<p>like what? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as I know there is no current way to measure consciousness whatsoever, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends upon <em>your definition of</em> &quot;consciousness&quot;. </p>

<p>IMO I tend to concur with this statement</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term “consciousness” is notoriously difficult to define. Consequently, many a debate about its character has been waged without the participants’ finding even a common topic as common ground. By “consciousness,” <strong>I mean simply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience">“sentience”</a> in the most unadorned sense</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than the &quot;philosophical&quot; speculations</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To use the philosopher Thomas Nagel’s construction:</p>

<p>A creature is conscious if there is “something that it is like” to be this creature; </p>

<p>an event is consciously perceived if there is “something that it is like” to perceive it. </p>

<p>⁠Whatever else consciousness may or may not be in physical terms, the difference between it and unconsciousness is first and foremost a matter of subjective experience. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very simply; <strong>Either the lights are on, or they are not</strong></p>

<p>This is what I perceive as &quot;consciousness&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have a look at the work of people like the neuroscientist Sam Harris (there&#39;s even an <a href="/r/samharris">/r/samharris</a>!)  et al and their studies of <em>consciousness</em> using fMRIs --- <a href="https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-mystery-of-consciousness">https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-mystery-of-consciousness</a></p>

<p>so there is really no way of knowing whether or not anyone else in the universe is actually thinking or not, let alone whether or not we all have a connected consciousness.</p>

<p>Not yet, but 20yrs ago the Internet had only just been born!</p>

<p>Why are you being so contrary?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you. I guess it&#39;s easier for me to get my head around as I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a long time</p>

<p>Forget the startrek Borg hivemind concept, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about. Bees do that, not humans!</p>

<p>In a nutshell, have you heard the term &quot;we are all stardust&quot;? </p>

<p>When you consider that <em>everything</em> is some kind of a manifestation of &quot;energy&quot; it is easier to understand like how &quot;we&quot; are all a &#39;part&#39; of it</p>

<p>A bit like how your computer can be used offline or online. BUT when it&#39;s &quot;online&quot; it can &#39;connect&#39; with other computers</p>

<p>IMHO the computers we currently use are simple &#39;representations&#39; of our &#39;brains&#39; and our &#39;&#39;brains&#39; are <em>naturally inter-connected</em> like computers online</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that most people have &#39;forgptten&#39; about  this natural form of com-uni-cation.</p>

<p>Telepathy is part of this &#39;connection&#39;</p>

<p>Surely you have experienced some &quot;amazing <em>coincidences</em>&quot; no?  </p>

<p>Except there&#39;s no such thing as a &quot;coincidence&quot; IMO!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you came to this conclusion known that there is currently no way of proving any of this? I took a class in Animal Intelligence and heard straight form the horse&#39;s mouth that we have absolutely no way of directly measuring &quot;consciousness&quot;, nor any way of proving it exists at all outside of our own mind. It&#39;s this realization that movies such as <em>The Matrix</em> came out of. While I can say I&#39;ve had one or two rather beneficial strokes of luck, they are not by any means statistically significant and are more than rare enough to be thrown out as random chance under any reliable data analysis calculation. Furthermore I would not describe those situations as anything like connecting to the internet or other people, but more like my internal clock and memory to be a lot more accurate in certain situations than it is generally. But asking for proof isn&#39;t the point of this sub (otherwise I would completely destroy his sources), so I&#39;ll let the matter go. </p>

<p>However, there are problems for just the internal logic itself. </p>

<p>First, he does not explain how he got from &quot;there are coincidental powers in the world&quot; to &quot;we must all be connected&quot;, and does not even go into what kind of coincidences he means. It has the same logical flavor of &quot;Unicorns cause rainbows, and rainbows exist, so therefore Unicorns must do also&quot;. I shouldn&#39;t have to say this, but Unicorns don&#39;t exist. At the very least they don&#39;t cause rainbows. </p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t advertisers used this yet? We can certainly assume that an advertising CEO would be in on plots like this, and would certainly use this for excessively enormous profits, because satanic illuminati or no we can all agree that there are some greedy fucks up there. So why haven&#39;t they?</p>

<p>Secondly, OP has expressed a large desire to let people know about this. Even though he supposedly has connection to this gigantic worldwide psychic network, he somehow has concluded that r/Conspiracy and his personal blog are the best ways to get the message out. </p>

<p>Thirdly, three out of the four phenomenon he tries to link to this network are more easily described by (and in some cases actually proven as) imaginary pattern finding, easy and therefore common memory errors, and the placebo effect. I&#39;ll admit that the placebo effect can be really spooky at times, but it&#39;s been pretty much proven experimentally to be 100% rational in our modern understanding of neuroscience. His whole reasoning for why he&#39;s certain this system exists is that there are some really weird correlations out there, and doesn&#39;t even bring up any of <a href="http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">these</a>. The one about divorces in Maine and margarine consumption is actually statistically significant, too, so these are actually more likely to be related than anything supernatural I&#39;ve experienced. He brings up a Tesla quote, but Tesla is talking about early leaps in Quantum Mechanics and related physical sciences. </p>

<p>He brings up a Universal Law of Free Will, doesn&#39;t explain what that is, and then contradicts himself and goes into how people are headed like sheep. </p>

<p>And then he tries to make the leap between bio-internet and satanism, which is not only not a thing outside of judo-christian religions, but all of his sources have a different demon that the satanists are supposed to be worshiping, none of which agree with him. He openly admits that the piece of paper where the satanism thing originated was fabricated. I don&#39;t know if he knows what fabricated means, but he really shot himself in the foot there. </p>

<p>One thing about the illuminati in general is that they would have to have been founded after 1865, because no all-powerful secret society would let the south loose AND Abraham Lincoln be shot. There is no secret plan I can think of that would allow both of those things and still be considered successful. </p>

<p>And lastly, Op pawns all of this off as the &quot;one true all-inclusive conspiracy theory&quot; and then re-writes illuminati and Pizzagate. Thanks, I see no mention of UFO&#39;s, Kennedy, Reptilians, 9/11, or anything like that. The entire thing is written like a politician, taking 30 paragraphs to say anything at all, having zero substance, talking the whole thing up to be much bigger than it really is, giving a stupidly positive general message that excludes himself, sweeping the obvious faults under the rug, and ends it asking you to like, share, and subscribe for more great content. This is not someone I trust with giving me information, and this post is in violation of Rule 11. </p>

<p>Full disclosure, I&#39;m from /topminds and I occasionally like to discuss the logic of claims outside of just sources. You can find my full rant <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/693h41/rconspiracys_unifying_theory_to_tie_together_all/dh3sq06/">here</a>. Quick take on sources: About half of his sources aren&#39;t even relevant to the topic. Another third is more links to conspiracy sites (including r/conspiracy, circular reasoning works because....), none of which gives a source for news stories or interviews outside of yet more conspiracy sites. </p>

<p>Personally, my opinion is that some of these coincidences are the work of higher powers AND that this claim is unprovable by design. I think God works miracles that can&#39;t be proven to be miracles, because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edCqF_NtpOQ">this</a>. And hey, whether god exists or not it&#39;s still important to have faith in something, especially when you have no faith in yourself like I did. </p>

<p>p.s. I wasn&#39;t really up for even trying to answer your &#39;questions&#39; before (hungry, tired, not good) </p>

<p>But, after resolving those issues, I am prepared to try</p>

<p>Could you answer this question first ... and then,</p>

<p>ask me whatever you would like  &#39;clarified&#39; about &quot;thoughts&quot; =&gt; &quot;actions&quot; and that the more people &quot;joined in thinking&quot; <em>the more likely it is</em> that those &quot;thoughts&quot; will become &#39;reality&#39;  ,, regardless of that &#39;thinking&#39; is for!</p>

<p>Primarily nobody has any conceivable way of testing your claim. As I said before we cannot even be certain of consciousness outside of the assumption that every human has it. Therefore it is impossible to make rational arguments based off of it, and the whole thing falls apart. This sub has made several grand demonizing statements that if even remotely plausible would collapse the world into chaos, which only serve to become the tools of the people you despise to fight one another. The modern world is based on proof and scientific rigor, without which we would literally still be in the middle ages, and you collectively piss on the very idea that proof and certain truth is possible to attain. Everything you have achieved for yourselves here is destroyed the moment anyone asks for serious defense of your wild claims, because you have none. If you want to I can apply the same scientific rigor to this post as I apply to my peer&#39;s research and you will fail miserably. </p>

<p>That statement was an observation on strength in numbers, that one united army stands more of a chance than any division of parts competing against each other, and has little to nothing to do with spirituality.</p>

<p>This is true, but does not mean that our consciousnesses are linked. Just because you are a cog in a machine does not mean you understand the whole machine, or have any control over anything but your part of it. Towards proving anything you have said this paragraph means nothing. </p>

<p>/TopMinds was created to laugh at your delusions of &quot;truth&quot; backed up by empty conjecture. There are people today who, trolling or otherwise, reject the idea the world is round even though the roundness of the world has been proven and measured since the days of ancient Greece, navigated since Michelangelo, explained by the physics of Newton, and photographed since the Gemini program. It is literally impossible to draw a perfectly proportional flat map of the world and yet some people think flatness in an inherent quality nevertheless. Who in any mind could possibly think the world is flat in this day and age? Some people are outraged at them. Some people ignore them. Others created /TopMinds to make bad humor about them. I, for one, want to wrench some of these people out of the stubborn ignorance they have chosen to live in, and up until now I have been gentle about it with the people of this thread. </p>

<p>If you really think this is the truth, that I am missing some grand design of the universe, then come at me and prove it. I honestly wish you luck. The burden of proof is on you. </p>

<p>Prove it. If you can somehow prove that you are conscious and that consciousness can be determined scientifically, you will be the leading neurologist in the world by whenever you can write a paper on it. So some on, give me some evidence! </p>

<p>Solipsism is equally unprovable. There is no evidence one way or another, so neither can currently be considered the truth any more than differing religions can. I&#39;m not going to defend Solipsism, I am going to say that you have no proof. Like I said before, the burden of proof is on you. </p>

<p>Yeah?  Open up that textbook and find ~~a <em>decent!! The explantion</em> of &quot;what IS gravity&quot; ... oh, BUT <em>you can&#39;t, except for</em> p aqrroting what you have <em>been told</em>.</p>

<p>You <em>can&#39;t explain</em> to me OR <em>anyone</em> what &quot;gravity IS&quot;? I&#39;d bet the house I live in <em>you can&#39;t explain &quot;the Laws of Gravity&quot; to me</em> ... as there are None!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t  come at me with Einstein&#39;s &quot;theories&quot; ... they DO NOT &quot;explain&quot; gravity, they <em>assume</em> it&#39;s &quot;becoz of a &#39;field&#39;&quot; which means there <em>must be</em> a &#39;gravity particle&#39; .... which <em>we have been TOLD</em> is &quot;becoz Higgs bosons&#39;</p>

<p>BUT, that&#39;s bullshit, and I&#39;m not about to even try and &#39;explain&#39; why to you UNTIL <em>you prove to me</em> &quot;what gravity IS&quot;</p>

<p>I have no doubts it&#39;s covered in that &#39;middle school phyysics textbook&#39;</p>

<p>BUT what if this book was printed in, say, 2012, 2013, 2014 <em>or before</em>? </p>

<p>At that time LIGO hadn&#39;t begun functioning and no-one had <em>told you</em> &quot;we have &#39;found&#39; the Higg&#39;s boson&#39; ROFL!</p>

<p>BTW, I guess <em>you</em> also &#39;believe&#39; in &quot;black holes&quot; just becoz <em>someone/a book TOLD You</em> ALL about it huh?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t explain to me OR anyone what &quot;gravity IS&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gravity is created by objects with mass causing curves in the fabric of space-time. Yes, that&#39;s a rather simplified definition, but you nor any of your sources have been able to give any better definitions other than Deus Vult. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess you also &#39;believe&#39; in &quot;black holes&quot; just becoz someone/a book TOLD You ALL about it huh?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except I know from the quality of the sources that gave me that information (including several physics professors) that these claims have been calculated, tested, and argued about constantly over time. The claims I&#39;ve been making have been battered by thousands of people a lot smarter than the both of us combined for years before they made it into that textbook. You sources, on the other hand, have been academically dismissed by everyone except the people that wrote it and their friends. You cannot find a single positive academic review for your sources that doesn&#39;t come from tabloids. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back to FACTS, even though it affects every aspect of youer Life, You can&#39;t even state what &quot;gravity isn&#39;t!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as modern physics is able to tell, gravity isn&#39;t related to electromagnetism, or the strong or weak nuclear forces. Gravity does not give objects mass, nor does it effect the quantum nature of various fundamental particles. It is not involved in the shaping of electron orbitals or covalent bonds. It is not responsible for the color of objects nor any component in the computer in front of you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like I asked before, &quot;are you just being contrary?&quot; ... I&#39;ll take your silence as a &quot;Yes&quot;</p>

<p>Are you resorting to Ad Hominem attacks?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BTW, you do know, &#39;c&#39; aka the speed of light is not &#39;constant&#39;? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. The speed of light is relative. Under different conditions light will appear to travel at different speeds due to a change in reference frame. This is what General Relativity is based on. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have such an &#39;open&#39; mind, it seems ALL the logic has been blown out of it!</p>

<p>Nothing you&#39;ve said has had coherent logic to begin with.</p>

<p>By my reasoning I can still assert that I&#39;m right and you&#39;re wrong. However, you refuse to accept this, and even after several problems that you have dodged, ignored, and misdirected you still think your ideas are foolproof. Shady claims that got destroyed ages ago were replaced by even more shady claims and insults. This is frankly absurd. Give up already. While we&#39;re at it, why are YOU still replying? You&#39;ve gone hopelessly backwards from the starting point and show no serious attempt towards getting back there, and you seem to be getting angrier talking to me, so why bother replying?

    <div class="md"><p>well how about you stop behaving like one and <em>maybe then</em> you can learn something</p>

<p>i&#39;m not trying to &quot;one up&quot; you and I meann no offence when i say, as somone who&#39;s nearly 40yrs your senior,  I&#39;m confident I <em>know</em> about things and I have experienced many things you haven&#39;t. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t your &#39;fault&#39;, as it&#39;s hardly fair to compare our lives, for who knows, when you get to my age you too may have experienced not just as much, but <em>most likely more!</em> than me!</p>

<p>ALL I&#39;ve been <em>trying to do</em> is to get you to &quot;think outside the box&quot; -- throw &quot;conventional&quot; (and <em>very conservative</em>) thinking out the window and &#39;come at an idea&#39; from another angle --- although to Do so is far more difficult than most people imagine. </p>

<p>And as few people ever try or bother to think in such a way, (it&#39;s <em>easier</em> to accept what you&#39;re &quot;taught&quot; by &quot;teachers&quot; of all kinds) so not a lot of &quot;lateral thinking outside the square&quot; ever gets done.</p>

<p>We know of several Great minds who were of this type of thinker. From Galilleo to Mendel to Newton to Curie to Franklin and Tesla to the Wright Brothers and Darwin to Einstein and Buckminster-Fuller et al, these people used their minds to &#39;think about things&#39; in ways that other people had not.</p>

<p>They were able to make great contributions <em>becoz</em> of the efforts they put into thinking <em>differently to everyone else</em>! In fact, a number of very well known scientists were very solitary in their work (as nobody else <em>could understand</em> it! </p>

<p>They correspponded with an elite few about their discipline of choice preferring a select few &#39;peers&#39; of their time e.g a 17th century &quot;rich kid&quot; who enjoyed studying mathematics, and back then, only the very wealthy could afford such luxuries as studying, but as his family were Rich, although he studied law, he could afford to be mathematician nonetheless<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat">Pierre de Fermat was his name</a> and what a mathematicion he was!</p>

<p>This kid was <em>so smart</em> and so talented at maths, that soons his name was known in all the elite mathematical circles. He also wrote all these &quot;number  theory&quot; &#39;conjectures&#39; or &#39;mathematical  problems&#39; ,, some that were as old as calculus! e.g.</p>

<p>This last theorem he had worked out, was something mathematicians worldwide had been trying to resolve for centuries, and Pierre Fermat said that he had figured it out, but the <em>only</em> &#39;working notes&#39; to his theory were in the margins of this book, <em>and nobody believed it would fit in such a small place!</em> lol</p>

<p>So, &quot;Although Fermat claimed to have proved all his arithmetic theorems, few records of his proofs have survived. Many mathematicians, including Gauss, doubted several of his claims, especially given the difficulty of some of the problems and the limited mathematical methods available to Fermat. His famous Last Theorem was first discovered by his son in the margin in his father&#39;s copy of an edition of Diophantus, <strong>and included the statement that the margin was too small to include the proof.&quot;</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In number theory, Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat&#39;s conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n = 1 and n = 2 have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin</strong>. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The first successful proof was released in 1994</strong> by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995, <strong>after 358 years of effort by mathematicians</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Andrew Wiles wrote a book about how he went about figuring out &quot;fermat&#39;&#39;s Last Theorem&quot; by thinking <em>so far out of</em> the box, he was in another dimension altogether, BUT, he was <em>the only person</em> in 358 YEARS of mathematicians trying to &#39;crack&#39; this &#39;last theorem&#39; that Fermat had said HE has <em>already worked out</em> BUT he died before he published his proof!</p>

<p>However, people respected the fact he was a brilliant mathematician who had already produces reams and volumes of work of the highest quality, so nobody would outright say &quot;Fermat is lying, he never figured that out coz <em>it&#39;s impossible</em> as anyone who&#39;s tried will know!</p>

<p>Oh really. The &quot;aswer&quot; <em>was there</em> and just <em>had been waiting</em> for someone to REconsider it in &#39;another way&#39; and &quot;poof!&quot; the answer appeared!</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great story, the book&#39;s a bit dry, but wow! What a feat!</p>

<p>I hope this gave you something to think about. e.g. The <em>Ultimate Logical science</em>, mathematics <em>still has</em> more UNresolved problems like this ,, conjectures in which nobody is even sure there is an answer!? Just as they did with Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem, except for Fermat&#39;s comments, most people would have said &quot;it can&#39;t be resolved&quot; .... and how wrong they were!</p>

<p>Each one of these people used logic and reasoning to prove that they were correct. Galileo based his reasoning on differences in the shading of Venus. Mendel had multi-generational records of pea genetics. Curie had readings on radiation, mass, and reactivity. Darwin had lengthy observations of species from around the globe. Franklin, Tesla, and the Wright Brothers had working prototypes based on the work of other scientists before them. Einstein, Newton, and B-F added to a giant pile of mathematics that came before them. </p>

<p>By all means think outside the box. I came into this thread in the first place with that as my intention. But if you want people to accept your ideas, you must have ways to back them up. You can claim to be Pierre de Fermat or Andrew Wiles and say you&#39;re still working on it but don&#39;t have enough details yet. That&#39;s fine. But until you do, don&#39;t act like you&#39;ve made a tremendous contribution to humanity. </p>

<p>IMHO your &#39;absolute belief&#39; in &quot;hard science&quot; is, at times, actually (and factually) UNfounded, just as so many scientists who thought they had come to the &#39;final answer&#39; only to learn they&#39;re really just at the beginning!</p>

<p>Did I ever disagree with that? The whole point of our discussion is that the conspiracy theory you and OP are supporting are significantly more unfounded that the science you&#39;re trying to attack now. </p>

<p>a study was conducted, to see how much people had changed over 10 years, and how they predicted they would change, and how they actually changed.</p>

<p>the test group was divided into sub groups by age, into decades, and invariably, each age group predicted they would not change much in 10 years, but reported that they had, in fact, changed a lot over the course of the previous 10 years. this was as true for 20 year olds and 80 year olds.</p>

<p>the point is that as you learn more and more, you will start to discover some very inexplicable discrepancies that make you question what you were told, and what you thought you knew.</p>

<p>unfortunately, there are (((those))) who would take advantage of your ignorance, not just a little bit, but a lot. like, basically everything you are every taught in school was to indoctrinate you, and to misrepresent dissent through straw man arguments.</p>

<p>i was literally taught in school that</p>

<p>&quot;men walked on the moon AND that only ignorant primitive African bushmen thought the moon landing was a hoax&quot;</p>

<p>well i certainly didn&#39;t want to live like a Bushman, so i had better accept the fact that men walked on the moon</p>

<p>there was a time in my life when i though that Santa Claus and Superman were real...</p>

<p>...and slowly but surely all of the other cultural myths that you grow up around being to crumble....</p>

<p>...you start asking yourself what hit the Pentagon on 9/11, and why the Pentagon didn&#39;t defend itself from attack, in spite of both WTC towers being hit long before, and altering the nation that it was under attack...</p>

<p>...then you start asking yourself if Ferguson riots wasn&#39;t just smoke and mirrors to red herring the public...</p>

<p>... and then one day you wake up and turn on CNN or NPR or take-your-pick and realize that its all bullshit. every last bit of it is scripted to fit an agenda.</p>

<p>...measles outbreak!!! (not news, but in the news)</p>

<p>...LIBOR scandal (news, but not in the news)</p>

<p>it gets so bad that you can literally take out a pencil and paper, take notes on every &quot;news&quot; story, take notes on every advertiser and what key words they use, and then go online and fact-check each and every one of their &quot;facts&quot; and you will discover that its entirely 100% LIES.</p>

<p>so, you turn off the TV and the Radio, but that only does so good, because your friends and neighbors still listen to the lies and their opinions affect their actions and their actions affect you.</p>

<p>this is the 50th anniversary of the summer of love 1967</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I understand it quite well. It&#39;s measuring the electrical signal intensity within the brain and measures the changes in it when the subject is exposed to LSD and other drugs. For the sake of click baiting the title it assumed that an increase in brain activity could be equated to an increase in consciousness, but does not go into how. It does not make any attempts to explain how consciousness arises whatsoever, or that their research has anything to do with consciousness at all. </p>

<p>Current research looking into consciousness and its origins are primarily focused on brain mapping. By understanding the organizational structure of the brain they hope to begin to understand how intelligence and thought arises in biological systems. It&#39;s rather complicated and we&#39;ve spent the past decades just developing the tools by which this might be accomplished in a achievable time frame. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A magnetic field is nothing but a mathematical method of expressing the relative motion between electrical fields. Electrical fields are complex mathematical interpretations of a totally empirical observation stated as Coulomb’s Law. In other words, our forest of scientific knowledge and explanations is made up of trees about which we understand nothing except their effect, their existence.</p>

<p>Instead of just empirical observation, we actually are starting to know the origins of almost every fundamental force and particle in the universe. We&#39;ve been able to reduce that complex set of equations down to two, one for Quantum Physics and one for Einsteinian Gravity. If I knew more about theoretical physics I could give you the particles and interactions that create electromagnetic fields. </p>

<p>About the exterior edge of knowledge. They argue because they want to be certain that the knowledge gained is reproducible and accurate as much as possible. The vast bulk of human knowledge is not under constant attack, which is why we&#39;ve been able to do something about it. </p>

<p>The next few paragraphs are actually sound observations on the nature of relativity, except that the author used &quot;light years&quot; wrong. It&#39;s not speed or time, it&#39;s distance. If he was paying attention to everything he wrote on relativity he would have caught that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This unified field theory, describing matter as pure field, has been accomplished now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, no it hasn&#39;t. If someone had created a unified field theory that could actually be defended they would have won the Nobel Prize in physics and Stephen Hawking would never stop talking about him for the rest of his life. The guy they cite as coming up with this system, Dewey Bernard Larson, has his own page on several debunking sites. Not a good sign. The main problem they have with his work is a complete lack of mathematics anywhere, ensuring that Larson does not actually describe relations between fundamental processes in the universe, but is merely postulating. The largest scientific fame he ever received was a book review by Issac Asimov, who said &quot;If no electrons exist within the atom, as Larson suggests, I do not see how the photoelectric effect can be explained. From this I conclude that however stimulating Larson&#39;s book might be as an intellectual exercise, it need not be taken seriously as anything more than that.&quot; Busted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The result of this approach is that one can now calculate from the basic postulate of Larson’s theory any physical value within our physical universe, from sub-atomic to stellar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting how he chose the word &quot;calculate&quot; given that there isn&#39;t any math involved. And what does he mean by &quot;physical value&quot;? That phrase is a non-sequitur that doesn&#39;t describe anything. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What physicists have never before considered worth investigating is now increasing at a very rapid rate. Action at a distance, apparently as a result of some type of mental activity, seems repeatedly the observed effect. When Uri Geller performs on TV, mentally bending metal and fixing clocks, there are often many kids who try to duplicate Uri’s “tricks.” Sometimes the kids succeed. The number of children that can cause bends and breaks in metal and other materials just by wanting the break or bend to occur is increasing daily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no records of any of this. He&#39;s already blatantly making things up and we haven&#39;t even gotten to the deus ex universa he claims to have. </p>

<p>Oh, wait, my mistake, we have gotten there, this bullshit is what he has based everything on. He uses non-mathematical physics theories and anecdotes about telekinesis as his proof that everything is both intelligent and connect through aliens. What the actual fuck, I don&#39;t think I need to go any farther than that. </p>

<p>There is other matter such as the Kuiper Belt and the Ort cloud that has not been accurately measured, and there is always the possibility that discoveries haven&#39;t been made yet.

<p>The math is based on estimations of what mass is where at what times. We do a calculation, ask ourselves if the math works with just the mass we have discovered, and when the answer is no we ask ourselves what mass we missed, and where it would be located. This is how we discovered Neptune, so it is possible that we could discover planets this way. As far as I have heard, though, the math suggests that the stuff we haven&#39;t measured yet is random space junk asteroids and gas waaaaay off in the distance. As in significantly outside of Pluto. We have discovered rather large objects out there (which is why the whole reclassification of Pluto thing happened), but the likelihood of an entire planet is getting increasingly slim as time goes on. This is all without assuming the sun is Binary or other such nonsense. </p>

<p>You&#39;re confusing this with the other thread of yours where I pointed out the ad hominem attacks. </p>

<p>My point here was that you&#39;re aware that Grand Unified Theory doesn&#39;t exist, and yet your Ra researchers source based their entire line of reasoning on the assumption that their GUT was correct. You&#39;re arguing against your own sources. At this point it doesn&#39;t matter what you think of me or any of the statements I make, you proved your own statement wrong. This argument is over not from the validity or non-validity any of my statements, but by the logical suicide you just performed. I suggest you sort that out before you pass judgement on other people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>I posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/christiansawake2nwo/comments/64hruf/_/dg2zccw">this</a> nearly a month ago on this particular &#39;scandal&#39; because so many were getting distracted by it.  Anyone who can read the globalists&#39; organizing signals can spot the effort to contrive the scandal as part of an agenda... But of course, anyone else who can read their signals likely already knows and is hyping it pretty much as OPie here is.</p>

<p>We also have the &#39;Alt-media Good, MSM Bad&#39; dialectic here.  Which always gets me.  Just because the MSM is making great efforts to display their sell-outry, why exactly does that make the alt-media personalities credible?  For all their resources and cunning, are they just fundamentally incapable of designing a website, creating a blog, or paying lackeys to do the same?  What exactly about alt-media is so trustworthy, reliable and sacrosanct anyway?</p>

<p>Or is it that they&#39;re just pretty much coming out with a chorus of similar alt-news, so it must be true?  Odd, when the MSM do that we interpret it as evidence that they&#39;re getting their directives from the same originating source.</p>

<p>The globalists are well aware that you&#39;re incredulous and untrusting of the MSM.  Statistically they&#39;re very likely to have decided that <em>for</em> you, because a &#39;limited exposure&#39; to restore credibility is part of their plan to forestall an inevitable <em>un</em>limited exposure if they didn&#39;t address those who were already skeptical.    But fortunately here comes the alt-media to save us all.  The new boss, just like the old boss.  Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;ll be enough emotionally positive fluff to go around and so many New Age gnostic catchphrases that you&#39;ll never notice critical thinking is nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, the topic of OP here <em>used to be</em> a recruitment method while the globalists were striving to obtain power.  Now that they&#39;ve acquired it their personnel are told to cut it out - no more perks of you want to survive in the club, much less advance.  In fact you&#39;ll now have to give back everything and pay back all the bribes, then work for them for nothing to show your devotion to the cause.  Don&#39;t like it?  Still want to dabble in the unseemly behavior you used to?  The look out kiddo, because everyone else behind you trying to get a leg up in the organization is just looking for the first opportunity to sell you out and earn points with their superiors.</p>

<p>Consequently, we get this.  The subject of the OP.  A deliberate &#39;limited exposure&#39; effort designed to impress the general public while simultaneously creating an opportunity for the globalists to pull the lever on the trapdoor and jettison any of their less-than-fully-loyal lackeys, in order to make room for those who are.  Because if they&#39;re going to make their New Order succeed, they know they&#39;re going to have to look convincingly legit.  And that&#39;s not going to happen if their frontmen are a bunch of self-indulgent jagoffs.</p>

Additionally, this discreetly communicates a strategy to their personnel to seek opportunities to sell out errant members of their own group if they violate the new policies and go back to indulging in the kinds of illegal hedonism that enabled &#39;the bad guys&#39; to increase their numbers by providing people the means to satisfy before.  And with the general public now so thoroughly riled over the topic, they&#39;ll demand severe justice on instances where the behavior is exposed.  So the public&#39;s desire for justice ends up just providing a convenient, overt, outsourced policy enforcement mechanism for &#39;the bad guys&#39;, a while keeping those who are opposed to them occupied.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how the <em>subject</em> being promoted by the OP here promotes the agendas of &#39;the bad guys&#39;.  If you&#39;re asking me how this specific OP promotes them, you&#39;d seem to be asking me to violate this subreddit&#39;s rules by calling someone here a shill.  That I can&#39;t do, though I am concerned with the amount of wooly thinking and other things throughout the OP.</p>

<p>It may not just be you.  I&#39;ve tried to be clear, but communication relies on having a shared context.  When a listener is unfamiliar with the context because it hasn&#39;t been out in the open for quite a while sometimes it takes a few passthroughs and attempts to clarify for good communication to happen effectively.  I&#39;m here in what&#39;s termed in law &#39;good faith&#39; and am certainly willing to clarify, I just don&#39;t always know when I haven&#39;t described something effectively until someone mentions it.  Please continue to do so when needed.  I want to be clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you talking about a <em>literal</em> code? A &#39;cypher&#39; or encryption of some type?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  A system of symbolism and imagery often termed &#39;doubletalk&#39;.  Multiple systems actually, one or more for each franchise and another set of them for the apparent &#39;parent group&#39; or principal organization, the ongoing organizational structure of the Babylonian &#39;mystery priests&#39;.  These systems are used by their practitioners simultaneously, or &#39;stacked&#39;, with the result that content prepared by, say, Jesuits who are sufficiently &#39;in the know&#39; with choose phrasing or visual symbols which impart a message not only overtly, but in Jesuit covert lingo <em>and</em> Babylonians covert symbolism as well, simultaneously.  It&#39;s a technique which takes years if not decades to do effectively, particularly in realtime, but learning how to &#39;hear&#39; it rather than &#39;speak&#39; it is much easier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If so, the where did you learn this &#39;code&#39;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started with the usual drug slang that&#39;s become so prevalent, then noticed it was in music lyrics and studied them diligently, piecing the code format together through context clues just like with overt languages. Then I noticed that while much of it used this system, other performers and other forms of media were using some other system unfamiliar to me.  So I examined those and learned several, eventually becoming able to determine through comprehension to which &#39;group&#39; they belonged.  Jesuits, Knights of Malta, some of the Asian dynastic groups, Freemasonry and so on.  Then between carefully assessing the symbolism being used and some overt research into conspiracy theory / history I had my attention called to some of the historic &#39;big name&#39; groups: the Vatican, Babylon and so forth.  I did some overt research into <em>their</em> symbols and sure enough, there they were in modern media and not only were they present - which could be purely coincidental - they were present in the right covert grammatical context time and time again to convey meaningful covert messages.  Not only that, but many of these groups had their own covert languages &#39;stacked&#39; in such a way that they were using both their own code base <em>and</em> Vatican and/or Babylonian codes to convey meaningful information <em>simultaneously</em>.  The odds against that happening purely on accident, over and over again systematically, are of course nearly impossible.</p>

<p>Then I started going over some of the overt analyses of the globalists&#39; already-exposed or already-enacted plans, and started to notice a lot of really old media from decades ago covertly organizing these plans.  This not only helped to confirm that I was onto something, but also helped me make sure I had my &#39;reading comprehension&#39; down pat by carefully examining the symbols and grammar they used in those instances to making sure I had a correct understanding of their usage of the various symbols, correcting where necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which any intelligent enough person with access to the Internet  can probably do too</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much anyone is able to do this, too, it&#39;s just that not many have the original awareness of the technique of doubletalk <em>and</em> the motivation to study it on their own <em>and</em> the overt historical research to give them an idea of which groups&#39; symbolism to study.  Of those who do have all these things, nearly all of them have them because they&#39;re involved with these groups themselves and have little to no inclination to expose the, and would encounter severe reprisals from their group of they did so anyway.</p>

<p>This sub with probably be interested to know that a large proportion of the seemingly &#39;normal&#39; people shouting down and publicly ridiculing &#39;bizarre conspiracy theorists&#39; are indeed using g these sorts of codes themselves, indicating collusion on their part.  And for that matter, so are nearly all of the alt-media &#39;expose the conspiracy!&#39; / &#39;Disclosure&#39; sources and personalities.</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably enough to establish in court collusion with a conspiracy of treason, subversion and plenty more.  Now all we need to do is <a href="http://www.NationalLibertyAlliance.org/">restore courts of law</a> so we can get an actual fair trial thing happening.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of both and scanned the former years ago.  I always conflate it with &#39;The Battle for Your Mind&#39; by Dick Sutphen.  But if memory serves it was interesting, but not particularly relevant to what they&#39;re up to covertly.  Presumably different aspects of the same organization and agenda, but that&#39;s overt while the stuff I&#39;ve been describing is more covert.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those who are turned off by some of the more dramatic suggestions in this post, I would implore you to check out some of <strong>Jon Ronson</strong>&#39;s books and research on psychopaths. </p>

<p>Regardless of your feelings on the conspiracies put forth by OP, there is very real evidence to suggest that a significant percentage of the world&#39;s most powerful people are essentially psychopathic, characterized by the inability to feel emotion or empathy. </p>

<p>Most people imagine psychopaths as sadistic killers, but many studies suggest a <strong>1%</strong> prevalence of psychopathy in the general population. Obviously, 1 in 100 people are not violent murderers; those who are were likely exposed to traumatic physical, emotional and/or sexual abuse as children. Many work menial jobs, held back by their anti-social tendencies but never developing violent habits thanks to typical loving families. Others, perhaps born with a silver spoon already in mouth, might find psychopathy to be a <strong>massive benefit</strong> in business, politics, law, etc. where emotions are often a detriment. </p>

<p>Most biologically-typical people like to discard theories like OP&#39;s because they cannot fathom a fellow human, not unlike themselves, participating in such things - much less 8000-8500 of the world&#39;s most powerful people. They don&#39;t understand that these people, these <strong>70 million</strong> people by many counts, are fundamentally different than their emotional counterparts. It&#39;s like expecting a wild ape to act rationally because it can shake hands like a human. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t speculate as to what these powerful psychopaths are capable of as OP has done a great job of that, but their is empirical research and strongly founded studies that psychopaths have advantages over the general population and are likely to occupy a disproportionate amount of powerful positions. It&#39;s a massive <strong>blindspot</strong> in our society that more people need to be aware of.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re thinking of psychological conditioning, what I&#39;m describing is a different animal. You can have a terrorist who&#39;s been conditioned to rationalize away the deaths they cause but still has love for his family - actually, I suppose that&#39;s how most terrorists become terrorists. A psychopath can be the normal, if not slightly off-putting, family man working a 9-5 office job, who might describe the death of his wife or child as an &quot;inconvenience&quot; or a &quot;bummer&quot; (pretty sure this is from Ronson&#39;s Psychopath Test). The highest-functioning psychopaths are also incredibly skilled at manipulation because they process human interaction like a math problem rather than implicit emotional cues like the rest of us. It&#39;s really fascinating stuff until you realize the implications </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am so thankful you made this post. They have done a good job of getting most people to sweep this under the rug. They were able to put the focus on pizzagate and turn it&#39;s definition into only about a pizza parlor instead of human trafficking. I think this information if presented after getting someone to read the Oatmeal comic on the backfire effect, will have profound results. Here is a <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe">link</a> to the comment but it was also a thread on this board in the hot section for awhile and still might be. And on a totally unrelated note If you are in to anime at all I have been watching one called Attack On Titan and <strong>SPOILERS SORT OF BE WARNED</strong></p>

<p>that seems to involve satanic rituals about the mysteries of their world and why they are attacked by titans. I haven&#39;t read the manga yet as it is much farther than the anime but I prefer to watch action based stories in animation if possible. I have noticed a big uptick in the satanic angle being portrayed in media. A show called Supernatural had an episode a few weeks ago where the hunted down Moloch. Although they didn&#39;t point out specifcally he was a god of child sacrifice, just regular sacrifice but you get the idea. Anyway sorry for the unrelated rambling but again I truly love and appreciate what you have done and your effort put into this. It will not go to waste or become lost in the mix. I am sharing the message with my proposed strategy of the backfire effect comic then this information. However I choose not to put a link to the conspiracy forum to try to ease people into it. People would accept and view a blog post with a bit more validity than a conspiracy forum unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too bad so many people are so willing to turn into apathetic vultures that want to take what&#39;s yours as soon as they perceive you to have anything that they want, and feel they are in a position to take it.  And, let&#39;s not forget the competitive mindset that the peasantry are mindfucked into, so that far too many people try to undermine anyone in any position of advantage over them in order to create opportunity for themselves by attempting to make others seem less than they are.<br/>
Most people are out for themselves almost exclusively, and can justify just about any wrongdoing to themselves if it brings them enough in terms of gain.<br/>
The 8,000 are not the problem. It is the conditioning people are exposed to that makes them the ravenous parasites that are willing to bring the world to the brink of doom with their greed.</p>

<p>So, despite all evidence that they don&#39;t form social groups, they have formed a social group to work TOGETHER, despite everything that says they don&#39;t?</p>

<p>So, if I&#39;m reading this right, sociopaths and psychopaths have tricked everyone for hundreds of years, convincing us all that they aren&#39;t social people, just so they could socially organize for the betterment of the group?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you think that way, it means you&#39;re optimistic, but you&#39;re also a little wrong. You have a certain degree of free will, however there is an &quot;attractor&quot; in the future guiding us towards its creation. I bet you realized this on a trip and came to the conclusion that none of what we do matters because it will end the same anyway. The same things will happen but who does them is not predetermined. If you are aware of the atrocities in the world and you&#39;re brave enough, you could be a catalyst for the event that results in the downfall of the evil elites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no &quot;me&quot; to have control. Enlightenment is but another game, there is nothing to it. </p>

<p>When the real you is all, to have hate towards anyone else (no matter how evil them seem) only means to hate yourself. </p>

<p>Maybe all of this darkness is to create more light, for us to rise in to. As there is no up without down, no left without right, one must experience the worst, in order to be able to experience the best - infinite love</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a link for it right now, but please youtube &quot;alan watts - what if god got bored&quot;</p>

<p>I went down to the end of the rabbit hole you are in, you can realise none of it matters at the end, it&#39;s all still part of a temporary game. Who knows if us humans are even important, what might here be in the next billion years? Will it be more important than the last 14billion? Of course not - and our measly 200,000 years as humans is not either </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve listened to a few dozen hours of Alan Watts and others like him already. I&#39;ve taken more than my fair share of psychedelics and come to some of the same conclusions you have: we are all the same divine being manifested as different awareness to experience the universe from varied perspectives. The good wouldn&#39;t be as good if there was no bad. But don&#39;t write off humanity as a meager experiment. We&#39;re immanentizing the eschaton. &quot;God&quot; has been playing this game for a long time where he forgets who he is to become more immersed in this experience of duality and life. The goal of this game is to remember the truth of who you are. You, as manifested in your current form, already remembered and therefore have &quot;won&quot;. You know the kingdom of heaven is within and you know there is nothing to fear. However you also exist in all of the people around you. Those that don&#39;t know yet are suffering. I think once you figure it out, you should be helping them along the path, as their suffering is also your suffering. You have seen outside the Matrix, so you can dodge bullets now, but the others you care about are still asleep. The elites that manipulate the sleeping sheep have gone through a false or partial enlightenment. They still have their egos, so they haven&#39;t seen that duality is an illusion. They don&#39;t understand the goal of the game. They&#39;re not evil, just ignorant, asleep as the rest. To stop them from manipulating us, we need to help them stop being manipulated by impulses, negative emotion, egoic desires, and other manipulators. The full enlightenment experience can happen to anyone at any time, but it doesn&#39;t happen or to everyone often. It&#39;s up to people like us to wake everyone else up. The sooner we achieve mass enlightenment, the sooner we can see heaven on Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t see them mention hating anyone as you implied. </p>

<p>I believe this does matter in the end because if they continue to hold power over the human race, we will adapt and evolve further to fit their mold. I have free will and that is something I do not want for humans.</p>

<p>The future is something that is undetermined and meaningless right now. We only exist in the present and because I can see that they are trying to mold me and the people I love, I would like to put an end to that. A peaceful end caused by awareness and a love for all life.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t downplay human beings, we are absolutely incredible and deserve to live as we please.</p>

<p>Next, you&#39;ll say: But if we can live how we please, then they will continue to take power. </p>

<p>This is true, but because we are capable of mental awareness, we can see them for what they are and not follow them.</p>

Under them are luciferian priests and witches who run every aspect of society, according to a now deceased whistleblower, <a href="https://youtu.be/iDbmIap09H8">John Todd</a> from the music industry who quit and became Christian.  He pointed out that all music is cursed and that rockstars from the 60s were children of the military and all grew up in laurel canyon.

    <div class="md"><p>Huh, my own primary conspiracy is similar, just stripped of the Jews and Hillary pedophilia stuff. As far as I can tell, human society has almost always existed with the object of keeping the powerful in power. It rewards the psychopaths willing to compete enough to win it, generation after generation, until psychopathy becomes a beneficial trait. Look at all of our TV shows that star morally ambiguous men who aren&#39;t sure they can feel anymore. </p>

<p>America has been particularly corrupted by greed. While peasants of other nations never expect a happy life, we get told we&#39;re owed one from birth. So we all play the psychopathic games of the elites, while they toss down scraps from the table just to watch their dogs fight. </p>

<p>The Jews are a distraction, Hillary is a distraction. Lizard people are real but very human. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we don&#39;t take BOLD &amp; BRAVE moves, this will never be fixed. Non-violent agression is what&#39;s needed people. Why aren&#39;t there massive protests around the White House? Why are politicians being humiliated by the passer by citizens when the media has cameras pointed at them? We need massive bumper stickers to red pill people. </p>

<p>We need to put in work folks. It will be fun so it won&#39;t feel like work. </p>

<p>To be fair, a lot of you are redpilling like crazy so that is great progress. </p>

<p>We need to literally force Trumps hand into action. FORCE his hand with massive protests. There are so many unemployed among us. All we need is 1 guy to stay around the White House, Federal Reserve, or any other notable cabal stronghold and you will attract many more behind you. We need a 24/7 protest plus much more. We won&#39;t get anywhere unless we actually JUST DO IT!</p>

<p>We can do it but if we do it now, we will get to our end goal faster. The longer we wait, the longer we suffer. </p>
