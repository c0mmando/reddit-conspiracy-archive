    <div class="md"><p>Why do you keep saying there was no criminal intent?  It doesn&#39;t matter.  She knows what she was doing, intent aside, she was committing a crime.  And it should be considered that way so we don&#39;t get some actual REAL spies (corporate or otherwise) doing this and just shrugging their shoulders and claiming no ill intent.  That&#39;s just a little too easy and convenient a way out, so much so I&#39;m shocked you can&#39;t see how foolish that is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s like a knife wielding killer stabbing people over and over and saying with a smile, &quot;There is no criminal intent!!  I don&#39;t mean this to be taken the wrong way at all!  I swear!!&quot;</p>

<p>See how that goes?  It doesn&#39;t matter if he thinks there is no ill intent, criminal or not.......he is still stabbing people to death, right?  Crime, pure and simple.  </p>

<p>Same thing here, if Huma is and has been playing the game since 96, she knows the deal.  She knows what flies and what doesn&#39;t.  So for you to say there is no criminal intent is just a little more than hard to believe and it also doesn&#39;t matter in the slightest.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe that&#39;s the argument here.  A person could get away with a lot of things at the intimate white house level when all they have to say is &quot;Gee willikers! I didn&#39;t know that I couldn&#39;t do that!!&quot;</p>

<p>Now we have people defending that kind of behavior and claiming ignorance is perfectly acceptable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only a crime with criminal intent. Period.</p>

<p>The argument isn&#39;t that criminal intent doesn&#39;t matter <em>ever</em>, only that it doesn&#39;t matter in the case of the law regarding classified information being passed between people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the argument they&#39;ll use.  The perfect little loophole.  She was just sending emails your honor!  No harm done!  Groman, you can take a breath now.  I do actually understand.</p>

<p>Are people here now to convince others that Huma didn&#39;t do anything wrong?  Or are we actually going to go with the &quot;legal precedent&quot;.  How rigid in our thinking can we be when we can&#39;t see what she has done on certain people&#39;s behalf, and how the real precedent that should be set here is to lock her up?</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s about the most basic and simple way I can &quot;fucking use my brain and think for a minute&quot;.  She should be in jail, it keeps people like Clinton out or at least doesn&#39;t make it as laughably easy to do what they do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who defines the &quot;legal precedent&quot; in our world.  In this world where money rules, I&#39;m not sure people can make the claim that &quot;we do&quot; as in we the people.  How many rich fuckers get away with murder because they have digits in their bank accounts.  This is a game, and its an unfair one.   If there are holes that can be used by opportunists/criminals/sociopaths, then there is some work to be done.</p>

<p>We all have to agree that when a crime is committed, that there is something there that will prevent it from happening again.   Or they essentially mean nothing at all.  They&#39;re just hurdles for the next clever guy to get past.</p>

<p>Also, on a side note....if you&#39;re so stuck on if things are &quot;the law&quot; just understand who writes laws.  Just understand who is in the power position right now and think about if you&#39;re in a system that isn&#39;t already &quot;upended&quot;.</p>

<p>This posts aren&#39;t for you, clearly, you&#39;re stuck.  You&#39;re a good little boy, doing what your told.  They tell you this is &quot;the law&quot;, and you say, &quot;sir, yes sir&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly how the system would work best for them, and you&#39;re unwilling to see the flaws and patch them up.  You&#39;re still stuck on &quot;its the law&quot;.  </p>

<p>This is how our legal system works, ignorance of the law is no defense. Like say I take a right turn at a red light in my city, that is fine, it is legal. I go to another state where it is illegal and do the same thing, I get a ticket. I am not discussing the fairness of such ideas, just explaining why we don&#39;t think she should be excused here.</p>

<p>If there is some special legal privilege enjoyed by people in her position when passing classified information around then explain that.</p>

<p>Ignorance of the law is not a defence, but a crime is more than just the act.</p>

<p>Some minor offences are strict liability, where proving the act itself is enough. Your example would fall into that, most traffic offences would.</p>

<p>But for most crimes, and indeed what most people view as crime, there is the mental element of the offence.</p>

<p>You&#39;re still in your car and you hit someone, they die. That&#39;s homicide. Tell me where we go from here with reference to intent.</p>

<p>Huma and Weiner were both on the wrong side of the law.  </p>

<p>And on the topic of Weiner, people should be looking back to when he first got &#39;caught&#39; sexting.  Because there were allegations back then of him being involved with underage girls.  Which ultimately means that clinton, huma, and others helped cover for a sex offender.  </p>

<p>A sex offender who repeated his previous offenses, and was also handling classified information he should not have had access to.</p>
