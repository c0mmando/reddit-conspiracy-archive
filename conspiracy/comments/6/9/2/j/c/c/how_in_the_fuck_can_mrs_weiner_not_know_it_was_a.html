       That doesn't make sense. If you know it's a crime and you do it anyway, that should be considered criminal intent.

       You're using circular reasoning. Passing that information is not a crime unless there's criminal intent. You're essentially pre-assuming it's a crime in order to establish criminal intent in order to declare it a crime. That's circular reasoning and fallacious.

       Why do you keep saying there was no criminal intent?  It doesn't matter.  She knows what she was doing, intent aside, she was committing a crime.  And it should be considered that way so we don't get some actual REAL spies (corporate or otherwise) doing this and just shrugging their shoulders and claiming no ill intent.  That's just a little too easy and convenient a way out, so much so I'm shocked you can't see how foolish that is.

       It's like a knife wielding killer stabbing people over and over and saying with a smile, "There is no criminal intent!!  I don't mean this to be taken the wrong way at all!  I swear!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       See how that goes?  It doesn't matter if he thinks there is no ill intent, criminal or not.......he is still stabbing people to death, right?  Crime, pure and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing here, if Huma is and has been playing the game since 96, she knows the deal.  She knows what flies and what doesn't.  So for you to say there is no criminal intent is just a little more than hard to believe and it also doesn't matter in the slightest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe that's the argument here.  A person could get away with a lot of things at the intimate white house level when all they have to say is "Gee willikers! I didn't know that I couldn't do that!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have people defending that kind of behavior and claiming ignorance is perfectly acceptable.

       The argument isn't that criminal intent doesn't matter
       <em>
        ever

       , only that it doesn't matter in the case of the law regarding classified information being passed between people.

       This is the argument they'll use.  The perfect little loophole.  She was just sending emails your honor!  No harm done!  Groman, you can take a breath now.  I do actually understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are people here now to convince others that Huma didn't do anything wrong?  Or are we actually going to go with the "legal precedent".  How rigid in our thinking can we be when we can't see what she has done on certain people's behalf, and how the real precedent that should be set here is to lock her up?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's about the most basic and simple way I can "fucking use my brain and think for a minute".  She should be in jail, it keeps people like Clinton out or at least doesn't make it as laughably easy to do what they do.

       Who defines the "legal precedent" in our world.  In this world where money rules, I'm not sure people can make the claim that "we do" as in we the people.  How many rich fuckers get away with murder because they have digits in their bank accounts.  This is a game, and its an unfair one.   If there are holes that can be used by opportunists/criminals/sociopaths, then there is some work to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have to agree that when a crime is committed, that there is something there that will prevent it from happening again.   Or they essentially mean nothing at all.  They're just hurdles for the next clever guy to get past.

       Speaking for people again?  I'm not sure any of my words were read or understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, on a side note....if you're so stuck on if things are "the law" just understand who writes laws.  Just understand who is in the power position right now and think about if you're in a system that isn't already "upended".
      </p>
      <p>
       This posts aren't for you, clearly, you're stuck.  You're a good little boy, doing what your told.  They tell you this is "the law", and you say, "sir, yes sir".
      </p>
      <p>
       That's exactly how the system would work best for them, and you're unwilling to see the flaws and patch them up.  You're still stuck on "its the law".
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't bother trying to speak for me again by claiming I want no rule of law....but who cares, this post is not for you but all the fence sitters.

       This is how our legal system works, ignorance of the law is no defense. Like say I take a right turn at a red light in my city, that is fine, it is legal. I go to another state where it is illegal and do the same thing, I get a ticket. I am not discussing the fairness of such ideas, just explaining why we don't think she should be excused here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is some special legal privilege enjoyed by people in her position when passing classified information around then explain that.

       No, you don't understand criminal law. And you're only looking at part of what he said, ignoring what he said about criminal intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignorance of the law is not a defence, but a crime is more than just the act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some minor offences are strict liability, where proving the act itself is enough. Your example would fall into that, most traffic offences would.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for most crimes, and indeed what most people view as crime, there is the mental element of the offence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're still in your car and you hit someone, they die. That's homicide. Tell me where we go from here with reference to intent.

       Yes, I see.  "Because with respect to Ms. Abedin in particular, we didn't have any indication that she had a sense that what she was doing was in violation of the law, couldn't prove any sort of criminal intent."  -Comey.

       It's a subjective matter, but here are two situations:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Somebody forwards thousands of emails, some of which are classified, to their spouse so they can print it out for them to read later over coffee or in bed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Somebody prints out classified info, puts it in a binder, then hides it inside an air duct in their house where their secret lover later takes permanently.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Which of these sounds like somebody who is deliberately trying to

        get away with something

       Did you watch Ted Cruz question Comey?  He read off the legal code that stipulates that ignorance of criminal code doesn't make you immune.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean.. .what are we talking about here?  If you simply let people claim they are ignorant of the laws they break, there'd hardly be anybody in jail.  That's absolutely ridiculous.

       Huma and Weiner were both on the wrong side of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on the topic of Weiner, people should be looking back to when he first got 'caught' sexting.  Because there were allegations back then of him being involved with underage girls.  Which ultimately means that clinton, huma, and others helped cover for a sex offender.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sex offender who repeated his previous offenses, and was also handling classified information he should not have had access to.

       It's only one girl and there's some issues with the story though seems it might have been her mom's phone and AW didn't know the girl was using it so he thought he was texting the mom and then the girl herself first recanting the whole thing with a documented email then saying she was pressured to do so and the 'relationship' was 'consensual and loving'.  Whole story is a mess.
