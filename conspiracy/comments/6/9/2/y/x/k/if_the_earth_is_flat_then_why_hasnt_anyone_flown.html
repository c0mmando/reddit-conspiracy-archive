<p>Exactly. So unless a FE&#39;r has a billionaire sugar daddy or gets a kickstarter going, no one can do it. I mean hell, even if it&#39;s not flat, Antarctica is still off limits to indie explorers.... One has to ask: Why?</p>

<p>Kyrie Irving is a multimillionaire, so is shaq. I can hire a private jet company for 20k to take me from LA to NY. I&#39;m sure I could fly around the world for 150k. </p>

<p>Notice I said around because I don&#39;t believe flat earth. What&#39;s the fucking purpose to perpetuate a lie like round earth if it was indeed flat. </p>

<p>Short answer no it&#39;s not expensive relatively speaking. For a low class and middle class it&#39;d be near impossible. For upper middle class and rich, it&#39;d be quite easy.  I&#39;m not rich by any means but I can squeeze a private jet flight if I needed to. Someone who is a multimillionaire can easily prove or disprove </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, somewhat. You&#39;d also have to get a company willing to risk it, as well. Which will drive up the price (if there is any private company that would). What happens if no company agrees to do it? Then you&#39;re kind of back to square one. I suppose rent a freighter, but that would be even more risky.</p>

<p>East to west/west to east circumnavigation of the earth is possible on a flat earth, but north to south/south to north is not. Which is a strong indicator on why people haven&#39;t circumnavigated the &quot;globe&quot; earth north to south/south to north.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP literally asked for a guy to fly across the antartic to see if there was an edge.</p>

<p>I was simply informing OP that there, in fact, was a man who was tasked with that such mission.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you have to believe every word of it. I&#39;m just saying there it is.</p>

<p>I found his tale to be fascinating. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s the schozophrenic ramblings of an old timer admiral who got frostbite in the brain. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s 100% true.</p>

<p>But what his testimony says (including his diary) is that he <em>tried</em> to reach the edge or &#39;the other side of antarctica&#39; and he continues to say <em>he couldn&#39;t find the edge</em>. Either way there should have been an edge where Byrd claims to have flew an extra 2400 miles.</p>

<p>Take from it what you will. You&#39;ll never <em>really</em> know the truth behind any of these major conspiracies. That&#39;s just a fact kiddo, you don&#39;t come here for answers. You&#39;ll die, we all will, before any of these conspiracies become &quot;fact&quot;. So just come into stories and theories with an open mind ad have fun letting your brain, both the logical side and the imaginative side run free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being a flat earther myself, i think most of us BELIEVE that the &quot;edge&quot; (Antarctica) is <a href="https://1888.org/images/2015/12/16/20430/ae-equidistant-projection-flat-earth.png">more of a wall</a> or an extended plain, and that the face of the earth is <a href="http://whotfetw.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Flat-Earth-Models-1.png">covered by a dome of some sort</a>. Of course this is speculative due to the near impossible task of confirmation without some serious resources and permissions from TPTB. You have extreme weather conditions and altitudes to deal with and strict travel restrictions imposed by government and enforced by military powers. Not to say that it hasn&#39;t been done. In fact, i think its the general consensus in the flat earth community that TPTB absolutely know the boundaries, have explored them, and have hidden them from the public.       </p>

<p>I wont list every one here, but proofs in the 30&#39;s in <a href="https://youtu.be/h5i_iDyUTCg">this video</a> get into the antarctic. The whole thing is worth a watch and is the first video i recommend to anyone interested in the flat earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again...it is speculative due to the extreme limitations and conditions. The deepest anyone has recorded digging is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole">approximately 8 miles</a>. That being said, TPTB tell us that the globe earth has a radius (distance from surface to center) of about 3900 miles. That is a pretty big difference. We know there is soil, rock, lava, oil. water, cave systems...etc etc. But i don&#39;t pretend to know everything that is beneath our feet. But I also have no reason to believe that if you dig far enough into the ground in one direction that you would eventually reach to surface of the same earth.        </p>

<p>In short, I believe earth is a created habitat with natural limitations surrounding us... extreme cold and barrenness as you get further away from its center <a href="https://youtu.be/R52_PdZlSq8">(flat earth sun cycle projection)</a>, lack of oxygen as you get higher above its surface, and extreme heat the further below its surface you go.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that the moon landing was a real event, and don&#39;t believe that the mars landing( or the future man on mars event) is real either. Why it is obvious that there is something there above us, I don&#39;t think space, the stars and planets are what TPTB say they are, nor do I think they are as far away from us or as large as they say they are. But again, i don;t pretend to know exactly what they are. Just moving lights as far as I can tell.         </p>

<p>I also think its worth mentioning that the &quot;heavens&quot; have been a very large distraction to mankind. People get so wrapped up in whats up there that they neglect to observe what is right in front of them, and all around them. And imo, TPTB have used that as a distraction. In fact, the movement of the heavens has been used to manipulate the masses into believing that the earth is the thing that is moving, when in reality, the only motion that is observable is the motion above us. </p>

<p>Also this just popped into my head, how does a flat earth effect gravity? Obviously up and down still operate in the same way. But can objects orbit with a flat earth? Something like a low orbiting satellite. What mechanism would cause it to orbit? </p>

<p>We also don&#39;t believe in man made orbital satellites for a number of reasons.       </p>

<p>I would suggest you watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/h5i_iDyUTCg">video</a> i linked. It&#39;s a couple hours long, but will answer these types of questions. But please watch it in its entirety and with an open mind. Most people i suggest it to skim thorough it and stop watching once they see something that they think they can disprove with globe earth dogma, not realizing that at another point in the video, their &quot;proof&quot; to disprove a proof in the video is disproved by another proof in the video.     </p>

<p>And yeah, i try not to flip out, because when it comes down to it, other people believing in a globe earth can&#39;t change what I know to be true about a flat earth. And I realize how hard it is to let go of something one believed to be true for so long. Globe earth is one of the first and most consistent lies indoctrinated into the public by TPTB. I wasn&#39;t always a flat earther, and even laughed off the idea until i opened my mind and really gave the evidence an objective look.      </p>

<p>I also would like to thank you for your politeness. Most globe earthers get red in the face mad when these ideas are presented to them.  </p>

<p>Exactly. and there is a metric shit ton of confirm-able evidence of ground based radio antenna usage. As opposed to the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=satellite&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIlfbM7tTTAhVD-GMKHeZmBYkQ_AUIBygC&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=950">&quot;evidence&quot;</a> that TPTB supply the public about satellite usage. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched a lot of videos, read a lot of articles, and the only semi convincing argument is &quot;zooming in on boats on the horizon&quot;, but that isn&#39;t enough for me.

<p>I guess you would say that I am a christian, but i have serious issues with organised religion, including &quot;christianity&quot;. I believe in God, that He created the heavens, the earth and man. That Jesus is His son, and our only way to God&#39;s grace. And i believe in the devil, and that he is attempting to turn man away from God and the truth, though at the current time, given authority by God to do so. But I don&#39;t call myself a baptist or a catholic or whatever...and don&#39;t attend services or participate in rituals...though i do pray.      </p>

<p>This point is actually brought up in the video. And the short answer is that, again, there is something there, and that the shape...composition...etc of the heavens has no bearing on the shape, composition etc of the earth because they are separate from the earth.      </p>

<p>To put it into perspective....imagine a picture of a room full of black women in red dresses. You know someone or something took the picture, but all you can see is the picture...of black women in red dresses. What is the sex of the person taking the picture? What color are their clothes? Is there even a person taking the picture or maybe its all automated? The point is that, the earth is not necessarily spherical and in motion because the planets we observe above us are. No more than the person taking the picture mentioned above is necessarily a black woman in a red dress...or a person at all.      </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve watched a lot of videos, read a lot of articles, and the only semi convincing argument is &quot;zooming in on boats on the horizon&quot;, but that isn&#39;t enough for me. We have telescopes that could follow these boats until they hit the great ice wall on a flat earth, but eventually there comes a point when the boats disappear no matter how far you zoom in.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that proof alone should be convincign enough that at the very least, the globe earth is not the size they say it is...and if they lie about that, why not lie about another attribute of the earth?     </p>

<p>And as far as the boats disappearing eventually, that will depend on the instrument used to observe, as well as other variables such as light, weather..etc etc. And again, there are some pretty serious travel restrictions imposed by governments and enforced by military. You have to understand that TPTB do not want us to know the truth. And almost certainly have and or will sabotage and murder in order to perpetuate their false reality.</p>

<p>I guess you would say that I am a christian</p>

<p>As a follow up question, do you believe in evolution? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and that the shape...composition...etc of the heavens has no bearing on the shape, composition etc of the earth because they are separate from the earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me almost ultimate arrogance to see everything around us as round, and then to assume that what we&#39;re on just isn&#39;t. Even though we can see similarities on all these other planets to our own, like atmospheres, mountains, valleys, ice, old dried up river beds and so on.</p>

<p>To me, that&#39;s like being in a room full of people (let&#39;s assume I can&#39;t touch anything), seeing they have legs, so do I, arms, so do I, etc ... but just because I can&#39;t see my face, I assume that mine looks drastically different, maybe I don&#39;t even have a face at all. Maybe it&#39;s just a camera like thing that I&#39;m looking through.</p>

<p>Also, the paths that these planets take make perfect sense in a heliocentric model, but in a flat earth model all these planets take weird snaking paths across the skies from our perspective. Sure they follow that same path over and over again, but that&#39;s explained by a heliocentric model. </p>

<p>How can they stay up there in their orbits? Gravity can explain this, there are no scientific flat-earth models that explain how something that looks massive can stay up there, same with the sun (and the moon) .. how can the sun, something that gives off massive amounts of light, heat, and energy, not just fall down to a flat earth?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well that proof alone should be convincing enough that at the very least, the globe earth is not the size they say it is...and if they lie about that, why not lie about another attribute of the earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen and read a lot of claims about how &quot;after such and such distance things shouldn&#39;t be visible, but they are&quot;, however the source and mathematics of these claims are not given, and honestly the math is a little beyond me, or at least beyond what I&#39;m willing to put effort into. Still, it ignores that eventually elements do <strong>completely</strong> disappear, or take the sun as a simple example: If it really is &quot;kind of like a flashlight&quot; hovering over a flat earth, why can&#39;t it be seen all 24 hours of the day, shining its light down on earth in the distance? </p>

<p>Also to take into account, light gets affected by everything. Whatever it&#39;s traveling through can distort it and warp it, including the earth&#39;s atmosphere (as you also mentioned) but also when it travels through a gravity field. The main point is, we have incredible telescopes, and on a flat earth you should be able to see everything, every continent, every city, every mountain ... but eventually our optics fail because these elements disappear over the curve in a globe earth model. </p>

<p>Why do we see different stars in the northern hemisphere compared to the south? </p>

<p>Why can a heliocentric model using gravity and atomic theory explain a long lasting sun that can constantly provide light and heat and energy and planetary orbits, yet flat earth cannot give any such explanation for a nearer, smaller sun? </p>

<p>I&#39;m genuinely just curious. It&#39;s hard to get any kind of good conversation going, so I definitely appreciate your willingness to respond. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I glanced over the content of <a href="http://www.darwinconspiracy.com">your link</a>, and here were my initial thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Citing &quot;chance&quot; for proof that a god is more likely than &quot;so-called darwinism&quot;. Emmediately showing a deliberate ignorance of what evolution actually is (guided by the forces of nature, not by chance, or by accident).</li>
<li>So do we agree on an old earth of 4.5 billion in an old universe of 12 billion? Because that&#39;s part of the argument&#39;s premise there, that a god is more likely to occur in that timeframe than any kind of purely natural process. </li>
<li>Then it cites &quot;some atheist lies&quot;, and I hate to tell you ... any group of people have liars. Scientists live a life where lies are sniffed out quicker than any other aspect of life. Peer reviewed means others have to agree that yes, the claim is true. I&#39;m not sure how this is relevent. </li>
</ol>

<p>Ok .. so I read the so called &quot;atheist lies one after another&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is worthy to note that even now, scientists are prevaricating about this matter and they insist they did not lie to us about humans having 24 pairs of chromosomes.  Instead they tell us they made an “understandable mistake” and it was very difficult to accurately count all the way up to 24 pairs of chromosomes.<br/>
It is absurd for atheists to assert that the counting of just 23 pairs of chromosomes was so difficult that none of them could do it correctly for over 30 years.  Guess what? They had no trouble counting the much larger number of chromosomes for other animals, such as dogs who have 39 pairs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is fascinating, because this actually was a huge thing in the scientific world, because that&#39;s part of the beauty of it. If anything truly contradicts something, it&#39;s updated and changed. If something could fly in the face of modern science, answering the question inadequately, or differently, would put the science world on its head. </p>

<p>&quot;Why do humans have one less chromosome pairs than apes?&quot;</p>

<p>One hypothesis was that 2 pairs might have merged into 1. And then predictions were made, along the lines of &quot;if 2 pairs have merged, we will see this in one of the pairs.&quot;</p>

<p>Ken Miller is a Christian as well, and he has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi8FfMBYCkk">this wonderful 10 min presentation</a> on all that info.</p>

<p>In any case then it goes on to disprove &quot;Darwin&#39;s theories&quot; which is easy for anyone to do since they&#39;re about 150 years old almost and horribly out of date, and the article isn&#39;t that much younger it seems, it&#39;s at least not up to date with the past 5 years or more. </p>

<p>As soon as I posted my first response, I started that video. I got to 45 minutes, and it was already repetitive, he easily rambled off 4 to 8 things for every point he was trying to make. And not different examples, just different ways of phrasing the same idea. (Easy to get to 200 this way)</p>

<p>I then watching about another 45 minutes in the bg, because let&#39;s face it, I&#39;ve got better things to do. I&#39;ve read all these points, I&#39;ve heard them, I&#39;v watched them, I&#39;ve thought about them. There are many that are simply based on &quot;well if you think about it&quot; or &quot;I mean, just look at stuff with your own eyes&quot; (like the horizon) without so much of a twitch about ignoring how primitive our minds our, how inadequate our eyes really are (despite their very good attempts I will admit). </p>

<p>Many others, they get very dramatic, very exaggerated, like the images showing an extreeeeeme curvature of the earth, then putting regular elements like ships and buildings at thousands of degrees larger than irl, and that just feeds that idea of &quot;this looks ridiculous, how can anyone believe this.&quot; When exactly, nobody believes the imagery they&#39;re showing you, people trust the maths, the models, the theories, the laws, the experimentation that all can make or break the back of science, yet somehow, it always stands up to scrutiny, and what can&#39;t gets scrapped or rewritten. </p>

<p>This is how improvement works. In your life. At your job. In science. Keep what&#39;s right and build on it, dump what doesn&#39;t stand up to peer review and scrutiny. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I know about myself. I&#39;m not a scientist, so there is a lot that I cannot just go out and prove on my own. There is math that is far beyond me, and possibly forever will be. I also know that I could have been / be a bit of a scientist. My math was always strong, but there wasn&#39;t a real passion for it. However I know how to study and if I stuck to it for a few years, devoting hours to it, there are some models I could mathematically verify. </p>

<p>So when it comes to science, there is some stuff I have to take for granted. I could go on, but I&#39;ll take a little breather here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kind of an easy cop out, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>There are many many different ways that the age of anything is calculated, or postulated, by necessity it is a bit of a guessing game and results can cover a wide spectrum of possibilities. But when you have two independent methods overlapping, that&#39;s the general age you start looking at. O look, a third method gives us an even smaller overlap, so we&#39;re getting more accurate, and so on.</p>

<p>Of course this means that the further back you go, the more inaccurate things get. </p>

<p>I think it makes a big difference how old you think earth is. Do you hold onto the possibility that the universe is really just 6000 years old or so according to biblical chronology?</p>

<p>One fact, or anecdote, however you want to see it, that makes a pretty loud statement in evolution&#39;s favor in my opinion is just the amount of fossils we find. Fossils, especially really old ones, are extremely rare. It takes special circumstances for fossils to maintain for so long. As you know from biology, the material that our bodies are made of decompose pretty quick. Bones might hang around the longest, but eventually they turn into dust too. </p>

<p>So we&#39;re kind of lucky to get any old fossils, but we find that there are so many of them, all preserved by these random events that just happened to allow them to last until we got a chance to dig them up, or calcify so we can see their imprints on rock formations. </p>

<p>So from my point of view either:</p>

<p>Evolution is a real process that occurs all the time, changing and creating new species on a (relatively) constant basis from a cosmic perspective, to where more than 99% of what we dig up has gone extinct. </p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>A god really enjoys creating animals and then killing them off completely, sometimes in horrific cataclysmic events.</p>

<p>Consider the possibility of a young earth, and that god did all that creating and killing in an incredibly short time frame. </p>

<p>I&#39;m harping so much on evolution in this conversation because I have yet to talk to a flat-earther (or read one&#39;s comments) who was not in some way a believer and digging a little further they&#39;re also evolution skeptics.</p>

<p>I believe flat-earth is used as a foundation to refute evolution, because from some believers&#39; point of view, evolution supposedly debunks their god, which it doesn&#39;t because there are plenty believers who accept evolution without any issue caused to their faith.</p>

<p>It&#39;s much easier to say &quot;evolution isn&#39;t real&quot; with the same breath as saying &quot;the earth is flat and not as old as those silly scientists claim&quot; because those two claims somehow support each other, using a god as a premise to get to those results. </p>

<p>Im not sure its safe to say that the Bible says the universe is 6000 years old. Again, I&#39;m not what you would call a traditional or mainstream christian...i have a lot of issues with it, including its Bible..which has been altered, translated and retranslated a number of times.

<p>I&#39;ll just leave with this: after just briefly skimming that video, there are a few hitches for me already ...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Trying to say that how artists&#39; depictions are used to give an example of how the animals that these bones came from <strong>could</strong> have looked like, is somehow indicative of scientists&#39; attempt to deceive anyone is a pretty bold claim. At least that&#39;s how I interpreted it.  </p></li>
<li><p>Claiming that dinosaurs somehow were needed to support evolution is completely false. Dinosaurs could be removed completely from the fossil record and the evidence for evolution would be just as strong as ever. </p></li>
<li><p>The final written statement at the end of video that &quot;intelligent design is a modest position&quot; .. kind of makes me laugh because there&#39;s nothing modest about it, it&#39;s actually quite bold. Especially when looking at it from the perspective that it&#39;s basically saying &quot;I can&#39;t explain why something smart like us exists - I know, something even smarter than us must have made it happen!&quot; ... ok, then how did that thing that&#39;s smarter than us get here in the first place ... it&#39;s just circular reasoning. You can&#39;t just explain something by positing something else that&#39;s even less explainable. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t though. If the earth was spinning, every time we jumped up off the surface, the ground would continue its motion at the same speed, and we would be decelerating because our motion was caused by the earths motion. Of course momentum would still carry us in the same direction, but our speed would be decreasing....so much so that the spot from which we jumped would be well away from where we land.      </p>

<p>Get in the bed of a truck, have someone drive down the road, while you jump up off the truck...what happens? The truck continues forward as momentum carries you forward, but well behind the truck...you land...you probably roll and break bones. The same principal applies if it were the earth that is moving...     </p>

<p>Or get on a treadmill or one of those moving sidewalks in airports and walk against the direction of the motion....its really easy to see. You can also test it vertically in an elevator.        </p>

<p>According to TPTB the earth is spinning at about 1000 mph. We would notice that speed. And no, our bodies are not &quot;use to it&quot;. You cant change the fact that we are separate from the earth, and that we can easily test if something is in motion. The earth is clearly not.        </p>

<p>Yes. you do. It is simply harder to notice because you cant jump as high or for long enough. Most buses wouldn&#39;t be going 90 either. The slower you go the harder it is to notice. But if you are short enough, and on an empty bus with enough room to effectively jump up, i recommend you try it and see for yourself.      </p>

<p>Well lets take this one step at a time. I personally don&#39;t think we have been out of earths atmosphere, or that space is necessarily an empty vacuum. But lets stick to the point i was making. If the earth is moving, the same rule that applies to us and the moving truck would apply to us and the moving earth. Motion is motion.      </p>

You go up and come down exactly from where you jumped.       </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the fact that you have so little time and space to jump in a moving plane makes it harder to notice, but I guarantee you, if you were able to &quot;detach&quot; from the moving plane long enough, the rear of the cabin would catch up to the spot in 3d space from whence you jumped. And if you have the balls to risk pissing off the flight attendants, feel free to test it yourself. You will be able to feel and observe your deselection as the plane continues forward....     </p>

<p>As for the atmosphere decelerating you more outside than inside a vehicle, you are correct. But because your motion is dependent on the vehicles motion, you will decelerate until another force is applied to continue your motion. Riding on the earth is basically like riding on a car with no windshield. Imagine your spinning ball earth as a vehicle that is carrying you through points in space just as a car bus or whatever does....the only real difference would be the size of the vehicle.      </p>

<p>Something less daring on a plane is maybe some quick juggling, the balls stay in the air considerably longer than you could jump, and they go up and then come straight down as long as the vehicle is at a constant speed.

<p>An airplane at 500 mph is half of the earth&#39;s rotation at 1000 mph, so logically you should be able to feel half of what you&#39;re expecting to feel &quot;if&quot; the earth was spinning like that. </p>

<p>How are the juggling balls not getting thrown to the back of the plane?</p>

<p>It really just isn&#39;t, you can&#39;t ignore the atmosphere like that. We can&#39;t see it with our simple eyes, and our primitive senses experience it as a sort of &quot;emptiness&quot; because we can walk right through it, but it&#39;s really a kind of soup and in the end doesn&#39;t behave that much differently than regular solid things, just to a different degree. There are metric tons of matter in the air all around us.  </p>

<p>The earth + atmosphere behave like an enclosed vehicle with a roof and we&#39;re sitting inside. No matter how fast you&#39;re going, at a constant speed if you throw something straight up, it comes straight down. </p>

<p>Remember that while the balls are held by you, and you are on the vehicle, the balls share the motion of the vehicle and will have that momentum when released.

<p>You can&#39;t claim muscle memory if your first time trying this, anything you throw up, whether it&#39;s juggling balls or anything by itself for that matter goes straight up and comes straight back down, no matter how fast the vehicle is moving as long as its velocity stays constant.</p>

<p>Your original example of being on the back of a truck and jumping, just do the same with anything small and light weight. Throw it up, and it much more drastically gets pushed back by the wind resistance the truck&#39;s speed is causing. </p>

<p>But your assumption is that this is simply caused by the truck moving.</p>

<p>So if on a plane moving at 500 mph you assume that if we could jump up high enough we then should be able to notice we land considerably further back from where we launched, then it stands to reason that anything as light as a juggling ball, being suspended in the air inside the plane and completely detached from the plane, it should be inevitably noticeable according to your reasoning that it moves considerably backwards in the plane.</p>

<p>You can even use a little launcher contraption that&#39;s designed to throw something straight up, no &quot;muscle memory&quot; involved, and the item will still come straight down. </p>

<p>&quot;if you throw something straight up, it comes straight down.&quot;</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t something I just picked up in the last week .. last year or more I got extremely interested in the flat-earth theory and since then have spent I don&#39;t know how many hours researching it, listening to all the passionate arguments, reading up on it, trying to talk to people. I would even admit that there were multiple times I was very much on the fence and could go either way because I did my best, as you&#39;re now requesting, to look at everything from an objective point of view with my mind open to any possibility, because come on, who doesn&#39;t enjoy a good conspiracy where you&#39;ve been lied to all your life? </p>

<p>And it comes down to the inability of flat-earth to substantiate its arguments besides &quot;just think about it&quot; or &quot;doesn&#39;t it just feel wrong?&quot; when that is not at all how we figure out the reality around us. Besides that, there&#39;s also the inevitably disappointing realization that there are no theories, mathematical models or anything of the like that explains something as simple as why the smaller, nearer sun in a flat earth model doesn&#39;t fall down amongst many other simply ignored natural phenomena. </p>

<p>Just look at radioactivity as a simple example: does it make sense to you that immensely tiny particles can travel straight through your body and in the process do incredible damage to your tissues? It might seem illogical, and it&#39;s not something you can witness with your eyes, but that doesn&#39;t change that it happens. </p>

<p>Or how light behaves: Sometimes as a wave, sometimes as a particle and literally depending on if someone is measuring its trajectory, it acts differently. This can be shown by anybody with relatively little capital using the double slit experiment. Makes no sense, but it&#39;s factual nonetheless. </p>

<p>If you or anybody can prove that inside a moving vehicle at a constant velocity, when something becomes detached from that vehicle it is moved &quot;backwards&quot; in any shape or form, then I might start taking this argument seriously. But the fact of the matter is, is that the internet is filled with questions and anecdotes and tests and mathematical explanations for exactly why this doesn&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>Find me one example of someone who claims and shows otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, inside or not, if the object inside the vehicle was not in physical contact for long enough the rear of the vehicle would catch up to the point in space where the object inside was. You are confusing brief periods of time out of physical contact and with momentum with the object being the producer of the motion.       </p>

<p>The fact that it is harder to notice INSIDE the vehicle is because its hard if not impossible to test it inside because contact with the vehicle is so brief and momentum is still in effect( though if you are a juggler...hop on the bus and give it a try when at cruising speed...or maybe try in the back of a large empty moving truck). But it is EASILY noticeable outside where there is more resistance and opportunity to come out of contact with the vehicle, whether it be the bed of a truck, a skateboard or the supposed moving earth....      </p>

<p>The point is that the effects of momentum and deceleration that one would experience when jumping up from a moving truck should be the same as jumping up from a moving earth...the difference being that the earth is supposedly moving at roughly 1000 mph. Good luck even being able to stand up and walk on something moving that fast, let alone jump up from it.      </p>

<p>I suggest the video because it shows the glaring obviousness of the lies we have been told. I admit the presentation and outline could have been cleaner, but overall I like it more than a lot of others because it doesn&#39;t get deep into speculation or focus on many things that cant be verified by anyone. As opposed to the powers that be that cant get their stories straight, have a new theory every day, use a shit ton of theoretical science and mathematics, and have been caught time and time again, straight up lying to the public.        </p>

<p>Prove it. You cannot find any example of this happening. Because it doesn&#39;t exist when the vehicle is at a constant velocity. </p>

<p>We do not just &quot;sit on top of earth&quot; in a globe or flat model, we are surrounded by molecules, by matter in the air all around us. In a flat earth this supposedly happens because apparently the earth is moving up,  which causes the heaviest particles to get pushed farther down than lighter particles, and also explains why we get &quot;pushed down&quot; into the earth.</p>

<p>Is that what you believe by the way? Because if not gravity, what keeps us on the ground?</p>

<p>Under the theory of gravity, our atmosphere moves along with the globe and we humans live in a zone of the planet&#39;s general area that acts exactly the same as if we were inside a vehicle.</p>

<p>Again, even in the typical flat-earth model, this atmosphere is the same soup from the globe earth model where the farther up you go, the less thick it gets. But the &quot;up&quot;  movement of the flat earth still keeps it all more or less in place, momentarily not considering wind for the sake of the argument&#39;s simplicity. </p>

<p>You ignore this every time you say &quot;it should be like riding on the back of a truck&quot;. Nonono, that doesn&#39;t make any logical sense. </p>

<p>How can you logically hold on to the idea that apparently 1000 mph should just be so noticeable when you, or anything, is detached from the earth for even a short period, yet half that speed on an airplane is apparently barely noticeable, or it&#39;s related to muscle memory somehow, or what?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve flown in many planes and have never had to compensate barring during acceleration, deceleration and turbulence. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked a lot of questions, I&#39;m trying to understand your reasoning, but so far you seem completely disinterested in considering any other possibility. I&#39;m not so sure I&#39;m the one having trouble keeping an objective point of view, not willing to open my mind to other possible explanations. </p>

<p>I think i have proved it. I have given you examples of this happening, and have been trying to make the examples easy enough so you could test them yourself. And read what you are writing....when the &quot;vehicle is at a constant speed&quot;...the object inside the vehicle is not the vehicle. When the object is in physical contact with the vehicle it shares its constant velocity. As soon as that object is not in physical contact with the vehicle, it will begin to decelerate. If it stays out of physical contact with the vehicle, eventually, the rear of the vehicle will catch up. I get that its harder to visualize this principal while inside...but it can be tested...      </p>

<p>In the flat earth model, the earth is not moving at all. But there is a natural up and down. We aren&#39;t being pushed or pulled...I suppose you could say we are falling. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=density+equation&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTytmZn9rTAhXhwVQKHSobAgYQ_AUIBigB&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=950#imgrc=RLSbKDSyVVS_eM:">Density</a> affects <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/engrade-myfiles/4064868690177260/b1bcc38d9304212a9fbcc052f8cf7b84878c318b.jpg">matter&#39;s decent</a>. The fact that the earth is denser than we are is what &quot;keeps us on the ground&quot;.      </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under the theory of gravity, our atmosphere moves along with the globe and we humans live in a zone of the planet&#39;s general area that acts exactly the same as if we were inside a vehicle.      </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean...can you not see how preposterous that is? The globe earth is supposedly spinning in one constant direction, though the atmosphere can be easily observed moving every which way. In the video he quotes someone saying something along the lines of &quot;the fact that the earth is motionless can be proven by kite flying...&quot; because you are correct, if the earth truly was spinning, especially at that speed, the movement of the atmosphere would be dictated by the earths motion.      </p>

<p>as far as the earth being the inside of a moving vehicle...no..in order for that to be, the hollow earth idea would have to be true. Riding on the surface of the globe earth would be equivalent to riding on top of a bus or on the outside of a plane....      </p>

<p>And for the record, according to TPTB, humans have lived on every part of the earths surface....i mean, maybe not every square foot, but EVERY &quot;zone&quot; as you put it.      </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can you logically hold on to the idea that apparently 1000 mph should just be so noticeable when you, or anything, is detached from the earth for even a short period, yet half that speed on an airplane is apparently barely noticeable, or it&#39;s related to muscle memory somehow, or what?      </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the difference is....<br/>
A) the difference between riding IN a vehicle and ON (the outside) of a vehicle.<br/>
B) The observable difference between 500 mph and 1000 mph is much greater than say...1 mph and 2 mph.... time distance and speed are all factors to consider.    </p>

<p>and to be clear, you said that its not noticeable IN a plane going a constant 500mph...not me. I very much think it is noticeable...so much so that it is visually measurable....but you have to remember momentum. Its not as if you are instantaneously at 0 mph when you detach from a vehicle going 500 mph, inside or out. You detach and its like 499, 498, 497.etc etc..you know? The reason why its more noticeable outside the vehicle is because there is more resistance, so you decelerate faster.      </p>

<p>And when i brought up muscle memory, all i meant was that you could unconsciously make physical adjustments once you get use to it....       </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve flown in many planes and have never had to compensate barring during acceleration, deceleration and turbulence.        </p>
</blockquote>

<p>so wait...you havent had to compensate barring during NON constant motion? Cuz i know that bs. Maybe you meant ONLY had to compensate? Which CAN be bs, but again, that is what i have been saying is harder to notice, and you don&#39;t think exists at all.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first want to ask if you think Isaac Newton was wrong with his laws of motion?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion</a></p>

<p>First law:</p>

<p><em>In an inertial reference frame, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a force.</em></p>

<p>When something inside of a vehicle &quot;detaches&quot; from that vehicle it keeps its exact velocity, according to this law of motion. Once something starts moving, it can only be slowed down if another force acts on it. </p>

<p>Contradicting exactly what you&#39;re saying here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As soon as that object is not in physical contact with the vehicle, it will begin to decelerate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just not how motion works. </p>

<p>The Zones of earth that I was speaking of was meaning vertically. We live and exist in a very small section of earth&#39;s zones when looking at it in vertical slices. We are not at the top. We are made of matter. Everything is made of matter. There are hundreds of tons of matter above our heads at all times. </p>

<p>When I said that I don&#39;t have to compensate in a plane, I was trying to say that when its speed is constant, and there&#39;s no turbulence, then I do not have to compensate anything about how I move or &quot;throwing objects in the air&quot;.</p>

<p>There are many many many examples on the internet asking this exact question: &quot;Why do things inside a fast moving vehicle not get pushed to the back of the vehicle&quot; because this is what everybody sees every day. </p>

<p>Your interpretation as described above does not fit what any person can test and see everyday. Show me one example where this doesn&#39;t happen. I can&#39;t find one, I&#39;ve been looking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the flat earth model, the earth is not moving at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should be saying that&#39;s not part of <em>your</em> flat earth model, <a href="http://wiki.tfes.org/Universal_Acceleration">because it&#39;s a pretty typical flat earth argument</a> to explain what we experience as gravity. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>To detach...to jump up is to apply a force. And unless you can jump with enough force to go 500mph in the SAME direction as the plane, you are going to cease going in the direction of the plane at 500mph....hence, you will not keep its exact velocity. And again...resistance is a force, and since there is more resistance outside of the plane than within, it is easier to observe because it happens faster.      </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which of the zones on <a href="http://static3.bigstockphoto.com/thumbs/4/2/1/large1500/124682.jpg">this globe</a> have we not lived on? Which is to say, which of these zones have man never been too? Becasue if we have been there, we have lived there.   </p>

<p>Again, i don&#39;t think the globe is real, but according to TPTB, man has been in all the zones, if the zones were the divisions in that picture.       </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do things inside a fast moving vehicle not get pushed to the back of the vehicle&quot; because this is what everybody sees every day.      </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they are in physical contact with the vehicle. And they WILL get &quot;pushed back&quot; during acceleration....&quot;pulled forward&quot; during deceleration. I use quotes because you aren&#39;t really being pushed and pulled...its just the difference of motion between the person and the vehicle in a 3d space. Your seat stops you from going all the way back during acceleration and your seatbelt stops you from continuing your motion forward when the vehicle decelerates.      </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s just not how motion works.<br/>
again, the &quot;detachment&quot; is caused by a separate force.       </p>

<p>You should be saying that&#39;s not part of your flat earth model, because it&#39;s a pretty typical flat earth argument to explain what we experience as gravity.      </p>

<p>Disinformation about the flat earth is plentiful. That particular piece is just as easily disproven as the spinning ball model. Some use these arguments because they are shills, some use them because they don&#39;t know what they are talking about.      </p>

<p>Even in a flat earth model there are layers, beneath us causing volcanoes and earth quakes, there are also layers above us consisting of matter, we just don&#39;t see them or experience them the same way we see rock because of how thinly spread the matter is.</p>

<p>The only reason vehicles slow down is because of drag, either from the air and all its mass in front of the vehicle, or from wheels on the ground, or of course boats on water and so on.

<p>Zones or layers like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok...first of all, while I do agree there are layers of earth below the surface (obviously) that diagram is wildly speculative. The deepest anyone has dug into the earth is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole">~8 miles</a>, so to make the claim that the crust alone is roughly 60 miles thick is bold to say the least. I wont even dignify commenting on the other layers because there is absolutely no technology that man posses to determine what is down that far.     </p>

<p>And yes, i thought you were referring to zones on and above the surface because we were talking about the atmosphere and weather patterns...which would be affected by the rotation of the spinning ball earth. Not really sure what subterranean parts of the earth have to do with that discussion        </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Full vacuum pressure occurs when pounds per square inch, or PSI, reaches zero. PSI is the most common standard to measure pressure. Nonetheless, other measurements also reach zero when a full or absolute vacuum is achieved.&quot;      </p>

<p>Ok....so where on earth is this possible? (hint: its a trick question)      </p>

<p>You completely ignored the force that threw the ball up in the air. Which is weaker, separate, and applied to a different direction that the force of the traveling vehicle.      </p>

<p>Well again...you can test this yourself. Ill try to find video evidence on the interet but can&#39;t guarantee I&#39;ll find any. I might just have to throw something together myself...but that takes time and resources...      </p>

<p>or again...you could just test it yourself. As I have...        </p>

</blockquote>

<p>OK...let me try to find an example in a way that is easier to visualize in your head...      </p>

<p>And to address a point I think you are making in your other comments....how do you compare the surface and atmosphere of spinning earth to the inside of a plane or car or whatever? Do you think the spinning ball earth is an enclosed ecosystem with a physical barrier surrounding it? Like...to use an example...do you see the spinning ball earth as a ball inside of an inflated balloon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had a hard time figuring out how to respond to this.</p>

<p>You have claimed multiple times that a natural phenomenon happens in a certain way, I have claimed that it does not happen as you&#39;ve described, and anywhere I look at the evidence, the models, the claims, the experimentation, they all support how I have described it.</p>

<p>In a moving vehicle at a constant speed any element inside that vehicle that becomes detached from the vehicle continues moving at the same speed as the vehicle.</p>

<p>This is something every single person experiences anytime it is tried. </p>

<p>If you can find evidence that it happens how you describe, I will reconsider this argument and likely you could win a Nobel prize in physics.  </p>

<p>Flat-earth arguments take a lot of naturally occurring phenomena, finds other ways to explain how they could be happening, not making any effort to tie them all together with a single overlapping model that supports all of them together, at the same time ignoring extremely vital questions like &quot;How does the nearer, smaller sun not fall to the ground?&quot; or &quot;Why do planets take such strange paths across our skies?&quot; or &quot;How come we can calculate the effect of the moon on our ocean&#39;s tides using gravitation Theory?&quot; </p>

<p>Heliocentrism is based on a few basic models and mathematical theories, it can make predictions on how it could be supported, but more importantly on how it could be disproved. So far every single natural phenomena we have looked at fits those models, and any backyard astronomy hobbyist can confirm these independently.</p>

<p>The heliocentric model has found us new planets that we didn&#39;t know were there before and new moons around planets we already knew about. Flat-earth doesn&#39;t have any such accomplishments under its belt.  </p>

<p>As for your (trick) question on where on earth there&#39;s a vacuum, earth exists inside a vacuum from my point of view. </p>

<p>And no, I don&#39;t see the earth as enclosed, or &quot;inside an inflated balloon&quot;, at least not in the typical sense you&#39;re trying to describe. The earth has layers, we might not agree on how many, or which ones, but surely we can agree there are layers. We as humans don&#39;t live on the bottom layer, or the top layer, but somewhere in between. There are layers above our heads that have millions and millions of tons of matter in them. These layers above us do have an &quot;enclosing&quot; effect on us down here on a lower layer. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I mean...can you not see how preposterous that is? The globe earth is supposedly spinning in one constant direction, though the atmosphere can be easily observed moving every which way. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to address this separately, because I specifically said for the sake of the argument to not include wind and weather, because it is irrelevant. There are other layers going out (or up if you will) that are completely different from the layers where weather can even happen, it effectively keeps the layers where weather happens contained so it can swirl around and worry about making sure high pressure zones dissipate to lower pressure zones. In the meantime soaking up massive amounts of water (again, matter exists above us that has many similarities to the matter that&#39;s below us) and then dropping it back down randomly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if the earth truly was spinning, especially at that speed, the movement of the atmosphere would be dictated by the earths motion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is such interesting phrasing, because I am claiming exactly that the atmosphere is directly affected by the earth&#39;s spinning motion, which is why we experience existence in this zone of the earth&#39;s general area, looking at it from a vertical perspective, very similarly to being inside a vehicle.</p>

<p>In a flat earth model you&#39;ll have to explain why we can&#39;t watch the boat float away until it reaches the ice wall surrounding us. Is the claim that we don&#39;t have optics that can zoom in that far? Or that the atmosphere gets too thick to see through it? </p>
