       Assange wasn't happy with the
       <strong>
        framing
       </strong>
       of the release because western leaders and media tried to make Putin the focus of Panama Papers which was obviously not true. (Much like they tied to make Hillary's loss all about Putin, again simply not true.)
      </p>

       The rest of the details are right there in the article you linked so I'm not sure why you didn't provide a more accurate description.

       The PM of Iceland was forced to step down when they were released. It was kind of amazing to see unfold. There was an interview where he clearly didn't know yet that the docs had been released and he had been named, and the interviewer began with asking him questions about the government crackdown on tax dodgers and why he thought it was important, getting a choice array of quotes that highlight his hypocrisy when he's then asked about the pp. He flustered and flubbed and fibbed and ended up walking out of the interview. He refused to step down, there was one of the largest protests in Iceland (~8% of the population), and then he announced his resignation. It all took place over the space of 24-48 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was so striking because it was so different from how these things go down in the US/UK. There were no arguments about whether what he did was technically legal or not; it was just assessed immediately as corrupt regardless, and everyone immediately turned on him and left him no choice. There wasn't the years of endless hearings, inquiries, investigations, justifications and partisan thinkpieces before anything could be done (at the end of which nothing will be done); there was immediate action. It was impressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's the only example I know of where there were any reprecussions. So many people were named, from Cameron, who was UK PM at the time, to the Spanish royal family, to Marine LePen, even Jackie Chan. I think everyone just weaseled their way out of it with Technically Legal™, and I haven't heard of it resulting in any legislation being passed to tighten controls or such. I hope there were some reprecussions that just weren't on my radar, but I think there may not have been many.

       Good point! Yes, she implied that Macron may have money stashed in the Bahamas, and now he's threatening legal action.
I don't follow French politics very closely, but from what I understood, LePen wasn't directly involved in the pp scandal, but her father and a couple of her aides were, and there were questions about whether she was implicated. I guess she must have been cleared if she can now throw those veiled-not-so-veiled accusations at him. 
I wish I spoke French; this election would be so interesting to follow more closely!
