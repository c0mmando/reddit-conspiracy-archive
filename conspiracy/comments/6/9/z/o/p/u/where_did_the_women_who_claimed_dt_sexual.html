    <div class="md"><p>This is seriously your evidence?
Jessica Leeds is the secretary of some (charity?) group, and that same group has one of several directors who met Clinton at a volunteer event. That&#39;s your evidence?</p>

<p>Your second link repeats a rumour that&#39;s been proven false (that Leeds&#39; phone number is the same as someone at the Clinton Foundation) and otherwise... proves that both women supported Clinton? (One by simply saying she would vote for her, and the other by giving less than $200 to the campaign.) This isn&#39;t evidence of anything - the fact that these two women supported her campaign was reported by the same NYTimes that first carried their accusations. Additionally, is it so crazy to think that if a woman HAD been sexually assaulted by someone, they might not want to vote that person into the presidency?</p>

<p>Your last link doesn&#39;t even claim to have any tie to Clinton or any evidence of the allegations not be real, except that the accuser herself reported to the NYTimes that she was supporting Hillary and the TOTALLY DAMNING EVIDENCE that she liked a liberal documentary on Facebook and a page for liberals.</p>

<p>This reply is a joke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FWIW, Trump was accused, several times, of sexual misconduct both before (sometimes decades before) he ran for president and during his campaign. It doesn’t make much sense to assume all the allegations were related to his presidential run.</p>

<p>Here’s a rundown of just SOME of the sexual allegations against Trump and a look at &quot;where the women&quot; went. It&#39;s pretty obviously not as clean cut as &#39;women accused him during the election and then stopped when he won&#39;.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Donald Trump’s ex-wife Ivana accused Trump of rape in an early 1990s book - Trump sued her (and won) for violating a gag clause in their divorce agreement. Ivan has since said her own claims were “without merit”</p></li>
<li><p>Jill Harth, a girlfriend of Trump’s, sued in 1997 for sexual harassment and abuse. Trump settled with her for an unknown amount. Harth still maintains that she was assaulted, but attended some of Trump’s rallies during the campaign (working as a makeup artist, apparently). She was not public with her story and lawsuit until 2016, and Trump has denied the allegations. </p></li>
<li><p>Multiple women who had worked with Trump or known him in some professional capacity (through pageants, etc) were interviewed by the NYTimes in 2016 and reported some sort of unwanted/inappropriate sexual conduct by Trump. The vast majority of these women were anonymous, but the NYTimes claimed that these women’s families and friends were able to back up their claims with details they’d shared with them when the incidents with Trump happened.
— Btw, several of these women publicly spoke out about their experiences with Trump after he specifically claimed he had never sexually assaulted a woman during one of the debates. All of them had family and friends who verified that these women’s stories had not changed throughout the years. These are the ones most often claimed to be “politically motivated”, but all of these women spoke to friends and families about Trump’s assault years or decades before Trump got into politics.</p></li>
<li><p>Natasha Stoynoff - interviewed Trump in 2005 for People magazine. She has at least six witnesses who corroborate her story of Donald Trump grabbing her and kissing her.</p></li>
<li><p>Summer Zervos, who was a contestant on The Apprentice, currently has a lawsuit against Trump, alleging that he kissed and touched her without her consent on multiple occasions, and suing for defamation because Trump has called her a liar. Trump is currently trying to get this lawsuit delayed until the end of his presidency, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2017/03/29/donald-trumps-lawyers-say-a-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-will-distract-the-president-from-his-duties/">claiming that it will “distract” him.</a></p></li>
<li><p>There was an anonymous woman who was suing Trump for raping her when she was 13 years old, but she dropped the suit after apparently getting death threats and harassment when her name was made public.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And then, of course, there are the several times that Trump himself has admitted what is, at best, really inappropriate behavior. The most famous example is the infamous “grab her by the pussy” tape, but there’s also this, from when he was on the Howard Stern show in 2005:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know, no men are anywhere. And I&#39;m allowed to go in because I&#39;m the owner of the pageant. And therefore I&#39;m inspecting it... Is everyone OK? You know, they&#39;re standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible-looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that ... I&#39;ll go backstage before a show, and everyone&#39;s getting dressed and ready and everything else.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strangely enough, although multiple women involved in Trump’s pageants have corroborated his story of walking in on them when they were naked and didn’t expect it, but Trump’s spokespeople have denied all of these women’s claims. Strange.</p>

<p>And, BTW, Trump did promise, in October of last year, that he was going to sue every woman who’d made allegations against him, as well as the media for reporting on them. And yet that’s never happened….</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Following my order from above:
* Ivana is friendly with her ex-husband. As I said, she now says her own claims were without merit.
* As I said above, Jill Harth still maintains that she was assaulted by Trump, but was seen working at Trump events during his election.
* Most of these women are anonymous, and those who are not remain occasionally in the public eye (at events like this one: <a href="http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-accusers-march-washington/">http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-accusers-march-washington/</a>) but primarily private citizens.
