        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Take some personal responsibility, some real personal responsibility, and evaluate what you are doing. The whole &quot;I voted&quot; bullshit is a way for people to feel like they are making a difference without actually having to do anything.    </p>

<p>Think about what you buy, what you spend your energy toward building, how you treat others, and how that shapes the world around you. It&#39;s easy to point out the fucked up shit in the world -  but how many of us are actively working toward making it a better place? How many of us are willing to change the status quo, to go against the grain, to shift our lives in a different direction?    </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t done much myself, and I&#39;m mad at myself for it. It&#39;s depressing when you see what&#39;s going on, and I go back and forth between being angry and apathetic. I am the problem. I feel small and insignificant and use that as excuse to do nothing. I could be out volunteering and dedicating my time to supporting good causes instead of sitting in my apartment reading about how fucked up things are. I&#39;m selfish and I&#39;m jaded... This post has turned into a sort of rant at myself, but that&#39;s fine. Maybe some of you will resonate with what I&#39;m saying and be motivated to get out there. We are all part of the problem.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice. I&#39;m not too concerned about a steady job or w/e, I&#39;m just not sure where I&#39;m going to go. Definitely need a change of pace though. I delivered pizza for 2.5 years and quit 8 months ago, and still have enough saved to sustain myself for the next year or so. When living alone and only spending money on the essentials, its pretty easy to make it work, at least in my experience. I&#39;m thinking about working on a farm and learning to grow food; would be good for me to be out in the sun instead of behind a computer screen too.</p>

<p>Is it standard procedure to assume people are spewing bullshit unless they have a nice youtube conspiracy video source? Both parties have the same goals but superficial differences are important to keep the people convinced they&#39;re not. The red ones have focused more on voter supression and gerrymandering than the blues have, they&#39;re busy trying to tax people on parts of the atmosphere and convincing their bluish friends that the lack of bathroom rights in this country is among the top 10 worst human rights offenses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey yeah, this post is awesome!</p>

<p>Self reliance/responsibility is crucial to building a healthy foundation with the world (and yourself of course). It&#39;s important to also notice how you are being, thinking, feeling, at every moment. Everybody feels and thinks about everything, but you don&#39;t always have to act on those thoughts or feelings. :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, true. When I&#39;m aware of the thoughts bouncing around in my head I can choose whether or not to entertain them. Otherwise I&#39;m just on autopilot with my programmed habits and thoughts, and its hard to change them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop eating meat. Stop drinking milk. Seriously. You&#39;ve probably been conditioned into defensively conjuring arguments against this kind of rhetoric because its &#39;vegan propaganda&#39; but they treat animal and eco activists as domestic terrorists for a reason in America. The USDA rivals AIPAC as a lobbying force in this country - Got Milk is child brainwashing to implant their product into our minds from childhood. Its toxic for the body, its toxic for the planet to produce industrially, and so is meat. Auto emissions are dwarfed by the carbon footprint of the animal agro-industrial complex. You want to drastically reduce your impact on this planet? Grow your own food, or at least eat as if you did - only whole organic produce, beans nuts etc and you will feel your whole being transform. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Righteous, I&#39;m in a similar position, off grid is the dream. I met a man in Mexico who worked for a hotel on the outskirts of Chichen Itza; he was living in a small classical Maya hut his coworkers had made for him, had a sizable garden, and slept in a hammock surrounded by stacks of books. He was the hotel&#39;s naturalist and ran their website. It can happen. Good luck to you on your path.</p>
