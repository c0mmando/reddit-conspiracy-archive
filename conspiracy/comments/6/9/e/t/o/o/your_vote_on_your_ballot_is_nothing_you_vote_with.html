       Take some personal responsibility, some real personal responsibility, and evaluate what you are doing. The whole "I voted" bullshit is a way for people to feel like they are making a difference without actually having to do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about what you buy, what you spend your energy toward building, how you treat others, and how that shapes the world around you. It's easy to point out the fucked up shit in the world -  but how many of us are actively working toward making it a better place? How many of us are willing to change the status quo, to go against the grain, to shift our lives in a different direction?
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't done much myself, and I'm mad at myself for it. It's depressing when you see what's going on, and I go back and forth between being angry and apathetic. I am the problem. I feel small and insignificant and use that as excuse to do nothing. I could be out volunteering and dedicating my time to supporting good causes instead of sitting in my apartment reading about how fucked up things are. I'm selfish and I'm jaded... This post has turned into a sort of rant at myself, but that's fine. Maybe some of you will resonate with what I'm saying and be motivated to get out there. We are all part of the problem.

       Own nothing, no mortgage no car. Money in a credit union. Live frugally. No cell phone. I buy stuff off of Craigslist and give it away when I'm done with it.

       That's awesome. My apartment lease is up in a couple months and I'm not sure what I'll be doing next. I have a decent amount in savings from being frugal, so I've got time to figure it out.

       Stay away from r/frugal, their idea of saving money and opting out consists of cheaper cell phone plans,
       <em>
        buying
       </em>
       in bulk from Costco, and cash back credit cards.

       If your going to use it, there isn't anything  bad about biying in bulk. Toiletries and essentials are good to get in bulk. If your buying in bulk and it goes to waste then yeah there is a problem.

       Frugal means saving money, not just spending nothing at all because you want to say fuck capitalism. Why would buying from Costco for cheap not mean frugal

       my work was affected by our last election. which has improved both money wise and lifestyle. 62% pay increase alone this year and I'm on only 8 more hours. 45 a week. t.in security. Also i'm bettering the lives of my countrymen so 360 win. I accept not everyone has the same perspective or had increased orders from jobs directly affected by the result and others may lose out. Infact you make good, fair points about self-improvement making you happier but lets face it you should know this shit before you are old enough to vote

       Nice. I'm not too concerned about a steady job or w/e, I'm just not sure where I'm going to go. Definitely need a change of pace though. I delivered pizza for 2.5 years and quit 8 months ago, and still have enough saved to sustain myself for the next year or so. When living alone and only spending money on the essentials, its pretty easy to make it work, at least in my experience. I'm thinking about working on a farm and learning to grow food; would be good for me to be out in the sun instead of behind a computer screen too.

       I disagree since the conservative network has spent big to suppress the vote, there must be a reason.

       Voting is our only option.  The Republicans who just uninsured millions were elected, not appointed by people who make lifestyle choices.

       Is it standard procedure to assume people are spewing bullshit unless they have a nice youtube conspiracy video source? Both parties have the same goals but superficial differences are important to keep the people convinced they're not. The red ones have focused more on voter supression and gerrymandering than the blues have, they're busy trying to tax people on parts of the atmosphere and convincing their bluish friends that the lack of bathroom rights in this country is among the top 10 worst human rights offenses.

       Self reliance/responsibility is crucial to building a healthy foundation with the world (and yourself of course). It's important to also notice how you are being, thinking, feeling, at every moment. Everybody feels and thinks about everything, but you don't always have to act on those thoughts or feelings. :D

       Stop eating meat. Stop drinking milk. Seriously. You've probably been conditioned into defensively conjuring arguments against this kind of rhetoric because its 'vegan propaganda' but they treat animal and eco activists as domestic terrorists for a reason in America. The USDA rivals AIPAC as a lobbying force in this country - Got Milk is child brainwashing to implant their product into our minds from childhood. Its toxic for the body, its toxic for the planet to produce industrially, and so is meat. Auto emissions are dwarfed by the carbon footprint of the animal agro-industrial complex. You want to drastically reduce your impact on this planet? Grow your own food, or at least eat as if you did - only whole organic produce, beans nuts etc and you will feel your whole being transform.

       I am vegan already, and eating lots of veggies and fruits. The dream for me now is to get off grid and be able to sustain myself without relying on anyone. I'm hopefully going to work on an organic farm soon and learn how to grow food!

       Righteous, I'm in a similar position, off grid is the dream. I met a man in Mexico who worked for a hotel on the outskirts of Chichen Itza; he was living in a small classical Maya hut his coworkers had made for him, had a sizable garden, and slept in a hammock surrounded by stacks of books. He was the hotel's naturalist and ran their website. It can happen. Good luck to you on your path.

       Check out Fairphone. Drive a Suzuki. Use a Linux distro. Listen to FLAC and watch MKV. Stop playing FPSs. Move to Scandinavia. Drink more water, but watch out for fluoride.

       said this for awhile,"Democracy or not, in a capitalist country the only vote that matters is the one you make with your checkbook". The unfortunate thing is that a fat checkbook makes your vote count more
