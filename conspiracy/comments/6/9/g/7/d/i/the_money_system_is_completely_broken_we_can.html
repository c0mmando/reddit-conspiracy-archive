        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A POW card is basically a card with a magnetic strip like a credit card that is swiped by a cashier to determine if you are working or not. When the cashier swipes the card, it green lights the cashier that you have been working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week at some job of your choice. You don&#39;t work, you don&#39;t consume unless there is a medical reason. </p>

<p>Using POW cards, we would all be on the same level. As long as we are working, we consume. The money system right now is giving massive amounts of money to the few and scraps to the 99%. The whole thing would level out with POW cards so that we move up and down as a society together. </p>

<p>Also, POW cards allow people to work any job they want. You can make gardens for the homeless, beautify our streets, rebuild our infrastructure, or whatever we want. Money wouldn&#39;t be used at all. Anytime we go shopping, we swipe our POW card and show ID and consume. Anyone can do anything and follow their passions but everyone has to work to fill up their POW card. People who are completely handicapped will get a free pass and consume for free. </p>

<p>This would eliminate drug dealing, nonstop commercials all over the place, our debt, income inequality, financial crimes, banks, taxes, financial hardships, and many other problems that stem from the money system. </p>

<p>This would work. Its simple, convenient, humane, and sensible all around. </p>

<p>EDIT: We would have to change ownership rules too. Instead of owning everything forever, we would just own it up until we are done using it. Once we are done, it goes back into the economy through an online donation system. (IE. I am moving out of state and don&#39;t want my car anymore. I post it on Ebay and the buyers takes it off my hands by showing me his POW card). This will completely eradicate hoarding and it will recycle our resources back into the economy wherever they are needed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the new system, massive pharma companies would soon realize that there is no point in forcing addiction on a population. It doesn&#39;t change their income in anyway. They, like everyone else, are using the same POW cards as the rest of us. The CEO of a big pharma company would simply be a smart guy who creates an efficient system to help cure people of their illnesses. There&#39;s no profit motive anymore. The only profit motive now is the wealth of the nation which is measured by the quality of our lives as a whole. This wealth comes through the massive gains in efficiency that will result when we dump money. Without money, every big dreamer will come out of their mom&#39;s basement and do great things for our country. Right now, they can&#39;t because they can&#39;t afford it but if they were given freedom to improve the world, they would do so in ways that would be felt in our lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagined this kind of system too. I like it but I do find serious faults that need correcting.  </p>

<p>As far as impacting big pharma, a POW system would eliminate  BP&#39;s ability to squeeze consumers financially while selling dangerous products. Also the FDA couldn&#39;t charge competition-killing prices to do research studies for new or natural cures.  If you&#39;re willing to work or participate in the study, you get to buy anything at the end of the day.   </p>

<p>Patents might be an issue though... but by and large this system would SERIOUSLY put the power in the hands of the consumer. If people don&#39;t buy your crap - you don&#39;t get paid.</p>

<p>And now I see a problem: what if you put in a good faith effort to create a new product you think people would want? Do you deserve your POW for that effort though it resulted in failure? </p>

<p>I like it, and I want to iron out the problems.<br/>
Could be the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your idea would only work with minimum wage type jobs. I actually think it&#39;s a pretty good idea if it could be applied to only minimum wage jobs. </p>

<p>There&#39;s the whole problem of training. When you are running a business for profit you can&#39;t just take any worker off the streets and let them pick their hours and come and go when they please. </p>

<p>So yeah I&#39;m all for developing a new class of low-training, &quot;minimum wage&quot; jobs (like the ones that prisoners do, or jobs that are currently volunteer jobs) that give you access to a rationed consumer system that would allow you to survive on Earth comfortably</p>

<p>I&#39;m not all for a communist utopia that is completely unrealistic when you consider the massive variety of jobs and the vastly varying (often specialized or proprietary) knowledge that is needed to do them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to enivsion the system in a flexibale light. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m an electrician and I want to work for GE but they aren&#39;t hiring because they simply don&#39;t need anymore employees so I try another company and they aren&#39;t hiring. I want to be an electrician badly because I love the job so I work as an independent company and that company grows as I grow. Anyone can simply open a new company but one day, when we are totally used to the new system, we will realize that some jobs are oversaturated and having 1 extra employee is not going to really improve quality of life (ie we have enough electricians in NYC). If it were me, I would just check every so often to see if a position is open but in the meantime, I would go and work on something computer related since I like computers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Example... Let&#39;s say I have a salary job. I work way OVER 40 hours a week as required by my corporate overlords. With your PoW system,   why should I get the same as somebody who only works 40.  I do double the work.  And the corporate overlords won&#39;t like getting the same as their slaves.</p>

<p>You see how quickly this degrades.  Besides we have something similar already. It&#39;s called welfare.  Its supposed to help people without means get jobs and become part of the &quot;Proof of Work&quot; class.  Doing a great job.... <em>eye roll</em></p>

<p>What you&#39;re talking about is not practical.  All systems of government and monetary distribution are prefect in theory.  But they fall flat on their face when humans put them into practice.  Greed being the usual driver there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought of this last year or the year before - never knew there was a name for it - or did you just invent it?  </p>

<p>Thing is though: what about building something new? A new business or researching a new product? R&amp;D type stuff - who watches you to make sure you&#39;re putting in a real 8hrs pursuing your new idea?  </p>

<p>Who watches ANYONE for that matter? I know customers could somehow validate your work in some instances... personal services for example - but what if you work 4hrs one day as a plumber - do you not get access to your POW purchasing power because you couldn&#39;t find enough customers to fill 8hrs? Were you back at office doing paperwork? Who watches you to make sure?  </p>

<p>This is where I ran into problems and just left it. But the rationale is sound imo: if you work and contribute, you deserve as much as anyone else.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not communism in my mind because I don&#39;t see or want a top-down authority structure. There&#39;s no basis in collectivism.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to keep it as humane as possible. If there are too many plumbers, and we don&#39;t need anymore, then a man who dreams to be a plumber is going to have to find a new location or just work another job. For example, a plumber calls around a few local plumbing companies and asks them how they are keeping up with the demand. The plumbing company might say they are holding up just fine or they need more plumbers. If they need more, the unemployed man can join them or start a new company depending on what&#39;s best for society. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t use government to check on our work. We use ourselves to check on our work. Let&#39;s call this job &quot;work checkers&quot;. Private citizens would be the &quot;work checkers&quot;. Let&#39;s say I decide we don&#39;t have enough work checkers in my neighborhood and so I decide to be one. I run a sector of 15 blocks for about 6-8 hours a day (whatever we agree upon.. i think 6 hours is plenty). I then make random inspections of these businesses, run interviews, and write reports. All I am doing is making sure that these people are working. There&#39;s no need to be overly strict but if I see someone screwing around, then I report it to the government who then does an investigation of their own. I do the inpsections but the government revokes the POW card until that man actually works again. If the man displays 2 weeks worth of work, the card is restored and he can consume again. This way we keep everyone legit. I would also drop a commercial on TV saying, &quot;Does your neighborhood have a work checker?&quot; This way, people can become aware of the importance of this job. </p>

<p>So simple. No jail time no nothing. You either work and consume or don&#39;t work and don&#39;t consume. Its humane and very easy to operate in reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What people don&#39;t understand is that EVERYONE thinks the world is full of disgusting people and they are the one of the good ones. How is that? Why is it that everyone things they are good people but the world is full of horrible monsters? </p>

<p>This is a flaw in thinking. The world and people innately want to be good but they are pitted against all odds of making it in a corrupt system designed by the dark hearts of very evil men. You make a system that works and the 99% will follow gladly. They won&#39;t try to game the system because there is no reason to game the system when it gives you all that you need to survive and thrive. Desperation causes good people to do very bad things and the system we have now has left most of the country in a desperate position and still most people refuse to break any laws which is great but some people naturally crack up and become career criminals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No man... Peer pressure has nothing to do with government or laws. If you are a man and wear a dress in public, your friends will make fun of you. Your friends are NOT thought police. Have you heard of the term &quot;social norm&quot;. The reason your friends will make fun of you in a dress is because you are breaking a social norm. A social norm is basically an agreed upon norm that we all agree on and this changes by the day. Today, we consider it odd for a man to wear a dress and so people simply follow the social norm. </p>

<p>When a business or country struggles, we don&#39;t oppress people to solve it. We dig into the problem and fix it at the root. That is the whole point of this post. My only concern is that you and all the people in America have a good life where they can live and enjoy instead of the economic suffering many Americans feel today. </p>

<p>If I personally was the president, I would lift oppressive systems like our prison system and upgrade them to something that works (IE instead of prisons, we can have rehab facilities but they have to be humane). Oppression is TOTAL FAIL. I am the first to agree this. I am looking to liberate you. I want you to have an easy life. Work ANY job you want for 6 hour, 5 days a week and consume as needed. The most complicated problems have the simplest solutions and this is a truly simple solution. The only hard part is growing enough balls to try something new. I understand humans are habitual creatures and like to stick to things they are familiar with but what if this system actually improves all of our quality of life and eliminates corruption? It seems like it would to me. That is my only aim. We are all equal. Nobody is above the other even if that&#39;s not what it seems to be but in truth, we are all useful citizens and the mentally/physically handicapped people who can&#39;t work get a free pass while we work on a cure. Just think it over. All great truth begins as blasphemy. </p>

<p>Wasnt that the whole point originally, in the grand scheme of the visionaries  that formulated the governing principles  (of the US) - What an individual does is unimportant until it encroaches upon anothers life/liberty/pursuit of happiness. Disputes between neighbors handled by towns, disputes between towns handled by counties, between counties handled by state, between states handled by fed - fed handles international issues via state representatives. </p>

<p>When power becomes consolidated at the top, very few need to be bribed, harassed, threatened, tortured, blackmailed, etc and it pretty much guarantees that everything will be controlled (often behind the curtain) by those with money, power, influence, and ruthless psychotics.</p>

<p>The pyramid needs to be flipped back over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those jobs will either be taken by people who don&#39;t mind the work or the upper 5% of the population. What I mean by upper 5% is the people who realize the importance of a functioning society and feel a &quot;call of duty&quot; to their society. Once the first 6 months pass by and people see how much easier life is, they would gladly work. First they will follow their passion and second they will fill vacant positions as needed. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you advice.  These systems are good when you have small groups of fiercely altruistic people.  But you need a system that will discourage &#39;hangers on&#39;.  If you don&#39;t, your community will swell to about 500 people, then collapse, as people come for the free beer, until you have too many people meditating for their &#39;work cards&#39;, and too few people shoveling the shit that is being created.</p>

<p>I only have one anecdotal &#39;data point&#39; for this one.  I knew a person who was raised &quot;on a commune&quot; in rural Northern California, and various members in his family frequently lived in/out of that type of society.  The quote that I remember is that it was tough to have enough people in the commune to pay for a doctor, while not attracting a bunch of people who wouldn&#39;t produce as much as they consumed.</p>
