<p>I have found that stating the name of the logical fallacy being used is one of the most effective tactics for arguing on this sub. Quote the text and show how they are using ad hominem, strawman, false authority,  etc. Even if they continue, others will be able to see the invalidity of their arguments.</p>

<p>Just a tip that works for me. What works for you?</p>

<p>Except you state &quot;Even if they continue, others will be able to see the invalidity of their arguments,&quot; which seemingly claims that seeing a logical fallacy pointed out will indicate that an argument is invalid.</p>

<p>Also, should I point out your anti-gay post earlier was using the &quot;Slippery Slope&quot; fallacy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying &quot;disregard anything drawn from a logical fallacy, except for my logical fallacy&quot;? </p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve never taken a an actual logic course. Just because a conclusion is reached through fallacious argumentation does not mean that the conclusion is inherently false. It just means the method of argumentation is not valid, sound, strong, cogent or whatever. </p>

<p>What you should do is analyze the argument in light of the fallacy and consider whether the argument can be made without fallacy.. Not scream &quot;LOGICAL FALLACY!!!!!!&quot; and then move on without actually considering that the conclusion may be true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument of the following form:</p>

<p>If an argument is fallacious then the conclusion is false.
The argument is fallacious.
Therefore the conclusion is false.</p>

<p>Is valid but it is not sound. However, this is true in a trivial sense. The whole point of providing arguments is to either prove a proposition or show strong support for a proposition that serves as a conclusion.  When an argument is fallacious the conclusion might be true, but only incidentally. That is not really helpful when exchanging arguments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s only slightly better than the minor misspelling or grammar gotcha. Who knew that using the wrong your invalidated you&#39;re* entire argument.</p>

<p>Simply calling out the fallacy or grammar error without addressing their statement is useless. Everyone else that comes across it without any knowledge on the comment content will have to choose who to believe without much to go on. </p>

<p>For that reason I believe it&#39;s important to address why their statement is wrong along with a note at the bottom regarding their use of a fallacy or grammar correction. </p>

<p>Just remember there&#39;s all different types of people online from varying countries, races, beliefs, languages, education levels etc. So while someone&#39;s comment may be obvious bullshit to you, it may not be to others. </p>

<p>For this reason I believe it&#39;s important to &quot;spell out&quot; why it&#39;s wrong instead of everyone just down voting it and moving on.</p>

<p>Whenever I see a heavily downvoted comment with no replies pertaining to something I&#39;m not familiar with I always wonder if what they said is true and just not popular opinion or false.  It makes it a lot easier to decide when someone responds explaining why it&#39;s wrong and provides sources. </p>

<p>It also helps invalidate any claim of censorship by the op. I think reddit would be much better if you had to leave a comment explaining why if you down vote someone.</p>

<p>This turned into a rambling rant. My apologizes.</p>

<p>(by logical I mean what instinctual aspect is this triggering to allow said thought process)</p>

<p>Generally i can find something agreeable within that &quot;logic&quot;. Though i like to give some form of counter, focused on a perspective change.

<p>You&#39;re welcome.  I think that a lot of folks get tired of seeing the names of fallacies thrown around incorrectly and maybe they&#39;re being overly harsh.  There&#39;s the whole fallacy fallacy thing as well.</p>

<p>It might be worthwhile to add discourse do&#39;s and don&#39;ts and expand your OP if you feel like it.  It&#39;s not necessary, of course, but it would be kind of cool to see a post about understanding logical fallacies, critical thinking, and so on sit on the front page for a while.</p>

<p>Absolutely.  I inadvertently end up sharing a lot information that, when all put together, could probably pinpoint my location, job, relationship status and more.  It&#39;s the main reason I end up purging my account every few months.</p>

<p>I&#39;m much more careful when using other platforms, but getting into in depth discussions tends to bring out some personal information.   Much of the hacking that takes place anymore is conducted via social engineering and it&#39;s a shame that more people aren&#39;t aware of that.  Great post man.</p>

<p>This is something I picked up early, fortunately.  Could you imagine being 13-14 right now?  Most of these children will have their entire lives on the internet.

<p>They also had a good analogy about not teaching kids how to use the internet and how that exposed them to all sorts of dangers. I agree with that too.</p>

<p>no one does this to me on reddit much (yet) but def on other sites</p>

<p>the hivemind seems to be so strong on reddit for some reason like it doesn&#39;t matter much how you argue</p>

<p>for example, that post that showed the oldest comments are strongly correlated with having the most points. and/or the top posts will just keep getting more and more points as well.</p>

<p>a lot of people use reddit and just up vote on the first things they see but they aren&#39;t aware that the content is sorted by newest or top i guess</p>

<p>okay i&#39;m rambling idk</p>

<p>I don&#39;t use Reddit much for porn, but it&#39;s nice to see a beautiful woman on the front page.  I&#39;ve subbed to some generic subreddits to liven up my front page and don&#39;t feel like creating a bunch of different accounts to hide boobs.  So I&#39;m right there with you.</p>

<p>Great question.  First and most importantly, someone (a &quot;race realist&quot;) who would make an argument such as the one you listed can be made to look foolish without digging through their post history.  Someone making an argument like that is basically required to misinterpret data in order to arrive at their conclusion.  Basically, you can still make them look foolish if you&#39;re familiar enough with the subject.</p>

<p>However, in regards to your &quot;concern troll&quot; examples...  that&#39;s where it gets tricky.  I would RES tag them if I suspected and, especially in the case of the &quot;Liberal T_D poster, would just ask them basic questions.  I&#39;d be intrigued and want to know how they were dealing with the cognitive dissonance caused by supporting Mike &quot;Dominion Theology&quot; Pence if they were really a Liberal.  Like the first example, I&#39;d imagine just asking good faith questions would be enough to make them slip up.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve just set a rule for myself.  If I can&#39;t win an argument, trying to discredit a user with their post history isn&#39;t going to change that.  I need to spend more time understanding the subject if a shill/ideologue can successfully argue a position better than I can.  I also must accept that there&#39;s a possibility that they are right and I could be wrong.</p>

<p>I was accused of this a few days ago... for agreeing with an unpopular opinion.  Do whatever you feel you should, but always be mindful that you could be wrong.   I&#39;ve made it a rule that I won&#39;t ignore someone&#39;s points made in a post and then attempt to discredit them.  I&#39;m tired of intellectually dishonest people getting away with their poss poor arguments and untenable positions.  I refuse, however, to be a hypocrite or someone with inconsistent beliefs.  It certainly makes it harder for myself sometimes, but it&#39;s worth it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also especially true for the alt-right shills. Like those fresh accounts that almost only post in <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> and one or two other subreddits. </p>

<p>It is definitely exhausting having to go point by point and address certain points and rhetoric as well as taking the time to read studies and find studies that run counter to them.  That&#39;s just part of it, to me.  It&#39;s a time consuming price to pay to remain intellectually honest, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been called a shill many times in this subreddit and every time it happened, those that were addressing me as such couldn&#39;t and/or wouldn&#39;t actually address my post and the points made within.  That strikes me as intellectually weak and dishonest and it screams &quot;I can&#39;t address your argument so I&#39;ll attack you, personally, instead&quot;.  It&#39;s literally fallacious reasoning, but those people still didn&#39;t care.  My fear of becoming like that is the biggest reason that I avoid the whole &quot;post history&quot; thing anyway.</p>

<p>The whole point in engaging in discourse, especially with those you disagree with, should be to learn and to form a more robust opinion.  I mean, I&#39;d rather be intellectually honest and consistent than &quot;right all of the time&quot;.  Although I have been guilty of exactly what you describe, don&#39;t get me wrong.</p>

<p>I understand that, but surely that will eventually cause cognitive dissonance and that&#39;s not something that you can ignore, at least if you&#39;re honest with yourself.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt that your observations are correct when it comes to some people, but surely that&#39;s an unsustainable way forward unless they are just deluding themselves.  Also, get your &quot;tide&quot; to avoid &quot;rolling&quot; over your neighbors to the north who bleed orange, please!</p>

<p>How is discussing ways to improve discourse in this sub &quot;retarded&quot;?  I think that OP should have went with &quot;helpful and good faith rhetoric tips&quot; route instead of focusing on logical fallacies, but the discussion generated in the comments has been pretty great.  </p>

<p>Honestly, your post is a great example of why the discourse in this subreddit is in dire straights.  You personally attack OP and attribute motives to them without having the slightest clue and you throw around words that you don&#39;t seem to know the meaning to.  Why not contribute to the thread by pointing out what, exactly, you take issue with?  In what way is a thread discussing good faith rhetoric make you think &quot;shill echo chamber&quot;?  In what way is understanding critical thinking brain washing?  I have so many questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to throw your own suggestion back in your face:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the fallacy fallacy
You presumed that because a claim has been poorly argued, or a fallacy has been made, that the claim itself must be wrong.
It is entirely possible to make a claim that is false yet argue with logical coherency for that claim, just as it is possible to make a claim that is true and justify it with various fallacies and poor arguments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have found that calling out a fallacy to counter the argument is the least productive thing to do. I mean, I enjoy doing it... A lot... But it doesn&#39;t work. I dunno, maybe it does to the people who read it but don&#39;t comment. Doxing is by far the best method to shut down a troll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t know if this&#39;ll work because there&#39;s also the &quot;fallacy from fallacy&quot; fallacy. </p>

<p>also i don&#39;t really argue a lot. and i usually give up because there&#39;s a ton of people out there, esp on the topic of vaccines and such, who can&#39;t take any sort of alternative viewpoint. (and it&#39;s weird because it became a hot button issue randomly like 4 years ago and i really just feel like all of a sudden people were fuming at the mouth with hatred for &quot;anti vaxxers&quot;. but i don&#39;t remember any sort of particular event that happened or anything, yknow?)</p>

<p>but one time i got an arrow in cmv on a vaccine topic. i just tried to use sources and rationally explain it i guess.</p>

<p>anyways i got side tracked but basically i guess i think the hivemind is just too strong and i pretty much always try to be as &quot;levelheaded&quot; as possible and such or whatever. but whoever i&#39;m arguing with usually &quot;wins&quot; but making up some slanderous statement about me that is obviously false. and then they resort to name calling and i guess people watching think that you&#39;re correct if you have the most clever personal insult.</p>

<p>i mean that&#39;s happened a lot of the time as well, not every time.</p>

<p>so yeah. idek. i just usually give up and because they had the last word they think they &quot;won&quot;. but idc because i don&#39;t have a strong stance on anything and am not even looking to win arguments online but just to have discussions.</p>

<p>like what sort of topics should we be arguing about that we know for certain the general public is wrong about?</p>

<p>The whole point in engaging in discourse, especially with those you disagree with, should be to learn and to form a more robust opinion.  I mean, I&#39;d rather be intellectually honest and consistent than &quot;right all of the time&quot;.  Although I have been guilty of exactly what you describe, don&#39;t get me wrong.</p>

<p>This is also why so many people get so upset when talking about serious topics...they don&#39;t care about the right answer, they just want to be right.</p>

<p>I understand that, but surely that will eventually cause cognitive dissonance and that&#39;s not something that you can ignore, at least if you&#39;re honest with yourself.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt that your observations are correct when it comes to some people, but surely that&#39;s an unsustainable way forward unless they are just deluding themselves.  Also, get your &quot;tide&quot; to avoid &quot;rolling&quot; over your neighbors to the north who bleed orange, please!</p>

<p>Absolutely.  I inadvertently end up sharing a lot information that, when all put together, could probably pinpoint my location, job, relationship status and more.  It&#39;s the main reason I end up purging my account every few months.</p>

<p>I&#39;m much more careful when using other platforms, but getting into in depth discussions tends to bring out some personal information.   Much of the hacking that takes place anymore is conducted via social engineering and it&#39;s a shame that more people aren&#39;t aware of that.  Great post man.</p>
