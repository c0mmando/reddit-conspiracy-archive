<p>There is this narrative I find overarching in mainstream media that hard work will be rewarded. However, anyone who spends even an afternoon on this sub can see that hard work is not meant to pay off in the financial realm at least. Is this purposeful?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just saying they&#39;re are jobs that are harder than driving all day, I do agree with you that it&#39;s a hard job. Most drivers work insane hours too. It&#39;s also takes more energy than you think to focus on the road all day maintaining several tons going 70 mph. I was a driver during summers in college, so I know a little bit about it. </p>

<p>I agree with you that there are many people working hard for no reason, nothing to benefit society or move us forward culturally or scientifically. The few that do often have hooks in their back from executive producers or financial institutions. Most people are locked up in the corporate 9-5 spinning their wheels supporting/migrating existing businesses. Some work on &#39;new&#39; things, but usually these are just copy cats of old things to a large extent, lacking originality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How will these automated devices be manufactured if someone doesn&#39;t work? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t misunderstand me.. i am not fan of the current system wherein people are more or less forced to work for others, have their profits stolen and then told if they do not work within that system they are useless or a criminal. I define work as anything one has to do to provide for themselves and family.</p>

<p>I think what you say will happen and it will really equal more control over people&#39;s lives, not less. Then, as far as the PTB are concerned, they no longer need so many masses of taxed slaves. Your worth, in whatever form they define it, will directly tie to your right to even continue to live.</p>

<p>But, yes, we should re-examine what kind of hard work is really commendable. We should be able to provide for ourselves and our families like free human beings - where our own labours Always = our own profits. They don&#39;t even have to be monetary profits. Growing your own food and bypassing part of that system is one example. They intend to make doing that very difficult.</p>

<p>My very unscientific life study has found that people are wealthy either due to hard work, luck, and family.</p>

<p>If people work more and get paid less, then they have to work more to get the same &quot;stuff&quot; others have.

<blockquote>
<p>But the 8-hour workday is too profitable for big business, not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours (the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours) but because it makes for such a purchase-happy public. Keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience, gratification, and any other relief they can buy. It keeps them watching television, and its commercials. <strong>It keeps them unambitious outside of work.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine. In regard to your question about whether it&#39;s purposeful, to the extent that it <em>is</em> intentional, I think that this inertia is the primary goal.</p>

<p><a href="https://orionmagazine.org/article/a-fistful-of-time/">Finding Time</a></p>

<p>Slowness as an Act of Resistance</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...but lost in the list is the language to argue that we are not machines and our lives include all sorts of subtleties — epiphanies, alliances, associations, meanings, purposes, pleasures — that engineers cannot design, factories cannot build, computers cannot measure, and marketers will not sell. What we cannot describe vanishes into the ether, and so what begins as a problem of language ends as one of the broadest tragedies of our lives.</p>

<p>This is most manifest in the life of the suburban commuter who weekly spends a dozen or more hours on the road between the putative dream house and the workplace, caught in the gridlock of tens of thousands likewise trying to move from the residential-warehousing periphery to the economically productive inner rings. Space is quantifiable and we are constantly taught to covet it (though leisure is advertised too — mostly as vacation packages). You can own those two thousand square feet including two-car garage, and it is literally real, the real in real estate. But to have this space you give up time, the time that you might be spending with the kids who are housed in the image of domestic tranquility but not actually particularly well nurtured by their absentee parents, or time spent immersed in community life or making things with your own hands or doing nothing at all — a lost art. You give up time, and you often give up the far more than two thousand square feet that you don’t own but get to enjoy when you live in, say, a rented apartment in a neighborhood full of amenities nobody advertised to you, because you don’t have to buy the public pool or playground that your kids don’t need to be driven to. The language of real-estate ownership is loud, clear, and drilled into us daily; the language of public life and leisure time is rarer and more complex.</p>

<p>People elsewhere are better at this language. At a certain fork in the road of automatization, Europeans chose to have more time, and they work far less than we do and get much longer vacations. We chose to have more stuff, the stuff sold to us through those beckoning adjectives — bigger, better, faster: Jet Skis, extra cars, second homes, motor homes, towering slab TVs, if not the time to enjoy them or to enjoy less commodified pleasures. These may be the wages of inarticulateness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was very well articulated. Thank you for your input! I was recently in Europe &amp; got to see them enjoy way more leisure time than we ever do in the US. That experience, plus talking to a Liberian woman who has lived in the States for some time opened my eyes that this work until you&#39;re dead mentality isn&#39;t naturally shared by all humans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the narrative serves to dissuade people from thinking that they can just take how they want.</p>

<p>It made sense to have it however, as without it, they would have run the risk of roving bands of barbarians forming.</p>

<p>The &quot;hard work&quot; narrative is going to have to stop when jobs become more automated however. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I don&#39;t see the point of having people spending their lives &quot;running the infrastructure&quot; when it will be automated before we know it. However, I see, even in this thread, people who feel like you don&#39;t deserve things unless you&#39;ve &quot;worked&quot; for it. That seems like a slippery slope </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a slippery slope indeed. I believe it&#39;s important that the people who feel that way are able to adapt to the coming automation.</p>

<p>During the previous U.S. election it really showed how people are unprepared for it, and how the politicians manipulate the public at large. They&#39;d rather blame the government, and other countries rather than prepare the population to adopt a new economic system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! It&#39;s frightening to think about how many people are in despair and don&#39;t even know it yet. I read somewhere that big corporations are eager to adopt the &quot;Uber&quot; model workforce where the &quot;minimum wage&quot; won&#39;t even matter anymore. </p>
