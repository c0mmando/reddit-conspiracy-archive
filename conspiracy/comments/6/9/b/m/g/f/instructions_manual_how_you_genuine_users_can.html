       This guide will hopefully be of assistence to you all.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy has been recently targeted by counter-intelligence once again.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all here's some background info on what kind of system you're faceing:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice
       </a>
       (Warning: The wikipedia article might be compromised soon if it isn't already)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Introduction:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       You've experienced attempts of bringing the "Israel vs Palestine" political conflict in here to falsely portrait
r/conspiracy as "anti-semitic" and now you face attempts to portrait this subreddit as "inciting violence/hatespeech",
other topics may follow soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Their Goal
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Discredit r/conspiracy for now. (It will be shut down ultimately one day, but there is still time.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Disrupting informative/constructive discussions
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Spreading false information / "fake news"
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        General strategies/information
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         If a user is suspicious to you, check their profile and look at what they've posted in the past.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They might try to obscure their agenda by posting both pro- and anti- conspiracy/political topics.
e.g. One post is Pro-Clinton the other is Pro-Trump, look out for such things.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Don't call anybody out openly / insult them (Rule 10), this will otherwise lead to users accusing each other of being "shills" constantly and disrupting any constructive discussion.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Types of "Shills"/Agent provocateurs
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Spammers
         </strong>
         : They are posting the same content repeatedly.
        </p>
        <p>
         Counter: Report for spam; Downvote.
        </p>
        <p>
         Examples: "SELF EXPLANATORY SELF EXPLANATORY SELF EXPLANATORY SELF EXPLANATORY"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Inciters/"Baiters"
         </strong>
         : These try to get you to speak out your inner desires/emotions against TPTB and might use citations of you against this subreddit or yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
         Counter: Don't respond; Think twice about what you are answering; Downvote.
        </p>
        <p>
         Examples:
        </p>
        <pre><code>         "That's stuff that only a typical (insert political preference of choice) voter would say."

         "Political system (X) works, history has proven it, you are so backwards."

         "All guns should be banned (mimimimi)."

         "We are so much smarter than you."

         "Government (X) are the good guys."
</code></pre>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Trolls/"Insulters"
         </strong>
         : These either borderline insult-question your arguments/narritive or insult you right away.
        </p>
        <p>
         Counter: IGNORE; Don't respond; Definitely downvote.
        </p>
        <p>
         Examples:
        </p>
        <pre><code>        "(Insert religious/non-religious preference of choice) are backwards/stupid."

        "You're not very smart, aren't you."

        "You @$$#0(â‚¬ !!!"

         :
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These "people"/bots are tasked to collect infos,
so that their superiors can assess how much this subreddit/users actually know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some use reverse psychology to get whatever infos they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       This work is also done by automated systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Counter: 
                Encourage them to use the search function;
      </p>
      <pre><code>           Write personal messages and screenshot them, so what they write to you can't be postprocess-edited; 
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Be careful with downvotes some questions are legit/genuine new users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples:
      </p>
      <pre><code>             "What's the TOP news about pizzagate ?"

             - Questions about personal information such as workplace,family,name,country,language etc.

       Since most of them are from the Americas, 
they are usually online after work-hours e.g. 5/6 p.m. (17/18 o'Clock) and on general break time e.g. 12 o'Clock , American Timezones.

        <p>
         MOST of them are in for Financial gain / payment -- The US. Economy is really in a bad shape, there are plenty people who do anything for fiat US. Dollars.

         They expect some kind of "greater reward" / promotion

       Very good post. I'd been thinking of writing up a similar one. I don't personally like to use the term "shill", even in the abstract, because I think a lot of the people posting and commenting this type of shit are doing it for reasons other than money. If you can't prove they're getting paid, and 99% of the time you can't, it makes it a weaker argument. Yes, some of them are getting paid, but our strategy should be the same. I prefer the term
       <em>
        disruptor
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       On the baiter/insulter types, the best thing to do is downvote, report, and move on. What often happens is a good user will get baited into responding with an insult or an attack, and then the disruptor reports them. We as mods then remove the good user's response if it does indeed break the rules, and possibly give them a warning or in repeated cases a ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not ideal, and not what we want to do as mods. We want the discussion here to be as free as possible, but when good users play into the disruptors' games and devolve into insults, we all lose. I understand getting heated and responding in kind, but we have to realize that's exactly what they want.

       Given the fact that you know these 'disruptors' exist, what are you mods doing to prevent this place by being overrun by these people?

       This is an instruction manual on how to shut people up that criticize Is real.  You guys just don't give up do you?  The Thought Police have no jurisdiction here.  This is r/conspiracy and if questioning Is rael is what makes me anti -se mi tic then I'll gladly be labeled as such.  That label has lost its power.  Everyday there are countless submissions just like this and people see right through it.

       Just saw a alt-right poster get exposed as a Russian the other night on here. Linked to his Twitter, forgot to change the language from Russian to English. Yeah, we know who the real shills are. Fuck outta here.

       Have you any (real) evidence to back up your claim ?
(non-photoshopped) Screenshots for example.

       Is "Russian" a codeword for individuals who disagree with your narrative.
