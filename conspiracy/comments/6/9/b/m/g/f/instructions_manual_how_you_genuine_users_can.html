        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This guide will hopefully be of assistence to you all.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy has been recently targeted by counter-intelligence once again.</p>

<p>First of all here&#39;s some background info on what kind of system you&#39;re faceing: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice</a>
(Warning: The wikipedia article might be compromised soon if it isn&#39;t already)</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>

<p>You&#39;ve experienced attempts of bringing the &quot;Israel vs Palestine&quot; political conflict in here to falsely portrait
r/conspiracy as &quot;anti-semitic&quot; and now you face attempts to portrait this subreddit as &quot;inciting violence/hatespeech&quot;,
other topics may follow soon.</p>

<p><strong>Their Goal</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Discredit r/conspiracy for now. (It will be shut down ultimately one day, but there is still time.)</p></li>
<li><p>Disrupting informative/constructive discussions</p></li>
<li><p>Spreading false information / &quot;fake news&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General strategies/information</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If a user is suspicious to you, check their profile and look at what they&#39;ve posted in the past.</p></li>
<li><p>They might try to obscure their agenda by posting both pro- and anti- conspiracy/political topics.
e.g. One post is Pro-Clinton the other is Pro-Trump, look out for such things.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t call anybody out openly / insult them (Rule 10), this will otherwise lead to users accusing each other of being &quot;shills&quot; constantly and disrupting any constructive discussion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Types of &quot;Shills&quot;/Agent provocateurs</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Spammers</strong>: They are posting the same content repeatedly.</p>

<p>Counter: Report for spam; Downvote.</p>

<p>Examples: &quot;SELF EXPLANATORY SELF EXPLANATORY SELF EXPLANATORY SELF EXPLANATORY&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inciters/&quot;Baiters&quot;</strong>: These try to get you to speak out your inner desires/emotions against TPTB and might use citations of you against this subreddit or yourself. </p>

<p>Counter: Don&#39;t respond; Think twice about what you are answering; Downvote.          </p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>         &quot;That&#39;s stuff that only a typical (insert political preference of choice) voter would say.&quot;

         &quot;Political system (X) works, history has proven it, you are so backwards.&quot;

         &quot;All guns should be banned (mimimimi).&quot;

         &quot;We are so much smarter than you.&quot;

         &quot;Government (X) are the good guys.&quot;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Trolls/&quot;Insulters&quot;</strong>: These either borderline insult-question your arguments/narritive or insult you right away. </p>

<p>Counter: IGNORE; Don&#39;t respond; Definitely downvote.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>        &quot;(Insert religious/non-religious preference of choice) are backwards/stupid.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re not very smart, aren&#39;t you.&quot;

        &quot;You @$$#0(â‚¬ !!!&quot;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Questioners&quot;/Information collectors</strong>: </p></li>
</ul>

<p>These &quot;people&quot;/bots are tasked to collect infos,
so that their superiors can assess how much this subreddit/users actually know. </p>

<p>Some use reverse psychology to get whatever infos they want.</p>

<p>This work is also done by automated systems.</p>

<p>Counter: 
                Encourage them to use the search function; </p>

<pre><code>           Write personal messages and screenshot them, so what they write to you can&#39;t be postprocess-edited; 
</code></pre>

<p>Be careful with downvotes some questions are legit/genuine new users.</p>

<p>Examples: </p>

<pre><code>             &quot;What&#39;s the TOP news about pizzagate ?&quot;

             - Questions about personal information such as workplace,family,name,country,language etc.
</code></pre>

<p>--Sidenote: The next ones are a very special case and actually go further than reddit.--</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>(Supervising intelligence officers)</strong>: </li>
</ul>

<p>-Organizing the &quot;Agent Provocateurs&quot; in the background</p>

<p>-Recruiting agent provocateurs &amp; informants in real life.</p>

<p>-<strong>PROFILING/LISTING USERS !</strong></p>

<p>-Assessing information for their next intelligence briefing (real life) </p>

<p>Counter: If your expertise is sufficient to recognise them, you should already know what&#39;s to do.</p>

<p>Note: They are <strong>extremely</strong> rare, but they <strong>do</strong> exist. They rarely/<strong>if ever</strong> use an standard reddit account themselves, they usually have &quot;other&quot; channels.</p>

<p>--Endnote: Some of the agent provocateurs/&quot;Shills&quot; switch through these different personalities and/or combine them.--</p>

<p><strong>Timeframe</strong>:</p>

<p>Since most of them are from the Americas, 
they are usually online after work-hours e.g. 5/6 p.m. (17/18 o&#39;Clock) and on general break time e.g. 12 o&#39;Clock , American Timezones.</p>

<p>Some might appear online at random times too.</p>

<p>This online-conflict is mainly aimed towards the people of the USA.</p>

<p><strong>Their basic platforms:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Phone Users</p></li>
<li><p>PC Users</p></li>
<li><p>Automated response networks / Servers</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why they do it:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>MOST of them are in for Financial gain / payment -- The US. Economy is really in a bad shape, there are plenty people who do anything for fiat US. Dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>Their own political agenda</p></li>
<li><p>They expect some kind of &quot;greater reward&quot; / promotion </p>

<p>The list goes on.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Things that their &quot;employers&quot; did NOT tell them:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The fiat money they receive is ultimately worthless since the Banks can shut down any account, the IRS can deduct/steal anything from any account.
Basically they work gladly for the same people that enslave them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IF</strong>/when (un-Civil)War breaks out/is staged, 
these &quot;useful-idiots&quot; and their families will be deported into the same FEMA camps as the rest of Americans who are resisting the system now. </p></li>
<li><p>TPTB wants <strong>everybody</strong> exept themselves under control/enslavement, just because they are working for their system now, isn&#39;t a guarantee they will also do so in the future.
(This is also true for the agents of the intelligence communities unless they are &quot;&quot;&quot;Family&quot;&quot;&quot;.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thank <strong>you</strong> for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good post. I&#39;d been thinking of writing up a similar one. I don&#39;t personally like to use the term &quot;shill&quot;, even in the abstract, because I think a lot of the people posting and commenting this type of shit are doing it for reasons other than money. If you can&#39;t prove they&#39;re getting paid, and 99% of the time you can&#39;t, it makes it a weaker argument. Yes, some of them are getting paid, but our strategy should be the same. I prefer the term <em>disruptor</em>. </p>

<p>On the baiter/insulter types, the best thing to do is downvote, report, and move on. What often happens is a good user will get baited into responding with an insult or an attack, and then the disruptor reports them. We as mods then remove the good user&#39;s response if it does indeed break the rules, and possibly give them a warning or in repeated cases a ban. </p>

<p>This is not ideal, and not what we want to do as mods. We want the discussion here to be as free as possible, but when good users play into the disruptors&#39; games and devolve into insults, we all lose. I understand getting heated and responding in kind, but we have to realize that&#39;s exactly what they want. </p>
