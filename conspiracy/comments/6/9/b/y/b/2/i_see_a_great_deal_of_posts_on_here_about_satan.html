       Since you asked, I grew up in the midwest with the idea that "gee, I hope I get my driver's license before the world ends". My grandparents walked the walk, fed me full of red meat and salt, spent an hour every morning reading the Bible to each other and praying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, to hear my single mom, accomplished musician on the 6 and 12-string guitar, flute, harp, percussion (and I wish I had any sense of rhythm) talking about burning her Moody Blue and Stones albums in the 1980s sounds like any poster to this sub today. There was nothing more evil to her than the Clintons and she would never hesitate to redpill you on the evil that we all live among.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, my beautiful blonde momma died at the age of 54. She was at the peak of her life until she faced an extended losing battle with brain cancer. I spread her ashes in the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, though all this, I must always be the "smartest person in the room", continuously attempt to blue-pill my "ignorant" family for decades. Me, as the educated, self-made success story, clearly had all the answers...until you "grow-up" and realize you don't. The further I go in my journey the amount of knowledge I think I have decreases. I'm now somewhere between wondering how I dress myself in the morning and protecting certain things from certain threats with expert accuracy. Life is an odd place to live.

       Thank you. My grandfather always told me "a man is nothing without his word" and those are the words I've always lived by and instill now into my children.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tell them to think about why you're putting your words out there. Are you trying to build something or tear something down? What seeds are you sowing? Are you speaking sincerely? Most importantly, are you speaking truthfully?
      </p>
      <p>
       Men live and die by their words every day; never discount the power of speech.

       have you seen all the threads out there about how trump is an agent of russia?  when do you think putin will order trump to nuke dc?  why is it taking so long, do you think trump is fighting back against putins control or is he fully complicit and just lulling people into a false sense of security so its more jarring and psychologically damaging when he reveals he's a manchurian candidate?

       That is the most important point. What I believe doesn't matter one whit. Other people are going to act as if it does, sticking my fingers in my ears will not stop them from doing what the do in service to this idea.

       Your logic is infallible. Next thing I know you'll be telling me we should worship Baal and sacrifice children to the true God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even IF Satan is real, and everything written in the Bible is true, YHWH (Jesus' Father) is an asshole who I refuse to follow. He created "Satan". He gave humans free will,
       <em>
        but Lucifer does not have free will
       </em>
       . Do you know what that means?
       <strong>
        It means Lucifer does God's will!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily for us, YHWH doesn't appear to be real, and neither does Lucifer. It must be nice to think it will all be okay when we die, that weak solace for being forced into existence by a cruel creator.

       Do you understand that I just condemned myself to your hell, should it exist?

       If you're sinning against people, then yes, you are condemned. It's not the next life you should be worried about though. Hell awaits us in this one. Sins have repercussions. Don't believe me? You will.... you will.
