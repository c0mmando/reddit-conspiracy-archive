       Things only reverted to how they were under Obama's 8 years. The Obama administration changed things from one agency to another in January 2017, the recent fake news explosion about this whole thing was simply changing it back undoing what Obama did as one of his many last attempts at setting landmines for the Trump administration that the media could blow up into scandals that set the narrative.

       That doesn't change the fact that the rules should have been in place. When telecom first started, there were pen register laws put in place to protect privacy. As communication technology expanded, they added strict wiretap laws. In this recent spike of technological development, that all went out the window, when what should have happened was development of laws and guidelines similar to telecom. You are treating this as a partisan issue which is short sighted. Put party politics aside, this is a constitutional issue. The only argument the ISP's had to reverse the rule was, "Google and Facebook do it, so we should be able to also". That is not a good reason. If you think this was a victory, go ahead and reply with all your usernames and passwords.

       I think it will now be legal for them to use without a warrant. So the ISP ruling means fewer barriers for law enforcement.

       I'm pretty sure they are already doing this. I saw a forensic investigation of a person's data, and it was complete. Every click, text, call, everything....now this was with a warrant...but I know others have access as well.

       I'm not sure you're using plausible deniability by it's proper definition.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  To make buying internet histories legal might make them fair game to be purchased and potentially investigated by law or Intel agencies, and therefore potentially anyone who fits a certain profile could become a legitimate target of investigation.  It's basically a way to legitimize what they want, not deny it.  Plausible Deniability would be more like when the head of a given Intel agency says something like "Oh look, someone dropped an envelope full of bad guys internet histories on my desk and I have no idea where they came from." Because they never gave anybody direct orders, or at least it can't be proven direct orders were given, to obtain said histories.  So whether or not he actually knows who did it, be it a kind hacker or a rogue element of his own team, he has plausible deniability about any laws that may or may not have been broken while obtaining​ the histories.  President Reagan had plausible deniability, at least to some extent, about Ollie North and the Iran-Contra affair.  What's going on here is something closer to Marshall Law, when laws are enacted and or circumvented in order to give legitimacy to activities by government, state or military powers that were previously illegal.

       That's pretty much what I meant haha. I knew "plausible deniability" wasn't exactly right, but was enough so that you knew what I meant. Like they say: if you want the right answer on the Internet say something wrong and someone will correct you. So thanks! Also I think you mean "martial law"?

       The government gives less of a shit about what you're doing online than your average advertiser. That's pure truth for 99.8% of Americans. It's like, sure the NSA records everything they can easily record, but if you deliberately hired perverts to handle security at all airports, would you be all that shocked if the rate of frisking went up to 100%? In the end they hamstring their ability to do too much of any use with the bulk data, either, like politically useful analytics - because nobody involved wants anyone else to end up benefiting from the results of the CIA's actions instead of them because a project reached completion after their side lost control of the presidency or such.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect some big time bulk data buying from various Super PACs and various political organizations, though. The fake news fight is about to get
       <em>
        real

       personal.

       I don't think "they" are going to buy much of anything, at least not in the conventional sense.  It'll be more like any Telecom or ad companies that buy your history and don't snitch on anyone who fits a certain profile will be assured a bankruptcy and maybe even some Rico type aiding and abetting charges.

       To answer the OP question, it's because they still need stuff to stick in court.  If I'm not mistaken, until now, the govt could collect data, but only store it, not investigate it unless they had due cause.  Depending on how the law is written and interpreted now, the govt won't be able to buy your history to investigate you without just cause.  It should be that only corporations can buy it and use it for marketing.  However, once corporations get ahold of a bunch of internet histories and have analyzed them for targeting sales programs, they could very well be on the hook too if they don't report to the govt that they found x number of deviant profiles while doing market research.  They become witnesses to a crime in a sense and wind up obligated to snitch on certain deviant profiles.

       To everyone in this thread saying or thinking that they collect and have that information anyway, the point is having a legitimate, legal way to access that data while circumventing the process of obtaining a warrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would also allow for a mess-desensitizing for anyone, but most especially the of the younger generations towards any feeling or desires for privacy.

       it also opens the door to say that there is no "expectation of privacy" from a legal standpoint.  So, even if they don't purchase it, they can argue that you don't have privacy because someone could have purchased your information.

       could be. But why does everyone put so much on browsing history. what does it really tell you about someone. for advertising and marketing reasons, it can be very beneficial. but what would government agencies or other nefarious actors get out of buying your browsing history? anyone deliberately committing criminal acts is likely taking some steps at obfuscating their identity online anyway, so I am not sure it is really as useful as some think.
