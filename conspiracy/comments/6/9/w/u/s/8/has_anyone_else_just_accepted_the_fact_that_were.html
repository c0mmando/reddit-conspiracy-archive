       Lets be honest, something is gonna happen. A natural disaster if that's called luck (my fingers are crossed for this one). A Recession, Depression? A war with North Korea, Iraq (again), or where ever. A "conflict" because of issues in the South Chinese Sea. I feel like nothing has or will be done. What about any leaks that have been released? Vault 7, haven't heard any updates on that. The Podesta email leak? That fucker still isn't in jail. The leaks with Hillary. That cunt isnt in jail or will be either. Pizza-gate, we're all just tinfoiled weirdos believing in a fantasy apparently. Trump and the rest of the Republiscums accusations/"proof" of their ties with Russia? They're all too big to jail. The recent passing of a law where our information will be collected and sold. The Fourth Amendment, whats that lol? ¯_(ツ)_/¯ (We're first world slaves if you ask me.) The chemical bombings in Syria, someone said they had "proof" on  whodunit. The new HealthCare Act? I cut my hand and need stitches, might as well break my neck because of the cost of my health insurance! The CIA leaks? Personally I have forgotten about most of this stuff. If Wiki-leaks, Anonymous, or any other hacking group could do significant world changing stuff, don't you think it would have happened by now? "We're waiting for the right moment." Where the fuck was that during the election? The puppets with the most strings attached are in office. Would have been the same with Hillary too. We should band up and protest for our beliefs! The Womans March and March on Science? Woohoo! We protested for like a day and nothing changed! In Venezuela, they've been doing that shit for months! PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO DIE OVER THERE AND CHANGE STILL HASN'T HAPPENED! We think that will happen here? Fuck no it won't. We all have to many clashing ideologies for that to ever work. Just look at the whole gender spectrum revolution bullshit and Blacklivesmatter.  Both are hate filled groups that are splitting us like a canyon. With the Republicans Im going to loose my right to marry. "Im gonna post all these issues on my Facebook and Twitter, Im helping!". Do people really think posting that stuff on a government controlled website will help? The world is now about controll and filling an agenda. We're the most tammed lion in the circus, and the ring master is marvelling at what he's accomplished. It might be in our nature to do something but its sooooo repressed, we won't give into it. Everyone likes feeling controlled and feeling safe and to some they're the same thing and they don't mind. That right there is the issue! I dont like sounding mean or negative like this. Im generally an upbeat person who wants change more than anyone. A redistribution of wealth or power, a massive country wide protest that produces change, hell yeah I'm game! Will it happen? Absolutely not in my lifetime. I just feel like we've lost. The big greedy bastards who are in office will get their war of a lifetime probably, they'll get richer and we'll get more poor. They will do what they can to screw us over as quickly as possible. And we wont be able to save anything because it will all happen so fast. I just needed to rant I guess :/

       Defeatism is exactly what they want to induce. "Nothing we can do. All hope's lost. Why even bother? We can't do anything.". Watch this video:

       It's shit because it's BBC and they don't name the real culprits but the method is correct. It's one of their goals to confuse and demoralize the public. The want to make real world issues so depressing that people don't bother with them anymore. Then they flood you with Star Wars movies, funny TV shows and video games that provide a world you can completely submerge yourself in. Don't fall for it! Never give up. Never slacken. Never tire. Never lose courage. Never despair!

       We really don't. The American public polls remarkably similar. Look at weed, healthcare, education, banks... We let them divide us with stuff like abortion and people pick teams. We are starting to learn that it's not red vs. blue it's people vs. corporations.

       That is literally what cost Bernie Sanders the election. All the people who thought this and voted for Hillary because she was 'electable'. We would have won if people voted for how they felt not how they were told to feel. We are making a lot of progress.

       Seriously? You don't think all the people who said, "I like him, and I agree with his policies, but he's not electable so I'm gonna vote for Hillary" had any part in his loss? Yes, the DNC fucked him over, but there were also shit tons of people pushing that bullshit narrative of "pie in the sky" and blah blah that made people who may have taken the chance and voted for him second-guess themselves and stuck with what the media was saying out of fear of Trump. Why does it have to be all-or-nothing here?

       I was referring to the Russian narratives. Sure, the idea of it probably made some people vote on way or the other, but what I meant was the OMGZ SCARY Russians did not meddle in our election whatsoever. Once the Donald started really tearing the leaks apart and spreading the information far and wide, was literally the day that fake news was born and the Russians came back into Vogue. LITERALLY in a 24 hour span.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched it happen organically, nothing of what I said is hearsay or second hand.

       I agree with you about the Russian narratives, but that is exactly the point I was trying to make. The original person I replied to said that it was
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       the corrupt DNC that cost Bernie the election, and I was disagreeing, since there were many factors that contributed to his loss. Regardless, the entire primary was a fucking joke and it's ridiculous how many people still won't accept that the DNC did any wrong.

       Seems like you've come to this conslusion because of your own unwillingness to be involved in anything other than an internet discussion. As though the people you expected to do something, anything, are now silent. And you're mad, You say "This is not what I was promised!" and demand a new change in human nature. No dude, humans are good and bad, the world is huuuge, television is not your friend. I bet if you spent 3 months alone in a cabin in the woods and I came up to you spouting your own post you'd prolly shoot me. THIS IS ALL A DISTRACTION. The world was made for you, a paradise to enjoy, go enjoy it and stop giving these leeches power. The best we can do is walk away from it all, fuck it, leave the pieces and stop trying to put it back together. I'll see you out there :)

       I agree on almost all of your points. We can't continue down the path we've been led down as it only benefits the people in power. We are surely fucked if we don't band together as a species and start helping each other. The fact we've had two major World Wars based off of propaganda is ridiculous and the notion that we're going to have a third is unfathomable. Human nature is easy to corrupt and that's why greed has us where it does, as the people running things are greedy and their greed knows no bounds. On a positive note though, nothing lasts forever.

       The absolute worst is what happens after you die. A theory that is growing rapidly in belief is the following; when you die you will be pulled into the "White Light Trap".  Fake Images of dead relatives and friends will be used to draw you in. Eventually you will be routed to the "Fake Heaven" which is actually an Astral Holding Area. After a period you will be judged by the "Archons", who are Parasitic Aliens. They will then say you must return for "More Lessons" and to remove "Karmic Debt". Both are complete scams. Your memories will be erased and you will be reinserted into this hellhole. We are used over and over as "Energy Slaves". The Archons are Parasites, and the Earth Global Elite work for them.. Search: 1)Archons White Light 2)Archons Reincarnation 3)Archons Lords Of Karma 4)Archons Reptilians 5) White Light Trap 6)Gnostics Archons 7)Illuminati Archons 8)Illuminati Lords Of Karma 9)Reincarnation Memory Erase. If you take the time and research all these, you will come across a large amount of information.. It is much worse than you could imagine. If you google search what I have listed, you will come across an enormous amount of information. Watching "David Icke" videos on youtube will explain everything and is something everyone should do. His material is now supported by many other researchers.
