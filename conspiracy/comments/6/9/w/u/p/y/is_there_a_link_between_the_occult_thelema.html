        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/antideerg.html">antideerg</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am new to Occult research but alarmed at how I ignored it for so long. Despite being so common, it is rarely mentioned in media.  I was shocked by how influential it is in History.  Many famous occultists and movements (Think Gaia, Wicca etc ) I immediately recognized the occult in the book “the secret” and movie “what the bleep do we know”. </p>

<p>I started with Thelema and Aleister Crowley who seems to have started a sect of occultism </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley</a>
Hermetic Qabalah (from the Hebrew קַבָּלָה &quot;reception&quot; or &quot;accounting&quot;) is a Western esoteric tradition involving mysticism and the occult. It is the underlying philosophy and framework for magical societies such as the Golden Dawn, Thelemic orders, mystical-religious societies such as the Builders of the Adytum and the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross, and is a precursor to the Neopagan, Wiccan and New Age movements. The Hermetic Qabalah is the basis for Qliphothic Qabala as studied by left hand path orders, such as the Typhonian Order.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Qabalah">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Qabalah</a></p>

<p>Thelema (/θəˈliːmə/) is a religion based on a philosophical law of the same name, adopted as a central tenet by some religious organizations. The law of Thelema is &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will.&quot; The law of Thelema was developed in the early 1900s by Aleister Crowley, an English writer and ceremonial magician.[1] He believed himself to be the prophet of a new age, the Æon of Horus, based upon a spiritual experience that he and his wife, Rose Edith, had in Egypt in 1904.[2] By his account, a possibly non-corporeal or &quot;praeterhuman&quot; being that called itself Aiwass contacted him and dictated a text known as The Book of the Law or Liber AL vel Legis, which outlined the principles of Thelema</p>

<p>So I started reading The book of the Law and this sentence jumped out at me            ( I have been reading about the 8 goddesses that  were in spiritual control of President Park ) </p>

<ol>
<li>For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but with the just I am eight, and one in eight: Which is vital, for I am none indeed. The Empress and the King are not of me; for there is a further secret. 
<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm">http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Choi Sun Sil   is reported to be one of 8 goddesses that was controlling Korean president Park.  Chois  father  Choi Tae-min is the founder of the cult called Yongsae-gyo .  which has had its wikipedia page taken down
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5a4ffv/south_korea_president_exposed_as_member_of_cult/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5a4ffv/south_korea_president_exposed_as_member_of_cult/</a></p>

<p>does anyone know of links to  Thelema and Yongsae-gyo? 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi_Tae-min">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi_Tae-min</a></p>

<p>Released by WikiLeaks, the U.S. Embassy in Korea reported to its government in 2007 that “Rumors are rife that the late pastor had complete control over Park’s body and soul during her formative years.” It also called Choi Tae-min a “Korean Rasputin.”</p>

<p><a href="http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pad/news/view.jsp?req_newsidx=217297">http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pad/news/view.jsp?req_newsidx=217297</a></p>

<p>The book of the Law.</p>

<p>So I checked out Rasputin and found this interesting</p>

<p>According to Rasputin&#39;s daughter, Maria, Rasputin did &quot;look into&quot; the Khlysty sect, but rejected it[citation needed]. One Khlyst practice was known as &quot;rejoicing&quot; (радение), a ritual which sought to overcome human sexual urges by engaging in group sexual activities so that, in consciously sinning together, the sin&#39;s power over the human was nullified.[4]:40 Rasputin is said to have been particularly appalled by the belief that grace is found through self-flagellation.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin</a></p>

<p>here is some background </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5a0lif/theory_the_smalltime_korean_oligarchy_controlling/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5a0lif/theory_the_smalltime_korean_oligarchy_controlling/</a>
<a href="https://metacenterchicago.com/2017/04/07/south-korea-collection-8-goddesses-cabal-secret-group-oligarchs/">https://metacenterchicago.com/2017/04/07/south-korea-collection-8-goddesses-cabal-secret-group-oligarchs/</a></p>

<p>I have read that the 8 consist of other Korean billionaires but I wonder if this more of global 8 goddesses.</p>

<p>*edit.  Just heard from Korean friend that goddess is not the correct translation - it appears to be gender neutral but definitely of a spiritual  nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might seem a bit far fetched but:</p>

<p>The crowely cult and general believe system was mentioned a few Times in the Cicada 3301 puzzles.
These puzzels would require decent knowledge of computer science in general and encryption in particular. Various aspects of different occult practices and (mostly) western cultural stuff like philosophy books and music pieces are to be found in the puzzels.
The organisation claims they are searching for &quot;highly intelligent individuals&quot;, though nobody knows for sure who is behind this til today. 
Some chat logs to be found in the deeper regions of the net suggest, that once you passed all the steps in time you were invited to a hidden service forum in which &quot;moderators&quot; tried to make the solvers work on a project called CAKES. Some sources say it was just an encryption/DMS tool, but one log i came accross discussed the possibility of this being some high-level-blackmailing platform as the initial design would make this usecase particularly straight-forward.
Now what bothers me is the whole story about encrypted/stenographed messages part in the podesta emails, anons working on that said it seemed like they would use similar encoding techniques. The whole Worldcorpo stuff has a feel from the riddels to it too. </p>

<p>It was speculated too, that cicada had something to do with the unreaveling of the current south-korean scandal.<br/>
Im really not sure how exactly but they seem to be involved in one way or the other, either being the good guys, or being fucked up elitists trying to crowdsource anon-intelligence. </p>

<p>Either way, the data angle should be looked into more....</p>

<p>How do these groups communicate? </p>

<p>There&#39;s no real connection to Crowley as far as I&#39;m aware, but Taoism does have a mystical side. The FOIA realeases by the CIA mention Qigong as a method for enhancing remote viewing, and as a means of protecting one&#39;s self from the psychic attacks of another.</p>

I thought maybe Merkel, who has ties to it, Clinton, Albright, etc were a part of a global cult.

They have infiltrated through NGOs many western nations including the US.  <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/south-korea-being-ruled-shaman-175718883.html">https://uk.news.yahoo.com/south-korea-being-ruled-shaman-175718883.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Krishnamurti is cool. Eckart Tolle is alright by me.</p>

<p>Most the religions have something positive you can take away. Unfortunately people want a piece of the power pie and it all becomes tainted. I&#39;m personally wishing for societal collapse which will force people to confront nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we should just start demanding the truth and see where that takes us. I was on r/dncleaks hoping for something that would expose the Clintons and elect Bernie Sanders when pizzagate was exposed. Now I my faith is in George Webb -  If the cabal is outed this will have a dramatic effect on consciousness.  </p>

<p>As for Trump.. I will wait and see but I think Antifa is trying to provoke a violent revolution like in Eastern Europe. I am starting to see that Russia might not be the evil empire that we were led to believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russians aren&#39;t the bad guys. The Zionist cabal needs to attack the last bastion of Orthodox Christianity.</p>

<p>Antifa is soros funded.</p>

<p>Trump learned the presidency has very limited power once he got into office. </p>

<p>As for Webb, don&#39;t put your faith in any person. Especially some pussy putz like Sanders. Basically we need a revolution in consciousness; the root of all our problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it seems it has to be a legal take down. I have been following the Awan brothers story for a long time, seems legit..  I have learned to judge by results only.  Sanders has spoken for truth it seems his whole life and Technology can take care of Higher education(I have done some online courses and comparable to a traditional education.  I think semi universal health care is fine UK or Australia model is ok. </p>

<p>Question is how do we trigger a consciousness revolution when things stay the same, somethings gotta give I think truth could be a trigger and is preferable to societal collapse.  Lets try my idea first and if that doesn&#39;t work we can go with your idea</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sanders is a do nothing. He&#39;s all talk. Judges &quot;the rich&quot; then flys around eating lobster and bowing to Clinton while quietly buying his third or fourth home. </p>

<p>Technocrats control the information and how it&#39;s disbursed. That&#39;s what common cores goal is.</p>

<p>People are working on a consciousness revolution right now. It&#39;s tricky. The problem is, the whole world is in the grip of sociopaths. The wobbling top may have to topple to set things aright.</p>

<p>How trippy that I got CEVs yesterday meditating(recently did mushrooms also) where it began with dull fractals and geometric shapes(closed eyes) then shadows of beings appeared couldnt really stay with the focus was kinda morphing into black shadowy guys with slight grey light behind them making a dark silhouette and it felt like they were just observing me moving around shaping to different things, some times they were peaking over the shoulders but was really fluid and morph like, nothing really stuck. Then these elve kinda avatar looking chicks were showing their faces and they had geometric patterns on their faces like jewelery hanging across ish?</p>

<p>Then it was 1-2 second scenes of grey shadowy people having a full on orgy, people every laying around with each other everywhere but the light was kinda breathing, so it was very dark and hard to see and the vision were limited, it was fully black but grey light/color would pulsate and make it visible, saw faces and bodies pretty clearly, the more you focused the harder it was so was just kinda letting go focusing on breath, but I was not in control, I couldnt chose what to watch or to change &quot;scene&quot; or do something else, it was just an orgy with these close up zooms on bodies having sex and people would kinda look up at me just watching me back as I looked at them. And you could compare it with a slide, were the transitions of one film to another are just black shadows taking over the view so you dont see anything then a few seconds lighter it comes back up and you get this grey ish, still shadowy view of the people, a couple of times I freaked out because it lit up and looked so realistic that I got a slight adrenaline shock and heart started beating, it was surreal as fuck.</p>

<p>It was getting kinda uncomfortable and strange as shit so I just stopped and it went away.</p>

<p>Ive been looking into the occult recently, also some Buddhism or generally just higher dimension stuff, alot with hallucinogenics etc aswell. Been fucking with <a href="/r/holofractals">/r/holofractals</a> and synchronicity aswell and this just felt spot on from what I experienced yesterday.¨</p>
