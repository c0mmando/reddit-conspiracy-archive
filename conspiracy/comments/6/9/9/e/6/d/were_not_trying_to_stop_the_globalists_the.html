        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They&#39;re not trying to institute an NWO, they already have control of everything. The reserve currency of the world, the banks, the military-industrial complex, the media-brainwashing complex, the major corporations, and the policy groups that make the laws. Carroll Quigley admitted this in the 1960s.</p>

<p>1984 isn&#39;t coming, it&#39;s here. The government spies on everything we do, suppresses dissent and murders journalists. They fly planes into buildings to terrorize the people.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we could have 20% economic growth, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6914hn/nasa_is_a_fucking_fraud/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage">0% taxes</a>, an end to climate change, ultra-high speed transportation all over the planet for under $100, and an effective end to starvation and water shortages.</p>

<p>The question is, what the fuck are YOU going to do about it? Complain? Bend over and say &quot;I just assume they spy on me&quot; and take it like a slave?</p>

<p>Or are you going to demand better. Demand that they <a href="https://newfederalistpapers.joomla.com/10-abolishthecia">abolish the CIA</a>, and have Nuremberg trials for the traitors. Demand an end to the Federal Reserve. Demand that we stop arming terrorists and then fighting wars with them a few years later.</p>

<p>The 2nd American Revolution is coming. Will you be the vanguard?</p>

<p>That is the dumbest fucking idea I&#39;ve ever seen suggested on this sub. Grid ops literally just has to reroute power and at worst, sporadic blackouts can be expected within the service area of a distribution substation. Even suggesting this as a means to &quot;strike back at TPTB&quot; says to me you&#39;re not only a fucking moron, but a larger and instigator who really has no business being here. This does nothing but mildly inconvenience electrical providers and hurts the general public.</p>

<p>Source - Me, electrical engineer. I&#39;m literally sitting in a fucking substation as I type this. Go fuck yourself op and get back to the drawing board.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s hard when you think you know a lot about an industry and some &quot;larper&quot; suggests that it&#39;s laughably vulnerable. But, you should probably read this <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R43604.pdf">Congressional report</a>. Because you&#39;re wrong:</p>

<p>&quot;Malicious individuals could, without significant training, identify critical HV transformer locations and time an attack for greatest effect. This could be accomplished with basic knowledge of transmission operations and regional network characteristics drawn from publicly available sources, including electric marketing data indicating constrained areas of the network</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>[One] example is a city served by eight transmission substations spread along a 250-mile line and located in five States...the damage would be enormous, blacking out a four-State region, with severe degradation of both reliability and economy for months</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In 1997, the Irish Republican Army reportedly planned this kind of coordinated attack against six transmission substations in the United Kingdom. Although the attack was prevented, had it been successful it reportedly could have caused wide spread power outages in London and the South East of England for months&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, quoting the congressional investigation into the 2013 incident and citing a plan the IRA hatched nearly 2 decades ago doesn&#39;t make you right.</p>

<p>Since 2014 the CPUC passed regulation for upping security, redundancy and patching up vulnerabilities in the grid and afaik  WAPA has done the same with power in 15 states it has authority over. Not only that, but IF an attack on even multiple substations (4kv dist to even 500kv trans) we have mobile transformers now that we use regularly when banks need to be taken out of service for replacement/servicing. These transformer trucks are even left in service for months at a time if project planning fucks up which happens semi-regularly . </p>

<p>The point is, attacking the power grid (or even suggesting it) as a means of accomplishing anything dumb. Personally I would group it in the same school of thought as commiting domestic terrorism to fight the 1%</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For starters, we can stop paying into their bs by not continuing to buy the latest chinese junk they put out for sale. It&#39;s not a matter of doing anything illegal, it&#39;s more of just realizing what we actually <em>need</em> rather than listening to them tell us what we want. It&#39;s not gonna be overnight, but as long as we try to stop paying into the crap they pedal out then they will eventually lose their hold on us.</p>

As always, education is the best antidote for this, but schools are pushing for partisan adgendas as part of the curriculum.  We are deeply fucked.  </p>

<p>Besides, the ones that call for violence always do it wrong anyways.  Why smash local businesses&#39; windows and light civilian cars on fire when you could go straight to the government offices that are actually fucking with your rights and send a message there?

<p>That is the dumbest fucking idea I&#39;ve ever seen suggested on this sub. Grid ops literally just has to reroute power and at worst, sporadic blackouts can be expected within the service area of a distribution substation. Even suggesting this as a means to &quot;strike back at TPTB&quot; says to me you&#39;re not only a fucking moron, but a larger and instigator who really has no business being here. This does nothing but mildly inconvenience electrical providers and hurts the general public.</p>
