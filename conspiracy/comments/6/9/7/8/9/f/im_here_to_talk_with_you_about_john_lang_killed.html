       <p>
        -"Open Letter the the USDOJ and the FBI I am fairly certain that Fresno Law Enforcement is trying to set me up on some type a charge related to child pornography. I’ve been trying to figure out why they would send Child Molester George Adams Ramirez my way when I was renting the property next to me for Don Green. Also I was at a loss as to how Fresno LE was able to turn so many people against me so quickly. The only thing that makes sense coupled with George Ramirez situation is if Fresno LE told these folks I was a child porn suspect"

       "Personally Identifying Information" per reddit's TOS.  Unfortunately it's a bit of a grey area and the admins have made it clear that PII is not and will not be tolerated at all, so we as mods need to err on the side of caution for the good of the sub.  If we were to slip up and allow a post through containing what they define as PII, we put ourselves at risk of being banned and also put the sub itself at risk of being deleted entirely.
