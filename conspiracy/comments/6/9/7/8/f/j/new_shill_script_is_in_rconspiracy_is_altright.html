    <div class="md"><p>Sure but to call <a href="/r/childfree">/r/childfree</a> a place for free discussion of child related ideas would be misleading and inncorrect, no? When you say t_d is a place for free discussion of ideas relating to a certain topic, you are saying that anyone can go there to discuss their opinion on those topics without being ridiculed or banned. But this is simply not the truth. It isn&#39;t even a place to freely discuss thoughts on Trump as all negative opinions are actively suppressed. It is a place where Trump supporters are free to show their support for Trump and be as loud and vocal about it as they want, to the point of being absurd. So when OP says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are essentially two, maybe three places that people can have an open discussion about the illegal shit happening with our leaders on the left, or have conversations that other people are too uncomfortable to have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is simply a falsehood, because if I went in their and said Clinton did nothing wrong I would be banned within minutes of commenting.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with what t_D is, but there is much wrong with attempting to misrepresent it as a place where people are free to have discussions about otherwise untalked about issues.</p>

Actual &#39;science&#39; has been banished from our memory, and in it&#39;s place is a sort of technological sophistication that is completely unlike the community-oriented, open, repeatable scientific process.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get people&#39;s fixation with trying to make gender dismorphia a mainstream thing we all have to embrace and accept. <em>It&#39;s a mental disorder these people aren&#39;t healthy</em>. It just doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>body <em>dysMORPHia</em> is something people with eating disorders get, where they think they&#39;re fat when they&#39;re skinny or they think their muscles are wasting away when they&#39;re buff. It&#39;s very sad. <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/body-dysmorphic-disorder/home/ovc-20200935">http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/body-dysmorphic-disorder/home/ovc-20200935</a></p>

<p>gender <em>dysPHORia</em> is a feeling in reaction to something that is deeply upsetting. It means unease, dissatisfaction, anxiety, being unwell.gender <em>dysphoria</em> is what some trans people get when our brains expect to be connected up to a body with parts matches the gender of our motor/sensory homonuclous (the brain to body map). If you&#39;re not transgender, you would probably get gender dysphoria if someone forced you to transition to another gender, treated you like you were that gender, and acted like you were crazy to insist that your internal gender identity is simply not what your body looks like. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>believe what you believe, but using that kind of language is going to make the left HATE us. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hate is a strong word. I think people who understand transgenderism just think you&#39;re ignorant assholes.</p>

<p>The Master leads by emptying people&#39;s minds and filling their cores, by weakening their ambition and toughening their resolve. He helps people lose everything they know, everything they desire, and creates confusion in those who think that they know.
True mastery can be gained by letting things go their own way. It can&#39;t be gained by interfering.
The ancient Masters didn&#39;t try to educate the people, but kindly taught them to not-know.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t quote me on things I didn&#39;t say. I never said science can explain everything. I said it&#39;s anti-scientific to believe that science can&#39;t address everything. Science is a method of testing explanations of natural phenomenons. It doesn&#39;t provide any answers, but rather it is a method to find answers. The premise of science is to consider examine all possibilities and eliminate the impossible. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re saying that there are certain things that science cannot examine, then you are saying that science cannot look at all possibilities. If science cannot look at all possibilities then science is operating on an impossible premise and is thus practically useless. So, if you&#39;re not anti-science, then you might as well be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry my tone came off hostile, that wasn&#39;t my intention. Not how it sounded in my head. </p>

<p>The difference is that religion is an institution that offers answers, yes? It gives you explanations?</p>

<p>Science does do that anymore than logic does that. Logic isn&#39;t a supplier of answers, but a tool to get to them. Just like logic, science can be misused and misinterpreted. And, what might seem to be the logical solution in one situation with limited information might not actually be the logical solution with full context.</p>

<p>So... I&#39;m trying to say there&#39;s a distinction between what people write in a science book and what <em>science</em> itself is. People calling themselves <em>scientists</em> make claims and when those claims are accepted without question then it is definitely a religious mindset.</p>

<p>But science is a method like cooking is a method. Cooking doesn&#39;t actually give you food, right? It&#39;s a method to prepare food, but cooking itself doesn&#39;t give you food or feed you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I get all that, difference between science as a &quot;process&quot; and scientists providing immutable answers.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see the difference between the two statements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Science cannot provide all the answers </li>
</ol>

<p>vs</p>

<ol>
<li>Science cannot address everything</li>

<p>I know there is some complex quantum-level, M-theory hypothesis that says that matter can spontaneously appear, but that is more mathematical meta-physics than hard science.</p>

<p>Science cannot tell us where matter came from or what set the universe in motion is all I am saying.  </p>

I think we should probably find a cure eventually but in the meantime I&#39;m more concerned about the genocide we have against Arabs. And the it would probably be world hunger, diseases, etc. Trannies are low on my list of priorities, at best. </p>

<p>If they want to cut their dicks off, that affects <em>me</em> about as much as if they want to pierce their ears or cut their hair. Body modification is body modification is body modification. </p>

<p>Also, I am an advocate of euthanasia. I believe people have the right to self-determinism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I would agree.  I misspoke regarding definition, yes you are completely right.  I don&#39;t think anyone is truly afraid of trannos, they just use the term phobia that way to paint a narrative of misunderstanding.  If more accusers and defendants would simply acknowledge that the dissent is mostly honest rejection, and not based in some sort of fear, then it would do both sides some good.  Yeah, while I was being sarcastic, I too agree with euthanasia.  Whole lot less messy in a variety of ways.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo!  Now other trigger terms are falling into that realm of accusation.  Don&#39;t like Zionism?  Youre anti semetic.  Don&#39;t like gangster rap culture?  You&#39;re racist towards blacks.  Don&#39;t agree with xyz... Bigot!  Oh please, I don&#39;t hate any group of people because of sex, color, gender, religion, etc.  Its when the thinking man (or woman) opposes paradigms that are pushed, and opposes with sound reasonable argument, the accusations and slurs start to fly.  We are witnessing the precursors to censorship of not only speech, but thought.... And worse yet, it is censorship based entirely on emotion and nothing else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply and thinking outside the box.  In my 40 something years experience, you are exactly right.  Yes, white on black racism did exist, and was quite prevalent several decades ago.  It very much fizzled out however and became an isolated niche among the intellectually inferior and the easily persuaded (i.e. Nazi punks, ignorant hayseeds, etc)  Now however, the tables have completely flipped.  A side effect of the ongoing welfare state, war on drugs, affirmative actio, paired with alt left ideology pushed in public schools have generated a huge black supremacy movement, the ripples of which permeate through society.  Every &quot;normal&quot; individual capable of thinking and providing for themselves regardless of race seemed to get along just fine before meh... Lets say 2000.  Now, the gullible and greedy are vehemently against the self sustaining portion of the citizenry.  Its a great big feminized humanist shit show, and everyone has tickets whether you want them or not.  Now is the time to stand up for what you believe in if there ever was one.  I for one fully support the autonomous liberty of the individual and don&#39;t go blaming the boogeyman patriarchy, terrorism, or herring of any other color just because the indoctrinated masses scream false epithets and pleas.  Now when the supreme court decides to step in, that&#39;s going to be a threshold.  We must not give up constitutional rights because people are emotional and cumulatively bought into so much propaganda that it potentially alters our freedoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, no apology necessary. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know man, I think that some people hated and still hate all people of a certain race. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily that widespread or ever was. I do <em>kind of agree</em> with your theory; I think that most people are just hesitant towards drastic changes, because most people get comfortable with their situations.</p>

<p>So, for example, not wanting to share a water fountain with someone of another race could be less about hating them, but more about not being able to wrap the mind around the idea of a cultural staple being overturned.</p>

<p>But, and it&#39;s a big but... I&#39;m mixed race, and I look racially ambiguous. I can promise you that there are people from all races who are truly racist. I&#39;m not even going to be one of those people who resorts to victimization as my argument. I&#39;m telling you that being racially ambiguous has actually made me a bit of a chameleon. So I&#39;ve actually been able to fit in with people who don&#39;t realize I&#39;m part of the target demographic they despise, and I&#39;ve had racists confess their true feelings to me thinking I was <em>on their side</em>. It&#39;s a really bizarre and amusing experience. </p>

I didn&#39;t want to be dickhole or nothing. And I agree  with you , I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as prevalent as the media portrays it though , and usually it&#39;s the unintelligent ones making the other ones look bad , as Id say goes for any race really , the whole thing is a sad state of affairs . And I think the tptb are purposely putting us against another dividing us to make it harder to stand. That&#39;s very fortunate for you ,  you&#39;re in a great position to educate them , and learn from the racists.  Listen to what they&#39;re fears of the other races are. 
It&#39;s mostly ignorance , thank you for not exploding on those racists , being kind and listening is very effective when the racist think all black people are thugs with  no self control/etc.
You set a example. Which is powerful.
Thank you for being kind to me. 
Good luck to you bud . </p>

<p>&#39;You guys are misogynistic for calling Hillary a cunt, but there is nothing wrong with calling Trump Putin&#39;s cock holster.&quot; .... stupid bias driven people without their own mind, just repeating how they were told to feel about things, is very transparent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from the Alt-Right, have posted on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> (which I absolutely fucking hate by the way,) and I think I should be able to discuss conspiracy theories just like anyone else.</p>

<p>People on the right wing have lived under what was basically a hostile authoritarian regime for the past 8 years. From Fast &amp; Furious on down, there was shadiness at every turn in the Obama Administration, and we <em>still</em> don&#39;t know the full extent. Probably never will, what with their penchant for destroying evidence. I feel this warrants discussion, at the very <em>least.</em></p>

<p>It might help for those of you on the left to understand someone like me&#39;s worldview. To people like me, there is <em>definitely</em> a conspiracy among the media to push a certain liberal humanist agenda that is heavy on the globalism. I see evidence for that literally every time I turn on the TV. So when things happen that conform to that worldview, ie what happened with Netflix and Bill Nye, it certainly falls into &quot;conspiracy&quot; territory for me. I don&#39;t find anything particularly wrong with that, and think people who say it&#39;s one-sided and political should maybe just stick to threads they feel more comfortable in. Politics, as with conspiracy theories, naturally divide people based on how they view the world. Often the <em>kind of conspiracy theories you believe</em> are influenced by your politics; for example someone on the left wing is probably more likely to believe vaccines cause autism, whereas someone on the right will be more likely to think Obama serially and deliberately targeted Conservative political groups by abusing his authority and directing members of his cabinet to actively discriminate against 501(c)(3)s based on political opinion.</p>

<p>I would hope left wingers and right wingers both are able to judge theories based on their merit, and not based on their own political leaning. Complaining about the content here based on your personal politics makes absolutely no sense; how about just stay out of threads you think are ridiculous and participate in threads that interest you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Real user here.  Half right.  While not transphobic, nor religious, I completely abhor and detest the transgender movement.  It is a blatant attempt to push an ideology, which has no basis in reality, upon the populous.  I&#39;m sorry if they are mentally ill.  But attempting to get the average person to accept it as anything more than a crazy lifestyle choice is subversive politics.  The cure is cutting body parts off?  Yeah, maybe if you have gangrene.  By the same logic the left should advocate euthanasia as treatment.  After all, if the brain is the source of the problem, then why not just cut their damn heads off?  I don&#39;t hate anyone, but I am definitely slighted towards not liking individuals that claim to be victims when they victimize themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I would agree.  I misspoke regarding definition, yes you are completely right.  I don&#39;t think anyone is truly afraid of trannos, they just use the term phobia that way to paint a narrative of misunderstanding.  If more accusers and defendants would simply acknowledge that the dissent is mostly honest rejection, and not based in some sort of fear, then it would do both sides some good.  Yeah, while I was being sarcastic, I too agree with euthanasia.  Whole lot less messy in a variety of ways.  </p>
