       That politicians are beholden to corporations and lobbyists rather than the American people. It's apparent that the GOP got very, very rich being the party of opposition for the last 8 years and as long as they pretended to try to pass healthcare bills they knew wouldn't go anywhere, their constituents would keep voting them in office because "they're fighting the good fight!"
      </p>
      <p>
       But then Trump gets elected and the GOP is caught with their pants down
       <em>
        immediately
       </em>
       . "Umm...you mean we were supposed to actually
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       a healthcare bill of our own worked out and ready to be passed by a Republican House and Senate?!"
      </p>
      <p>
       There are Democrat Representatives and Senators that keep getting reelected just because they are pro-gun control (or voted for ACA), even though they don't really seem to see the need to do anything about things like rising tuition costs and unemployment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The illusion of freedom is that you are free to vote for people who won't actually do much of anything to help you.

       Correct. I'm free to live in poverty on the street, and many people do.

       This is the part where you need to get out of your own head a little.

      <p>
       Try to imagine a world where most of the money and resources weren't hoarded by a very few, where technology is allowed to be developed and distributed easily and automating meaningless tasks is the standard. What do you think people would be "free" to do then?

       Try not paying taxes, smoking weed or drinking in the streets, or protest without a permit. All will land you a cozy seat in jail. Or hey tired of work? Just stop working and live on the streets, you do have freedom I guess but you'll be punished for exercising it.

       Freedom is relative to what you are.  Aristotle wrote that man is a rational animal, a being that cognates in a particular way.  If you are unhindered in thinking and hence acting as a man, then you are free.

        According to ABC affiliate KLTV, about an hour later and after a $25 profit, Overton police showed up and shut the lemonade stand down because the Green sisters did not have a "Peddler's Permit," which comes with a $150 fee.

       Every dollar in circulation is has been taxed by interest from the fed.
The money you pay to the government in taxes mostly goes to pay interest and principal on bonds issued to lenders.
If the federal budget is 4 trillion and the nation debt is 20 trillion.. imagine how much more service you could get if the government didn't go in debt?
At the moment interest payments on U.S. debt exceed U.S. tax revenue. Meaning you can never pay that debt off... oh well 2 bad so sad for the debt holders.

       Try to film inside an abattoir. Try to vote against israel, banks, oil, pharma, big ag, "defense" industry etc. Try to go completely off grid and build your house the way you want with materials you choose. Try to unionize. Try to defend yourself against unwarranted aggression from cops. Try to convince a jury to use nullification. Try to overturn unjust laws using the legal system put in place. Try going off the main routes during a protest downtown. Try to block something being built that would harm your local biome.

       They mean the fact that at any given moment a federal agent can storm into your house whisk you away to a black site and have you legally tortured under the patriot act. You're at the mercy of the surveillance state at all times.
