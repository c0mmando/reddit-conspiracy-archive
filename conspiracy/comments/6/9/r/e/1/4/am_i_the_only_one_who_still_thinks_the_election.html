    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my problem with the commonly held belief here that it was rigged for Hillary and she still lost.</p>

<p>If TPTB can just rig elections and pick their candidate, why wouldn&#39;t they rig both sides?  Why would they not just put two controlled candidates up against each other, go through the election, and decide which one they want more at the end and make them win.  That is a much safer proposition for the people in control if they have as much power as people here tend to believe.  I mean, Trump met with BIll Clinton privately only days before announcing his candidacy.</p>

<p>Second, there are two aspects of the &#39;the election was rigged for Hillary&#39; story that I just don&#39;t think hold up to any scrutiny.  First, that Hillary received favorable treatment from media and government/election institutions, and second that Trump is the candidate for/of the people and that his victory was a victory for the people.</p>

<p>On the first point, OP says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mainstream media&#39;s bias for only 1 candidate (Hillary), </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely untrue.  Trump got insane amounts of media coverage.  At multiple points CNN just flat out played long segments of Trump rallies live, broadcasting the most favorable view of him to millions of people.   The media also refused or totally failed to call out Trump on outright lies until very late in the election.  Trump got away with completely ignoring the truth in so many situations because of the media&#39;s &#39;bias towards fairness.&#39;  He was a totally unconventional candidate who, in any other era, would have been rightfully deemed, totally unfit for the presidency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the fact that president Obama was the first president to ever endorse a candidate who was under criminal investigation by the FBI</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The president ALWAYS endorses and campaigns the member of his party running, this is nothing surprising.  Yes, there was an FBI investigation for Hillary, <strong>But people also seem to ignore the fact that Trump was under investigation by the FBI at the same time and we never heard anything about that.</strong>  Comey said the other day in congress that he had two options &quot;conceal or speak&quot; when they reopened the Hillary investigation in October, but he actually had a third option.  Speak about Hillary, but also tell everyone that the other guy was under investigation too.  </p>

<p>The second issue is that Trump is the candidate of the people which I just don&#39;t believe.  Trump has essentially done nothing in his time that has shown he is anti-cabal and pro-people.  His health care plan is a giant tax cut for the rich at the expense of the poorest Americans.  His tax plan is just another tax cut for the rich.  The immigration ban is pro-nationalist, but conspicuously missing from the countries banned is Saudi Arabia, the world&#39;s largest sponsor of terror who is almost solely responsible (probably with our help) for the rise of ISIS and Al-qaeda.  Saudi Arabia is the <em>in</em> country in the Middle East that is part of the cabal.  Egypt and Pakistan also missing, who are key U.S. allies that regularly sponsor terrorism.  Trump has appointed Goldman Sachs employees at high places all over the administration including secretary of Treasury.  I just see absolutely no evidence sine inauguration that Trump is in any way working for the people or has any desire to do that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, my thinking is that Pizzagate really shifted the perspective for them.  They were getting exposed in a way they didn&#39;t intend and didn&#39;t want, so they decided to cut ties with Hillary, get Trump elected, make him say some vague things about human trafficking to placate the Pizzagaters, and get some low-level rings busted so there was some progress to be talked about, and then just move on and set-up shop somewhere else.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That could be. I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure, though. They&#39;ve used the election to further push the general public into their partisan corners and continue to point fingers at eachother rather than at TPTB themselves. Everything is the other &quot;teams&quot; fault, zero culpability or even acknowledgment of wrongdoing on both sides.</p>

<p>True non partisanship is rare</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, its starting to look that way. I&#39;ve been clinging onto hope, quickly fading though. The one thing I don&#39;t understand, that doesn&#39;t fit into this explanation. There is definitely still a huge concerted effort in the media, online and elsewhere to demoralize the Trump voter base, to make sure he&#39;s not voted for again.

    <div class="md"><p>Because those things can be very beneficial for the people in control too.  In general, there seems to be a global shift towards nationalism happening that could easily be playing into the hands of TPTB or controlled by TPBP.  There is also an escalating tension between the west and Russia that could also be beneficial to them.  Conflict creates opportunities for growth, and conflict that you can control and predict makes even more opportunities.</p>

<p>I think the Globalist, Anti-Globalist dichotomy that seems to be the base assumption on the sub is pretty naive.  TPTB made great money in the nationalist conflicts of the early 20th century, and the in the late 20th century they made huge amounts of money and continued to centralize their power during the globalist progression.  </p>

<p>The push towards nationalism may also be a way for a smaller faction within TPTB/Cabal to consolidate power and money.  If most of the group was assuming that increased globalism, and increased coordination was in everyones best interest and was the direction they were going, then a smaller group could try to counter-act that, create global crises which they can control and predict, and use that to cut out of the Cabal, factions that they don&#39;t want to include.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You people have all sorts of whacked-out bullshit conspiracy theories but you can&#39;t even fathom how mistrust in the media would be beneficial to a purely hypothetical shadow ruling class?</p>

<p>The education part is easy: people that are unable to think critically, uneducated masses, are easier to abuse, mislead, and contain.</p>

<p>The media part is trickier, but it&#39;s a big part of what&#39;s happened in Russia. Putin and his KGB allies have created an environment where, for most Russians, nothing at all is true. Everything is up for debate, nobody trusts anybody or any source of information regardless of how verified or researched the item might be. This lack of trust has created a void in the populace that Putin has used to his advantage. Because they don&#39;t or can&#39;t form beliefs and opinions about their own government they disengage from it as much as possible, allowing Putin to basically do whatever he wants, because anything that comes out about him and his government becomes just another piece of useless information that his people will never actually believe.</p>

<p>You can believe in this formless TPTB entity that almost surely doesn&#39;t exist in any capacity you might imagine, go ahead. I&#39;m not trying to convince you that they don&#39;t exist. However, if your imagination is so limited as to why they might do these things you think they&#39;re doing when the entire government of Russia is dedicating effort to doing exactly that while also controlling most of the media that the population gets to digest, then clearly you aren&#39;t thinking hard enough and instead are just directing some sort of discomfort you feel at an imaginary entity.</p>

<p>Just think about who you&#39;re blaming for things. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because you&#39;re not <em>supposed</em> to. Being &#39;under investigation&#39; isn&#39;t a crime. Did we miss the FBI&#39;s charges? The grand jury indictments? The investigation turned up nothing. But you expect it to have influenced the election?</p>

<p>We both know full well that this isn&#39;t the whole story. The emails scandal was pretty much contained at that point. The NYPD finding the Weiner laptop—new evidence clearly outside all the bullshit immunity agreements—forced Comey&#39;s hand.</p>

<p>Not sure if you&#39;re referring to the Trump or Hillary investigations on this one, but re: Trump, that one is still ongoing, so maybe we will get indictments in the future.  this Hillary one which, at least according to the FBI FWIW, is the one that lead to no evidence to support criminal charges (again take the FIB&#39;s word FWIW).</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking specifically about Comey&#39;s decision to announce just before the election that they were reopening the investigation on Hillary.  He said (again FWIW) that a a big part of what weighed on him was how it would effect the election.  You&#39;re right that normally you don&#39;t announce this stuff, but Comey said he was afraid that if he concealed it, after the election it would come out that the investigation was reopened and the FBI would lose credibility and trust and w/e, so he deamed that it would be less damaging to announce it before the election and risk influencing the election in order to not have it come out after.  <strong>But this is exactly what happened with Trump</strong>.  If he wanted to be impartial and wanted to ensure the FBI didn&#39;t get caught concealing something then he should have announced both of the investigations together to put all the cards on the table.  That doens&#39;t bias the election because both candidates are being investigated, and it give the FBI the ability to say, regardless of who wins the election, &quot;look, we told you we were looking into them before.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely not.  Trump&#39;s positions don&#39;t even match one week to the next.  I don&#39;t believe Trump really has any positions he believes in and feels strongly about.  I don&#39;t think Trump knows much about policy or cares to know much about policy.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s exactly my point.  The situation where he doesn&#39;t appoint Mnuchin and Cohn and the rest is the situation where <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is right and he is actually hte populist savior to fight off the globalist Cabal.  If that were true he wouldn&#39;t make the appointments he did, but it&#39;s not, and those appointments are evidence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s weaseling, it was pointed out time after time after time that Hillary Clinton was under &quot;criminal investigation&quot;, while Trump&#39;s supporters had reason to deny that he was as well (despite it being reported by a couple of news sources, but never confirmed officially).</p>

<p>It&#39;s weaseling if Hillary being under investigation was the only thing that brought her down, but it wasn&#39;t, and not by far. The emails, Saudi funding, Goldman speeches, murdering Seth Rich, and this other extensive, <strong><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/05/here-they-are-hillarys-22-biggest-scandals-ever/">documented and sourced list</a></strong>. These are SERIOUS scandals. And, what&#39;s more, Hillary came with rapist Bill&#39;s baggage, too. American voters have <strong><a href="http://www.mrctv.org/blog/10-scandals-involving-hillary-clinton-you-may-have-forgotten">known this woman is a crook for decades</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Hillary backers thinking that the election was hers to win and if it weren&#39;t for this or that or Comey or Wikileaks <em>muh Russia</em>, she&#39;d have been elected. Instead, <strong>voters saw her husband, not elected to any office or occupying any official position of power whatso-fucking-ever</strong> hold a secret tarmac meeting with Loretta Lynch. </p>

<p>I get that your mandate is to rewrite or repair Hillary&#39;s legacy, but, seriously? You&#39;re still polishing this turd?</p>

<p>This conversation only illustrates again (and again, and again) how utterly fucking delusional people were to think Hillary was a qualified candidate. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not doing anything of the nature, especially not with somebody who&#39;s coming from a completely deranged perspective, whom believes any and all negative claims about Hillary Clinton, regardless of how unsubstantiated they may be, and seems to downplay and and all Trump negatives, as you do in your final paragraph.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US spends 16% of its GDP on healthcare, more per capita than any other country in the world. Its healthcare system is a literal joke (and I&#39;m Canadian, so, you bet I know what I&#39;m talking about). You seriously think Trump can fix it? By himself?? Pardon me while I roll all over the floor, laughing. BOTH the GOP and the DNC are completely co-opted by big pharma, big banks, and everything else. Stop pretending the solution will come from the Oval Office. Or only from the DEMs. It won&#39;t. Obamacare is an utter joke and Trump is right. It&#39;s flawed and completely fails to address the problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely missing the point.  The proposal that he&#39;s currently pushing DIRECTLY contradicts everything he said his proposal would have on the campaign trail.  Tens of millions fewer will have insurance - while he explicitly said everyone will have it.  He said people with pre-existing conditions will not be able to be discriminated against - they will easily be able to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You seriously think Trump can fix it? By himself??</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He isn&#39;t even trying to fix it, he&#39;s trying to re-work our healthcare industry to the benefit of insurance companies and the wealthy, while overtly screwing over the poor (by gutting subsidies and cutting Medicaid by nearly a trillion dollars) - that is literally the only change, and it is objectively an overwhelmingly negative change.</p>

<p>Also he himself?  He has never even attempted to work with the Democrats on it.</p>

<p>You have such cognitive dissonance, it&#39;s astounding.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>why wouldn&#39;t they rig both sides? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question assumes that the corporate hegemony is now fully in place, and that both parties are a sham and working together.  I don&#39;t believe that is a working theory at this time.  My perception is that corporate donors are donating to both parties, as a way to cover themselves, but that the parties are still competing against one another.  I have no opinion of the Republican party, except to note that a candidate unpopular with the RNC establishment was somehow elected, whereas an unpopular candidate with the DNC establishment was not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump got insane amounts of media coverage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you aware of the email from the Clinton Campaign outlining a plan to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1120">elevate Trump through excessive media coverage?</a>  The idea was that by doing that, he would divide the right wing and weaken what they assumed would be a more moderate pick, like Bush.  The DNC wanted Trump to have that excessive coverage.</p>

<p>The date from <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1120">this Harvard study</a> agrees with you that HRC received much negative media attention, and they do a nice analysis of the reasons.  They propose that while Bernie received more positive coverage, but less coverage overall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Sanders was said to be doing “surprisingly well,” a positive narrative. Sanders’ character and policies were also sources of good press—in fact, he was the only candidate portrayed positively by the media on these dimensions.  On the other hand, at this stage in the campaign, Sanders—unlike Clinton, Trump, Cruz, or Rubio—was not perceived as a candidate who could actually win the party’s nomination. Although his resounding New Hampshire victory dampened the claim, it returned in force after his losses in Nevada and South Carolina. In reporting his South Carolina defeat, for example, The Washington Post noted that “Sanders has already accomplished a huge amount in this race—including dragging Clinton to the ideological left . . . . But, exerting influence—even considerable influence—over the nominee’s priorities is not the same thing as having a real chance to be the nominee in your own right.”[13]  *</em>The perception that Clinton had a lock on the Democratic nomination diminished journalists’ interest in the Democratic race generally and in Sanders’ candidacy particularly.** Sanders’ press attention in the early going trailed not only that of Clinton and Trump but also that of Cruz and Rubio.*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great, and well written response, thanks.  I won&#39;t take the time to respond to everything here, but a few things.</p>

<p>I had seen that Podesta email before, but I don&#39;t really think that has too much to do with the idea that the election was rigged for Hillary.  This just seems like pretty typical political gamesmanship media strategy to me.   Her campaign and operation certainly wielded a lot of influence over the media, probably to an unprecedented degree, (why and how that&#39;s the case is another discussion) but the actions taken by the campaign and the media response to it seems mostly in-line with the way I would expect these things to work.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it doesn&#39;t help us answer the question &quot;why did the DNC select a candidate who WE KNEW was being investigated?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure this is a question really in need of an answer past the obvious &quot;that&#39;s just how political parties work,&quot;  though maybe we coudl go a little deeper.  For the most part, political parties are conservative in their operations and insular.  They pick the candidate whose turn it is, the one who is most senior and who has put in the work to get to the position to be the candidate.  That was definitely the case for Hillary.  It&#39;s also true that she put her people in place in the DNC to help her win (Debbie Wasserman-Schultz was her &#39;08 campaign chair).  This, again, seems like normal political gamesmanship to me, although taken to the nth degree and &#39;perfected&#39; by the HRC political machine.  I think the DNC simply favored the candidate they were always going to favor and were biased towards fro a number of reasons.  Remember, Bernie was never a Democrat before declaring as a Democratic candidate for president, he always ran as an Independent but caucused with the Dems, so it&#39;s not surprising the the Democratic political machine didn&#39;t really support him.  And while I, like many others, liked and supported Bernie, there are a lot of legitimate reasons that his ideas and policies were not taken up as strongly by the Dems and even why they were mocked by the people in the DNC.  Socialism is still a bad word in the US, even among left-leaning Dems, and many of Bernie&#39;s policies were outside of what was Democratic cannon, and what was thought electable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But getting back to the rigged issue, the DNC was supposed to be impartial and they were not only not impartial, they targeted Bernie and sabotaged his campaign. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree this is what they are supposed to do, but I think it&#39;s naive to think that this is the way political parties actually opperate.  You have to pay your dues to get support from the party, and you have to fall in line with a lot of expectations of the party.  Bernie neither paid his dues (he was alway an Independent) and he wasn&#39;t ever going to fall in line with that the party wanted, even if the party was short-sighted or flat out wrong in wanting things that the people didn&#39;t.  I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s how political parties work.  </p>

<p>I guess we need to define rigging.  There&#39;s rigging, where votes are dumped, or counted twice, or that sort of thing.  There&#39;s also the gamesmanship, as you put it.</p>

<p>I pointed out the Podesta email, because you observed that Trump experienced great media coverage.  I was explaining why that might have been.  You can call that rigging, or gamesmanship.  I call it unfortunate.  If you are unhappy with Trump as president, then this was a factor in his rise.</p>

<p>So what do you mean exactly?  Are you saying &quot;eh, life is corrupt, and it doesn&#39;t phase me much.&quot;  If so, well there&#39;s nowhere for this conversation to go.

<p>Fortunately, the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/8/31/1417001/-Bernie-Not-Democrat-Enough-Let-s-See-How-He-Stacks-Up">Daily Kos responded to the &quot;Bernie isn&#39;t a democrat&quot; rationalization</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bernie votes 98% with the Democrats.</p>

<p>Not good enough, so who is better? In the House no one, the closest at 97% is Fredricka Wilson, the average Dem votes with the party 93.2%. In the Senate the average is 95% of the time and there are a few Senators who barely beat Bernie out...</p>

<p>Rank    Name              Total Votes         Votes With Party            Rate
1    Al Franken                    161                        159                   98.8%
2    Benjamin L. Cardin    160                        158                   98.8%
3    Barbara A. Mikulski    158                        156                   98.7%
4    Maria Cantwell            161                        158                   98.1%

6    Elizabeth Warren    157                        154                   98.1%
So where did he veer off Democratic lock step? He voted against the Keystone XL Pipeline three times. He voted against arming the Syrian rebels, he voted no on exempting religious employers from the anti-discrimination laws, he voted no on the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013 which would set interest as high as 10.5% on some loans, among others. You can check his voting record here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of us would say he&#39;s more of a democrat, then most democrats.</p>

<p>I think a private not-for-profit who receives my tax dollars and has a charter, should follow it&#39;s charter.</p>

<p>But whether you want to argue the legalities, they behaved unethically, and I left the party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t like any of this.  I agree that this isn&#39;t how the parties should operate and I, like you, long ago &#39;left&#39; the democratic party.  I&#39;m still registered Dem so I can vote in primaries, but I don&#39;t identify myself with them at all because they almost wholly do not represent my political positions though they are closer than the Republicans.  I am quite disillusioned with the current political landscape, and don&#39;t know really what I can do to improve the state of affairs when I feel both the Dems and GOP are morally corrupt organizations that do not work in the interest of the people AND the institutions and systems we have for making changes (e.g. congress, the legislature and regulatory agencies) aren&#39;t really capable, in my view, of making significant changes that lead to real improvements for most people.</p>

<p>RE: the Bernie stuff, just because he voted with the Dems, doesn&#39;t make him a Democrat. Like I said, he caucused with them, and as one of the furthest left members or the House and Senate it should be expected that his votes will mostly line up with the left-most party (and when he doesn&#39;t vote with them he votes to the left of them, not to the right).  </p>

<p>What makes or doesn&#39;t make someone a Democrat is not what happens in the legislative chambers, but what happens on the campaign trail.  Sanders never asked for or received campaign support from the DNC, he never made contributions to the DNC and he didn&#39;t have input into the organization and activities of the DNC or it&#39;s leadership, because he was not running as a Democrat, he was running as an independent.  This is one of the things I liked about him and I respect the shit out of him for it.  As someone who has felt like the Dems have never really been aligned with my political beliefs, and who doubted the Dems sincerity or means in their political pursuits, it seemed like Bernie saw things the same way.  I understand why he chose to join the party when running for president, and I understand why he chose not to continue his presidential campaign as an independent after not receiving the nomination, but truly he was not a Democrat, and for me that was a feature, not a bug.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your post, and for clarifying.  I see your point about him not being a democrat.  </p>

<p>I would have expected them to be impartial and at the very least, not to target him.  There seems to be an agreement that his campaign would have gone nowhere had he run as an independent, so he didn&#39;t have a choice really.  Ironically even though he&#39;s an Independent, he&#39;s incredibly faithful to the party despite their ill treatment of him.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve learned is that we leftists need a party, and if the DNC doesn&#39;t see any obligation to represent <del>all</del> of the left wing in this country, then we progressives are basically excluded from the political process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exit polling indicates the vote was rigged for Hillary in the primaries, and Trump in the general election.</p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s family has been the center of conspiracy theories since Governor Bill attended Bilderberg in &#39;91.  A lot of people here were emotionally invested in the &quot;rigged election&quot; idea.</p>

<p>And of course, Donald Trump outright stated that the Election was rigged, and his fans believed him. </p>

<p>But then he won, and the exit polls indicate that the vote was skewed in his favor by as much as 2%.  And the Deep State allowed him to transition into power, shattering that conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>I understand you were invested in it, but you&#39;re almost certainly wrong.</p>

<p>The election, if it was rigged, was almost definitely rigged for Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome to conspiracy, you must be new here. It&#39;s been happening for last 6-8 months now. It does get really old seeing the same ole whining what about Hillary post every 20 minutes but there isn&#39;t much we can do besides callout their bullshit, downvote and move on.</p>

<p>The mods try not to remove a post as long as it doesn&#39;t break reddit wide rules such as doxxing. Although there have been some highly questionable &quot;unverified&quot; tags used in the past regarding pieces that paint Trump in a negative light.</p>

<p>I feel they are doing their best with the tools provided and trying to maintain a &#39;fair and balanced&#39; sub. Only admins have access to tools that can verify brigading and evasion bans and they couldn&#39;t care less about this sub. </p>

<p>It&#39;s up to us as a community to police the sub and make others aware when people are spreading obvious bs.  </p>

<p>This community is made up of member&#39;s who often hold different views but we always keep an open mind and respect fellow members. There been a massive coordinated campaign to divide and conquer this sub and spread blatant propaganda. Hopefully we don&#39;t allow them to &#39;win.&#39;</p>

From briefly looking through your post history it seems nearly <strong>all</strong> your contributions to this subreddit consist of arguing against other users. You do not belong here, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nothing is centrally controlled with US voting. There would be too many whistle blowers on the local,state, or federal level. It can only work in small doses in certain districts. Some states have laws that make it easier or harder to rig a vote through electronic means, but some counties have their own rules that makes even that difficult.</p>

<p>If it was all centrally controlled, and all areas followed a homogeneous system, it would be a LOT easier.</p>

<p>Michigan requires physical votes for recounts and auditing, but the votes are tallied on election night with electronically. Basically it is a fancy scantron sheet like a college exam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The article states most of the precincts with miscounted ballots were heavily Democrat.</p>

<p>And then it goes on to say that most of these discrepancies are around 1-5 votes per precinct or some shit.</p>

<p>And then they state how lots of counties were using decade old vote counter, 94 of which broke on election day. </p>

<p>How is this some grand conspiracy?</p>

<p>In the end all the discrepancies did was prevent a recount for Clinton, because precincts with ballot discrepancies can&#39;t be recounted.</p>

<p>So it didn&#39;t help? It kinda did...the opposite.</p>

<p>You realize the state auditor just wanted this to go away because the thorough investigation would be a FUCK TON of work and cost more than the department can afford, as well as call into question a large number of local elections. Chris Thomas has since announced his retirement, which may just be another one of those coincidences like the myriad of them that caused a recount to be impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a poll worker for the primary and the general election and it really depends who teaches you how to run the polls. For the primary, we were given barely any instruction even though it was far more complicated. In the primary in CA, Independents and green party members could vote for the Democratic candidate but you needed a crossover ballot to do so. The problem was, we were never trained how to process a crossover ballot at all. The only reason I knew is because I was very involved in the Bernie Sanders campaign and they trained​ us how to process them. There were multiple districts which results were spoiled because the poll workers didn&#39;t process the ballots properly</p>

<p>This is about the lamest excuse I&#39;ve ever seen for someone trying to prevent a recount in a close election where the REPUBLICAN WON the official count. I guess whatever it takes, huh?</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not that we are afraid the Republican didn&#39;t actually win in our Republican won state -- we&#39;re just really cheap and lazy. ROFL</p>

<p>On the contrary, Republicans were very strong and determined to distort and stop recounts and sabotaged the Jill Stein efforts with Big Money.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like they haven&#39;t done it before. In 2000, they used every dirty trick in the book, but still had to employ their Supreme Court partisans to stop the count.</p>

<p>As for 2016, it was stolen by Republicans too. <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/election-stolen-heres/">http://www.gregpalast.com/election-stolen-heres/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more centrally controlled than a lot of people expect. When people think of election fraud, they usually think of the county or state election officials being responsible. But our election system is heavily privatized, with a small number of corporations producing the voting machines and voter registration systems. Those private companies could easily decide to rig the election if they wanted.</p>

<p>Of course, you still have to prevent fraud from being exposed in states that do audits. About half of states <a href="https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/post-election-audits/">don&#39;t do audits</a> or use voting machines without paper trails. For those that do audit, you&#39;ll also need to involve some local election officials to rig the audit. This happened, for instance, in the 2016 Dem primaries in Chicago and California.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you don&#39;t need to involve too many people: a small group within the election vendors, and some local officials to prevent the exposure of the fraud. This small group could potentially have been formed a while ago and hijacked national elections over many successive years.</p>

<p>If you look at the ownership and control of the election vendors, deep state ties abound. ES&amp;S and Hart Intercivic were owned by Dallas and Omaha powerbrokers, including an heiress of the Hunt oil family. Diebold was started by financial crooks with possible mob ties, and had an embezzler (Jeffrey Dean) on their board who had worked with Egil Krogh of Watergate fame. Sequoia was owned by a partner of the Carlyle Group. And these voting machines were lobbied into widespread use by a coalition of military contractors (Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin) and a mysterious vendor called VoteHere that had Robert Gates on its advisory board.</p>

<p>Hillary was selected, she was to be the next president. Half way through the election, even trump could make her look like SHIT.</p>

<p>He also told Middle America, almost every majority of the GUN owning states that the election was rigged, that Hillary was rigged to win.</p>

<p>Plan B was implemented. Trump was selected/accepted by the elites despite his unfavorable policies toward Russia.</p>

<p>Simply on the basis that if Hillary was put into office after trump said over and over that the election was rigged. More than half of the population and about 150million guns would rise up in civil revolt.</p>

<p>The problem was that he had no idea how to actually implement his policies, or how they would work, or whether they were a good idea in the first place.</p>

<p>The border wall, for instance. He has zero idea how to pay for it, or how much it&#39;s actually going to cost. He doesn&#39;t know if it will actually be effective. If he was truly concerned with stopping Mexican illegal immigration, he&#39;d stop trash talking the Peso. What about places where the border is marked by the Rio Grande?

    <div class="md"><p>Good question.  My understanding about the way it works is the policies are determined by certain organizations that are never up for election.  The public has no say in what these policies are.  </p>

<p>These organizations are Bilderberg, The Trilateral Commission, and the Council on Foreign Relations.  Normally, both candidates are associated with these organizations so, no matter who wins, the policies will be implemented.  </p>

<p>This past election was different because only Hillary was associated with these organizations, either directly, or through Bill Clinton.  </p>

<p>Here is a historical flowchart of The Cabal:  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I&#39;m pretty sure they actually tally votes is, in every county multiple people are chosen to look at every ballot and pull a mechanical arm or something. I say &#39; or something&#39; cuz its a trade secret(a la buddy of mine&#39;s mom). So there are about 10-20, and I&#39;m just ball parking, of these voting centers in every state, where every single vote is actually hand counted.</p>

<p>The corruption in voting comes from gerrymandering, or choosing district lines, so those arm pulls or something, actually count for multiple votes. The electoral college I guess isn&#39;t a horrible idea because it is supposed to represent those who would otherwise be left voiceless, but with gerrymandering, they(THEM) are simply able to choose votes that should be worth 2x or 3x. Or in places like Wyoming 6x votes. And they choose rich white folks every time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with u\glencompton. I think the way it&#39;s &quot;rigged&quot; is by the biased coverage by the media. It doesn&#39;t take an outlandish conspiracy theory to see what was happening. Bernie was a very popular candidate that was pushed aside by the media, and his very own party for that matter, because he wasn&#39;t the candidate the system wanted. Even though Bernie was extremely popular with the younger voting population, which is what the democrats were always aiming for and (the kicker) even though he was popular with people from the Midwest that later on winded up voting for trump because they didn&#39;t want Hillary in office, he still wasn&#39;t taken seriously by the media and was only talked about because of his extreme popularity on social media. So I do think the system is rigged in a sense, but not in a ballot stuffing, direct manner. </p>

However, <a href="http://tdmsresearch.com/2016/11/10/2016-presidential-election-table/">the exit polls</a> (which have historically indicated electronic fraud in numerous elections, such as the 2004 election to favor Bush and the 2016 Dem primaries against Bernie) show the opposite trend: fraud favoring Trump. This is inconsistent with a &quot;shy Trump voter theory&quot;, since the discrepancies occur all over the country (not just in blue or swing states), downticket races were also shifted towards the GOP, and exit polls are confidential surveys, not face-to-face interviews. And the recount was primarily blocked by Trump&#39;s campaign and Republican (e.g. Bush-appointed) judges. For whatever reason (and I&#39;ve thought of possible theories since November), I think TPTB decided to abandon Hillary and get Trump elected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve manipulatively focused on one piece of evidence without acknowledging it&#39;s context. Wisconsin allowed individual counties to <em>choose</em> whether or not to do hand counts. That is inherently suspect. It defeats the entire point of an audit if people under investigation get to choose whether they get audited. Seeing a pattern of Trump-favoring vote patterns being associated with not hand counting only heightens that perception.</p>

<p>And WI is the only state to even partially do a real recount. MI and PA were shut down by Trump and the GOP. Hm, I sure wonder why they were so opposed to verifying the vote count if there was nothing problematic to be found. The Trump supporters are misleadingly parading the &quot;Trump gained votes!&quot; line. If the recount was so beneficial to Trump, why did he fight it?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Hillary supporter, by the way - I considered Trump the lesser evil, and am glad he&#39;s president over her, but I don&#39;t think he legitimately won. The only reason I accept it is that Hillary didn&#39;t legitimately win the Dem nomination. But if we&#39;re going to talk about partisan bias: if Trump lost Wisconsin, the exit polls said he really won, and there was a recount in which counties got to choose whether they actually counted the votes, would you approve of that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;shy Trump voter&quot; theory is that due to social pressure (e.g. fear of being called racist, sexist, or fascist), they didn&#39;t want to disclose who they voted for. Social pressure is more likely to exist in blue or swing states, but exit poll discrepancies occurred all over the nation. The fact that Trump wasn&#39;t the only candidate to see a red shift also indicates that the shift wasn&#39;t tied to him. And since exit polls are private and confidential questionnaires, where you don&#39;t reveal your vote to anyone in person, it&#39;s debatable how much social pressure would have dissuaded exit poll response in the first place.</p>

<p>Nonresponse is frequently used to explain exit poll discrepancies, but the exit polls have been proven valid in <a href="http://www.organikrecords.com/corporatenewslies/Presidential-Election-2004.pdf">2004</a>, <a href="http://electiondefensealliance.org/files/LandslideDenied_v.9_071507.pdf">2006</a>, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5O9I4XJdSISNzJyaWIxaWpZWnM/view">the 2016 primaries</a>. The exit pollsters are generally quite good at representing voter intent. So if there was a discrepancy this time, it had to be something specific to the 2016 election, and the evidence of that isn&#39;t very strong.</p>

<p>Of course, as you say, the ultimate takeaway is that we should never have to question whether votes are valid or get into these forensic analyses. We should have hand-counted paper ballots, whose counts are observable by the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the correction. I was looking at the margin of victory column not the margin of discrepancy column. </p>

<p>The assumption that voters were more likely to report true voting patterns were more honest depending on the political makeup of the area seems like a stretch. The 2016 election was unique in many ways maybe the most notable being how wrong so many pre-election polls were. My own (albeit anecdotal) evidence of traveling all over the U.S., from heavily red to heavily blue areas and the number of voters who &#39;came out&#39; after the election is pretty consistent. </p>

<p>There were many discrepancies in the 2004 election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that red/blue/swing state is the primary factor that would have affected exit poll response. The red shift for other downticket candidates besides Trump and the confidentiality of the exit polls are much stronger evidence, in my view. But it&#39;s still notable that high discrepancies occurred in solid red states like Missouri, Utah, South Carolina, and Indiana.</p>

<p>Another interesting observation comes from comparing these discrepancies to the national discrepancy. The national discrepancy is only about 2%, while state discrepancies are generally above that. Exit polls weren&#39;t reported at the state level for every state, so these are the ones that were considered close/interesting enough to bother with. That implies that the non-listed states (in other words, the even-less competitive ones) would see much smaller discrepancies. Seeing a higher red shift in more competitive states fits with election rigging.</p>

<p>I think that the election was close enough to make a Trump victory plausible. Many of the swing states that appear flipped in the exit polls have Trump officially winning by a small percentage. But I still don&#39;t believe he actually won those states.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, there are unfortunately a lot of unknowns when doing post-election forensics. You can&#39;t trust official results, but measures like exit polls also need to be taken with some skepticism. I think the evidence is more convincing of election theft for Trump, but I can&#39;t say that with too much certainty. Hopefully, there will be some in-depth analyses of this election (like there were for 2004, 2006, and the 2016 Dem primaries).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense. In order to explain why people voted as they did, you would obviously need to know how they voted. People frequently resort to that excuse when exit poll discrepancies are pointed out, but it doesn&#39;t hold up.

<p>I didn&#39;t claim that 2% was statistically significant. Plenty of the discrepancies are well over that number. I was responding to the commenter&#39;s claim that most of the discrepancies were below 2%, which wasn&#39;t true (and they acknowledged that they had misread the table).</p>

<p>Not really an excuse.  Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html">2004 exit poll</a> that clearly does not even ask whom was voted for.</p>

<p>Yes, I did read them, but they did not contradict anything that I said.  It also didn&#39;t count exit polls that contradicted the income in those respective elections, like the 2004 Edison-Mitofsky exit polls in 2004 where Kerry had healthy national lead, and was 6 points off of the national results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That 538 article about exit polls is heavily misleading. #2, #3, and #10 are an exercise in circular reasoning: exit polls are bad because they&#39;ve been wrong, and that&#39;s not evidence of fraud because exit polls are bad. #4 is likely based off that circular reasoning, since it would explain the exit poll discrepancies if people take the possibility of fraudulent results off the table. #7 is wrong, since exit polls are taken several times a day, including just before poll closing. #8 is irrelevant, since we&#39;re not discussing leaked early exit polls.</p>

<h1>6 and #9 need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. And while you <em>say</em> you read my 3 links, I&#39;m not sure you actually did. The 2004 link explained why the 2004 exit poll discrepancy was most likely not due to faulty polling, and more indicative of vote miscount. The 2006 link had an examination of the demographic crosstabs to show that the polls, if anything, slightly oversampled Republicans. The 2016 link also looked at demographics among the exit polls to reach a similar conclusion.</h1>

<p>And your claim that the 2004 exit poll didn&#39;t ask who people voted for is clearly contradicted by the presence of result percentages for Bush and Kerry. When they display it, it&#39;s broken down by demographics (to show <em>why</em> people voted a certain way, as you say). But of course they asked people who they voted for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I think too, but I hadn&#39;t seen that exit polling data before.  My thought immediately after the election is that this was actually a response to Pizzagate.  Think about it, what if the Podesta hacks were directed, by whomever, to hurt the cabal and to begin exposing the kind of shit they were up to <em>under the premise that Hillary would still win</em> which was a fair assumption because she was both a stronger candidate and the one backed by the cabal.  </p>

<p>If Hillary wins, Pizzagate probably doesn&#39;t just blow over as easily as it has.  All of a sudden there is evidence for this HUGE scandal for the sitting president.  Not some scandal for a cast-aside loser who is no longer in the public spot-light.  Also, prior to the election Wikileaks was saying they had months and months of more leaks related to Podesta and Clinton, so why haven&#39;t we seen any of them.  Maybe it&#39;s because wikileaks has been compromised, but maybe it&#39;s because after the election, their source cut them off since the leaks weren&#39;t important/relevant anymore.  But if Hillary was president they would still be really important and would make a huge scandal, and would keep growing evidence that would get increasingly hard for the media and the public to ignore.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exit polls are generally considered ass and can generally be way off the mark. They should be taken as seriously as online polls. </p>

<p>Trump was elected on a perfect storm of shit. The media covered his every move because hes an outragous idiot who says things that get the views. The media tried to force parity between the two candidates whether it was an attempt to create a neck and neck race for ratings or some misguided idea of what neutrality remains to be seen.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that TPTB had both dogs in this race and didn&#39;t give a shit who won. Hillary the status quo or Trump the one who campaigned on raping the country to feed the military industrial complex both are big pay checks for TPTB. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;generally considered ass&quot; by who exactly? By the ever-trustworthy mainstream media, which has constantly pushed that narrative? For the <a href="http://www.organikrecords.com/corporatenewslies/Presidential-Election-2004.pdf">2004 general</a>, <a href="http://electiondefensealliance.org/files/LandslideDenied_v.9_071507.pdf">2006 general</a>, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5O9I4XJdSISNzJyaWIxaWpZWnM/view">2016 Dem primaries</a>, analyses of the exit polls confirmed their accuracy and indicated vote miscount as the more likely reason for discrepancies. That helps confirm their general accuracy. And curiously, exit polls were fairly good until the early 2000s, when electronic voting became widespread.</p>

<p>I do not think we can be certain what calculations TPTB were making. Even when both candidates are controlled (as is basically always the case), they can still have preferences. The 2004 election of Bush vs. Kerry was two fellow Skull-and-Bones members facing off, and Kerry was a pro-corporate Dem. Yet the election was still rigged to put Bush in office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The democratic primary had exit poll discrepancies in favor of clinton in many states especially those with no paper trails. I had many arguments with people about this but most dismissed it because they believe the argument that exit polls aren&#39;t reliable. They were reliable on the republican primary though and they are used in other countries to determine if elections are legit. I think either the media is lying and exit polls are reliable and they discredit them to hide the election fraud, or the exit polls are purposely done in a way to make them unreliable so people can&#39;t ever know if election fraud is being done</p>

<p>As if T_D is not an echo chamber for the most dedicated Trump supporters. There&#39;s no way that it&#39;s representative of Trump supporters as a whole.</p>

<p>Your belief that Trump is not a part of the elite is laughable.

They also did things that were borderline ethical and legal. Very likely they did a few things that were unethical and illegal.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think either leader directly cheated (they aren&#39;t dumb enough to do that), but there may have been some looking the other way, or implying that certain things should be done.</p>

<p>So while I personally don&#39;t think that Clinton directly told her workers to get the CNN interview questions, someone high up probably got them and then gave them to her and Clinton did not refuse to look at them (as she ethically should have).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Her main point in all of her ads was stop Trump.  She didn&#39;t even give people a good reason to vote for her, her health was visibly terrible with her public collapsing and not being able to climb stairs, she hardly made any public appearances compared to Trump, and when she did her crowds were terribly small, she catered to wealthy donors the entire time, alienated the base of her party by not focusing on issues that mattered to them, and just generally being unlikable.  And don&#39;t even get me started on the wikileaks.  She was made to lose.  I didn&#39;t see it then, but looking back now, how could anyone not see it?  Plus we have years and years of predictive programming that show Trump being where he is now.  </p>

<p>On election night my biggest surprise wasn&#39;t that trump won, it was that the electoral process worked! I had seen full trump rallies on tv/YouTube every day but Hillary had to invite LeBron and JayZ to get anyone to show up. And she seemed so devastated that she had lost I feel like they didn&#39;t rig it enough. I do want to believe the electoral process is untainted though, it gives me some hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what he is getting at is if you look at Utah they get a larger percentage of votes compared to their population. This is the same in many lower pop areas. High pop areas tend to have higher cost of living, homeless and traffic, meaning they are more likely to vote dem to help the homeless, increase pay and build more non-toll roads. Lower pop areas don&#39;t need more roads, have low homeless and have a low cost of living so they don&#39;t need more pay, they tend to vote republican for religious reasons and lower taxes. The reason elections are skewed in favor of these low pop areas is because they are overrepresented in their electoral college votes. </p>

<p>California gets a reasonable amount, but places like Utah got 50% more electoral college percentage compared to their actual population percentage. And despite Hill getting 30% of that, 100% still went to trump, both sides complain about the winner take all, but it is a huge factor to why most elections skew towards repub. Seeing how there was a 3million voter deficit and a republican candidate still won should prove that point. Dems need more than a 3million voter lead just to break even. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but the whole point of that was to get the other states to come into the fold of the government to begin with. The larger less populous states didn&#39;t originally want to join for that exact reason. They didn&#39;t want to be outvoted by population dense areas. The united states is bigger than just texas, california, florida and new york. I lived in Florida for a big portion of my life. I would not want this state deciding a majority of the countries outcomes alone. It&#39;s simply not fair to those in less populous states.</p>

<p>Racial tension was slowing down, despite all the white cops killing black people before the election, so now they&#39;re working on stoking the fires between men and women. To poorly paraphrase Nietzsche &quot;Capitalism requires issues for people to focus on so they don&#39;t pay too much attention to their government.&quot; </p>

<p>They want uprisings, easiest way to pacify, disarm and control the populace. So now you have Antifa and Trump supporters (T_D, /pol/) showing up at rallies to fight one another. Both groups speak of arming themselves and weapon training, and both are run by agent provocateurs. So we&#39;ll probably end up with bloodshed at one of these rallies, then we can watch new laws get passed to ban protests and similar demonstrations. </p>

<p>Tl;dr : The election <em>was</em> rigged, they got who they wanted. Anyone can be controlled when you run the world. </p>

<p>ftfy</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at how best to rig the presidential election. The US system is quite decentralized, so you have to have a granular scheme. You want it just big enough in just the right areas to swing the electoral college to your favored candidate. You basically want an outcome exactly like what won Trump the election. Now I don&#39;t happen to believe the election was rigged. But thinking it was rigged in favor of Hillary with zero evidence and a case to made the other way around is just you being biased and ignoring reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, the decentralized nature of the election means that rigging has to be done strategically at local levels. It would be basically impossible to rig the popular vote, however, by targeting the right places, you might be able to win the overall election while losing the popular vote. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally think the election was rigged but if it was you would almost certainly have a popular vote mismatch as you had in this election against Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>every time the GOP and Trump administration does something categorically unpopular</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every day I open reddit to some new and unknown sub on the front page describing something the Trump administration did claiming it categorically unpopular - like eating dinner without bringing the press corps. Whenever Hillary Clinton is mentioned there is a high-probability that there is a negative Trump narrative at the same time. </p>

<p>Cool. Hold both their feet to the fire. No reason to pick sides. Trump needs to hammer-down on those banging the drums of war, not become Bush/Cheney 2.0. Hillary Clinton needs to stop playing fast and loose with classified information trading her power for wealth, not become everything we criticize Snowden for only without the ethical justification. </p>

<p>The corporate media didn&#39;t cover it, but there were reports of exit poll discrepancies in the general. I can only imagine that they didn&#39;t want to legitimize Trump&#39;s complaints that the election might be rigged. Oh, and if they admitted that exit poll discrepancies far outside the margin of error were legitimate evidence of election fraud (they are), then that would be tacitly admitting that the very same type of rigging was used against Bernie Sanders, since there were many states in the Democratic primaries wherein the reported results were far outside the margin of error in Clinton&#39;s favor. And always in Clinton&#39;s favor. </p>

<p>I always imagine that if there IS some secret shadow cabal, it&#39;s not necessarily that simple either. </p>

<p>Their entire game plan would have to revolve around pulling strings and manipulation, not direct involvement, and looking at it that way they might as well have conceded the win to Trump as a way to placate the citizenry. They likely plan much more long term than one presidency or one legislation here and there. They might have thought that temporarily losing the US might not be such a big deal if the EU and the UN are still in their hands.</p>

<p>Gotta think bigger than &quot;muh Obama and Hillary rigged the election&quot;, because they&#39;re more than likely the pawns, not the players.</p>

<p>For one, you&#39;d need a lot of multiple voters to make a substantial dent in the totals. At some point word would get out from these people. And secondly, I think they&#39;d just find an easier way to steal votes. </p>

<p>Voter ID&#39;s are a weak argument, but I also think if the government(federal or state) wanted to give out free voter ID cards, well I&#39;d take them for sure. I just don&#39;t see how it changes anything. People could still fake ID&#39;s or whatever else. </p>

<p>The fact is, the way our election is setup(decentralized) it would be very difficult to organize a massive fraudulent voter campaign. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I see things.... Trump really wasn&#39;t that great of a candidate.  He was beatable.  I think Bernie could have beaten him.</p>

<p>The Dems where strangely blinded by Hillary.  It was like they owed her the White House.  When Bernie got in the way they fixed it.  What the Dem&#39;s refused (and a good many of them continue to do so) to understand was that Hillary was a monumentally bad candidate.  Come election night people just couldn&#39;t be bothered to vote for someone whom was owed the White House.</p>

<p>In short, Hillary was such a bad candidate that she couldn&#39;t even beat Trump.</p>

<p>To the Dems reading this I have this to say - why you guys aren&#39;t practicing scortched Earth against Hillary is one of the great mysteries of our time.  Trump still isn&#39;t that great.  He isn&#39;t going to get better.  There is every opportunity for you to win 2020.  You will not be doing so with any candidate with the last name of Clinton.  If you need Trump to beat Hillary again, Trump will beat Hillary again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking about the climate that produced a &#39;Narrative over Reality&#39; administration, which has proven to be Bannon&#39;s long game. We&#39;re talking about TV stars and television writers. Putin, Trump--the whole team hated Hillary (as do many reasonable people for fair reasons, too, but...) to set the tone of victory and gut punch her is in line with all of the other tactical-level execution of a vindictive strategy meant to produce ratings and followership, not legislation or anything relating to progressiveness. We had the news actively trying to keep up with the intrigue ratings of Sunday night Game of Thrones. I&#39;m not surprised the TV writers won, in terms of helping them keep up. I&#39;m also not surprised that the actors at play are utterly incapable of actually assuming the roles they&#39;ve taken on, now that they&#39;re done chasing cars and have to...just DO things with the presidency...   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gut-punch her? Hmm. Yea, you can keep your reality and I will keep mine. Clinton was/is dangerous. In all seriousness. </p>

<p>Your version of news was GOT. Yours.</p>

<p>What would she have done? I see Trump and Clinton as they are...corrupt. But who has longer been entrenched in political corruption? Clinton. </p>

<p>I am glad she lost. I am honestly, as a woman, so thankful she was not our first female President and Donald Doucheface continues the boring tradition of US President. </p>

<p>Is anyone other than me thinking, how sad it is, that Democrats/Greens/Libretarians have not been able to immediately lift an ethical, moral and just contender in the next election against Trump? What is going on behind closed doors right now? Cause 2016 proved it - they ain&#39;t letting a Sanders or a Gabbard or a Stein or a Johnson hold highest office and actually FIX shit that hurts American society and prosperity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly, the election was &quot;rigged&quot; for Hillary, but not in the traditional sense like an election in a country run by a dictator.</p>

<p>In terms of traditional &quot;rigging&quot;, The US&#39;s election system has somewhat uniform standards but the actual process of administering elections and voting is very decentralized.  Many non-federal people from both parties are involved in most areas making election fraud challenging.  The largest weakness, these days, by FAR are the voting machines themselves.  Those are the weak link in the chain for sure.  Until we can vote via blockchain or something, I don&#39;t see that threat diminishing any time soon.</p>

<p>The real rigging for Hillary happened in the media.  The media (not just news media), almost universally, decided that Hillary was going to be the president and anyone who voted for Trump was a racist, sexist, Nazi, white supremacist bigot.  Every social media site supported Hillary WITH THEIR ACTIONS, with few exceptions.  </p>

<p>They attempted to rig the election by manipulating public opinion, making it seem like Hillary had more support than she did, and making it seem like he had a better chance than she did (through shitty polling).  This is possible becuase the media is mostly centralized.  What they did not count on was the power of the internet and it&#39;s ability to get information through to people.</p>

<p>The big fear now is that these organizations are exploring and patching the weakness that made them lose.  They will not allow another e-mail leak to happen as an October surprise.  They will not allow their political opposition to have their opinion heard on their site.</p>

The fact she got caught under oath lying about her emails, KILLED her candidacy, when a citizen would be indicted and imprisioned. The democratic party shoulda ousted her and put someone else up. When people watched documentaries like &quot;Clinton Chronciles&quot; and &quot;Hillary: the Movie&quot;, it just makes them even more pissed at her.</p>

I don&#39;t like the bitch at all, and she definitely used some Puttin-esque tactics to  fuck Bernie out of the election, which is bullshit, but god damnit I don&#39;t give a fuck about her anymore.

Regarding the presidential voting, there is no evidence of voter fraud (unauthorized or multiple voting). While voting machines could potentially be tampered with, most state governments are under Republican control, so both voter registration and the mechanics of the election were supervised by Republicans</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the 2016 fake voting event was not an election, it was a cheating competition between apologists for evil and the outright evil</p>

<p>and its pretty obvious who won</p>

<p>neither side will allow an investigation for obvious reasons</p>

<p>hillary could not have beaten bernie honestly or trump by cheating, and to me this was obvious before the 36 months of kabuki</p>

<p>hillary is neither bright nor virtuous, shes a bad leader and she should have divorced her husband for obviois reasons</p>

<p>one of the worst people in history but donald is still far far worse</p>

<p>i fully expect trump rapes someone every night of the week</p>

<p>kidnapped bolivian 14 year olds are probably brought to him non demand</p>

<p>its very grim, the system is totalitarian the only aspect out of place is that im still allowed to state the obvious on reddit</p>

<p>In the end Trump won my Illinois county. still very few people come out as Hillary supporters... if it wasn&#39;t for chicago Trump would have had Illinois. yet even in Chicago i do not see much support for hillary.</p>

<p>Now if you are familiar with the jews captivity in isreal you will know that the fire and brimstone was iron oxide hail that landed in the fields and rivers poisoning the water supply and food. So naturally people would want to leave. We are living in the plagues of egypt right now!</p>

<p>On a semi related note China has made plans to move its population to escape the plagues, so has russia, but the united States isn&#39;t. As you can imagine this is really bad for us. Now what it is is that the elites and the powerful don&#39;t want any of us to know that. They want us on the ground and keeping our nose to the grindstone. China has built these ghost cities. in the highlands of their country with no one living there. And everyone said, &quot;look at theses stupid communists&quot; &quot;what jokes&quot;. And they are <em>huge</em> cities! They&#39;re gigantic. Enough to hold seventy million people. They&#39;ve built the entire cities. Interstates, infrastructure, ammenities. All empty. When the flooding starts they are going to move people inland. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect that the DNC and possibly the Deep State conspired to make Hillary the nominee and to have her win the Presidency as part of a deal she made to support Obama&#39;s election and administration. The DNC&#39;s lawyers currently contended that that the DNC is under no obligation to function democratically and that it can support or sabbotage a candidate <em>of their own choosing</em>. So my suspicion isn&#39;t as outrageous as it sounds.  </p>

<p>I suspect there was a great deal of anger from many people who so feel that they were not represented properly by the DNC that they voted Trump as a &quot;fuck you&quot; to our entire corrupt political infrastructure - not that I agree with that choice.  I suspect that another large segment of disheartened democratic voters simply stayed home on election day rather than exercise a repugnant choice.  I think Hillary was her own worse enemy and was not as attractive of a candidate as she needed to be. She was not as progressive as the public wanted even 8 years earlier which is why she lost then and people found her progressive positioning in the primaries reactive to Sanders and transparently hollow.</p>

<p>Collectively it put the election close enough to the point where it could be hijacked and still be plausibly viewed as legitimate - as was George W Bush&#39;s reelection win in Ohio.  To me the telltale sign that Hillary was the real winner was how far off the mark the all pollsters appear to have been (typically they&#39;re not).  I suspect the election was hijacked by multiple forces whose identity we&#39;ll never know because if it came to light that a US presidential election was in fact hijacked (and in truth invalid) the damage to our national standing and identity could be irreparable and not recover (yes it can get even worse than it is now). And if it became public that the Russians were actually involved in this, there would be extreme pressure to retaliate, possibly militarily. I suspect then that if it is true, the deep state will conspire to keep this secret and work to mimimize Trump&#39;s presidency and impact on the deep state&#39;s agenda which appears to be what&#39;s happening.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>If</em> the election was rigged in favor of Hillary (which I do truly believe), then that brings into question <em>how</em> Trump won. I think he&#39;s been setting things up for years in order to have people he trusts in positions where they would be able to let him know/blow the whistle if they saw something fishy. I happen to think she was made aware the night of the election and given the ultimatum to fight it and get the votes illegitimately and Trump would blow it wide open or concede and he would keep a lid on it, and that&#39;s the reason for her not making a speech and leaving her supporters out to dry. She and her camp were going through all the options after finding out what Trump had set up and figuring out how to proceed (recount, contest, blow the whistle on Trump essentially blackmailing them with airing their dirty laundry, etc). Just a theory. No evidence. Send your hate mail. </p>

<p>Anyway, I recall seeing analyses that suggested that there were exit poll discrepancies in both directions depending on the state. In some cases, it appeared that Trump had received more votes than he should have and in others, it appeared that Clinton received more votes that she should have. Not to mention the voter registration purging that either side uses to disenfranchise voters or other voter suppression techniques. I think both sides were cheating as hard as they could and it just so happened that Clinton fucked up by losing states she thought she&#39;d never lose in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure the only cases of illegal voting discovered, or at least publicized, were from Trumpets.  </p>

<p>I doubt she did anything illegal in regards to the actual voting process, but I think it was clear who was on who&#39;s side.  We in America like to think that anybody can do anything, and if this election taught us something, it&#39;s that these institutions that we&#39;ve trusted to treat everyone fairly and with the same equality, are complete bullshit.  If anything, this election has opened the eyes of millions to how the Election and government really work, with favoritism spewed from the top to the bottom.  </p>

<p>The question she was given, eh, didn&#39;t make a real difference.  And, in this country, you&#39;re innocent til proven guilty.  Hillary, as much as we all hated her and &quot;knew&quot; she was a criminal, she wasn&#39;t.  Never convicted, nothing.  But, if this election taught us anything, it&#39;s that people don&#39;t really have morals, or care about the morals of their President and officials.  They didn&#39;t care that Trump had scammed people, that he was a life-long con-artist, that he&#39;d been married several times and probably wants to bang his daughter.  No.  None of that mattered this time.  Her being under investigation was, at this point, OBVIOUSLY a strategy to keep her out of the white house.  So, yes, this system is rigged against everyone, from the top to the bottom.  And the reason Trump did well?  Because he was a celebrity who could fund his own way.  He made it &quot;seem&quot; that anyone could win the Presidency, but the truth is, it&#39;s only going to be people that are rich or well connected.  </p>

<p>Honestly I think they do have to sway within reason which is why they always try to get two equally shitty candidates i.e. the lesser of two evils. If it were Sanders vs Trump and Trump won would there be riots in the streets? 
My theory is that TPTB pulled Clinton when her health started failing and there was no way they could combat the &quot;leak&quot; in Washington.
Plan B: Trump; raised by the swamp, lover of capital and women. Sound like the perfect C.I.A. recruit! I&#39;m not claiming he is C.I.A. rather he can easily manipulated by capital and women. They pushed him since day one for the Republican nomination despite his historically democratic ties. 
&quot;Curiously, Trump’s no stranger to Democratic politics. Most of his contributions in the last 10 years have gone to Democrats and Democratic causes, including the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Hillary in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2007. She was even front-row at his 2005 wedding to current wife Melania Knauss. So is it possible that all the inflammatory rhetoric is in fact a brilliant secret scheme to hand the election over to Clinton?&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>There was one case of double voting nationwide and it was a trump supporter in Des Moines, IA. She was caught immediately. Even if they could have generated extra votes (and they didn&#39;t), why would they put them all in CA and NY instead of Ohio and Pennsylvania?</p>

<p>Most of your list of charges are just factually inaccurate. To rig an election is a huge charge, to be able to rig an election and still manage to lose is to say a huge amount of power was being wielded by the most incompetent handful of people alive, and that can&#39;t be right because the most incompetent people alive are in the white house right now.</p>

<p>You realize the state auditor just wanted this to go away because the thorough investigation would be a FUCK TON of work and cost more than the department can afford, as well as call into question a large number of local elections. Chris Thomas has since announced his retirement, which may just be another one of those coincidences like the myriad of them that caused a recount to be impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pressure is increasing on Republican partisans as the &quot;outsider&quot; trick is becoming less supportable every day. Republicans took power in the 2016 election by a very thin margin. That margin is based upon the propaganda directed at independent types to buy-in to the Trump outsider meme.</p>

<p>They are now desperate to hold onto this new constituency of marginal voters to secure power with thin &quot;victories&quot; in the swing states.</p>

<p>TL;DR R/conspiracy types were fooled by the &quot;outsider,&quot; but they are awakening to the dirty trick now. </p>

<p>The border wall, for instance. He has zero idea how to pay for it, or how much it&#39;s actually going to cost. He doesn&#39;t know if it will actually be effective. If he was truly concerned with stopping Mexican illegal immigration, he&#39;d stop trash talking the Peso. What about places where the border is marked by the Rio Grande?

<p>The mods try not to remove a post as long as it doesn&#39;t break reddit wide rules such as doxxing. Although there have been some highly questionable &quot;unverified&quot; tags used in the past regarding pieces that paint Trump in a negative light.</p>
