    <div class="md"><p>Getting rid of net neutrality will only give more power to ISPs. They will be able to charge different rates based on the content of the data packets rather than the speed or quantity, such that 10mb of data from Facebook might cost you more than 10mb of data from Netflix, or they could do the &quot;package&quot; thing like cable tv does with channel bundles but instead of channels it&#39;s website bundles.

Good luck when you&#39;ll be fighting to over come the search results pushed up ahead of your site, if they&#39;ll even show your site as a result. Since you&#39;re &#39;not one of their paying customers who pays to have their page boosted&#39;; they don&#39;t give a fuck if people go to your page, in fact, it&#39;s better for them if they don&#39;t go to your page and go instead to a paying business&#39; page.  Because with that added site traffic the user will be more likely to buy or use the first site than to search and find yours.</p>

<p>Have you ever been in the grocery store and seen items on sale for the regular price, or even on sale for more than they were the week before?  That deal didnt&#39; get better, they just marked up the price to mark it on sale and hoepfully trick people into thinking they&#39;re getting a deal because it&#39;s now &quot;50% off!&quot; yet it&#39;s the same price as last week.  Same situation.</p>

<p>They advertise speeds, technology gets better, throttle service to stay at same speed, improve network, get bills passed in your favor to exploit your new venture, then keep &quot;same low rates for internet as before&quot; but added bonus availability for speed with a higher rate. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m pretty sure few people actually get the speeds that they&#39;re paying for, I very often see people bitching in my area about slow ass internet and they they call the provider who adjusts some things because they were on vacation last month and the company recognized they&#39;re reduced use and moved that bandwidth elsewhere. Only after calls and complaints do their download/upload rates return to normal.</p>

<p>Either way, you&#39;ve mentioned twice now about things that shouldn&#39;t or can&#39;t be done, that from my experience have seen done; and it&#39;s exactly why I don&#39;t believe most corporations anymore.  They do what they want, until they get caught and deal with a minor slap on the wrist if at all; then they lobby to make the laws beneficial for themselves and exploit everyone else.</p>

<p>I have no faith that a company/corporation will do the &quot;right&quot; thing when the &quot;illegal/wrong&quot; thing is more profitable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the same ISP merged with all the others and just sold you the same Service under different names (T-Mobile owns MetroPCS as an example) so you&#39;re tricked into believing that you have options when you have none. Time-Warner wanting to Merge with Comcast would have given one entity about 65% of the whole US market and in some areas that would&#39;ve been 100%. So, there&#39;s a monopoly but, granted it&#39;s only a Monopoly in a few areas and probably have enough power to force the other carriers to do what they want in the others. </p>

<p>A good example is in Georgia where I live, although not related to the internet, A Southern Company has a literal legal Monopoly on electricity in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida​. I know this because, I wanted to start a Solar business and saw that A Southern Company set the price per Watt and basically forced me to never start because, I could make no profit. </p>

<p>Wheeler held generally pro-NN inclinations going back well before he even joined the FCC. Arguing that Obama influenced his policy is disingenuous because the Obama administration didn&#39;t even wade into the FCC/NN debate until very, <em>very</em> late in the game -- mere <em>weeks/months</em> before the Title II vote.</p>

<p>Let there be NO misunderstanding, Ajit Pai (and Michael O&#39;Reilly) is(are) <strong><em>Republican Party</em></strong> shills placed there by Mitch McConnell many years ago -- nominated by Obama in a &quot;reaching across the aisle&quot; gesture at the behest of Mitch.</p>

<p>Neither Pai nor O&#39;Reilly have ANY prior experience (technical or otherwise) that qualifies them for positions at the FCC. The Trump Admin&#39;s move of Ajit Pai from commissioner to chairman is nothing more than a &quot;this piece is in position, time to play it&quot;.</p>

<p>They are ISP shills inasmuch as that flows naturally out of the Republican Party&#39;s long-lived Pro-Business-At-Any-And-All-Cost agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump supporters specifically, or just supposed conservatives? I think the reasoning that is used against net neutrality on the surface is supposedly that they don&#39;t like the government intervening. The idea that more regulation doesn&#39;t fix regulation problems. </p>

<p>What we currently have are monopolies in place that have ruined how people receive service. Those monopolies are in place in small part due to government regulation. Now, what people want to do is put in more regulation which makes them upset. </p>

<p>The difference though, is instead of acknowledging the issue, and coming up with a solution, they want to oppose any efforts to actually fix it. They don&#39;t seem to understand that companies don&#39;t self regulate in a market place that has already stifled and killed off any competition. This fully eliminates any and all reason not to do something to fix the problem. Since they haven&#39;t come up with any plans, just opposition, their position has always been &quot;let the market sort it out&quot; despite cities deciding to create their own ISPs as voters approve of them, or other solutions. They want to create the illusion of competition, but aren&#39;t interested in letting it come about or flourish.</p>

<p>Now, what I have stated is a generalisation of conservatives, and there will be outliers, but the policies that have been put in place, and the conversations I have been privy to have all gone this way. Those outliers can speak up, but they likely aren&#39;t speaking for their party, just themselves. None of what I have said gives liberals a pass either, as there are just as many problems with the way they view the world as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it was instituted under Obama.</p>

<p>They put people in charge of the departments who hate the department.  It&#39;s part of the &quot;not a traditional politician&quot; bit.  Tear it all down.  Fuck if it&#39;s useful or not, tear that shit down because regulation is bad.</p>

<p>So they defund the ones they can, and here, they just put in a guy who has all the power to tear it down from the top without needing a lot of extra help.</p>

<p>It started in January before the inauguration.  He immediately dropped a bill that would have force cable companies to allow 3rd party cable boxes.</p>

<p>Then, in february, they dropped subsidies for low income internet access.  Then he announced &quot;Net Neutrality all must go&quot;.  Then comcast rolled out a fee for people using a roku instead of a cable box.  $5.  So you now have to pay them to rent their shitty cable box, or pay them to use your own device instead.  Either way, they&#39;re getting that $5 from you.  The old FCC would have blocked this.</p>

<p>He was put in place to destroy the FCC because it was doing so well under Obama.  We thought Wheeler was going to be an ex-Verizon corporate shithead, but the guy ended up really doing some great things for consumers.  Net Neutrality being one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many Republicans that I know think the government is inept and that the Internet would be better if the government didn&#39;t have a hand in it.  They don&#39;t think telecommunications companies will use the lack of NN to screw over customers because on the free market those customers would be able to just find another provider. They think NN reduces competition between ISPs and that the consumer pays the price. The whole regional monopoly thing doesn&#39;t really resonate with them because many of them live in rural areas and just got high speed internet pretty recently. They think in the city there is bound to be lots of competition and that one can easily vote with their wallets. They don&#39;t realize that without NN and with government sanction monopolies that the mega ISPs will become even more tyrannical than they already are.</p>

<p>Seriously though, even most libertarians I know are pro net neutrality. It doesn&#39;t make sense for an industry with a natural monopoly like ISPs to be able to discriminate against traffic or charge more to reach certain sites. The internet is a utility, not just a service that most could do without. It&#39;s way to ingrained in our world now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likewise. I got in a heated discussion with a co-worker over it who identifies as a strict libertarian (the type that, if a model existed, would prefer to have a private police and military over a publicly funded one). His outlook is that they are a business and the government shouldn&#39;t tell them what they can and cannot do with their privately created and funded service. Period. No other ways to around it. Even if they may have accepted public money at some point to expand, the company itself isn&#39;t publicly owned or operated, therefore the gov&#39;t shouldn&#39;t tell them how to manage their own data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s not the right way to say, but we&#39;ve all been affected by the internet for a long time now, and privacy has been the biggest factor of it. From Facebook to Windows 10, we&#39;ve been largely affected by them (in terms of privacy).</p>

<p>To keep it short, i believe that we should have some power over what businesses such as Facebook to even ISPs are trying to do to gain advantage over what we do on the internet just for the sake of making a ton of money behind the scenes. And being vocal about it, raising our own unique opinions to issues like this is what makes businesses guessing (and not put them into being dominant in a certain market while they freely use any internet activity that we do for their own purposes - like Google for example) and be &quot;respectful&quot; for our privacy in our lives. I believe that by focusing on major issues such as Net Neutrality being offered freely for ISPs to use for their own gains, we can make USA (and probably the rest of the world) a better place.</p>

<p>Hopefully you can understand what i&#39;m trying to say. Most of these things go under our naked eyes and whatever the result this will give us right now will surely affect the outcomes in the future. It&#39;s why everyone needs to fight together for these issues. </p>

<p>I get the emotion, in that you (and others) just want the world to be nice. I&#39;m not sure if people realize what they&#39;re suggesting though.</p>

<p>Like in regards to google or facebook, do you think people should be stopped from supplying personal data or that the company should be forced to never use this data after the people supply it free of charge? I assume it&#39;s the later, except these companies provide a free service in exchange for peoples privacy. So if these companies can no longer have your privacy, then they will lose their business model. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the latter, but this is a business world and of course it will definitely ruin their business model (i mean most corporations are based on taking personal info for ad uses).</p>

<p>Still, it&#39;s not so easy to abandon these corporations when it&#39;s an essential need for anyone in their lives these days.</p>

<p>Just trying to say that giving the pressure (aka voicing opinions in relation to certain changes and stuff) to these corporations can probably eliminate their total domination and freedom of using private and personal user data for their own gains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gone <em>from</em>? The US was never established to be a full democracy. It has <em>always</em> been a lauded elite seeking to secure their property and profits, be it against the rebellious proles or foreign powers that were threats to their established power. There is a lot of nostalgia for a theoretical historical vision of a democratic USA. The closest you might have gotten was in the aftermath of the war and before the implementation of the US Constitution, and only on a state by state basis.</p>

<p>Actual grassroots democracy always fails. India, Egypt, Iran, France, Germany, China, and Russia are all testaments to that throughout the 2 centuries. Either the rebellion is hijacked and usurped by a powerful extremist elite (because a peasant revolt can&#39;t have enough organizational rigidity to survive) or the global elite outside of the rebellion starve the country post-revolt of trade and support until it devolves into anarchy and a puppet can be put in its place. Or they just put the puppet in directly, through the first method.</p>

<p>When &quot;We, the People&quot; was written, it was written by a room full of white aristocratic men who all encompassed the colonies 1% elite landowners who feared the enforcement of British tarrifs and more relevantly regulations and laws they had the luxury of ignoring completely for the better part of half a century because Britain was too busy fighting wars in Europe to enforce the law in the colonies. For most of that time period, the colonies were absolute oligarchy, where bought off governors enforced the will of this same group of aristocrats. They took an extreme measure to preserve their fortunes and power structure, but succeeded feasting on the blood of the poor and a promise of prosperity few got to participate in, intentionally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im confused what point you are trying to make.</p>

<p>The democratic obama administration ended up formally protecting net neutrality. all democratic candidates in last election vowed to protect it.</p>

<p>the republicans are trying to kill it. i understand that you may have other issues more important to you causing you to vote republican, but a vote for a republican is a vote against net neutrality. a vote for a democrat is a vote for net neutrality.</p>

<p>these are just basic unarguable facts.</p>

<p>Why is that confusing? The Liberal media was saying Hillary was winning 90% when in fact all of us know she was not. </p>

<p>So who is controlling / manipulating the press?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>vote republican</p>

<p>Who said I did? Are you projecting or just assuming based on zero facts? </p>

<p>I enjoy seeing how easy the young minds can be swayed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no one with any credibility was saying she was winning 90%, good lord...</p>

<p>the polls were accurately showing her ahead by a few points but could not call the states that decided the electoral college.</p>

<p>the american people soundly rejected trump by millions of votes in the popular election. he only won the electoral college by around 70k votes.</p>

<p>for someone claiming to be wise, old, and unswayed by propaganda you have a shocking lack of common sense and seem unable to grasp basic facts. most likely you are trapped in a right wing facebook bubble though :(</p>

<p>these false equivalencies, and what aboutisms are why it is so easy for politicians to get away with being bought - you claim to have a certain stance on an issue but then vote for a politician with the opposite stance and whine that the opposition (who actually agrees with you) isnt perfect</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine I&#39;ll give you a crazy conspiracy rant. Here we go. </p>

<p>What does one internet law example have to do with another internet law example? I&#39;m sorry if you think all we should care about is Net Neutrality, but I have the expectation that politicians understand the mentality and purpose of the internet. It&#39;s not enough that they happen to cave to pressure one time because that just means they&#39;ll go right back to the same shit. It&#39;s clear neither party knows what to do with the internet, so how about you stop trying to make your party look good. Also, let&#39;s not accuse me of voting one way or another. Not that it&#39;s any of your business, but I&#39;d never vote main party. </p>

<p>You want to know what the problem is? You want to know why politicians are so easily purchased? Easy: Two-Party System, and the fact that everyone plays along with it because they&#39;re too scared to split the vote. Big shock, but when you only have two shitty options you lose the ability to punish them. If one party goes way too far with something (like, idk rigging their primaries), the only option to punish them is the opposite party. The lesser of two evils just sets the standard for how evil you can get away with being. Best case scenario: No change.  More likely both parties get a little bit eviler. They have no incentive to get less evil because the corruption we call evil keeps them in power. The money as speech, the redrawing of political maps, and other rigging of elections at various levels with various that happens with both parties all that crap that&#39;s attached to the two party system makes out politicians easy to buy.</p>

<p>Of course we&#39;re losing the internet. It&#39;s the biggest tool to organize against the purchasing of politicians. Not a damn thing we can do but fix the two party crap and everything that comes with it (money as speech, first past post, gerrymandering, etc etc etc) if we want to stop this crap. But what do we do? Do we try to fix all the things leading to the loss of the internet? Nope! We blame the other party! Because it&#39;s so easy to believe other party is <em>evil</em> and our party while not perfect is a way better than them and if only our party had control of the everything things would be just dandy. Jesus, what a bullshit fantasy. You want to know what would be happening right now if the democrats had swept everything? Roughly the same fucking thing. There&#39;d be some different issues, sure, but we&#39;d still be facing this net neutrality issue. There would still be concerns of mass corruption. Our democracy would still be headed right down the drain. I mean it&#39;s great that the democrats get to complain about all these issues since they lost, but we didn&#39;t hear a word of it from them until they lost so there&#39;s not a doubt in my mind the republicans would be in the same place if the roles were switched. </p>

<p>The two parties are exactly the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to this because for whatever reason it hasnt been stated. Obama administration and Hillary Clinton were for TPP, and those who know what the TPP was (which was shut down but Donald Trump via excutive order) knows that it wouldve destroyed internet neutrality. </p>

<p>Soo this whole &quot;b-b-but its the republicans!&quot; is complete and utter bullshit, the Democrats were pushing the TPP as hard as they could and they probably would have succeeded if it was planned earlier and Obama had more time with it, or if Hillary won.</p>

<p>FCC is still a threat though, internet neutrality is one of the few things keeping the status quo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I scoff when I see a video removed for being political. There was a span of months on <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> where every top post video was a black man telling other blacks to be good little negroes and listen to the white man. Can&#39;t recall any of those being removed. Many were gilded in fact. Police abuse videos regularly get removed for witch hunting or politics. It&#39;s all perspective and spin, videos get removed when they violate THEIR politics.</p>

<p>Seriously though, even most libertarians I know are pro net neutrality. It doesn&#39;t make sense for an industry with a natural monopoly like ISPs to be able to discriminate against traffic or charge more to reach certain sites. The internet is a utility, not just a service that most could do without. It&#39;s way to ingrained in our world now. </p>
