<p>CO2 and it&#39;s affect on the atmosphere is chemistry, not magic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only <em>effects</em> of CO2 on the planet that we can measure reliable have been wholly positive. Deserts are shrinking. Forests are expanding. Trees are taller and thicker. Rain forests are recovering. Food crops are much larger. All thanks to the increase in the amount of CO2 in the air. CO2 is plant food. It is also completely harmless to living things in the asmosphere. It is not causing global warming. When the climate warms, CO2 then goes up ... it trails after the rise in temperature, it does not come before it. All this is documented many times over.</p>

<p>They tell us that global and local sea levels are different, and then say that the global level is increasing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently went and saw Gwynne Dyer talk to a crowd about his book Climate Wars. He investigated the military interest in global warming and found that they could shut down the borders from people fleeing the tropics and sub tropics. The last point he made was that it looks like geo engineering is going to be made reality, and it looks like the tool of choice is to spray into the atmosphere to reflect a portion of the Suns energy. I do not like this idea as it could go horribly wrong with no way to correct it after it has been done.</p>

<p>The way I see it is that if the elite know that global warming is going to reshape the planet in 50 years, they would protect themselves before the people. We are shown ways that we can slow it and insinuate we can stop it, but never mention how we can prepare and adapt.</p>

<p>This sub has discussed the police state and military plans for cities of the future, and I believe these to be connected to global warming. If we allow those with power to decide how to move forward from here it will not be to protect us nor the billions of other people in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think anything that is shoved down our throats as aggressively as man made climate change should be met with skepticism. Al Gore has been shown to be full of shit and has become a wealthy man in the process. The main proponent of CC has been the UN, and this should make us automatically skeptical. The UN HQ was built in NY on land that had been bought and then donated by the Rockefellers for this exact purpose. As we all know, this family are proud globalists and eugenicists. David Rockefeller was crucial in the founding of the Bilderberg group, the CFR and the Trilateral Commission. </p>

<p>The influence of these organisations on geopolitics and the current state of world affairs cannot be understated. Al Gore was also a member of the Trilateral Commission. These people are obsessed with population control and the implementation of a new economic system that would be made possible under a one world government. The CC scare has been the perfect cover for this to come about. The fact that everyone has bought into this shit scares the fuck out of me. In my home state, the government is in the process of constructing the biggest battery storage grid the country has seen. All part of sustainable development. Brave new world here we come. </p>

<p>&quot;This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for the, at least, 150 years, since the industrial revolution,” </p>

<p>&quot;Some even believe we [Rockefeller family] are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - One World, if you will.If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&quot;</p>

<p>David Rockefeller, Memoirs </p>

<p>The common enemy of humanity is man. In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these
dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through
changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given the current geography of Earth and stage of the Milankovitch cycle we expect that the planet has settled around a climate mean that varies naturally due to competing feedback mechanisms. For instance, warmth increases evaporation over time leading to an increase in cloud cover that leads to natural cooling. Milankovitch cycles play a role in overturning the current climate regime on the order of thousands of years. Within those cycles climate varies around a mean on the order of hundreds of years. Within those hundreds year periods are the short term modifiers such as ENSO. What we conclude is that climate is dynamic rather than (more or less) static as AGW insists. Climate may only effect the thin skin and atmosphere of Earth, but that is still a very large area that takes time to warm and time to cool. Feedback mechanisms can&#39;t shift temperature trends quickly.</p>

<p>Understanding the role of CO2 in the AGW hypothesis is vital to understanding the theory behind AGW, and where it comes up short.. CO2 is a very weak GHG. It&#39;s transparent to all but three narrow bands of infra-red (IR), 2.7, 4.3 and 15 micrometers (µM). The AGW hypothesis states that the effect of CO2 alone would be undetectable if it weren&#39;t for the feedback of water vapour (WV) in the atmosphere. WV is by far the most active GHG. CO2 raises temperature slightly, being enough to cause a slight increase in evaporation from the oceans. WV in the air is 25X to 100X the amount of CO2, depending on local humidity. WV is far less transparent to IR, with several wide bands of opacity, <a href="http://www.gisagmaps.com/storage/articles/satellite-data-atmospheric-correction-precipitable-water-eff/Guzzi%20and%20Rizzi%201984%20Water%20vapor%20absorption%20in%20the%20visible%20and%20near%20infrared%20-%20results%20of%20field%20measurements.pdf">0.68 - 1.05</a>, with strong responses at <a href="http://en.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enwiki/7803742">2.5, 1.95, and 1.45 µM, and weak at 1.2, 0.97 µM</a>. It&#39;s the increase in WV that is thought to cause a global heating response to increased CO2.</p>

<p>AGW comes down to the WV response. We&#39;re told that a doubling of CO2 will raise the global temperature 2 degrees. That 2 degree figure assumes that increased WV will increase the rate of high altitude cloud formation which act to reflect incoming IR. AGW is thought to be self-limiting in that cloud formation will adapt to a new normal of higher CO2 and so modulate warming. There is no accurate model for that since there had not been much work done concerning rates of cloud cover or cloud formation. </p>

<p><a href="https://www-pls.llnl.gov/?url=science_and_technology-earth_sciences-moisture">This report</a> from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory tells us that humidity increase should be 6-7% per 1C temperature rise. That figure is close to the observed increase in global humidity, which is not definitive owing to the problems of measurement prior to our most modern techniques. Ultimately, there are unknown factors as well as known factors that have not been adequately modeled. Value estimates input into computer simulations give a wide range of results. So, the problem with getting a definitive agreement on long-term effects stems from an imperfect understanding of the climate-regulating factors that go into the predictive climate models.  </p>

<p>But more than anything else that dogs AGW believers is that the lengthy and very cool period we call the Little Ice Age (LIA) which ended ~1850. Temperatures have had nowhere to go but up. And now we have paleo evidence from plant stomata which tells us that the current warming is likely less than what occured during the MWP (Medieval Warming Period) and RWP (Roman Warming period). You may have heard about the &quot;Mann-stick&quot; which has been debunked. Mann used a technique to manipulate his data so as to get rid of the MWP and lend credence to the idea that Earth&#39;s climate does not change once it settles into an inter-glacial period. That idea was critical for AGW.</p>

<p>In response to new paleo data which confounds the AGW hypothesis, the AGW militants came up with a new sales tactic - the rate of warming today is faster than any other previous warming due to CO2. So now they accept natural cycles but claim to have intimate knowledge of temperature variations such that they can determine, and tease from the paleo data, temperature changes below 1C. That&#39;s ludicrous since we all know that samples degrade the farther back we go. The fact is that there is no hard temperature data from prior to the modern period of instrumentation, so any claim made about the rate of change is just smoke.</p>

<p>If anything else comes to mind don&#39;t hesitate to ask.  </p>
