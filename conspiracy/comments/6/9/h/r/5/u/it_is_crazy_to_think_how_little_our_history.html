       I'm 16 and I came across this sub a few months ago. I study history at school and its honestly crazy how the teachers believe censorship is not a thing anymore and that we should be lucky that we have free speech when we really don't. The discoveries I've seen on this sub made me realise how brain washed everyone is.

       Yup. If you want to know history you're going to have to teach yourself.

       I can give you some authors, only because most of these guys don't have one Magnus opus that encompasses everything. I'd recommend rereading sentences and paragraphs over and over again until you feel you have a good understanding. Remember, there is no filler in these books - they're not trying to make a 200-page book 300 pages so they have a better chance of landing on a best-seller list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nikola Tesla - In my opinion one of, if not THE, smartest man in the last few hundred years. Had a better understanding of this planet than anyone else. Solutions to free energy, living with nature. I believe when he was in his 80's he was living a life that was spent experimenting over 20 hours a day on a diet of milk, honey, and some fruits. he said he only required 1-2 hours a sleep a night.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Greeks - Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Pythareous - Supringly easier to understand. All there concepts are weighed with reason. Start with 'Allegory of the Cave'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, Aristotle was specifically chosen to tutor Alexander the Great because of his intellect. Alexander later went on to rule most of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Graham Hancock will give you a modern understanding of civilizations that is years ahead of mainstream history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Francis Bacon - Recently started reading him myself.

       Which is why it's incredibly important to maintain a sort of mental balance. I have no doubt many great minds have gone off the deep end and "burned out" before they were able to influence/affect in any substantial manner.

       You are way ahead of the game to be "awakened" at only 16.  It took me until I was 23 to learn of the NWO agenda and become awakened.

       You will come to discover that virtually everything that is taught to us by the "Establishment" (big corporate media, Hollywood, government, public schools) is a deception.  Satan and his minions have (temporary) power in this world.  Thanks mostly to the internet, however, there is a mass awakening to the truth.

       History teacher here and while that's true for most teachers, I always tried to plant seeds of doubt in my students. I never tried to tell my students "that the history of certain events is settled" and look no further.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the best measures of the job I was doing is when a student would approach me and say "So I was doing some research last night" and then they'd bring up some obscurely known fact and I knew they were on the path of red-pilling themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad I found the truth on my own.  I always try and give a little nudge to my students so they can discover the truth for themselves when they're ready...

       No respect for history teachers. No offense. But even when I was in high school some time where this snowflake shit was just a fringe iceberg on the horizon, I recognized them unquestionably pushing the narrative of things with no imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       I liked my Civics teach in my senior  year. He made us recite in front of the class every amendment almost verbatim. If we did that, we passed his class. He was very constitutionally oriented and refrained from injecting his opinion or colored perspective in any case. He even made us sit in on a live court hearing for 3 class days.
      </p>
      <p>
       We walked from the school to the courthouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was very focused on making sure students had a strong grasp of their constitutional rights and the division and ideal function of the 3 branches of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's one of 3 teachers I left school respecting in all my years (college included).

       There are lots of good books out there about various aspects of history, but it would take too long to teach them all or some meaningful subset of them in hs history class. Just look at JFK's murder for example, there are hundreds of books about this one topic. You could never cover them all in hs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you are smarter than I was at your age so I say you should read about whatever topic interests you. You can pick up used books for $1 from the internet so this is a good tool also.

       Actually, There were many teachers who taught specs of truth...but I am talking about the 90s. Now, they will immediately fire anyone who doesn't tow the mainstream line. It doesn't matter what profession. How can teachers teach real truth when their paychecks depend on them teaching the propaganda? I think they call this period the "post truth" area.

       There is no truth to be found here nor is critical thought truly encouraged; not from me, nor these guys cheering you on, not from anyone. Go read philosophy, study math and science, and leave things like conspiracy theories until 10 years from now. Just go live for awhile and avoid social media like a plague. It is the ultimate advertising and propaganda avenue. We know
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what everyone says and does on these sites, every word and click, and we put it to use to push narratives. Anyone telling you about how woke they are and how woke you are for agreeing with them is just someone encouraging you to be deluded with them, or someone selling you a pack of lies. Etc, etc.

       There was this really crazy time in my life where I had to basically unlearn most of the things school taught me. It was called my 20's. There's a lot of pretty little lies we feed children, and now I realize it's to get them to sign up repeatedly for their own slavery. By the time you even begin to realize what's going on, you're an adult and locked in. You've already made a lot of bad choices based on false or erroneous information.

       This is how the United States Corporation perpetuates itself. By preying on innocent children. Welcome to the Resistance, OP.

       Show her how propaganda is also legal too since 2011. They abolished a law that made them honest before, or at least try to be. Just like how Nestle' made water a "Need" instead of a Right. They are altering history right before our eyes.

       OP, if there's one thing I could tell my 16 year old self, it would be to read 1000 times more books.  Seriously.  The internet is way too enormous a source of dopamine rushes and can leave you seriously scatter-brained.  So the sooner you can get hooked on the long-term reward and mental exercise of reading substantial non-fiction books, the better.

       This is a list of books I've recently added to my list of things to get to, they're from assorted topics, but are mostly political or stuff I've seen mentioned around this sub.

       remember to question everything, not just main stream thinking and main stream media, there is just as much disinfo on here/ in the conspiracy world as there is out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       the two biggest questions are "who would benefit?" and "how would they benefit?"

       My history teacher was into JFK. We were too dumb to care, but If we asked him about the assassination, he go on and on the whole period. No one listened, we just did it to not have to work -- now I'd like to be back in that class.

       I also never respected history teachers... until I had a good one. I'm glad you had at least 3 teachers who made an impact. Honestly, I have to agree. All to often history teachers literally recite what's in the textbook. And so much of what's in those textbooks is either complete bullshit or only tells 1/2 the story.

       I understand where you're coming from but I am not your average teacher. You would have loved my class!! Cheers ;)
