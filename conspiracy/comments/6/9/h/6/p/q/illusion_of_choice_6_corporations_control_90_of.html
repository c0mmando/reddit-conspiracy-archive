       Showing these numbers to your family and friends might help them realize that much of the world really is controlled by a small percentage of people. Sources:

       I couldn't find a "credible" list related to the Rothschilds and banking (hm, wonder why) but
       <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2013/11/complete-list-of-banks-ownedcontrolled.html">
        here's
       </a>
       the link anyways
      </p>
      <p>
       I've realized that one of the best ways to see the media control first hand is during commercial breaks... Notice how all of them seem to go on commercial at the same time, forcing us to have advertisement after advertisement shoved down our throats. Channels don't have to compete for viewers anymore because they're all owned by the same corporations who make billions in profit annually via media advertisements from the same corporations who control almost all of the goods we buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2014,
       <a href="http://time.com/96303/tv-commercials-increasing/">
        36%
       </a>
       of an hour-long TV show was dedicated to commercials and I would argue that the percentage is higher now, but because the study hasn't been updated, we don't know for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2016,
       <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272314/advertising-spending-in-the-us/">
        $195.76bil
       </a>
       was spent on media advertisementsin America and Statista has projected that number to rise to $242.77bil by 2020. Worldwide,
       <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Total-Media-Ad-Spending-Growth-Slows-Worldwide/1012981">
        $569.65bil
       </a>
       was spent on media advertisements in 2015 and is projected to rise to $719.20bil by 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and as a side note, did you know that America and New Zealand are the only 2 countries who allow
       <a href="https://www.drugwatch.com/featured/big-pharma-marketing/">
        direct-to-consumer ads
       </a>
       for prescription drugs? That link has a lot of great information related to Big Pharma and advertising but here are some of the most notable things I found:
      </p>
      <p>
       -In 2015, Big Pharma spent record breaking $5.4bil on direct to consumer ads, and "the bulk of these ads appear on TV at a rate of 80 ads per hour of programming."
      </p>
      <p>
       -The amount of money spent on Big Pharma ads has increased by 60% over the past 4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The $5.4bil paid off for Big Pharma in 2015 because Americans spent a record $457bil on prescription drugs that same year.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The top 4 TV networks (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox) take the majority of the advertisement budget, and CBS profited the most, bringing in $511mil
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/11/big-pharmaceutical-companies-are-spending-far-more-on-marketing-than-research/">

        I gotta get back to work so I'll try to add more info later but hopefully this is enough to show how much consumerism has taken over the globe and how consolidation and control are the reason the 1% continue to line their pockets, leaving the rest of us out to dry.

       I get where you're coming from but I don't wish that at all... Being rich is one thing but being rich and having so much power is entirely different. No one should have that much power, regardless of their wealth.

The company that makes the narcotic painkiller OxyContin and three current and former executives pleaded guilty in federal court to criminal charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the drug’s risk of addiction and its potential to be abused.  Company sales officials were allowed to draw their own fake scientific charts which showed a lower addictive potential, which they then distributed to doctors.

       Yes, it's all controlled by a fairly small group of people.

       But that doesn't mean we can't fix it. Most of the problems we're concerned about can be fixed in a very short time, so long as we focus on solutions and build consensus around them.

       Funny I, or more accurately Jon Ronson, can answer that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his book "The Psychopath Test", which I recommend, he retold an account of an early psychologist or psychiatrist who attempted to break the mental defenses or render the power of the psychopaths mind lessened or momentarily compromised via LSD therapy in a prison setting........all sitting around completely naked to emphasise the openness inducing, vulnerability aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       One psycho. Jon spoke to unfortunately simply said it enabled him to be a better psychopath and gave him more insight into how to better manipulate people including the psychiatrist one would assume.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny huh.

       I don't mean to get biblical, but America has given the devil a platform to recreate the world in his own image. Who knows, maybe this new world is better than one some god would have created.

       So your "source" cites as its "source" a chart found on reddit? Lol.  The OP tosses a bunch of random facts around like its some kind of evidence.  Even admits he cant find a credible source to prove his BS claim that all global banking is controlled by one family.
