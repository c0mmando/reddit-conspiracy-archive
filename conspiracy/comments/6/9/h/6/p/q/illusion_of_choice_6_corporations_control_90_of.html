        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Showing these numbers to your family and friends might help them realize that much of the world really is controlled by a small percentage of people. Sources: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6">6 corporations</a> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com:80/these-10-corporations-control-almost-everything-you-buy-2012-4">10 corporations and goods</a> <a href="https://timeline.com/commission-presidential-debates-history-725e0be8def">Presidential Debates</a> I couldn&#39;t find a &quot;credible&quot; list related to the Rothschilds and banking (hm, wonder why) but <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2013/11/complete-list-of-banks-ownedcontrolled.html">here&#39;s</a> the link anyways </p>

<p>I&#39;ve realized that one of the best ways to see the media control first hand is during commercial breaks... Notice how all of them seem to go on commercial at the same time, forcing us to have advertisement after advertisement shoved down our throats. Channels don&#39;t have to compete for viewers anymore because they&#39;re all owned by the same corporations who make billions in profit annually via media advertisements from the same corporations who control almost all of the goods we buy. </p>

<p>In 2014, <a href="http://time.com/96303/tv-commercials-increasing/">36%</a> of an hour-long TV show was dedicated to commercials and I would argue that the percentage is higher now, but because the study hasn&#39;t been updated, we don&#39;t know for sure. </p>

<p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272314/advertising-spending-in-the-us/">$195.76bil</a> was spent on media advertisementsin America and Statista has projected that number to rise to $242.77bil by 2020. Worldwide, <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Total-Media-Ad-Spending-Growth-Slows-Worldwide/1012981">$569.65bil</a> was spent on media advertisements in 2015 and is projected to rise to $719.20bil by 2019.  </p>

<p>Oh and as a side note, did you know that America and New Zealand are the only 2 countries who allow <a href="https://www.drugwatch.com/featured/big-pharma-marketing/">direct-to-consumer ads</a> for prescription drugs? That link has a lot of great information related to Big Pharma and advertising but here are some of the most notable things I found:</p>

<p>-In 2015, Big Pharma spent record breaking $5.4bil on direct to consumer ads, and &quot;the bulk of these ads appear on TV at a rate of 80 ads per hour of programming.&quot; </p>

<p>-The amount of money spent on Big Pharma ads has increased by 60% over the past 4 years. </p>

<p>-The $5.4bil paid off for Big Pharma in 2015 because Americans spent a record $457bil on prescription drugs that same year. </p>

<p>-The top 4 TV networks (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox) take the majority of the advertisement budget, and CBS profited the most, bringing in $511mil </p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/11/big-pharmaceutical-companies-are-spending-far-more-on-marketing-than-research/">Big pharma spends more on marketing than on research</a> </p>

<p><em>I gotta get back to work so I&#39;ll try to add more info later but hopefully this is enough to show how much consumerism has taken over the globe and how consolidation and control are the reason the 1% continue to line their pockets, leaving the rest of us out to dry.</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny I, or more accurately Jon Ronson, can answer that. </p>

<p>In his book &quot;The Psychopath Test&quot;, which I recommend, he retold an account of an early psychologist or psychiatrist who attempted to break the mental defenses or render the power of the psychopaths mind lessened or momentarily compromised via LSD therapy in a prison setting........all sitting around completely naked to emphasise the openness inducing, vulnerability aspect.</p>

<p>One psycho. Jon spoke to unfortunately simply said it enabled him to be a better psychopath and gave him more insight into how to better manipulate people including the psychiatrist one would assume.</p>

<p>Funny huh.</p>
