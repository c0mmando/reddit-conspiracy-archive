<p>In the US, there are opposing media even if small and not all people can be easily influenced as a result.</p>

<p>Le Pen moderated her views somewhat from the early days of the national front but they are still a far right party by virtue of their policies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of Le Pen&#39;s policies would be seen as left leaning by rational people. Her only right policies are:</p>

<p>*Close extremist mosques.
*Get tough on immigration.</p>

<p>In reality, shutting extremist mosques and tackling terrorism should be seen as centrist. Telling people they just have to live with terrorism, which is Macron&#39;s position, should be seen as the extremist view.</p>

<p>If the media are judging politicians left/right position solely on their nationalist/globalist position, then Macron should be described as far left. Islamic terrorism should be described as far left.</p>

<p>Nazis are more a part of yout history than anybody else. It boggles my mind how many of your people believe the lies of the media and do not know that Nazis are left wing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they&#39;re not the same. Macron backs German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s policies to welcome refugees from Syria. Le Pen is very much against this.</p>

<p>When did I say Le Pen is extreme left wing?</p>

<p>The Nazis were left-wing socialists. The National Socialist Workers Party of Germany, otherwise known as the Nazi Party, was socialist and it had a lot in common with the modern left. Hitler preached class warfare, agitating the working class to resist “exploitation” by capitalists , particularly Jewish capitalists, of course. Their programs called for the nationalization of education, health care, transportation, and other major industries. They instituted and vigorously enforced a strict gun control regimen. They encouraged pornography, illegitimacy, and abortion, and they denounced Christians as right-wing fanatics. Yet a popular myth persists that the Nazis themselves were right-wing extremists. This insidious lie biases the entire political landscape today.</p>

<p>America didn&#39;t experience tragedies and bloodshed as you guys did. We joined the war rather late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said IF you judge one&#39;s left/right position solely on their nationalist/globalist position, THEN Islamic terrorism should be described as far left.</p>

<p>Different experts come up with different opinions on whether the Nazis were left/right depending on what your definition of left/right Is. Many opinions I&#39;ve read suggest that the Nazis are right, but some others say left. </p>

<p>According to a popular misconception, the Nazis must have been on the political right because they persecuted communists and fought a war with the communists in Russia. This specious logic has gone largely unchallenged because it serves as useful propaganda for the left, which needs “right-wing” atrocities to divert attention from the horrific communist atrocities of the past century. Hence, communist atrocities have received much less publicity than Nazi war crimes, even though they were greater in magnitude by any objective measure.</p>

<p>What that means is : Communists (or “Marxist Socialists”)  have killed far more people during the last century than the Nazis (“National Socialists”) ever did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m but you&#39;re very, very wrong if you think that the Nazis were left-wing. This stems from most people not really understanding what defines right and left wing.</p>

<p>Right wing are reactionaries and left wing are progressives, in most simple terms. Left wing wants to change things (for better or worse) and right wing wants to maintain the status quo or turn back the clock to previous traditions (for better or worse). FRANCE of all places is where the terms right/left wing politics were coined.</p>

<p>So it comes down to this: were nazis reactionaries or progressives? They were radical reactionaries. Which makes them far right.</p>

<p>I used to think that the EU was a good idea.  However, now I see such organizations being used by the Rothschild Zionists to control more countries.  The EU can be a good idea, but the powers that be will abuse it.  </p>

<p>Now I am thinking that countries need to be more separated to make it more difficult for a small group of people to seize too much control.  It is very sad that we need to worry about this.  </p>

<p>I am not a Nationalist either, but certain principles need to be in place to avoid being taken over.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of Le Pen&#39;s policies would be seen as left leaning by rational people. Her only right policies are:</p>

<p>*Close extremist mosques.
*Get tough on immigration.</p>

<p>In reality, shutting extremist mosques and tackling terrorism should be seen as centrist. Telling people they just have to live with terrorism, which is Macron&#39;s position, should be seen as the extremist view.</p>

<p>If the media are judging politicians left/right position solely on their nationalist/globalist position, then Macron should be described as far left. Islamic terrorism should be described as far left.</p>

<p>Nazis are more a part of yout history than anybody else. It boggles my mind how many of your people believe the lies of the media and do not know that Nazis are left wing.</p>
