       I love seeing people with an appreciation of history tackle major conspiracies. The ability to cite corroborating sources at will, always serves to lend extra credence to the theory being posed.
       <em>
        JFK to 9/11
       </em>
       is a veritable goldmine of first hand accounts, documents, as well as an entirely unique perspective on much discussed topics.

       Amazing documentary that absolutely helped yo open my eyes. The only thing I'm curious about is that if I can remember correctly, there is little to no mention of the zionist connection. (I'm sure a lot of people were just looking for more content to help them along with their anti-Semitism, but that's not me and it's beside the point).
      </p>
      <p>
       There were a lot of comments online accusing the film of deliberately avoiding that connection. I will not jump to the same conclusions, but if I'm there for the AMA it would be nice to hear what the director has to say.

       It's a random video by someone I've never heard of, without references to support its claims. Why would I believe? Why would anyone believe it?

       For anyone who believes it, tell me what steps you went through to decide whether it was credible or not?

       I've provided

        examples of why the video is ludicrous
       </a>
       in the past. I haven't even watched it all the way through, because it's so laughable. 
Officer Tippit was killed because he looked like JFK? Holy shit, is there no theory this guy isn't going to throw in? Could he actually believe it all?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he's pulling you leg. There's no way he really believes all that shit.

       The documentary is absolutely 'conspiracy stew'.  I was showing some friends how ridiculous it was, then when the documentary said "there were 7 gunmen who fired 17 shots" the room just start laughing.  There's good information in it, but as a whole I think its a very amateur work.

       I'm writing my own manuscript on the assasination, I'm going to ask some tough and specific questions in this AMA.  Stoked for the discussion though.

       I can believe 7 gunmen. I mean, if they want someone dead they will cover all angles. But the fact everyone was taking shots seem odd to me but I've mostly spent my time looking into the Moon Landing. I've heard theories that Jackie O fired that last shot then stashes the gun in her purse before crawling out the back. But I will be looking forward to your questions and his answers regardless. I just keep an open mind about all of this.

       I bet he revised his own worldview several times since making that documentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was his work that redpilled me in the first place, but even I notice a lot of inconsistencies in it. Skull &amp; Bones isn't about being a pirate, it's more about the occult worship of death. The fatal shot that hit JFK in the head didn't come from the gutter, but from the grassy knoll at the hands of James Files. Interestingly enough the full interview with Files that had 400,000 views has been removed.

       The Bolshevik revolution was also funded and supported by the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite all that his documentary is a milestone and thanks to not having much nonsense or "unrealistic" truths in it, is a perfect stepping stone to opening peoples eyes.

       Sutton's work provides a far greater insight into undocumented history than anything Conolly will ever produce. On his fund raising page he says "I know that I am a man who understands history better than it has ever been understood before". That's laughable and agitating at the same time. Without referencing a single source, he completely overlooks a perspective altering part of history that Sutton documents in amazing detail, using primary source materials that are all referenced. I'll provide a link to Professor Sutton discussing his work and I encourage everyone to view it, especially those who were impressed with Conolly's film.

       I'm not sure if he would have changed his views much. His work certainly changed mine. Even though everyone moves deeper into the rabbit hole as they go, it seems like he deliberately left the most obscure and esoteric historical conspiracies alone in his documentary because it was the most appropriate thing to do for the film's sake. Otherwise it would likely never have been taken seriously by anyone who had never been exposed to that information before. If people started bringing up Moon Hoaxes, Sandy Hook, and Elders of Zion at me when I was researching JFK, I'd have probably shut that information out myself and never learned anything deeper about those things. So I thank him for gracefully red-pilling myself and letting me expose my friends to more accurate versions of history without fear of getting called a nutjob in the process.

       Don't bother! James Files is completely full of shit and just wants the fame so he doesn't die in jail as a nobody! He claims that he used a Remington Fireball with a scope! At that close of a distance, not only would you not need a scope, you wouldn't
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to use one! Scopes are magnified, and at close range, the target would be in and out of the scope's sights before you could blink!

       So you love trump but also love a film that shows that he and everyone like him are purposely running the world into the ground?

       Trump isn't exactly rich, he's nothing close to a Rothschild. I just like that the people he appointed such as Tillerson, Mnuchin, Cohen, Wilbur, weren't really rich when young, but went on to run the world's biggest institutions. They ran all the operations for Rockefellers and Rothschild without ever getting due credit. It's old money vs new money perhaps, but I'd much rather new money ran the world than old money

       How do you reconcile with yourself knowing that trump is not "exactly" rich (I happen to agree with you there), when that's all he ever claims to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he's lying about his wealth, and you know he is, yet you like him.
      </p>
      <p>
       OR he really is rich, putting him in the 1%, and is therefore, by virtue of having that kind of money, and actively furthering ONLY the goals of the "old money" oil / weapons /pharmaceutical industry, totally in league with the "old money". But because his money is younger than their money he's a good choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       ORRR he really is a failure at business (check) and is totally lying about how much he's really worth (check) and in an effort to make people think he really is so incredibly yugely rich, will pander to the "old money" until they accept him as one of their own (check) and he has done nothing but prove these things since taking office (check) and you somehow still think he was a good choice (check) and you also find this film about how horribly awful the people who do these things are (check) and you don't have any idea why MOST people think you and ALL other trump supporters are mentally retarded?
      </p>
      <p>
       The shilling for don aside, you bring up some fairly reasonable points, but thinking trump is good, and that this movie is about some other type of rich people, is just fucking stupid. This film is an expose on the system set in place by the "old money" to be carried out by the "new money". Fund war, elect puppets, join war, get lootz, don't share the lootz, rinse and repeat.

       10 billion isn't rich. It's rich to what TPTB want us to think, but even Bill gates is a small fish. I never said he isn't rich. He clearly is as his campaign financial disclosure forms show. The only negative thing he's done since office has been net neutrality in my honest opinion, and I read about him atleast an hour every day and watch everything the Whitehouse channel puts out, and I listen to political podcasts going to and from work which is 2 hours of it.

       Sure I can understand that. I was confused about your statement about his wealth. So if I got it right he is really rich compared to 99.99999% of the population but is broke so to speak compared to the .00001%?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way he has enough wealth and connections to make it clear he is not going to be advocating for our best interest. And these people in the .00001% don't give a shit about money anymore, power is their currency and they will do anything necessary to obtain it and keep it.

       Then why do we even vote if both sides are always going to be corrupt, incompetent or simply red or blue? Serious question, I'm not trying to troll or anything. I just hear this a lot and makes me wonder if we all know this why do we keep fooling ourselves thinking our vote matters?

       I ask myself this every day, the fact that don is sitting in the office just proves that votes don't count. Until we abolish the electoral college nothing will change, I just hope Donald is stupid enough to actually think he won the popular vote and try and get rid of it during the term.

       Interesting. I watched half last night and I'm finishing the last half when I get home. I was blown away at how far back he starts. I assumed it was going to be covering from JFK to 9/11.

       A document in Yale's archives[20]suggests that 322 is a reference to the year 322 BC and that members measure dates from this year instead of from the common era. In 322 BC, the Lamian War ended with the death of Demosthenes and Athenians were made to dissolve their government and establish a plutocratic system in its stead, whereby only those possessing 2,000 drachmas or more could remain citizens. Documents in the Tomb have purportedly been found dated to "Anno-Demostheni".[21] Members measure time of day according to a clock 5 minutes out of sync with normal time, the latter is called "barbarian time".
      </p>
      <p>
       One legend is that the numbers in the society's emblem ("322") represent "founded in '32, 2nd corps", referring to a first Corps in an unknown German university.[22][23]

       Back in 2013, a series was started called
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1bk3g4/32_greats_in_32_days_list/">
        32 Greats/32 Days
       </a>
       . The series was started on the premise that each day, a fan of each team would write about a player who was a franchise great, and was one of the best players in that team’s history. However, following the 2013 season, the series fizzled out, and was not continued the following offseason. However, with another offseason ahead of us, it seems to be a good time to give users some reading material on this subreddit. So, without further ado, I present to you:
       <strong>
        The 2017 edition of 32 Greats/32 Days!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This project will be using 32 fans of 32 different teams who have been writing about a franchise great. The table will be updated as information comes in, so the “Players” category will be updated as time goes on. As for the posts, they will contain the same general information, but will present it in their own unique way that makes the post engaging to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       The series loosely follows the order of the NFL Draft’s first round, although some spots are switched around. The writers have been putting a lot of effort into their posts, and any feedback would be appreciated.

       The whole doc is a goy black mail piece. Jews, Israel, Zionism, etc., are willfully ignored. He even plugged the Holohoax towards the end. It's sad the sub is duped by such blatant deception and misguidance.

       <a href="http://www.sportingnewsct.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/troybrown.jpg">
        Troy Brown
       </a>
       looked like a promising young receiver at Marshall University, despite his 5'10", 196 pound frame. Aside from his receiving skills, he looked like an exceptional returner in college. He led his division in return yard average in 1991. A year later, Troy Brown and Marshall won the National Championship, with Brown getting an
       <em>
        interception
       </em>
       in the final minutes of the game. To say the least, Brown set a legacy at Marshall University. He holds numerous NCAA records that still stand to this date; notable records being kickoff return average and kickoff return touchdowns. Brown cemented his place into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2010. After finishing his senior year at Marshall University, 21 year old Troy Brown was ready to enter the NFL Draft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown's draft day did not turn out to be the best. He had a long wait, being picked in the 8th round at pick 198.
       <em>
        There were 224 total picks in this draft.
       </em>
       On top of this, Brown was drafted to the New England Patriots, who, at the time, finished the previous year
       <strong>
        2-14
       </strong>
       . Brown's draft day could not have gone any worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown's first few years with the Patriots was disastrous. He got cut by New England in 1993, but was eventually resigned. Brown's role with the Pats was strictly him returning punts and kicks from time to time. He received little to no playing time as a receiver. This lasted until the 1995 season, when Brown saw a slight increase in snaps played at receiver. He caught 14 passes for 159 yards, and averaged roughly 21 yards per kick return. His role continued to increase, catching 6 touchdowns for the Patriots, 1997 AFC Champions. In 2000, Troy Brown finally became a starter for the Patriots.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his first year as a starter, Brown looked encouraging. Catching 83 passes for 944 yards from former number one overall pick
       <a href="https://www.pehub.com/wp-content/uploads//drewbledsoe.jpg">
        Drew Bledsoe
       </a>
       , the duo looked like they could be the next big thing. That is, until
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tNzd9Xd0who">

       </a>
       . Bledsoe's backup quarterback,

       ,

        pick 199

       , had a poor build. He was skinny, and he lacked great physical stature and strength. He lacked mobility and ability to avoid the rush. He lacked a really strong arm and he can't drive the ball downfield. He does not throw a tight spiral, and he could get exposed if used in the wrong system. He gets knocked down easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now, Troy Brown, coming off his best year of his career, is without his star quarterback. Brown's first few games with Brady at quarterback were rough. A combined 8 receptions for 68 yards through two games. Then, the wheels started to spin. Brown exploded the next two games - 11 catches for 117 yards, and 8 catches for 120 yards and a touchdown. Brown finished the 2001 regular season with what would be the best season of his career. 101 catches, 1199 yards, and 5 touchdowns. On top of this, the Patriots finished off the regular season on a six game win streak, getting then a first round bye.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Patriots won the divisional game thanks to hard work and the

        Troy Brown
       </a>
       looked like a promising young receiver at Marshall University, despite his 5'10", 196 pound frame. Aside from his receiving skills, he looked like an exceptional returner in college. He led his division in return yard average in 1991. A year later, Troy Brown and Marshall won the National Championship, with Brown getting an
       <em>
        interception
       </em>
       in the final minutes of the game. To say the least, Brown set a legacy at Marshall University. He holds numerous NCAA records that still stand to this date; notable records being kickoff return average and kickoff return touchdowns. Brown cemented his place into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2010. After finishing his senior year at Marshall University, 21 year old Troy Brown was ready to enter the NFL Draft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown's draft day did not turn out to be the best. He had a long wait, being picked in the 8th round at pick 198.
       <em>
        There were 224 total picks in this draft.
       </em>
       On top of this, Brown was drafted to the New England Patriots, who, at the time, finished the previous year
       <strong>
        2-14
       </strong>
       . Brown's draft day could not have gone any worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown's first few years with the Patriots was disastrous. He got cut by New England in 1993, but was eventually resigned. Brown's role with the Pats was strictly him returning punts and kicks from time to time. He received little to no playing time as a receiver. This lasted until the 1995 season, when Brown saw a slight increase in snaps played at receiver. He caught 14 passes for 159 yards, and averaged roughly 21 yards per kick return. His role continued to increase, catching 6 touchdowns for the Patriots, 1997 AFC Champions. In 2000, Troy Brown finally became a starter for the Patriots.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his first year as a starter, Brown looked encouraging. Catching 83 passes for 944 yards from former number one overall pick

       , had a poor build. He was skinny, and he lacked great physical stature and strength. He lacked mobility and ability to avoid the rush. He lacked a really strong arm and he can't drive the ball downfield. He does not throw a tight spiral, and he could get exposed if used in the wrong system. He gets knocked down easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now, Troy Brown, coming off his best year of his career, is without his star quarterback. Brown's first few games with Brady at quarterback were rough. A combined 8 receptions for 68 yards through two games. Then, the wheels started to spin. Brown exploded the next two games - 11 catches for 117 yards, and 8 catches for 120 yards and a touchdown. Brown finished the 2001 regular season with what would be the best season of his career. 101 catches, 1199 yards, and 5 touchdowns. On top of this, the Patriots finished off the regular season on a six game win streak, getting then a first round bye.

       The Patriots won the divisional game thanks to hard work and the

       Interesting. I watched half last night and I'm finishing the last half when I get home. I was blown away at how far back he starts. I assumed it was going to be covering from JFK to 9/11.

        He clearly is as his campaign financial disclosure forms show.

       I can believe 7 gunmen. I mean, if they want someone dead they will cover all angles. But the fact everyone was taking shots seem odd to me but I've mostly spent my time looking into the Moon Landing. I've heard theories that Jackie O fired that last shot then stashes the gun in her purse before crawling out the back. But I will be looking forward to your questions and his answers regardless. I just keep an open mind about all of this.
