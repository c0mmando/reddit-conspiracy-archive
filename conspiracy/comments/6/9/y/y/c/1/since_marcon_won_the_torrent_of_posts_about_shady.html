<p>You are advocating for digging to the bottom of the Russian narrative, fine, that is all good. But what is so wrong about being skeptical towards something the MSM is cramming down our throats? I never said that everyone supporting the Russian narrative was a shill, but c&#39;mon man, do you seriously think every single pro-Russian narrative comment was organic? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To paraphrase another post I&#39;ve written about this in the past. Nation-state actors obfuscating the source of the hack to appear from another country is par for the course, and there are a number of well known techniques to do this, that particular &quot;revelation&quot; about the CIA hacking is nothing new and they are not the only ones to employ it. </p>

<p>However there are certain &quot;fingerprints&quot; that relate to tool sets and operations that is much more difficult to fake, because it involves changing your tools and your normal tried-and-true process for breaking in. As an ELI5 imagine you American spy but pretending to be a Swedish plumber, you can speak Swedish and fix the plumbing for your target - this is basically what the CIA paper revealed, language changes and other superficial obfuscation techniques. Now imagine that the Swedes use an entirely different set of tools and techniques to fix a leaking toilet, to be thorough you would also have to re-learn how to fix the toilet in addition to speaking Swedish. The Russian hacking details revealed tools and processes consistent with known Russian hacking groups, which is above and beyond the more superficial obfuscation techniques in play by the CIA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, and to avoid any oversimplification, the CIA does also aggregate exploits of anything that works, and that includes exploits used by foreign actors, however the unique combination of tools at their disposal becomes yet another fingerprint. I am not saying that I can say with 100% certainty that Russia was behind it, because with any sophisticated entity it means there is always some plausible deniability (which is what makes hacking such a powerful tool). That said, the evidence <em>against</em> hacking I think is much less compelling than you might think given all the articles and discussion among non-experts on this. </p>

<p>My personal opinion is the Russians were &quot;probably&quot; involved given the evidence in play but cannot say definitely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make good points in reference to u/verello&#39;s good points. The question I guess would be if those tools and processes could also be faked by a CIA operative who speaks Russian fluently. I don&#39;t mean to poo-poo the idea, but I&#39;m naturally led there, or artificially led there thanks to the greater pushback against the Russian hacking idea. </p>

<p>What&#39;s rarely mentioned on this sub was what some of the cybersecurity guys at the Senate Intel hearing had to say about their identification process for the hacks, which u/verello does a good job of summarizing. They went in depth at length about similar notions and ongoing techniques, including attempts to obfuscate sources. And they were not all Crowdstrike employees, not even sure if any of them were.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the JAR report that is the focus of that article is not the greatest and didn&#39;t really provide any new evidence. However that is not the only report nor the report of record for this breach. The original Crowdstrike incident response write-up is sound and in-line with expectations for this sort of thing. Here&#39;s an article from the same guy discussing the initial crowdstrike write-up. Dave Aitel also concurs in this article and he is hugely respected figure in the security community. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/06/guccifer-leak-of-dnc-trump-research-has-a-russians-fingerprints-on-it/">https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/06/guccifer-leak-of-dnc-trump-research-has-a-russians-fingerprints-on-it/</a></p>

<p>As I said in my other post above there is always going to be a possibility of wiggle room in a case like this. But, if you have tools and access methods consistent with a russian hacking group, Russian error message accidentally embedded in certain documents, and tradecraft elements suggesting handoff of certain operations consistent with these groups, that is in my opinion stronger than the detractors. For example this is weak: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>CrowdStrike researchers who analyzed the Democratic National Committee&#39;s hacked network, argue that the pattern strongly implicates Russia because no other actor would have the combined motivation and resources to hack the same targets. But as Carr pointed out, the full source code for the X-Agent implant that has long been associated with APT28 was independently obtained by researchers from antivirus provider Eset.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was not the only argument that Crowdstrike put forth but one of many. Sure, it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that someone was able to find this specific tool but that still leaves all of the other evidence in favor that this was Russian state actors. That someone would go to all this trouble would say to me it&#39;s <strong>definitely</strong> a state actor if they not only achieved the hack  but also meticulously recreated Russian state hacking group details to falsely attribute that group. </p>

<p>CrowdStrike researchers who analyzed the Democratic National Committee&#39;s hacked network, argue that the pattern strongly implicates Russia because no other actor would have the combined motivation and resources to hack the same targets. But as Carr pointed out, the full source code for the X-Agent implant that has long been associated with APT28 was independently obtained by researchers from antivirus provider Eset.</p>

<p>Everything identified was a known exploit. You really think the Russian gov is using script kiddies who rely on prewritten exploits for their most sensitive cyber warfare? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats not the point.  Theres a big difference between the level of someone who is using someone else&#39;s prepackaged exploit scripts and someone who can understands the exploit completely and can code their own implementation of it.  I have to believe the Russia government has at least a few of the latter to put to work on sensitive cyber warfare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true TBH. What pre-packaged exploit scripts are you speaking of specifically. I wouldn&#39;t call SeaDaddy and X-Agent script kiddie tools, it&#39;s not like they were using metasploit for everything. Also I&#39;m not sure about SeaDaddy but I&#39;m pretty sure X-Agent was written by this group. Here&#39;s a list of tools the group uses. Yes there is some ready-made stuff here but certain tools like mimikatz are standard because they are the best and there is no substitute. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstand what I was saying. Fingerprints are not related to spoken language but it is something identifiable between hacking groups. A hacking group is an organization with certain established methods to infiltrate initial access to a target, escalate privileges, find worthwhile information, and exfiltrate it, groups may have specialists working in each one of these stages of the operation. As such, there are certain tools and tool combinations that are used that can be used to identify a group. Yes, certain elements can be faked if you know exactly how that group operates and you work to recreate those operational details, but, generally, hacking groups each have their own modes of operation with some specific nuances that are unique compared to other hacking groups. None of this has to do with their spoken language. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do wish more specific details were published too. That said I don&#39;t have reason to dispute Crowdstrikes findings since they reviewed the evidence directly and they are a legitimate organization. Sure I&#39;d have preferred a Mandiant write-up but hey. Hours of operation, the tools that were used, the higher level of sophistication, target selection, and other ancillary details of the leaks themselves paint a picture. As I said above this is not an open and shut case but these types of accusations are rarely clearcut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, many are dupes. </p>

<p>The fact is, the Russia narrative has the full blast of media support puffing it up 24/7, while the actual scandals we all know are being repressed are squashed completely. So you can come into a political/media environment like this and play of this little fake &quot;balanced&quot; attitude like &quot;we must conscientiously look into all conspiracies, we are not political!&quot; when in fact there is nothing remotely similar between the two cases, they aren&#39;t nearly equivalent, and thus &quot;equal treatment&quot; is propagandistic.</p>

<p>If Russia Theory was real, Trump would be gone. You can&#39;t reconcile the anti-Trump frenzy, and Russia, and the failure to bust him for Russia. Can&#39;t have all three.</p>

<p>So, Russia Theory should be given very little play, unless there is something much more concrete, and that explains the other factors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the obvious brigading... You want to push the narrative yourself AND brigade it at the same time... well, you tip your hand every time dudes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m suspicious. Particularly of the supposed drug transaction in Feb. There&#39;s a few too many missing steps in their investigation, and given how much it should be easily linkable I have to wonder why.</p>

<p>GetNews offers us four pieces of evidence to prove that M. Tourret bought drugs: </p>

<ul>
<li>Screencaps of an email (to a Mr. Francois) confirming purchase (with a payment address to a M. Francois) and payment via bitcoin, dates missing;</li>
<li>Screencaps of various wallet pages on Blockchain showing transactions in February (no links, but the addresses helpfully pasted on so you can type them);</li>
<li>Screencaps of a second and third email with tracking info, a screencap of a delivery tracker. The emails show a transaction in March by credit card with all info except the delivery address showing a M. Francois Machado (who is that?);</li>
<li>Photograph of an email saying &quot;Ne pas oublier l&#39;achat de la c.. pour le boss&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#39;s the actual blockchain wallet page for &quot;M. Tourret&quot;: <a href="https://blockchain.info/de/address/1JWUYN3sZyzCiHn5hvmCQXUkDNMRLTRiuX">https://blockchain.info/de/address/1JWUYN3sZyzCiHn5hvmCQXUkDNMRLTRiuX</a> </p>

<p>Those transactions happened in February. We&#39;re told that we know that this wallet belongs to M. Tourret because the dates on the bitcoin transactions match the dates on the first email. Except for whatever reason, the dates on the first email aren&#39;t included in the screencap. Oh, and <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/btc-usd-converter">according to this website</a>, in February this year, 1 BTC was equal to <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Es8Pj">€1069.20</a>. Why would M. Tourret pay Buckled TWENTY TIMES the value of his actual order?</p>

<p>The second transaction looks a more convincing, the email appears to have actually been sent to M. Tourret. But the payment information is for M. Machado, and this was paid for by credit card. Why is he paying for M. Tourret&#39;s drugs?</p>

<p>Side note: I gotta say these drug dealers are incredibly efficient. The time stamp on the March order email is just after 9am. The drugs were posted three and a half hours later. </p>

<p>And because, for some reason, GetNews doesn&#39;t like providing people with convenient links:</p>

<ul>
<li>The tracking page: <a href="https://www.internationalparceltracking.com/Main.aspx#/track/RN676369653NL/FR/75355">https://www.internationalparceltracking.com/Main.aspx#/track/RN676369653NL/FR/75355</a></li>
<li>The website the drugs were ordered from: <a href="https://www.buckled.eu/">https://www.buckled.eu/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If I were looking at the first transaction alone, I might suggest the overpayment of the bitcoin was to build a credit for future purchases. But the other transaction was on a credit card.</p>

<p>The fourth piece of evidence, the photo of the email, has been debunked: <a href="https://twitter.com/jpney/status/861029060109103104">https://twitter.com/jpney/status/861029060109103104</a></p>

<p>I would say it doesn&#39;t pass the sniff test, but given we&#39;re apparently talking about cocaine, that would be a little on the nose.</p>

<p>And quickly on the other two accusations:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want me to believe that Macron was receiving gay underwear emails, at least show me the email addressed to him instead of a screencap of an ad?</li>
<li>The Rothschild thing was also debunked. The email is two people asking questions about where the funding came from. The actual exchanged ended like this: <a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3Hr2pmKGs3F0Q9PSdq3PKg.png">email</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@lemebfr/ce-quil-y-a-vraiment-dans-les-macronleaks-pas-grand-chose-3de14d82f662">item 12 in the article</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>French law dictates that journalists can&#39;t report on candidates 44 hrs before the election. This is to prevent last minute fuckery from influencing an election. Good or bad, works or not, that&#39;s how it is. </p>

<p>Dropping this info when they did pretty much ensured it would be validated by the fact that it was &quot;being censored.&quot; In reality, it meant that no journalist could verify or refute the information.</p>

<p>So, my answer to your OP is: due to the timing of the information, it didn&#39;t matter. It could neither be confirmed or denied when it mattered. </p>

<p>...in the media.</p>

<p>Social media platforms like Facebook and reddit and 4chan were under no such blackout and could run wild with speculation.</p>

<p>Which was the entire point of leaking the emails during this time window. It didn&#39;t end up working because the French put less importance on social media and Le Pen was so popularly opposed by the majority of French voters. But the goal of the leakers was clearly ment to influence the election in the same manner as the American one, and by the same agents.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hardly pointless that a known national security risk was put in charge of national security, because both Trump and Pence lied when they said they didn&#39;t know. </p>

<p>Flynn, who was let go from the campaign after they realized he improperly contacted the Russians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a nice twisting of reality there. </p>

<p>Flynn was not let go from the <em>campaign</em>. He was fired from the administration, after having already been appointed as the national security advisor by Trump. Furthermore, said firing did <em>not</em> occur when the White House learned of his improper collusion with the Russians. It only occurred after the press got a hold of that information. The White House was aware of Flynn&#39;s connections at <em>least</em> as early as the beginning of January, and did nothing until the public learned about it as well. </p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Flynn was let go after <strong>the public</strong> found out about his collusion with Russia. The administration knew about it beforehand. I see no evidence to suggest that they would have ever fired him had he not become a political hot potato. </p>

<p>It was clearly more of a process to determine what the story actually was. It was never a question of whether they intended to keep Flynn on if they found out and the public didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>This is ignoring the fact that nothing Flynn did was really illegal either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flynn wasn&#39;t let go from the campaign.  He was fired after they were already in the white house.  Flynn&#39;s son was fired for vocally supporting the pizzagate hoax during transition.  You might be thinking of Manafort or Page, one who was Gaddhafi&#39;s lobbyist for twenty years and a close Putin ally, the other working as a lobbyist for Russian oligarchs.</p>

<p>The president is a chronic liar and an imbecile, ignorant of even the most basic political know-how, with obvious signs of dementia to boot.  He can hardly string together complete sentences, and he&#39;s spent more time playing golf and watching tv than most American retirees.  The president&#39;s two closest advisors are his daughter and his son-in-law.  This son-in-law gutted the transition team that Governor Christie had built for months, all because he was getting revenge on Christie for doing his job as a federal prosecutor and going after papa Kushner when he clearly broke the law.  When Jared was given a tour of the West wing by Obama staffers, he kept introducing himself to people who worked there, telling them he was looking forward to working with them.  He was shocked to find out that they were all leaving and he had to staff the West wing, just weeks before inauguration.  Lil Jared had no idea.  He has no experience in policy or governing, though basically no one else in the administration does either.  They&#39;re still chronically understaffed.  And if Jared can&#39;t staff an office with the easiest possible jobs to recruit for, how in the hell is he going to solve mideast peace, or fix the VA, or do anything on the incredible list of duties he&#39;s been given?</p>

<p>For his &quot;chief strategist,&quot; (a made-up position) the president picked Steve Bannon, the mastermind behind Citizens United, whose greatest triumph was outlawing any practical campaign finance restrictions.  He, along with a wildly out of touch supreme court in 2010, made it legal for corporations (including foreign ones) to spend unlimited money on political messaging in the USA because hey they&#39;re people too! </p>

<p>The levels of incompetence and corruption we&#39;re seeing today threaten the very stability and foundations of the Republic.  We are genuinely not safe.  This is several orders of magnitude worse than anything we&#39;ve seen in all of American history.</p>

<p>That there are clowns cheering this in is astonishing. That the Trump reddit brigade are calling for a reversal on net neutrality rules and pushing for &quot;opening up those libel laws&quot; is absolutely mind boggling. Even going as far as setting up their &quot;free speech&quot; rallies as an excuse to act the thug, the irony isn&#39;t even a funny irony. </p>

<p>The silver lining, if you could call it that, is exactly what you mentioned. Trump is as dumb as a paper bag. The next Trump might not just want to loot the country. The next Trump might/will be smart. </p>

<p>America has some huge problems. This is just the beginning. The bad guys found a way in and the scouts are only probing right now. If this loophole isn&#39;t closed, the <em>world</em> is in serious trouble. </p>

<p>They lied about it. I can&#39;t really speak to their motives behind it because I obviously don&#39;t know everything about the deep state, which is why that&#39;s not really relevant (because you don&#39;t either).</p>

Your support for that exceptional claim is one blog post. A post that itself points out that only more than 50% of the IP addresses he cannot identify. The ones that he can are to nodes. Fine. But Tor was cracked last year. The CIA have released the Tor ip addresses but according to reports last year can likely trace them to the source. Not to mention that somehow l doubt that the entire case is predicated on the IP addresses coming from Russia so Putin has been hacking.

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re trying to hurt macron, you don&#39;t actually want people to read the 9gb of emails. When people hear &quot;9gb of emails&quot; they think &quot;that&#39;s so many emails, there must be something horrible in there!&quot; the same kind of thing happened with the emails from weiner&#39;s laptop, it was a big number and people just assumed there&#39;d be somethign so bad on there it would sink her.

<p>Or hell, another example is how excited everyone got about okeefe&#39;s cnn leaks, like there was so many hours of audio cnn was going down for sure! and it turned out to be nothing, but there was a lot of chatter about it for a short period, which is perfect to use during the media blackout.</p>

<p>The fact is there were fake emails implanted, yet nothing implanted with any significant salaciousness to change anyone&#39;s opinions on the election, right? Nothing in there was outrageous enough for people to go, oh my god, maybe we should vote for Le Pen. But why not? You have 48 hours where you can put out unchecked facts and nothing anyone can do about it? Why not some Rothschild&#39;s emails, some emails about funding/co-ordinating with US/DNC, some fake plans for future totalitarian legislation? Even a whiff of that shit and people will back out. Yet there was nothing. So, why go through all the effort to put in fake emails that don&#39;t even help your supposed goal? The reason is because it&#39;s obviously not your goal. At this point, all I can go with is it may be used as a vehicle later to take internet freedoms away at some point or electoral freedoms away under the guise of preventing manipulation with elections. </p>

<p>tl;dr I agree with you, but there were fake emails in there. So why not put in fake emails that could genuinely hurt Macron? No one has time to debunk beyond logic/reasoning, so you can go hog-wild. The reason is because it wasn&#39;t put out to hurt Macron. Beyond that you can draw your own conclusion. Mine is it&#39;s basically a psy-op to further in the minds of the public how damaging hacking and election &#39;tampering&#39; is. Imagine you&#39;re the CIA, everyone everywhere basically believes Russia hacked the US election, and now the French one. How fucking perfect is that? More funding, more control over future elections and internet, more reason to start doing anti-russia stuff, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re into? Hackers are like Muslims 10-15 years ago and we&#39;re going to see some Patriot acts. </p>

<p>I was actually referring to the 200 hours of audio files from his &quot;CNNLeaks&quot; which was like 180 hours of  garbled mess from the inside of someones purse.</p>

<p>Theres certainly some merit to your theory, but I think they still would have wanted to release that before the blackout, because pushing a russia narrative and some nothingburger emails would push macron&#39;s numbers up even more and give him a bigger mandate(and decrease the odds of le pen sneaking out a win) but to push that narrative before the end of the election they need the media to be doing it too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media blackout was part of it; if the Russians had obtained anything particularly interesting with their hacks, they would have released it - likely through Wikileaks - well before the media blackout. They did not, ergo they did <em>not</em> release it through Wikileaks - doing so and using forged documents would have damaged the carefully cultivated reputation Wikileaks has for no releasing fake documents - and instead Wikileaks was used to pump the data while maintaining deniability. The media blackout ensured the French media could <em>not</em> participate in debunking false information following a brief 1-hour window in which they could announce the existence of the data. The French media being, of course, most capable of parsing so many French documents and most able to reach the French people.</p>

<p>Instead, the plan was to use a last minute social media pump centered - in large part - around foreign social media to create international interest that would reverberate, eventually, to France. Given the inter-connectivity of social media and the existence of well-known, international social media accounts such as Wikileaks it was a feasible last-ditch effort - though ultimately futile.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By Fall 2016, many news organizations knew about the existence of the dossier; it has been described as an &quot;open secret&quot; among journalists. However, they chose not to publish information that could not be confirmed.[7] Finally on October 31, 2016, <strong>a week before the election,</strong> Mother Jones reported that a former intelligence officer, whom they did not name, had produced a report based on Russian sources and turned it over to the FBI.[11] The report alleged that the Russian government had cultivated Trump for years:</p>

<p>The &quot;Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.&quot; It maintained that Trump &quot;and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.&quot; It claimed that Russian intelligence had &quot;compromised&quot; Trump during his visits to Moscow and could &quot;blackmail him.&quot;[11]</p>

<p>First Russia who organised the hacking and who edited specific documents using Russian software, then the Trumplets and their army of bots linked to those same fake documents in order to drown out social media with their fake news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d recommend staying cynical about the whole affair. </p>

<p>The French government, pretty much like everyone else&#39;s, is full of the same kind of greedy opportunists and not any high minded or socially conscious idealists. Hell, both candidates from the county&#39;s two major parties went down under the weight of their public scandals and corruption that led to this somewhat bizarre run-off between the least liklies.</p>

<p>Time and again the French President has said or promised one thing to the French public or on the international stage while the Prime Minister and the actual government itself quietly proceeded to do just the very opposite. </p>

<p>So there&#39;s no telling what the upshot might be. Marcon may wind up being just as paralyzed and beholden to the ruling government as Trump is and Le Pen wouldn&#39;t simply have had any co-operation at all had she won. </p>

<p>France, consequently, is actually one of the least trustworthy countries in Europe and they&#39;ve been that way for a long, long time. Gallic arrogance and duplicity has also been around for so long now that no one inside or outside of France actually thinks anything of it anymore. It&#39;s simply the way the country is and has evolved over time. It&#39;s never actually a surprise whenever some glaring example of it happens to raise it&#39;s ugly head.</p>

<p>The French public with such a low turn-out obviously didn&#39;t see this as the right time or the place to take a hard stand and may simply see the exit of the UK from the EU as giving them a leg up and giving them far more leverage in the EU as a result. They wouldn&#39;t simply bail, or drop the Euro, without first trying for more and better concessions and advantages for themselves. </p>

<p>Le Pen&#39;s determination to just quit and get out of the whole arrangement simply isn&#39;t the way the French people like to do things. What will actually be more interesting is what will take place in their next general election and what the public reaction to Macron turns out to be at that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing people need to understand about hackers and I am referring to real hackers. Not  hackers that work for a government. </p>

<p>Hackers will always identify with the underdog, the one breaking convention, and the outsider. They loathe anything &#39;establishment&#39; and love nothing more than sticking it to them. Government employed hackers will never have the skills of the black hats. These realities should always be factored in to your big picture on these recent leaks. IMO thos all points to the possibility that none of the recent leaks against US and French candidates was sponsored at the national level or by a political party. It leans heavily to what hackers just love to do. Fuck with the establishment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that was by design, since there wasn&#39;t anything actually incriminating in there, they could just spread it on social media and the media wouldn&#39;t be able to try and debunk any fake docs mixed in there (like the fake as shit meth one). But then it wasn&#39;t as effect because of how blatantly obvious that the ones spreading it were americans not french people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media blackout was part of it; if the Russians had obtained anything particularly interesting with their hacks, they would have released it - likely through Wikileaks - well before the media blackout. They did not, ergo they did <em>not</em> release it through Wikileaks - doing so and using forged documents would have damaged the carefully cultivated reputation Wikileaks has for no releasing fake documents - and instead Wikileaks was used to pump the data while maintaining deniability. The media blackout ensured the French media could <em>not</em> participate in debunking false information following a brief 1-hour window in which they could announce the existence of the data. The French media being, of course, most capable of parsing so many French documents and most able to reach the French people.</p>

<p>Instead, the plan was to use a last minute social media pump centered - in large part - around foreign social media to create international interest that would reverberate, eventually, to France. Given the inter-connectivity of social media and the existence of well-known, international social media accounts such as Wikileaks it was a feasible last-ditch effort - though ultimately futile.</p>

The problem I have is that this sub has always been critical of the media and the amount of bs that the media spewed about the Russia ties made you really wonder that it was a bunch of propaganda.</p>

Maybe it was someone in some French government agency that has become disillusioned by how things have turned out...</p>
