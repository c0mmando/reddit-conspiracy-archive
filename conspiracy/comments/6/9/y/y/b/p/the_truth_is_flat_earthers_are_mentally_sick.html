    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just about them disagreeing. It is about them denying reality. They literally can not see the evidence in front of their own eyes because they mentally block it out.</p>

<p>Here is an example I came across yesterday:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/69vqw4/uh_oh_flat_earthers_some_high_school_kids_just/dh9vo94/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/69vqw4/uh_oh_flat_earthers_some_high_school_kids_just/dh9vo94/</a></p>

<p>This guy posted three videos, insisting that they did not show any curvature of the earth. But all three videos clearly did show curvature.</p>

<p>You can argue as to what was causing the curvature, but this guy literally could not see it.</p>

<p>If that is not a mental illness, I&#39;m not sure what is.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of evidence to directly support the flat earth, plenty of evidence to support NASA fakery and there&#39;s plenty of evidence for the mockery it gets.</p>

<p>It fits all the bills for a conspiracy to be true, so I&#39;m gonna say it is. I don&#39;t know how it all works, I have trouble even grasping the scale of this, the fact they managed to pull it off, but from where I currently stand (after years of interest and research on conspiracy topics) it&#39;s the truth.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect people to be convinced, it took me so many years as an already extremely open-minded person, but the information is out there, and it makes sense.</p>

<p>No, there isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Yes, he obviously is. That, or he&#39;s a liar. He ignores all the evidence that disproves his claims. One example is the idea that there are no direct flights from Australia to South America. This is false.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/6p11penAPvw?t=1121">https://youtu.be/6p11penAPvw?t=1121</a></p>

<p>Here for example is Qantas flight QFA27 direct from Sydney, Australia to Santiago, Chile:</p>

<p><a href="https://flightaware.com/live/flight/QFA27">https://flightaware.com/live/flight/QFA27</a></p>

<p>On the flat earth map, this would be an enormously long flight with no refueling. Yet it happens on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Like everyone who believes in Flat Earth even slightly has this unified view of how the entire system works. Mother fuckers if we debate the official story it&#39;s because we can&#39;t get ourselves into outer space to see it for ourselves. If that is the case then we don&#39;t know the actual size and shape of Earth and we sure as hell don&#39;t know the size, shape and orbit of the sun. Everything is speculation.

<p>To take any position as a fact and refute all other differing opinions is the main goal of the TPTB. People complain about shilling, on both sides of each argument, but TPTB don&#39;t need to. We do it to ourselves instead of opening our minds to different perspectives. Their methods of mind control are present here everyday when people close themselves to the thought of a different perspective. People let their reality become blinded by ideologies, religions (and yes, science is a religion), politics, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I see your point about it not being a difference of opinion. I worded that poorly. Sorry.</p>

<p>I was just trying to say that either way, I don&#39;t think anyone is mentally ill whether I agree with them or not.</p>

<p>And I will be honest, I&#39;ve never looked at the evidence to support a flat earth theory. I&#39;ve been too busy looking into other conspiracy theories. So I admit, I don&#39;t know if it is a flat earth or round earth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair enough.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll save you some time though, the Earth is round. Aside from scientific jargon which most people don&#39;t really understand anyway there is no reason to propagate a lie about the shape of the Earth. I&#39;ve heard various thoughts thrown out there but none of them make sense.</p>

<p>Almost every other conspiracy will tell you to follow the money and see who benefits there is no one at the end of that trail in a flat earth world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only answer I&#39;ve seen provided is that it somehow allows TBTB to control us through deception. How this particular form of deception really helps them is beyond me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also seen this answer paired with extreme Christian ideologies where the deception is the work of evil to keep people from realizing the truth that we are the center of the universe. </p>

<p>These fuckin&#39; assholes who feel the need to go out of their way to tell flat earthers how stupid they are is fucking annoying.</p>
