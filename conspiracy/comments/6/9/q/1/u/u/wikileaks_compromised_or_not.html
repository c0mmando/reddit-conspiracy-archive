       We all know of the raid that took place and the code that automatically dispersed after that, with all those crazy tweets, and then Julian never went to the window again, so what do you guys think about it? seems to me like he could of given the twitter handle over to a back-up, and that he's just the frontman and the others who do a lot of verifying etc are still in place. But what are your thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: FROM MY COMMENT BELOW - Just the fact that the wikileaks twitter handle misspelled words omitting letters that when added up spelled "help him" is um... fucking good evidence for [a coup] - but a question still arises - if he did let out the codes - that would of self destructed that computer at the embassies access to the wikileaks accounts, thus protecting them, and sending that message to back-up wikileaks people - so they could truly continue the agenda - I just thought of that and that makes perfect sense - i think that wikileaks isn't compromised now - wow - thoughts?

       Well, who would be the ones seeking control of Wikileaks? Seems like it would be on some way related to  Soros/DNC or some Russia bullshit, so regardless we'll have to wait and see. If it's the former I think we are going to see a discrediting of wikileaks or at least Assange. If the latter... well what would the motive of those meddling "Russians" be? To continue publishing leaks on certain political figures they dont like?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either that or some outside force with a completely different motive. Or maybe Assange just had to be moved for safety and is hiding somewhere else. I can only speculate.

       Thanks, yea that's all this is, just to throw out some ideas and see what fits
      </p>
      <p>
       yea, if anything i'd think the CIA or someone like that took him, and basically are using the dumping platform of wikileaks to censor more info - there's that idea - another is that it was a moving thing like you said - which i hope it is - there's a lot of speculation - but raiding the embassy like that is kinda... not right feeling

       Proof of the raid?  Evidence that British police invaded, in what would have been an illegal act unless authorised by the ambassador himself.  I've asked this before and no one had provided definitive proof that this occurred.

       Do you really think they could storm an embassy without creating a major diplomatic incident?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you believe people behave legally or not, is not proof of then raiding the embassy.  To do so with no reports of it happening would require a massive and fruitless effort.  In this age of instant news and video there would be at least some form of witness trail.

       Here you go - armed militia outside of embassy - internet disconnects - long bizarre "dead man" code is let out - never to be seen again at window - now has an entire change of premise - probably a POW for exposing such corruption - a fearful threat to the elite - brave man

       Again, that's not evidence.  Words like 'may' and 'we don't know' do not constitute evidence of an embassy raid.  Police vehicles being in the area would not be unusual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any unusual activity in that area would quickly draw a crowd as it's one of the busiest areas in London for tourists.
      </p>
      <p>
       All other events around that time also don't prove anything about a raid.

       Mud hitting you in the face would be evidence of it being thrown at you by some means, it wouldn't appear by magic.

       His Internet being cut off is proof of nothing other than his Internet was cut.  The tweets could be just his state of mind, how do you know he wasn't drunk or high, or just pissed off about something?  People tweeting on Twitter again is useless unless they have a source.  The Internet is a wonderful thing but a lot of people take what is on it as the truth, without questioning.  It is easy to post misinformation and have it spread quickly.  Once it's out it's off into the ether, like an enhanced version of Chinese whispers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no reliable Google sources for an Embassy raid, merely heresay, conjecture and circumstantial, nothing that would pass as evidence in a court case.  You stated 'but raiding the embassy like that is kinda' so I thought you must have had some conclusive evidence, there isn't even footage of the police entering the Embassy via force.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm quite happy to accept that in your opinion something fishy is going on, but stating something as fact, without sources, isn't the same thing.  As you said our views on proof differ, which is fine, debate is healthy and promotes greater understanding.

       I'll admit it's circumstantial evidence, that leaves one suspicious, and with the enemy we're facing, or whatever you want to call them, there's no room for error. These types of people have systematically covered up ridiculous amounts of things before and will continue to do so, they are the most professional of the most professional. Just a bunch of hokie stuff that's happened that seems fishy, plus it was in the upheaval time of the clinton campaigns self destructions with the help of wikileaks, disseminating the info to the public, who has a right to know. But as we can tell, the oligarchy wants to keep it all in the family, and keep us in the dark as possible. I also apologize for being rude

       I believe this too. I think they snatched him with the intention of throwing him into a kangaroo court once Clinton was elected, who would have cleared the way to explaining why snatching him was ok. And then she didn't, and they were left holding this culturally radioactive bag.

       Hahaha great way of putting it, probably true. And I bet trump is completely unaware honestly. Or at least has no power to do anything, especially at this point. Or he just doesn't care about Assange, and doesn't want his shit leaked. Too many possibilities.

       If wikileaks has been compromised one thing we can say is that the people behind the compromise want to keep the masses blind, thus will ATTEMPT to keep the agenda of wikileaks alive by pushing "leaks" that seem to go along with the story, while on the other hand being a hidden hand of the enemy. So discernment is key. Just the fact that the wikileaks twitter handle misspelled words omitting letters that when added up spelled "help him" is um... fucking good evidence for that - but a question still arises - if he did let out the codes - that would of self destructed that computer at the embassies access to the wikileaks accounts, thus protecting them, and sending that message to back-up wikileaks people - so they could truly continue the agenda - I just thought of that and that makes perfect sense - i think that wikileaks isn't compromised now - wow - thoughts?

       And then we have the tweet where he tells everyone to stop the internet attack (paraphrasing). Many people think that was when agents had secured access to the WL Twitter acct. Sorry, I do not feel any better.

       You'd think there would be a plan in case this happened, from the get go, knowing the level of stuff they were dealing with. I have hope, apparently 14 other wikileaks people were cut off during that time too. I have hope...

       Has anyone who interviewed him since asked what those hash codes were before they went down?  I remember that was being talked about a lot, now I see very little. He has come back in the public since. Has anyone just directly asked what they meant when he was not communicating?

       How has nobody asked about this in any of his talks since he came back?  That is odd. Is that accurate?  After all that, not a single person who has interviewed him since has thought to ask?

       What sucks is this is as far as it'll go. It's not like some reporter or person with access to him is going to see this and ask. That would have been the first thing I asked in an interview- what happened during the silence and what did those tweets really mean?

       You're right, they'd probably screen the interviewers if he was in CIA hands, and force him to say only certain things. Someone should apply for an interview that could sneak through the screening and ask those questions. Until then we need to keep our discerning hats tightly on.

       I am more just like really?  Really? Nobody has thought of this before and nobody has thought to ask him that question during an interview?  Even if he didn't want to answer it, why would nobody ask?  Am I the only person thinking that is super bizarre?  I haven't watched all the interviews. Does anyone know if this was covered?

       I mean just all the coincidences... I mean you had Kerry threatening Ecuador, with his slimy skull and bones fists, aka well collapse your monetary system unless you comply, type chat. Armed, where British cops don't carry firearms,  and threats sent out through tweets. We haven't seen him at the window, and there were tweets deliberately misspelled saying help him.
