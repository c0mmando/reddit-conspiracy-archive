But what are your thoughts?</p>

<p>Edit: FROM MY COMMENT BELOW - Just the fact that the wikileaks twitter handle misspelled words omitting letters that when added up spelled &quot;help him&quot; is um... fucking good evidence for [a coup] - but a question still arises - if he did let out the codes - that would of self destructed that computer at the embassies access to the wikileaks accounts, thus protecting them, and sending that message to back-up wikileaks people - so they could truly continue the agenda - I just thought of that and that makes perfect sense - i think that wikileaks isn&#39;t compromised now - wow - thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, who would be the ones seeking control of Wikileaks? Seems like it would be on some way related to  Soros/DNC or some Russia bullshit, so regardless we&#39;ll have to wait and see. If it&#39;s the former I think we are going to see a discrediting of wikileaks or at least Assange. If the latter... well what would the motive of those meddling &quot;Russians&quot; be? To continue publishing leaks on certain political figures they dont like?</p>

<p>Either that or some outside force with a completely different motive. Or maybe Assange just had to be moved for safety and is hiding somewhere else. I can only speculate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, yea that&#39;s all this is, just to throw out some ideas and see what fits </p>

<p>yea, if anything i&#39;d think the CIA or someone like that took him, and basically are using the dumping platform of wikileaks to censor more info - there&#39;s that idea - another is that it was a moving thing like you said - which i hope it is - there&#39;s a lot of speculation - but raiding the embassy like that is kinda... not right feeling </p>

<p>Whether you believe people behave legally or not, is not proof of then raiding the embassy.  To do so with no reports of it happening would require a massive and fruitless effort.  In this age of instant news and video there would be at least some form of witness trail.</p>

<p>Show me some evidence of the raid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, that&#39;s not evidence.  Words like &#39;may&#39; and &#39;we don&#39;t know&#39; do not constitute evidence of an embassy raid.  Police vehicles being in the area would not be unusual.</p>

<p>Any unusual activity in that area would quickly draw a crowd as it&#39;s one of the busiest areas in London for tourists.</p>

<p>All other events around that time also don&#39;t prove anything about a raid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mud hitting you in the face would be evidence of it being thrown at you by some means, it wouldn&#39;t appear by magic.</p>

<p>His Internet being cut off is proof of nothing other than his Internet was cut.  The tweets could be just his state of mind, how do you know he wasn&#39;t drunk or high, or just pissed off about something?  People tweeting on Twitter again is useless unless they have a source.  The Internet is a wonderful thing but a lot of people take what is on it as the truth, without questioning.  It is easy to post misinformation and have it spread quickly.  Once it&#39;s out it&#39;s off into the ether, like an enhanced version of Chinese whispers.</p>

<p>There are no reliable Google sources for an Embassy raid, merely heresay, conjecture and circumstantial, nothing that would pass as evidence in a court case.  You stated &#39;but raiding the embassy like that is kinda&#39; so I thought you must have had some conclusive evidence, there isn&#39;t even footage of the police entering the Embassy via force.</p>

<p>I&#39;m quite happy to accept that in your opinion something fishy is going on, but stating something as fact, without sources, isn&#39;t the same thing.  As you said our views on proof differ, which is fine, debate is healthy and promotes greater understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s circumstantial evidence, that leaves one suspicious, and with the enemy we&#39;re facing, or whatever you want to call them, there&#39;s no room for error. These types of people have systematically covered up ridiculous amounts of things before and will continue to do so, they are the most professional of the most professional. Just a bunch of hokie stuff that&#39;s happened that seems fishy, plus it was in the upheaval time of the clinton campaigns self destructions with the help of wikileaks, disseminating the info to the public, who has a right to know. But as we can tell, the oligarchy wants to keep it all in the family, and keep us in the dark as possible. I also apologize for being rude</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If wikileaks has been compromised one thing we can say is that the people behind the compromise want to keep the masses blind, thus will ATTEMPT to keep the agenda of wikileaks alive by pushing &quot;leaks&quot; that seem to go along with the story, while on the other hand being a hidden hand of the enemy.
