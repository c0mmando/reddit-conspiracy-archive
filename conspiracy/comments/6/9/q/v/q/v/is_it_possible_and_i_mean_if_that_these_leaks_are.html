        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What are the fucking odds the exact same scenario happened in the US as it&#39;s happening in France? See a pattern?</p>

<p>Seems to be having an effect. Here in the US, people think &quot;Russia&quot; stole the election from Hillary (stupid narrative). During the whole election and after, and when trump was elected what do you see now? Extreme hostility between the citizens of the US. Lots of bickering and protesting, social media memes and arguments, and the two party system seems to means more than ever to these sheeple now, and we are incrementally inching towards some sort of chaotic social unrest. </p>

<p>My question is...</p>

<p>Is this being <em>planned</em>? Are these leaks being &quot;coordinated&quot; with big elections to cause this reaction? <strong>Remember, the NWO can&#39;t happen, unless an orchestrated collapse occurs. Then, TPTB are going to &quot;pose as the saviors&quot; of this chaos, and use it to usher in a &quot;new order&quot;, with a single currency and ruling force.</strong></p>

<p>Same thing happening in France right now. The only thing that can come from this is more social unrest and chaos in France.</p>

<p>You guys know the establishment knows how to stir shit up. The media is all over this covering it to beef it up. What do you think? Are we in the early stages of the global collapse?</p>

<p>EDIT: Lot of downvotes...shoutout to the shills. </p>

<p>Hmmm...am I onto something here???</p>

<p>Nothing is ever for certain. This would mean 1 thing though:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wiki leaks is compromised, and the establishment is coordinating these leaks on purpose to (as you said, create hostility within these countries).</li>
</ol>

<p>Is it possible that the CIA influenced wiki leaks or has compromised them? Not sure. Hard to say because I know they were NOT compromised during PG. but who knows. </p>

<p>1 there is a cabal like organization that uses evidence of crimes to force people&#39;s hands </p>

<p>2 the responsible government has gained high level access to the effected people&#39;s systems </p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that Clinton/macron were groomed into doing these things.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very clear that Wikileaks is compromised and anyone still putting any credibility in Assange is a naive fool.  The so-called Macron leaks came with very obvious fake.  The job was so amateurish that whoever was putting the &quot;evidence&quot; together forgot to merge their photoshop layers and failed to do something as basic as reproduce an accurate signature.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.numerama.com/politique/254983-compte-offshore-demmanuel-macron-une-intox-venue-de-4chan.html">http://www.numerama.com/politique/254983-compte-offshore-demmanuel-macron-une-intox-venue-de-4chan.html</a></p>

<p>And yet wikileaks went to great lengths yesterday to try to convince us that there were no fakes in the leaked documents:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/860638153471918081">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/860638153471918081</a></p>

<p>When presented with a clear, obvious example of a fake and a statement denying its existence, I can only conclude that the latter is a lie.  Why did Assange lie about this?  Whoever his masters are told him to, of course.</p>

Alternatively, they could be pushing just for a large-scale conflict between Russia and the West, and these elections are part of that.</p>

<p>This is a fucking side account I made to post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>  since I didn&#39;t want to on my main, and I have like 10 posts.

Also look at my response to the guy above you where I will elaborate on what I meant, because I probably didn&#39;t communicate it very well.</p>

<p>I like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because I like to see a different narrative and perspective on current events and because I&#39;m generally skeptical of the narratives that get pushed in most media, but <em>god damn</em> are there a lot of stupid people on here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I don&#39;t think I was totally clear in communicating what I was thinking.  I don&#39;t necessarily think that is what&#39;s happening, but I could imagine a scenario in which TPTB/Cabal could see it being beneficial to themselves to shift global geo-politics towards a more Russian dominated environment in which the US&#39;s power and influence as a world police was diminished and there was more acceptance of Russian style autocratic, nationalistic states.</p>

<p>Referring to TPTB being partly Russian, I think this only makes sense.  Certainly some of the Russian oligarch and leaders including likely Putin (who is the former director of the KGB and an oligarch in his own right, banking and industry elite <em>and</em> intelligence elite) are part of the &#39;<em>in</em>&#39; circle within the Cabal/TPTB.  Now I think the typical notion of the Cabal/TPTB that exists on this sub as a coordinated global conspiracy is probably not very realistic, and rather there are likely many factions of the Cabal/TPTB who work together in some ways but are also vying against each other for more influence and more power.</p>

<p>In this case there is likely a Russian faction or a Russian aligned faction who may be gaining power.  Again, I don&#39;t really believe this is actually happening, but it is one scenario that I see as possible that could explain some of the geo-political events of the past couple years.</p>

<p>RE: the war between Russia and the west.  I definitely see increased escalation over the last couple years, and all the RUssia hysteria in the US right now is pretty reminiscent of the cold-war era type of propaganda, and I assume this is coming for a particular reason.  I&#39;m not sure why the US is building up the Russian boogey-man again, but I think its for a larger reason than just covering HRC and explaining her loss.  Additionally, Russia has become increasingly bold in the last couple years with the annexation of Crimea and the wars in Ukraine and Syria, and it continues to look like they are willing to escalate conflict with the west.</p>

<p>Why this is all happening, I don&#39;t know, however if there does become a war between Russia and the west, either hot or cold, there stands to be a lot of money made.  And if some factions of the Cabal/TPTB are responsible for making this war happen, they are in an opportunity to control it and profit off of it more than anyone else.  Lots of people got rich off of WW2 and other early 20th century conflicts, and the Rothschilds have profited off of wars for the entirety of their dynasty, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s absurd to think that some factions of the Cabal/TPTB would be in support of creating more global conflict.  Again, I don&#39;t really think tis is happening, but it does seem like one explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but I think we&#39;ve entered a new &quot;phase&quot; in media manipulation.</p>

<p>TPTB KNOW that a decent portion of the world&#39;s people are skeptical of mainstream media. </p>

<p>Now, they use the media and their tarnished reputation for manipulation, to actually lead people in certain directions.</p>

<p>Example, with Trump, since he was &quot;attacked&quot; in the media, the people thought, </p>

<p>&quot;The media&#39;s attacking him because he&#39;s anti establishment, he must be on our side!&quot;</p>

<p>They know we don&#39;t trust the media, so they&#39;re exploiting the equation:</p>

<p>Anything the media seemingly &quot;covers up&quot; or &quot;attacks&quot; = must have legitimacy to it</p>

<p>Trump attacked by media and deemed &quot;racist&quot; = He must be on our side!</p>

<p>They are leading us in certain directions with this new MSM distrust. TPTB are smart, they are able to gauge how the general population feels and what they are thinking, what they trust. They use this to manipulate us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say you&#39;re right in the title questions, but I think the main weapon is mass immigration from a culture that refuses to assimilate.  </p>

<p>Problem -&gt; Reaction -&gt; Solution  </p>

<p>TPTB orchestrate all 3 rungs.  The solution will likely be things like multinational armies (like we&#39;re seeing with the EU army), increased socialism and communism, stricter restrictions on most civilian matters, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possible? I&#39;d say likely. How has the US put puppets up in the middle easy? A little stability loss, some negative narration of the current leader, toss on civil war, terrorism, and military intervention, youve got an authoritarian puppet government goin.</p>

<p>Say they wanted to do this in the US. How could they? Run an election with one very &quot;good&quot; candidate, and one very &quot;evil&quot; one. Let the evil one win, and create unrest between the two groups. The two groups that are almost literally 50/50 of the voting population. All that&#39;s left for us is a little more terrorism, maybe a war with a minor country like NK. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t stress enough how important it is that they need to get rid of the 2nd amendment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think as crazy as this is going to sound they will be taking the US off the map so they don&#39;t have to deal with it&#39;s natural rebellious culture any longer. The US is the only modern really pro gun nation on earth left so the crazy NWO might just be planning to crash and burn it so they rule from Germany or Asia.</p>

<p>What ever the plan is I think before 2030 we are going to have seen really screwed up stuff happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might sound retarded, but perhaps a partial collapse is what civilization needs right now.  It would be the only thing that would get Americans out of their semi-comfortable way of living and actually going after those responsible for their country&#39;s demise.  Same goes for Europe.  These elites seems untouchable to us commoners, but they are just human individuals.  It wouldn&#39;t take much to exile them or give them street justice.  Billions of us and a several thousands of them.  </p>
