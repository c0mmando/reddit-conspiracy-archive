    <div class="md"><p>Do you seriously believe its not like this already even with fucking guns? I GUARANTEE you if a black man justifiably shot a police officer tomorrow because the officer was abusing his power, half the country would crucify him in an instant for being a thug or a terrorist amd tptb would push that narrative so hard that the other half would eventually buy it.  Guns dk nothing now they are going to do nothing tomorrow.  The thing is, many conservatives support gun control AND heavy policing, and if thats not textbook cognitive dissonance than idk what is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me from that Hitler saw them as competitors on an equal level as evidenced by this quote from him:</p>

<p>*&quot;All the supposed abominations, the skeletons and death’s heads, the coffins and the mysteries, are mere bogeys for children. But there is one dangerous element and that is the element I have copied from them. They form a sort of priestly nobility. They have developed an esoteric doctrine not merely formulated, but imparted through the symbols and mysteries in degrees of initiation. The hierarchical organization and the initiation through symbolic rites, that is to say, without bothering the brain but by working on the imagination through magic and the symbols of a cult, all this has a dangerous element, and the element I have taken over. Don&#39;t you see that our party must be of this character...? An Order, that is what it has to be — an Order, the hierarchial Order of a secular priesthood... Ourselves or the Freemasons or the Church — there is room for one of the three and no more... We are the strongest of the three and shall get rid of the other two.&quot; *</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you already have a tyranny in the US, more or less, so it clearly isn&#39;t working.</p>

<p>More, how has this worked out in the US in the last century for you?  Typically everyone involved ends up like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege">Branch Davidians</a>.  Occasionally, you get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Weaver">Randy Weaver</a>, who lost his wife and kids but got some compensation.  Not really a good trade.</p>

<p>Overall, you&#39;re going up with your guns against the most heavily armed military force in the history of the world.  If you think the rest of the populace will be with you, you are wrong.  You will be represented as terrorists and most people will just shrug.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some virtue to &quot;taking a few of them with you&quot;, but realistically, by the time it ends up as &quot;You and your guns vs. the United States of America&quot;, you have <em>already</em> lost, and are simply trying to make a spectacular finish.</p>

<p>Sure, I understand why you have the guns as a last ditch defense mechanism, but you won&#39;t prevent tyranny that way.  Your only hope is to use the democratic tools at your disposal while you still have them.  Once it&#39;s down to you and your rifles vs. a couple of gunships and APCs, you will die - perhaps gloriously, but you will still die, and people will be told that you were a terrorist, and they will nod and believe it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The US wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;We&#39;re turning on our citizens&quot; - precisely because that wouldn&#39;t work out, for precisely the reasons you say.</p>

<p>Instead, there would be an &quot;attack&quot; on the United States that killed a lot of people.  Americans would be told it was the work of &quot;terrorists&quot; and nearly all of them would believe it.  Soldiers would never be ordered to kill their neighbors - instead, they&#39;d be asked to &quot;defend the country&quot; against &quot;terrorists&quot;.  </p>

<p>Do note that soldiers are already moved around constantly from place to place - in my mind, this is precisely so they can&#39;t form lasting relationships with the non-military community.</p>

<p>And do remember that few people who are anti-authoritarian join the military, and the majority of those who do are either weeded out, or brainwashed into cooperation.</p>

<p>Yes, some small percentage of people would be very skeptical - but would be afraid to act or even speak out, because they would immediately be branded terrorists, with &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. I think that these people would proudly fight and die <em>for their government</em> and believe that they were fighting and dying for their fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>I mean, look at all those poor saps who signed up to fight in Iraq because they were led to believe that this was some sort of reasonable response to being attacked by a group of Saudi Arabian terrorists (and, yes, we all wonder about that, but no matter who did 9/11, it certainly wasn&#39;t Saddam).</p>

<p>More Americans died in that stupid war than in 9/11, and 50,000 people were seriously injured (and you know what <em>that</em> means for the rest of your life...) - and for what?</p>

<p>Because the government told them that Iraq was their enemy, and they bravely went out to defend their country.</p>

<p>It&#39;s happened for thousands of years.  It will continue to happen.</p>

<p>I understand why you have the guns as a last ditch defense mechanism, but you won&#39;t prevent tyranny that way.</p>

<p>Lol wow....Not buying it. Is this why every major dictatorship has found a way to confiscate the peoples protection/weapons before they become ultra-tyrannical? Not coincidence pal...You need to learn your history, seriously.</p>

<p>Hitler, Stalin, and Mao Zedong, are all noted as having disarmed their populations before becoming dictatorial super states.</p>

<p>And what usually follows? Massive genocide.  Is anybody here familiar with the term <strong>Democide</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>Democide- The murder of any person or people by their government, including genocide, politicide and mass murder.</strong></p>

<p>Democide is actually the leading cause of premature death in <em>history</em>. Government genocide is responsible for nearly 200,000,000 recorded deaths. WOW!</p>

<p>So the notion that having a 2nd amendment is not important, is just fucking ridiculous. Like I said, it&#39;s ok though, because you don&#39;t know your history.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s keep this civil - because this subject is dead serious.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sure, let&#39;s look at Hitler!  Actually, I had a long thing written, but <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1791/did-hitler-ban-gun-ownership">this Straight Dope article</a> said everything I wanted to, more and better.  Please read that - summary is that pre-Nazi Germany had extremely liberal gun laws, which Hitler used to his advantage in taking over the government.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Your claim isn&#39;t even right - epidemics have killed at least 300,000,000 people.  Heck, one outbreak of the Black Death in the 14th century alone killed around 100,000,000 - and that&#39;s at a time when the total world population was less than 500,000,000.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite likely that war is the #2 killer, with democide being the third.</p>

<p>However, we can all agree that governments are dangerous.  The real question is - can we resist the US government with the sorts of weapons that are available to us today?</p>

<p>My claim is no.  The US government has far more weapons and far more powerful weapons than any government in history.  If it&#39;s you and your guns vs. even one gunship, 99 times out of a hundred you&#39;re going to be dead in a few seconds, and if by some lucky shot you manage to take out the pilot before your home is reduced to rubble, they&#39;ll just send ten more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?… The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin’s thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If…if…We didn’t love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation…. We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.” ― Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</p>

<p>Yeah, no. This idea is bullshit. If the government wanted tyranny they would do it. I understand why people want guns. That&#39;s fine. Bit this idea that we need them in order to stop the government is hilarious. </p>

<hr/>

<p>The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001. Also known as the USA Patriot Act. It was proposed by the Bush Administration soon after the September 11 attacks. At that time, President Bush had very high approval ratings and it was clear that most Americans wanted him to do something to stop more terrorism. The bill passed quickly in Congress, mostly before it had even been fully read. The act made it much easier to control money terrorists had in bank accounts. ...

I GUARANTEE you if a black man justifiably shot a police officer tomorrow because the officer was abusing his power, half the country would crucify him in an instant for being a thug or a terrorist amd tptb would push that narrative so hard that the other half would eventually buy it.  Guns dk nothing now they are going to do nothing tomorrow.  The thing is, many conservatives support gun control AND heavy policing, and if thats not textbook cognitive dissonance than idk what is.</p>
