<p>B) I said no such thing. It is a conspiracy THEORY. Until more details come out, it can&#39;t be corroborated as fact.</p>

<p>C) Without answering at least one of those questions (sans where and when, as we all know damn well where and when it happened) what should be put in the confirmed conspiracy? &quot;Unknown parties demolished WTC7 for unknown reasons, but we know for sure it was a controlled demolition&quot;.... Sounds believable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not at all what I said. You&#39;re insufferable. Eat some gogurt out of an owl&#39;s asshole.</p>

<p>You already admitted it&#39;s a confirmed conspiracy. Unless we&#39;re hypothesizing supervillain&#39;s acting alone with superpowers... </p>

<p>It takes coordination to demolish a skyscraper. Demolishing a skyscraper full of people is mass-murder, not to mention a dozen other kinds of illegal. Putting up goalposts at the end of some hypothetically detailed story is neither useful nor necessary. </p>

<p>Jesse Ventura&#39;s special being removed from DVRs (with InfoWars as the source) is a confirmed conspiracy but 9/11 isn&#39;t? I&#39;m not even sure that Tivo&#39;s interference was illegal, much less confirmed in any official capacity or described in any detail who or why or how they did it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re insufferable and my words are wasted on your clay-filled ears. Hence, eat some gogurt out of an owl&#39;s asshole you anti-conspiracy theory broshill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what. That was rude. I apologize. You kinda caught me off guard a day after the fact and I&#39;m kind of tired of talking about this, but I&#39;m gonna go ahead and detail out my position on this for you and if you disagree, then so be it, but I won&#39;t be responding to any more posts on this thread.</p>

<p>The &#39;confirmed conspiracy&#39; sidebar is where new users are sent to get an idea of conspiracies that have happened in the past, who did it, why they did it, how they were addressed before and after coming to light, etc.
All of these details are important in showing new users that conspiracies ARE real, they have happened in the past, and they are happening now all over the world.
If the mods post incomplete information on there, on any subject, it may turn critical readers away from this sub. That&#39;s why I said beyond all shadow of doubt, regardless of hyperbole, because the purpose of the &#39;confirmed conspiracy&#39; sidebar (in my mind, at least) is to change the mindset of people who don&#39;t believe that conspiracies are real, not just some checklist of what we know.</p>

<p>People who don&#39;t believe in conspiracies are idiots and putting what we know about 9/11 up there ain&#39;t gonna prevent any idiots from changing their minds on conspiracy in general.</p>

<p>It would inform them of what we know about 9/11. They&#39;d probably just shut off their frontal lobe though.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been proven that 9/11 is a conspiracy so far as the known details show us. Exclusion from the list isn&#39;t just absurd. It&#39;s a message from the mods that they&#39;re compromised.</p>
