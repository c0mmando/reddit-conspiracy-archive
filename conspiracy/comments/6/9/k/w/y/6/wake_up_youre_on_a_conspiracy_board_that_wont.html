       Wrong? 9/11 Truth is on the sidebar. Your title needs work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe something like: It's a conspiracy that r/conspiracy's "list of confirmed conspiracies" doesn't include wtc 7? Anyhoo r/conspiracy has always been good about linking to r/911truth?

       First time I've clicked on the red button labeled "List of Confirmed Conspiracies" so the chances of understanding your title were slim. Anyhoo your post about the board that "Won't Acknowledge" wtc7 falls flat with the link to r/911Truth on the main page.

       you never asked. you insisted, manipulated, mischaracterized OP, and had a sincere aura of 'unwillingness to learn.'

       That's the third time you've insisted a "related subreddit" is the same as the "List of Confirmed Conspirpacies" button.

       I'm not here to argue with you. I agree that its a conspiracy, there's just not enough evidence (as of yet) to go around touting it as fact. Who blew the building? What did they use? Why did they do it? How did they keep witnesses quiet? Should the moods just add 'WTC7 was a controlled demolition, we know bc free fall' to the list?

       If you're implying that I'm derailing this conversation by stating that there's a difference between theory and fact, then you're sadly mistaken. Even if its taken at face value that WTC7 controlled demolition is an undeniable fact, without a perpetrator or reason how can you PROVE that it was a conspiracy?

       Yeah, its generally accepted even outside of conspiracy circles that the NIST report is heavily flawed, if not completely fabricated. That still answers none of the questions I asked. I wholeheartedly support the claims that WTCs 1, 2 and 7 were all controlled demolitions, but until it's proven I'm not going to call them confirmed. By all means keep digging and spreading awareness, but don't jump down people's throats when they ask question you don't have answers to.

       A) YOU proved nothing. You posted somebody else's findings.

      <p>
       B) I said no such thing. It is a conspiracy THEORY. Until more details come out, it can't be corroborated as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) Without answering at least one of those questions (sans where and when, as we all know damn well where and when it happened) what should be put in the confirmed conspiracy? "Unknown parties demolished WTC7 for unknown reasons, but we know for sure it was a controlled demolition".... Sounds believable.

       D) Yeah, you too. FYI I upvoted all of your comments in the chain until the direct attack. I don't disagree with you per se, I just think you're jumping the gun a bit.

       Cool. I suppose we should throw Reptilians, Flat Earth, Hollow Earth, Archons, Pizzagate, etc. All up on the confirmed conspiracy list too, because its not about what we can prove is true, its about what we feel is true, right? Feels over reals is totally our mantra around here.

       It takes coordination to demolish a skyscraper. Demolishing a skyscraper full of people is mass-murder, not to mention a dozen other kinds of illegal. Putting up goalposts at the end of some hypothetically detailed story is neither useful nor necessary.

       Jesse Ventura's special being removed from DVRs (with InfoWars as the source) is a confirmed conspiracy but 9/11 isn't? I'm not even sure that Tivo's interference was illegal, much less confirmed in any official capacity or described in any detail who or why or how they did it.

       You know what. That was rude. I apologize. You kinda caught me off guard a day after the fact and I'm kind of tired of talking about this, but I'm gonna go ahead and detail out my position on this for you and if you disagree, then so be it, but I won't be responding to any more posts on this thread.

       The 'confirmed conspiracy' sidebar is where new users are sent to get an idea of conspiracies that have happened in the past, who did it, why they did it, how they were addressed before and after coming to light, etc.
All of these details are important in showing new users that conspiracies ARE real, they have happened in the past, and they are happening now all over the world.
If the mods post incomplete information on there, on any subject, it may turn critical readers away from this sub. That's why I said beyond all shadow of doubt, regardless of hyperbole, because the purpose of the 'confirmed conspiracy' sidebar (in my mind, at least) is to change the mindset of people who don't believe that conspiracies are real, not just some checklist of what we know.

       People who don't believe in conspiracies are idiots and putting what we know about 9/11 up there ain't gonna prevent any idiots from changing their minds on conspiracy in general.

       It would inform them of what we know about 9/11. They'd probably just shut off their frontal lobe though.

       Um, maybe because unlicensed controlled demolitions are  illegal? That and they require a team to carry it out? And because it pretty much is an undeniable fact at face value that it was a controlled demo.

       Who blew the building? Why? How? You know what everything in the confirmed conspiracy list has in common? Details. You can't just throw in "WTC7 was definitely a controlled demolition, but we have no idea who did it, how they did it or why they did it"

       Think of it as a way to show people coming here for the first time that yes even msm/government admit some conspiracies are true.

       I don't consider it a list of stuff we believe has happened but rather as a sort of tool to help open the eyes of people who still believe that the media is trying to inform us and the government has our back.

       I always call it "list of conspiracies that are Wikipedia-true". It's to get your feet wet, you can always take the plunge into the rabbit hole and go straight to

       It's only a few mods at best. I ran into one who thought the conspiracy behind it was BS. His reasons why were even more BS than any conspiracy I've heard around 9/11. He actually believed the official narrative.

       Had my mind blown and he even worked around name calling by calling me something only a child would say.

       Yeah, its generally accepted even outside of conspiracy circles that the NIST report is heavily flawed, if not completely fabricated. That still answers none of the questions I asked. I wholeheartedly support the claims that WTCs 1, 2 and 7 were all controlled demolitions, but until it's proven I'm not going to call them confirmed. By all means keep digging and spreading awareness, but don't jump down people's throats when they ask question you don't have answers to.
