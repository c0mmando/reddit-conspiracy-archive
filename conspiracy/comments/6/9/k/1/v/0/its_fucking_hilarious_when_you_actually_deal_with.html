    <div class="md"><p>Not everyone in the CIA or NSA is in there because it&#39;s a family legacy. A lot of people are recruited from college after professors that &quot;work&quot; for the Agency notify them that certain students are showing promise and excelling in certain subjects or fields of interest to intelligence communities. Some go in because they then get visions of James Bond but then once they actually start working there they realize they&#39;re actually doing the equivalent of extremely tedious civie-tier office work, just for a lot less money in some situations, and realize they&#39;ve probably made a huge mistake but stick with it for an eventual government pension. Or just use the job and the security clearance as a stepping stone to a private sector job doing similar work but for considerably more money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people, even the smart ones, are completely oblivious to what&#39;s actually going. They full heartedly believe that what they&#39;re doing is making the world and America a safer place. It&#39;s not like every single person at Langley is personally setting up ISIS cells in the Middle East for Israel&#39;s benefit or organizing false flag attacks and government coups to put into place Zionist friendly heads of state. Some are just doing admin work or just intercepting bits and pieces of the bigger picture. Even the ones that are legit torturing people for information think they&#39;re doing it to make us safer, even if they are doing it without realizing that not only did we create the terrorist problem in the first place, but are perpetuating it by doing what they&#39;re doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wheres the proof that they are making anything safer?</p>

<p>You know, in my entire life, I&#39;m 35, I&#39;ve only ever read of the cia and mostly the nsa making things horrible for other people in America, and around the globe.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever ran into ONE FUCKING NEWS ARTICLE that reads, &quot;The cia helped the fbi take down some bad guys this month...&quot;, or w/e. They basically have unlimited power and resources, they know this, and now they&#39;ve become what most would in such a position, maniacal evil doers. </p>

<p>Their blindness does not matter. &quot;A few bad apples&quot;, doesn&#39;t matter. Their complete destruction does. I just can&#39;t make that happen. All I can do is bitch and moan drunkardly on the web, and hope to inform others of their evil.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a helluva thing to have such an evil destroy your place in life, and to be basically helpless against it. Hell, I can&#39;t even leave the fucking country because they find various ways to block my passport, or I&#39;d be in Europe or Russia with my fucking dog this very second. I&#39;d rather be homeless in the EU with my dog, than live in this place that I cannot trust.</p>

<p>You do understand that the cia and nsa, slightly waring factions of an &quot;internal government&quot;, run this nation in reality, right?</p>

<p>The bad guys, the evil do&#39;ers, have taken over. They&#39;ve won! They snuck in, in their creepy cowardly way, and they have the nation! They have your PC (Intel CPU / Windows 7 / ISP DNS) by the balls. They have your politicians fucking toddlers for blackmail/control purposes. </p>

<p>So, at what point will you stand up and crush skulls? When you&#39;re in the position I&#39;m in? Almost complete life destruction? Probably. A little too comfortable to bring the pain. I understand, as I was there too. I turned the blind eye when I read/understood the evil being done.</p>

<p>However, now I&#39;m here. They&#39;ve put me in a perpetual limbo/hell. I&#39;m ready to rock n&#39; roll, I&#39;d just like them to show up at my fucking doorstep to start the show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not sad. I don&#39;t agree with the guy/Russian gov. on everything they practice, but they&#39;ve never screwed with me. If I had something to trade them for a visa, some language lessons and 6 months of a middle class apartment, (and from there on I could get on my own feet), I&#39;d already be over there. However, I don&#39;t have anything of value to trade. </p>

<p>Violence is the answer when nothing else works, and one is being attacked. I have been insanely patient. At first I thought it was a cult, and maybe the FBI was investigating them, maybe using me as bait? (Weird, but the best thing I could come up with at the time.) Then I understood that it was the US gov., and figured they&#39;d go away when they understood that they had the wrong guy, or that I wasn&#39;t a terrorist. They still persist. This shit started in 2015. We&#39;re in May, 6th, 2017 now!</p>

<p>I cannot set goals, as no matter what I do, they&#39;ll dig their creepy crawly cia/nsa claws into whatever the fuck I do. I try to get a job? &quot;Oh, that guy tried to rape me!&quot;, or maybe I&#39;ll make another start-up, and they&#39;ll somehow trick me into committing fraud or working with organized crime, which they tried six months ago with two stolen credit cards, yep, that happened, but I caught that little trick too.</p>

<p>They will not leave me alone. They will not allow me to leave the nation in any dignified manner. I&#39;m broke, credit cards are maxed. What is left?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Accually, in all seriousness, from one human to another , I hope you find peace and happiness. I drove a taxi ten years weekend night shifts in a big city, Ive exsperienced more more human drama on a weekend than most people do in thier lifetimes. Ive met people on the very best day of thier lives and the very worst.
And I just want you to know after meeting 100 random strangers every weekend for 10 years...i want you to know that I quit that taxi job ......with a more positive view of humanity, that we are almost all exactly the same, most all of us are kind compassionate people by nature, given the benefit of the doubt and a little respect.
Ive had to sit and hug strangers from the ER weeping thier loved ones died, Ive had to clean drunk vomit out of suffocating mouths while they puke all over my taxi (and still not get paid)......but let me tell you the wierdest thing about that job..it was those times that my nigts were ruined  and made no money  but I was able to help a random stranger.... that gave me Job Satisfaction beyond any other job.
 I came away understanding that for every bad action someone does, a million acts of  normal kindness happens all around you unawares...
Anyways, hope you find whatever it is you need for Peace, and nothing wrong with a third party professional therepists..those people have a lot of wisdom to share after getting to know 100s  or 1000s of.clients</p>
