I just remember Youtube not being anything nearly as big as it use to be. My little sister can sit there for HOURS and I was cooking the other day for quite some time and actually got to listen to wtf shes watching and it&#39;s completely mind numbing. It&#39;s all about others opinion on things. I couldn&#39;t stand to watch that for hours?
Just random mind numbing toddler bullshit. Like random noises and singing random parts of songs, and speaking of there opinions on things. (Makes me think global consciousness agenda) Mind you shes 13. 
But I even remember hearing them repeat things/segments in the video, like almost brain washed, and she didn&#39;t even seem to notice. Hard to explain, wish I knew what videos they were, but kinda worrying to see she can watch it for hours on end.
Any examples you have of profiles you find indoctrinating? I find it fascinating the amount of psychological warfare going on. 
Hell, I was even played by it as a child...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youtube has a lot of crazy indoctrinating videos</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video from ThatPoppy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1_m7QuQeTQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1_m7QuQeTQ</a></p>

<p>Your best bet is to get her off youtube, because she&#39;ll find something she shouldn&#39;t be getting into.  There&#39;s tons of hypnosis videos and people online teaching witchcraft and how to summon demons</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing so much ThatPoppy posts today actually made me think to post this - I was looking for even more besides her profile.
Is she really that popular though? Besides people simply watching for the weird factor? Like from watching 1 video I can totally tell its absolutely Illuminati bullshit. Very weird. Not even subtle about it. 
I wish to stop that as well, technically my sister in law so a bit harder. Not really sure how to bring it about to stop it... her mother would think its crazy bonkers lol people are clueless to whats going on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s the Don&#39;t Hug Me I&#39;m Scared channel.  It looks like a fun kids video in the beginning, but as the video progresses it get very dark and occultic.  I left a few posts talking about youtube channels that promote the satanification of children and a lot of those videos have techniques to induce hypnosis/put kids in a mind numbing state while they insert subliminal messages and images.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed a pattern with some of these creepy kids videos, they usually have these bright vibrant colors in the thumbnail</p>

<p>Also the finger family nursery songs are hypnosis and they represent finger demons</p>

<p>That&#39;s because a handful of years ago it didn&#39;t exist.  YouTube, google, Alta vista, ask Jeeves, Myspace, livejournal, homestar, newgrounds, irc, icq, none of those existed very long ago.  Odds are you don&#39;t even know what at least one of those is without (Heh) googling it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have nieces and one of them can spend limitless hours just watching a few people post youtube content. Particularly 5 nights at freddy&#39;s crap.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t fault Youtube for that. I fault parenting and a lack of boundaries and direction. You know, like instilling good dietary habits, hygiene, cleaning rooms/messes, doing homework, going outside to play and develop motor skills and street smarts, ride bikes, play baseball/soccer/basketball/something.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that most parents with younger children think just having it survive another day is success. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! The amount of impressionable, and anxious youth of average or below-average intelligence being ensnared by hacks like Alex Jones, Eric Dubay and other such &quot;red-pillers&quot; is pretty astounding. Seeking truth =/= knee jerk contrarianism. Pretty crazy how effective propaganda videos on youtube are when you&#39;re uneducated/ignorant on a topic. Crazy how many kids are convinced Hitler wasn&#39;t such a bad dude, and everything they&#39;ve read about the natural sciences is a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the question to really ask here is where do the videos come up as a recommendation? Do they come up in actual childrens videos? Because how many young parents simply hand their phones to their children... and they end up on something completely different. Then the &#39;dark adult humor&#39; thing wouldn&#39;t be as legit anymore. </p>
