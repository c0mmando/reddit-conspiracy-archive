       Even if you don't care about the outcome of the French election these emails could reveal a lot about the systems behind people like "Macron" who is connected to the Rothschild's. I find it amazing that you're on a conspiracy board but ain't interested in the content of the emails.

       As I noted in another thread, it was a huge dump of data and it was only about a day ago. It's going to take some time for people to sort through them and find the interesting parts. Since there have been accusations that some of the emails are fake, professional journalists and news sources will probably fact check the juicier ones before publishing.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that a huge chunk of the data will be normal political campaign stuff, En Marche and Macron confirmed that just before the French reporting blackout started.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not going to hear much from the French until after the election regardless. The upside to that though is that French journos have two days to do some thorough investigations into the dumps so when they do finally start publishing we might see some good stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we can really do for now is either read the emails ourselves or

       It's funny that 90% of the people reading this will not read a single email, yet will claim with absolute certainty not only that the content of the email is either "completely damaging" or "nothing to see," but also that they can somehow magically determine the exact intention of whoever leaked them. The backfire effect post from a few days ago is really in effect. People are fitting the scenario to their worldview without even considering the actual facts and using it to label the opposing group as crazy.

       How not?  Sure, Podesta is a child murdering pedophile, but that's not all the Podesta emails revealed.  Give it a couple days and we'll start to find out what Macron has been up to.  The simple fact this was leaked indicates that somebody feels there's something worth leaking.

       Good point. I kind of want the podesta emails to remain on the front-burner so that people can have a better chance to figure out what's going on within American government (potentially exposing other countries?). At some point, we will be saturated with emails to sort, and the things we will find, (while still disgusting) will not be as potent because "every email points to some shady shit" I definitely want all the emails to be thoroughly looked through.

       They will be.  I personally read through about half of the Podesta release, and I didn't find anything others hadn't previously.  Be patient, 9GB is a massive amount of data and will take a while to dig through, but the truth will come out in time.

       So you admit you were grossly exagerating to try and prove some point. Yea, nice. That is how fake news evolves. Exaggerate the hell out of the truth to sway opinions. Be more careful about the statments you make when you are speaking with such conviction. As you said, SOME people believe what they read on reddit.

       I think your missing my point completely, the 90% has nothing to do with my actual point just what it appeared to be from my viewing reading the other thread. I'll admit the 90% was an exaggeration, but I'm not sure what "Fake news" has to do with it. My point is to be open to being wrong and not accepting things because it matches your particular worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than forcibly projecting my worldview onto other's I am actually telling people to not be afraid to have their worldview change no matter what side they are on. If anything that is the opposite of "Fake news."

       The issue is that they were posted mere hours before the mandatory 48-hour media blackout pre-election. As a result, they're getting spread around on social media (check twitter, 95% of the accounts spreading them are blatantly pro-trump american accounts).
      </p>
      <p>
       This gives the news media no ability to fact-check/debunk any claims.

       No worries! Brock's gang of ShareBlue is already pushing the "muh Russia" narrative on social media, blaming Russia and WikiLeaks too (for some dumb reason, even though WikiLeaks has nothing to do w/it) attempting to outrage French voters as if their democracy is under attack by TRUTHS! Oh, the horror! Lol!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, rest assured, the pro Macron side is pushing their false narrative all over the net and mainstream media outside France.

       Macron's own people have released these e-mail:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         elections are tomorrow;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         there is no way to find anything in these e-mails (not enough time, plus it's not even clear Macron did something controversial);
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         thus this dump does not hurt Macron in any way;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         but it hurts Le Pen because it creates the impression that Russia interferes with the elections.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Why is even Russia in the picture?  With the Democrats, they at least had some bullshit investigation that kind of showed that some group called Fancy Bear was involved, and bear is a national totem animal in Russia,
       <em>
        ergo
       </em>
       it's clearly Russia.  With Macron there are no details on anything except that it's 9GB.
      </p>
      <p>
       National Front has close to 100,000 members.  That's 90KB of emails per person to read.  That's one hour per person.  If there was anything there, it would have been revealed already.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst thing about these two stories (plus the chemical attacks in Syria) is that there are very capable people behind all these,
       <em>
        and they are not Russian
       </em>
       .  This is the worst part: they are not Russian.  While you are looking elsewhere, someone plays you.  Look at how effective they are: the American presidency is threatened, the French presidency is threatened, and there is a possibility of a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia.

        lthough the autopsy revealed no human flesh in Eugene's stomach, a number of undigested pills were discovered that have not been identified.[20] Although police sources had speculated that the street drug "bath salts" might have been involved, preliminary toxicology reports were positive only for the presence of cannabis.[5][21] Authorities have not necessarily found the negative results conclusive; Broward Sheriff Al Lamberti has expressed a belief that some new drug not yet tested for played a role; nationally noted toxicologist Barry Logan said Eugene's behavior was consistent with "bath salts" and that toxicologists "are not testing for everything that may be out there"; and the director of toxicology at the University of Florida, Dr. Bruce Goldberger, said, "We are not incompetent...We have the tools, we have the sophistication and know-how. But the field is evolving so rapidly it is hard for us to keep track. It's almost as if it is a race we can never win."[22]

       Seriously though I think it was just a new form of bath salts that couldnt be traced in system because they dont know the genetic compound of that drug because they change quickly as to avoid bans.

       Basically a designer drug made in a lab by a chemist. It's highly euphoric like cocaine, but is apparently more more-ish. Meaning you can't fucking stop taking it once you've started lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       The research chemical scene is pretty big, as they keep pumping out Chems faster than they can be banned. Once one's banned, another comes out with a slightly different molecular structure to keep it legal. The scene would always be there, as humans are always looking for the next big thing, but it would be way smaller if drugs were just legalized already.

       There were also a couple of files that alluded to Macron being funded by American/Saudi interest groups, but that doesn't really surprise anyone.

      <p>
       There was also a couple of files that seemed pretty pizzagate imo, but I've only found two so far that I would consider pedo-friendly.

      <p>
       Not gonna post it here because they always ban pg stuff, but keep an eye on voat.co/pizzagate. I'm gonna start a post with the info I find, if one is not already created, when I did a bit deeper

       They're all factions of the same global "Satanic" ring that has its hold on the population of earth. ("Satanic" isn't
       <em>
        really

       the most accurate word, but it gets the picture across. It's occult stuff at least. There's something bigger and very dark behind the scenes. It's spiritual, and they have access to hidden knowledge that most people wouldn't even know exists.)

       That's the one I was thinking of! I should do a bit more research into that myself. I've done a lot into the "lighter" side of occultism where Buddhism pretty much touches on, and I know they're in ways parallel yet inverse to each other. Shit, man, I should probably read the old testament as well while I'm at it haha.

       Best video format info on the mystery religion that I've come across is from those guys.  Also graham Hancock touches on the idea.  R/Holofractal reinforces the holographic principle for me.

       It's all waves of energy and we're caught in a focus of frequencies being stuck in this dimension somehow against our will (those of us who have thought this abstractly at least)

       Every religion is a tactful deception.  There's a reason Gnostics were hunted down for saying these things throughout history.

       They all worship a demiurge that holds humanity in captivity within the spectrum of light.  Our consciousness transcends this.  Close your eyes and imagine anything you want because that's the true you.

       A lot of research over a few years. Too much to name in one comment because I've been piecing it together from a very wide variety of research topics, and hearing out other people's theories too of course.

       Dark Magic - and Satanism - aka the Church of Set/Satan - also they're trying to usher in the antichrist - at least from what i've gathered - but "satanic" is a good literal word to use... they go to the church of satan/set - i think that word conveys it the best - but saying dark occultist magicians who sacrifice babies to demons etc is a bit drawn out

       So we are dealing with a North Korean spiritual leader?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't religion banned in NK?

       You're  correct but I find it odd that our original spirit cooking star Marina Abramavic has been speculated to be somewhat of a spiritual leader.

       Maybe its just a coincidence in the translation,but I don't like coincidences.

       Didn't these leaks come from 4chan? Isn't it far more likely they just put in some bullshit to fuck with everyone. Like why is some rando French businessman/politician in a Korean cult? That's fucking retarded. This sort of obscure cult conspiracy mumbo jumbo from Korea is more likely to do with whoever leaked the emails warped world view than Macron. These emails are a bunch of nothing designed to try and tilt the election, smells of Russian conspiracy all over it, and suddenly

       They seen the internal polls and le pen is in the lead.

      <p>
       They them selves leak the emails then follow the same tried and test method of attack used against trump.

       Russia hacked the election le pen should be impeached.

       Fake news get popularised.

      <p>
       Current regime makes a law against fake news influencing the elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       days before the election, a leak comes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly, the leaks have to not be talked about, or mentioned.

       Uhm actually the alleged "islamisation" document is just a textbook guideline to make the history books more comprehensive. It's not really wrong, historically speaking, since European history has been influenced by Islam via the Mediterranean sea and viceversa. The socialists backing also is just politics 101: the left wing supports the left wing candidate...nothing strange here

       Im agnostic btw, before you get too far ahead of yourself.  I just understand the differences in the Abrahamic religons as I actually took the time to look into them before deciding I just don't know for sure which if any are right.  It's not hard at all to see which is definitely wrong.

       Islam is about as close to christianity as the church of latter day saints, which is ... Fairly close.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that there have been several reformations in Islam. Perhaps you've heard of sunni and shia? There's tons of smaller ones as well.

       The funny thing is I read "Islam: the straight path" a few years ago to understand Islam better. I thought it was a pretty academic explanation no one could argue with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I started explaining the relevance of Ali to a third party, but realized there was a Shia Muslim nearby and asked him to explain it instead. "Those motherfuckers..." was his response, and it reminded me of when a very evangelical friend of mine explained that Catholics are pagans because "they worship the virgin Mary and the saints instead of God."

       No, I'm implying that the hacking in US and now French elections are obviously one-sided and helped the candidates that are friendly to Russia. Le-pen's Russian connections have been talked about, and Trump's curious Russian ties are too numerous to count, plus Trump himself defends Putin for murdering his political opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really the point I'm making is that as long the hacking is a political weapon instead of a more generally applied anti-corruption tool, it won't fight corruption.

       However, none of that means the Russians weren't involved. None of that clears Trump, or makes him a better candidate. Just the publicly available stuff shows that Trump is a corrupt narcissistic con man. At least Hillary had a decent platform. I would much prefer a corrupt politician who promotes good policy over a corrupt politician who promotes facist, racist policy.

       I suppose when the entirety of MSM starts doing their job and playing fair by treating and covering all candidates fairly, then I'll start giving a fuck that only globalists' emails are getting leaked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until then, I really appreciate having truth and transparency about my elected officials that MSM refuses to provide. They refuse to report anything negative about the establishment's pre-chosen candidates and/or act like their PR firm by spinning negative info while simultaneously smearing or ignoring via total blackout of nationalist and/or populist candidates that the MSM owners do not back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say leaks being provided straight to the people, bypassing the gatekeeping MSM, is leveling the playing field and the establishment and their brainwashed useful idiots are pissed about losing control over us plebs' minds. Governments have all our info; I think it's time we had theirs. :)

       This ground breaking revelation that some french guy did coke maybe? Or that he's a korean super wizard? Fucking ground breaking. The donald is a bunch of retards worshiping a literal retard. The posts there are largely stupid racist nonsense from garbage news sources. Everything the sub preported to stand for has been betrayed by its name sake so it's mostly various racist/whatever jokes about how muslims are pedos or whatever, that and minor fluff pieces about oh hey some muslim killed some black guy. Did you know murders occur? Often by muslims!

       These leaks are empty garbage, the donald is garbage. Trump is a con artist and you are as useful an idiot as he is.

       This story has no teeth to it, it's just a smear attempt with good timing. There's actual important news that you are ignoring by using T_D as your source of news, and no good conspiracies come out of that subreddit because it has to avoid Trump, the president, who's about knee deep in the goop nowadays as anyone else.

       There were emails for their plans to rewrite history to make it seem as Islam and the West were equally responsible for the Enlightenment. There was evidence of arms deals with known Lebanese Hezbollah/ISIS arms suppliers. There was clear evidence that Macron is controlled by the Rothschilds. There was evidence that he does spirit cooking shit with Koreans.....

       Man if you wanna make up a bunch of shit to try and get someone elected trim the fat a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Islam is responsible for maintaining the knowledge of the romans and advancing society forward up to the enlightenment so an argument could be made there, but I don't see how or why that would be some french politicians position, other than perhaps as a means of spin to relieve tensions with the islamic population.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all sounds like a bunch of made up shit 2 days before the election to smear him. If these claims had any weight they would've been made earlier so that the media could report on and focus on them. Instead they were made right when the media can't report on them, saying to me that they likely have no merit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not huge dude, no one cares about your stupid ideology, go learn something, go get a skill, go lose weight or get a job or read a book or something. Your support of Trump is pathetic and your weird cyber cult is lame.

       Well I'm convinced. Dude get a life lol, this is a bunch of gobblidity goop in a language you and i dont speak, translated by people we don't know about a country no one knows shit about that has nothing to do with the person in question. The email has no outside context, no reason for existing and you are making a bunch of random guesses about korean family trees and ciphers with zero context. On top of this this is an unconfirmed to be real email released in a massive batch. There's no contextual or circumstantial reason for it to be a thing regarding Macron outside of some large base "knowledge" about korean voodoo cults I'm sure some tinfoil wearing Alex Jones watching loon could give me a crash course on. This isn't proof of anything, use your fucking brain, holy shit.

       He's just up to no good. There's tons of emails between him and his rothschild handlers. It's gross. They have a plan to rewrite Islamic/West history and to naturalize ALL refugees. The Islam plan is really going down dude. They're really going for it.

       While I completely agree, it is very suspicious when any subreddit gets a statistically significant number of new users. If it's the regular crew cycling through new accounts, there really wont be that many new accounts relative to the number of total accounts posting.

       I come to this sub rarely. But my guess is that Reddit users might not want to leave markable traces of their activity? I've heard of some t_d users accounts being tagged and such, I'm not sure of the mindset of people that browse this sub but I imagine tor and other precautions might be standard for some. Don't know if people are willing to go and make new accs but if there was a deep state, I would probably tag users of this sub and see if there are links to sites like 4chan tbh.

       One thing to note is that a lot of people will use Alts to post things that reveal any political opinion. Having a post history in

       The reaction of the media will likely have more of an effect than the contents.
      </p>
      <p>
       A day before election the media in france agrees not to post negative info they may have on their preferred candidate and the government has threatened criminal charges for posting them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This just a few days after a debate where Le Pen won handily yet CNN and BBC and left leaning media all reported Macron winning. Even lifelong lefty Morrissey called out the media and said Le Pen very obviously won.

       It is not bullshit.
Yes I am aware of the rule, that is no doubt part of the reason the leaks were dropped an hour before the limit. 
The release was more about reminding people of what they aren't allowed to know about the candidate they are considering because they aren't completely free.
      </p>
      <p>
       That does NOT change the absolute fact that the government has threatened criminal charges for posting them and media consensus not to discuss the leaks. It shouldn't be a rule, but they still had time to discuss the leaks in a short window, and they can still cover it in certain ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine that the sole purpose of the leak was to make people going to the polls realize "hey it's kind of fucked up we are about to vote for a guy who has just had leaks dropped that may verify a long standing scandal regarding him, and we have to vote blind - maybe we should vote against this form of France."
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be no media blackout allowed.
France isn't a free country.

       I would argue that you in fact are the one that is god damned stupid. You are going to ignore everything else I say and than say I am stupid because I said Morrissey has been a life long lefty. You get up in arms about a comment about Moz and presume my intelligence based on that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Morrissey has been left leaning the majority of his life, only until the last few years have people started calling him a right winger. Same as Johnny Rotten, older Brits prefer the non EU England of their youth. So of course their in support of Brexit.
So a few years of being called right winger over a a few issues does not make him a right winter.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, in fact you are fucking stupid.

       Also RT lol, AJ can be somewhat useful, but anyone with an informed opinion uses multiple outlets, some combination of BBC CBC AJ and RT Might get you a good general overview, but I'd take RT and to a lesser extent AJ with a pretty big grain of salt. T_D is just stupid. Like it's a stupid place for REEEpublicans and fat Red pillers.

       It just shows how far the globalists have gone to take over the media.  Even the comments in this sub seem to completely parrot the main stream media's current narrative word for word.  This is a

       I love this new reality where Russia is this super villain behind everything, trying to make other countries become more nationalist for some reason. How exactly do you know Russia is behind this? Like wat. How brainwashed are you people, do you have any idea how many people could be involved? Why is it always russia, it's disgusting. I hope you get paid well.

       4d chess move: your emails leak, so you make some new reddit accounts, push your own leaks, reddit thinks you are a shill. Now reddit thinks leaks must be fake because they are being pushed by shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brigade the sub with talking about the emails, so no one reads them.

       Oh, you're posting again still worried about this? Don't be! Brock's gang of ShareBlue is already pushing the "muh Russia" narrative on social media, blaming Russia and WikiLeaks too (for some dumb reason, even though WikiLeaks has nothing to do w/it) attempting to outrage French voters as if their democracy is under attack by TRUTHS! Oh, the horror! Lol!

       Anyway, rest assured, the pro Macron side is pushing their false narrative all over the net and mainstream media outside France.

       NO.  Look them up yourself (links are everywhere) and interpret them independently instead of having some 14 year old autist make up stories for you to then repost as facts when it's made up bullshit.  We did this before and apparently fail to learn lessons.

       It is not bullshit.
Yes I am aware of the rule, that is no doubt part of the reason the leaks were dropped an hour before the limit. 
The release was more about reminding people of what they aren't allowed to know about the candidate they are considering because they aren't completely free.
      </p>
      <p>
       That does NOT change the absolute fact that the government has threatened criminal charges for posting them and media consensus not to discuss the leaks. It shouldn't be a rule, but they still had time to discuss the leaks in a short window, and they can still cover it in certain ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine that the sole purpose of the leak was to make people going to the polls realize "hey it's kind of fucked up we are about to vote for a guy who has just had leaks dropped that may verify a long standing scandal regarding him, and we have to vote blind - maybe we should vote against this form of France."
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be no media blackout allowed.
France isn't a free country.
