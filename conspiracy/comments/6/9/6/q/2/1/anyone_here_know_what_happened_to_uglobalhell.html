<p>Why do you scrub your history? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do it because reddit is used by some very strange people who will read through years worth of comments to find something they can use against you.</p>

<p>I had another account that was 4 years old, had over 30,000 comments and someone read back through them, found 3 pieces of personal information and was able to then find my address. Luckily it was an address that I had already moved away from.</p>

<p>Ever since then I am very careful about what I share online and use a plugin to edit and delete my comments once per week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>33 days ago he made a post saying he tipped  off the Trump administration about the surveillance at Trump tower. He also talked about his parents being involved in cyber crime and cyber security. I told him his post was weird and came across like baseless bragging, which is not how real hackers are supposed to operate. He sent me extremely long messages. One as a comment and one private message. I don&#39;t have anything against the guy, I was just always skeptical of what he said, as everyone should be and especially around here. His last message to me it seemed like he knew who I was as he mentioned some things most people don&#39;t pick up on, but I dunno. I think he might have been an agent or limited hangout or somethig. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll continue later if I get the time. These are interesting enough. Does anyone know some of his last predictions? I remember him talking about a supervolcano some time ago. We might determine why he was silenced (I don&#39;t believe he&#39;d disappear without a word or trace). In any case, we should start looking for everything we can find about the guy, his work <em>must</em> go on.</p>
