       Thats been my question since day 1.  If my son went missing, my immediate reaction would be to have a quick look around the surrounding area/apartments before deciding that 'They' took him.

       You'd think after 10 years a proper police investigation would have happened? One where they dont remove the one person that actually had an opposing theory to their own, at the behest of a foreign police force? Dont be silly.

       You can make shit up all you like, Im giving my considered opinion based on circumstantial evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you can show me another missing child case that Clarence Mitchell dropped everything for, i think im justified in claiming his dash as circumstantial to the McCanns being somehow connected to the government. Whether that is through business, friendship or other reasons, i have no idea.

       Kate has been the one keeping the investigation alive for all these years. Think about it, if you
       <strong>
        knew
       </strong>
       what happened to your kidnapped child but couldn't get the truth out because of some
       <strong>
        reason
       </strong>
       (Maybe the fact that they will kill your child if you do), wouldn't you want people to keep investigating it to get to the bottom of it?

       I have also discovered its unlikely John Podesta was in Portugal at the time of the abduction of Madeleine McCann.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here he is in DC on May 2nd 2097.

      <p>
       These pics include the EXIF data that shows John Podesta standing outside watching a protest at 1:45PM in DC.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was hosting an event for his org, Center for American Progress called "Colombia &amp; the United States at a Crossroads: A Conversation with President Alvaro Uribe" in Washington, DC.

       The closest airport to Praia da Luz is Faro Airport:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about a 12 hour 20 min flight with one stop (the best I could find):

       </a>
       (sort by shortest duration)
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, it's at least an hour drive to the location where she was kidnapped:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you need to account for the 5 hour time difference.
      </p>

       So... if he literally left from the event &amp; immediately jumped on a plane, he wouldn't arrive in Portugal until at least 7AM on 3rd of May. That includes no time to get to the airport, no time to get on the plane, no time for possible flight issues (delays, etc), and it also assumes a flight was available at that exact moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you need to tack on at least an hour to get to the resort in Praia da Luz. So now we're pushing 8AM. If we're being realistic about the travel times, it's probably more like 3pm.

       And after all that, 7 hours later, he kidnaps a little girl with his brother dressed as a 20-40 year old.

       Is there any conspiracy you actually believe?  A quick glance at your previous comments show you denying any wrongdoing across several different subjects/conspiracies.

       I think this one theory is really quite stupid. Why would political bigshots like the Podesta brothers do the dirty work of kidnapping children? Do they like the thrill or something? I don't have any doubt they are involved in child-human trafficking, but the stuff with Madeleine is really stretching it.

       Yeah, I'm pretty sure that he has better things to do than going to Portugal to kidnap children. I doubt he'd even have the guts to if he desired to do just that. There's a lot of room for skepticism here. I think Clement Freud—and here you have the generational sex demons, too—might have a far more direct link to Madeleine's kidnapping.

       It's only a dark mindset if Comet Pizza is something other than Podesta's preferred pizza joint - otherwise this is all just a really bad joke to him, one he is looking for a way to dismiss. You can't easily get rid of a fake news propaganda campaign - a real scandal has consequences - like impeachment or jail- or else you can do away with it somehow; an apology or some other show of contrition, etc., but a fake scandal fueled by misinformation? You ignore it and it grows worse, you deny it and you look guilty. So what do you do? Simply proving pieces of it to be impossible isn't enough, of course, when there are so many made-up little puzzle pieces and more can be created at any time. Besides, people who want to believe something terrible about you aren't going to believe your proof or else they'll believe it only proves that one little piece of
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       wrong.

       No, just about the only thing you can do is laugh it off. Joke about it. Make a mockery of the very idea. Well, that's step one, anyway.

       There is a changeling ritual that they seem to practice. It involves kid napping a child and changing their soul for a demon. This is only a theory but it is part of the luciferians. Also Comet ping pong had some photos and strange videos about it.

       Who else is going to do it. Also, this seems to be less of a kidnapping and more of a picking up of pre discussed goods.

       So unless Podesta is a mid level manager, he won't actually have a contact number or regularly run into any grunts. Podesta wasn't head advisor to two presidents because he also ran the grunt work for child trafficking. The upper heads know political connections. Like heads of state fed and state. Heads of law enforcement. Etc.

       To add to this, people are making the connection based on two police sketches that look sort of like the Podesta brothers. Thing is, those sketches were of the same person. Sketches are often inaccurate, possibly explaining the differences between the two.

       well the podestas don't seem to have been members of this tapas 9, so i wouldn't say this article is confirming that theory at all, seems to point at the parents instead.

       Think about how you refer to a group of people as "they" in conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reckon you only do that when the person you are talking to is going to understand from the context of your discussion who "they" are, because if they don't know, they will ask "who's they?"
      </p>

       I don't know about that. If your child is not known to wander, or if your child is the type that clings close to your side, I think many parents might quickly assume their child was taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not to say what words she used in this circumstance are not very suspect. Something weird is likely here. But it's good to consider all possibilities, including that some kids are we will say "homebodies" and their parents certainly would assume someone took them if they could not find them.

       It's a plausible explanation for why she said "they" which is what the entire thread is discussing? What's weird about it, I'm not being facetious. I really don't see why that's a weird or implausible response.

      <p>
       Respectfully, I disagree - even in times of great distress, people inherently know which pronoun to use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: as a completely innocent parent, if my child was missing and I called 911, the conversation should sound like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       911 operator: what's your emergency?
Me: my daughter, she's gone, I can't find her anywhere. I checked her room and the back yard and she's not there and I can't find her!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying "my" daughter because the important part is that a child is missing; what's not important is that my husband and I both think she's missing, so I don't need to say "our daughter is missing."
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't need to say "we" looked for her, although I could say that to indicate multiple people have searched. "I" checked her room - again, I'm trying to give info to the people who can help - the missing child is not in her room. I don't need to list, in order, the people who also checked her room after I did, as that's not helpful information. It would be weird to say "we" checked her room - did my husband and I run into the room at the same moment, arm in arm? How did we fit through the door together? No, the more logical scenario is that I checked in one place and he checked in another place, and then I called 911 because my daughter wasn't in either of those places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, I wouldn't say "we didn't think she'd run away." My husband and I rarely think together. We discuss things, we may agree or disagree, but we don't sit down and intuit each other's thought process. So it's strange to say "we thought this."
      </p>
      <p>
       And the last bit, "I can't find her anywhere," is me expressing the urgency of the situation. Is it helpful to say "we" can't find her? Not really. What I need is the police to come look for her, right now. What the police need is for me to give them the basic information: she's 4, she's missing, she's my daughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I haven't said "he took her" or "they took her" or anything like that. For all I know, my kid could be hiding in my closet or asking for a cookie from the really nice retired lady next door, or she decided to walk to the babysitters house by herself, or she saw a loose dog and she followed it, or any one of a million scenarios. I don't know she's been taken, and that hasn't even crossed my mind. "Where is she" should be the ONLY question at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare this to a guilty parent reporting a child missing - they might make statements like:
      </p>
      <p>
       We got up this morning and she was gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       We who? What time did "we" get up? Who is gone? An adult? Did she leave of her own accord? A toddler? Is she hiding? This statement doesn't convey any specific information. Why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       We would never hurt her.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a weird future-tense statement. 'I did not harm her' or 'I never hit her' is a solid denial. And a person can only be 100% sure about their own actions. I cannot definitively say "my spouse never harmed her." I can say I never saw it, or I didn't think he's capable of it, but I can't use the same degree of certainty that I used in my own denial. Innocent people do not think this way and they do not speak this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       We ran back to the apartment and we just knew she'd been taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual statement from the McCanns. How did they know? Did they know at the exact same moment? Did they discuss it? If so, why not say 'Kate screamed that Maddie had been taken?' A scream is an actual event. "We thought" cannot be tied to a specific date and time, and sounds like poor story-telling.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's more of this double-thinking. Kate has said "we thought it was a very relaxing holiday" and "we paused to think about how beautiful she (Madeleine) was and how lucky we were." Do these people not speak to one another? Do they just read each other's thoughts? And what are the staggering odds against two people, even married people, thinking the same TWO thoughts at exactly the same time? Where are the statements like "Gerry said Maddy was so beautiful and I replied that we were so lucky to have all 3 kids." Two individuals having different thoughts, and sharing those thoughts, is wayyyyyy more normal than all the "we thought" statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry this got long - there are so many shenanigans in this case, it's not even funny.

       Age progression artists add moles to people's foreheads where there were none before? I know they might guess at the expansion of a mole which was already present in the "young" version of that person, but, adding one where there was none before?

       Completely anecdotal but yes. I've had moles appear as have my girlfriend. It would depend on how much time you've spent in the sun and your genetics. Caucasians tend to freckle or develop moles more often as they age or over expose themselves to the sun.

       My point is, an age progression artist is not going to add moles to someone's face that were not already there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tony podesta does actually have a mole over his eyebrow. It is on the opposite side of his face than the suspect image, but it is there.

       Since its an age progression shouldn't the artist assume that it could be there for the same of authenticity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way my original point is that there aren't two suspects. It's not the podesta brothers. It was an age progression. People already busted this theory and now they're trying to slip it under the door again.

       No. Moles on the face and the location of them are important in identification. The artist isn't just going to throw them in randomly. That's preposterous.

       You are trying very very hard to twist the evidence to conform with your already-held belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think an errant mole is really more preposterous than the police releasing sketches of two different suspects while at the same time saying they are the same person? (the police have always said it was the same suspect, from the very start. What on earth would be the point of this?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Police sketches are very imprecise, it makes perfect sense to fuzz the details some to better cover the overlap generated between your sketch and the person you're looking for.

       What?! "Fuzzing the details" is not something done with age progression.  Adding
       <strong>
        non-existent
       </strong>
       detail, such as a mole that was
       <strong>
        never present in the original description
       </strong>
       , would not ever be done in an age progression. That would be equivalent to the artist saying, " I'm guessing this guy might get a tattoo on his neck," and actually adding a non-existent tattoo to the sketch just because that's what he is imagining. 
Absolute foolishness.

       It is interesting that Goncalo Amaral thinks there was a cover up executed by MI5. He is the police officer who led the initial hunt when three-year-old Maddie went missing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The now retired detective was removed as head of the investigation after criticising British detectives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Madeleine McCann’s parents lost their third court appeal to silence ex-policeman Goncalo Amaral, who claims “they covered up their daughter’s death and MI5 helped hide her body”.

       The courts apparently think there's more merit to his claims than not.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Amaral was ordered to pay Kate and Gerry £430,000 plus interest in damages after losing round one.
       </p>
       <p>
        But this decision was reversed by appeal judges in April last year, siding with the former police chief and overturning a ban on his book.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then a fresh appeal by the McCanns was rejected by the Supreme Court, the country's highest court.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the third time a Portuguese court has upheld Amaral’s right to freedom of expression.

       Both parents show deception in their NUMEROUS and conflicting statements. Sometimes, though, guilty people will hint at exactly what
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       happen, and I believe that's what Gerry was doing when he said "show me the body - if there's no body, you can't say we were involved." That's an odd denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Random person: Hey BobbleHeadDwight, did you kill your kid?
BHD: No! God no.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reporter: Gerry, did you kill Maddy?
Gerry: That's ridiculous. Why would I do it? And how? And where's her body? Without a body, you can't prove anything. People are saying that she died in the apartment, we covered it up and then took her in the hired car 3 weeks later
       <em>
        and hid her body very cleverly, where nobody will find it
       </em>
       . It's ridiculous. (This is paraphrased.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Suuuuper long explanation that 1) doesn't outright deny it, 2) introduces a ton of info that wasn't included in the question, and 3) may very well be a guilty conscious leaking information without realizing it. How hard is the word "no?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, also, his answer essentially lines up with forensic evidence like blood and cadaver scent in the apartment, still-unexplained conflicting statements from the Tapas 7, cadaver scent in the rental car, and oddities surrounding the photos that the McCanns gave to police (essentially creating doubt about the last time she was seen alive). At a minimum, this is what his answer confirms.

       ugh - I am sure something shady happened, and that something is going on - but this article reads like crap.

      <p>
       2 british people on holiday 10 years ago, just now come forward that they remember these specific words on a night that they heard from two stories up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The driver looked british, said by lady 100 yards at night, but it was a common looking car.

       It just reads like a bunch of BS to stir a pot, not important details or trustworthy ones.

       I agree it smells fishy. Why didn't they come forward at the time? Possibly cashing in in the renewed interest in the case, knowing that the
       <em>
        real

       public opinion in the McCanns is

       exactly! It just reads too clean. You are saying when the cops showed up 10 years ago, you sat two stories up watching these distraught parents go thru hell, and then decided with your partner...nah...lets not go talk or say we saw anything, we are on vacation.

       Madeline was killed in the apartment, stuffed into the kids closet, and then later transported in the car. If John and Tony had anything to do with it. It's likely they took things to far and killed her in the living room. There is a documentary on YouTube from the lead investigator. She died in the apartment between parents checking in on her and the twins while having dinner.

       I hardly think it's a theory. There is way too much evidence and facts to be a theory anymore. This is more of a case. And I would be willing to bet the NSA has all the proof one would need to put all of them away for life or hung. Not just the Podesta's but all of them and us too.

       The data is is easy for them to obtain they could send speeding tickets to your SMS in real time as you break the limit and then give you another ticket if you look at it while the keys are still in the ignition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA has all the data to make the world right again OR let it fall apart. They should be treated by humanity according to how they wield that power.

       You'd think after 10 years a proper police investigation would have happened? One where they dont remove the one person that actually had an opposing theory to their own, at the behest of a foreign police force? Dont be silly.
