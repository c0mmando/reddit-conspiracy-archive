    <div class="md"><p>You can make shit up all you like, Im giving my considered opinion based on circumstantial evidence. </p>

<p>Unless you can show me another missing child case that Clarence Mitchell dropped everything for, i think im justified in claiming his dash as circumstantial to the McCanns being somehow connected to the government. Whether that is through business, friendship or other reasons, i have no idea.</p>

<p>...And given the infinite universe, the possibility of alien life NOT existing is minuscule... and if you&#39;ve a problem with that, take it up with Hawking. </p>

<p>&quot;There is no doubt that there is life out there; the mathematics of it lead you to that absolute conclusion. In my mind, there is no doubt that the universe teems - with life in all its form&quot;</p>

<p>I have also discovered its unlikely John Podesta was in Portugal at the time of the abduction of Madeleine McCann. </p>

<p>Here he is in DC on May 2nd 2097.</p>

<p>These pics include the EXIF data that shows John Podesta standing outside watching a protest at 1:45PM in DC. </p>

<p>He was hosting an event for his org, Center for American Progress called &quot;Colombia &amp; the United States at a Crossroads: A Conversation with President Alvaro Uribe&quot; in Washington, DC. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/events/2007/05/02/16512/colombia-the-united-states-at-a-crossroads-a-conversation-with-president-alvaro-uribe/">https://www.americanprogress.org/events/2007/05/02/16512/colombia-the-united-states-at-a-crossroads-a-conversation-with-president-alvaro-uribe/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>The closest airport to Praia da Luz is Faro Airport: <a href="http://www.algarve-tourist.com/praia-da-luz/praia-da-luz-to-faro-airport-transfer-bus-train.html">http://www.algarve-tourist.com/praia-da-luz/praia-da-luz-to-faro-airport-transfer-bus-train.html</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s about a 12 hour 20 min flight with one stop (the best I could find): <a href="https://www.kayak.com/flights/WAS-FAO,nearby/2017-04-28">https://www.kayak.com/flights/WAS-FAO,nearby/2017-04-28</a> (sort by shortest duration)</p>

<p>Then, it&#39;s at least an hour drive to the location where she was kidnapped: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Faro+Airport+(FAO),+8001-701+Faro,+Portugal/R.+Dr.+Agostinho+da+Silva+5,+Luz,+Portugal/@37.1002206,-8.6214851,10z/am=t/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0xd0552b04da7999b:0x2144551e63673b47!2m2!1d-7.96972!2d37.0175956!1m5!1m1!1s0xd1b313c0e04f0b1:0x78895c0278e3f7a!2m2!1d-8.7309393!2d37.0886347?hl=en">https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Faro+Airport+(FAO),+8001-701+Faro,+Portugal/R.+Dr.+Agostinho+da+Silva+5,+Luz,+Portugal/@37.1002206,-8.6214851,10z/am=t/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0xd0552b04da7999b:0x2144551e63673b47!2m2!1d-7.96972!2d37.0175956!1m5!1m1!1s0xd1b313c0e04f0b1:0x78895c0278e3f7a!2m2!1d-8.7309393!2d37.0886347?hl=en</a></p>

<p>Also, you need to account for the 5 hour time difference.</p>

<p>So... if he literally left from the event &amp; immediately jumped on a plane, he wouldn&#39;t arrive in Portugal until at least 7AM on 3rd of May. That includes no time to get to the airport, no time to get on the plane, no time for possible flight issues (delays, etc), and it also assumes a flight was available at that exact moment. </p>

<p>Then you need to tack on at least an hour to get to the resort in Praia da Luz. So now we&#39;re pushing 8AM. If we&#39;re being realistic about the travel times, it&#39;s probably more like 3pm. </p>

<p>And after all that, 7 hours later, he kidnaps a little girl with his brother dressed as a 20-40 year old. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only a dark mindset if Comet Pizza is something other than Podesta&#39;s preferred pizza joint - otherwise this is all just a really bad joke to him, one he is looking for a way to dismiss. You can&#39;t easily get rid of a fake news propaganda campaign - a real scandal has consequences - like impeachment or jail- or else you can do away with it somehow; an apology or some other show of contrition, etc., but a fake scandal fueled by misinformation? You ignore it and it grows worse, you deny it and you look guilty. So what do you do? Simply proving pieces of it to be impossible isn&#39;t enough, of course, when there are so many made-up little puzzle pieces and more can be created at any time. Besides, people who want to believe something terrible about you aren&#39;t going to believe your proof or else they&#39;ll believe it only proves that one little piece of <em>evidence</em> wrong.</p>

<p>No, just about the only thing you can do is laugh it off. Joke about it. Make a mockery of the very idea. Well, that&#39;s step one, anyway.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not to say what words she used in this circumstance are not very suspect. Something weird is likely here.

    <div class="md"><p>Respectfully, I disagree - even in times of great distress, people inherently know which pronoun to use. </p>

<p>Example: as a completely innocent parent, if my child was missing and I called 911, the conversation should sound like this:</p>

<p>911 operator: what&#39;s your emergency?
Me: my daughter, she&#39;s gone, I can&#39;t find her anywhere. I checked her room and the back yard and she&#39;s not there and I can&#39;t find her! </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying &quot;my&quot; daughter because the important part is that a child is missing; what&#39;s not important is that my husband and I both think she&#39;s missing, so I don&#39;t need to say &quot;our daughter is missing.&quot; </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t need to say &quot;we&quot; looked for her, although I could say that to indicate multiple people have searched. &quot;I&quot; checked her room - again, I&#39;m trying to give info to the people who can help - the missing child is not in her room. I don&#39;t need to list, in order, the people who also checked her room after I did, as that&#39;s not helpful information. It would be weird to say &quot;we&quot; checked her room - did my husband and I run into the room at the same moment, arm in arm? How did we fit through the door together? No, the more logical scenario is that I checked in one place and he checked in another place, and then I called 911 because my daughter wasn&#39;t in either of those places. </p>

<p>Similarly, I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;we didn&#39;t think she&#39;d run away.&quot; My husband and I rarely think together. We discuss things, we may agree or disagree, but we don&#39;t sit down and intuit each other&#39;s thought process. So it&#39;s strange to say &quot;we thought this.&quot; </p>

<p>And the last bit, &quot;I can&#39;t find her anywhere,&quot; is me expressing the urgency of the situation. Is it helpful to say &quot;we&quot; can&#39;t find her? Not really. What I need is the police to come look for her, right now. What the police need is for me to give them the basic information: she&#39;s 4, she&#39;s missing, she&#39;s my daughter. </p>

<p>Also, I haven&#39;t said &quot;he took her&quot; or &quot;they took her&quot; or anything like that. For all I know, my kid could be hiding in my closet or asking for a cookie from the really nice retired lady next door, or she decided to walk to the babysitters house by herself, or she saw a loose dog and she followed it, or any one of a million scenarios. I don&#39;t know she&#39;s been taken, and that hasn&#39;t even crossed my mind. &quot;Where is she&quot; should be the ONLY question at this point.</p>

<p>Compare this to a guilty parent reporting a child missing - they might make statements like:</p>

<p>We got up this morning and she was gone. </p>

<p>We who? What time did &quot;we&quot; get up? Who is gone? An adult? Did she leave of her own accord? A toddler? Is she hiding? This statement doesn&#39;t convey any specific information. Why not?</p>

<p>We would never hurt her. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a weird future-tense statement. &#39;I did not harm her&#39; or &#39;I never hit her&#39; is a solid denial. And a person can only be 100% sure about their own actions. I cannot definitively say &quot;my spouse never harmed her.&quot; I can say I never saw it, or I didn&#39;t think he&#39;s capable of it, but I can&#39;t use the same degree of certainty that I used in my own denial. Innocent people do not think this way and they do not speak this way.</p>

<p>We ran back to the apartment and we just knew she&#39;d been taken. </p>

<p>Actual statement from the McCanns. How did they know? Did they know at the exact same moment? Did they discuss it? If so, why not say &#39;Kate screamed that Maddie had been taken?&#39; A scream is an actual event. &quot;We thought&quot; cannot be tied to a specific date and time, and sounds like poor story-telling.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s more of this double-thinking. Kate has said &quot;we thought it was a very relaxing holiday&quot; and &quot;we paused to think about how beautiful she (Madeleine) was and how lucky we were.&quot; Do these people not speak to one another? Do they just read each other&#39;s thoughts? And what are the staggering odds against two people, even married people, thinking the same TWO thoughts at exactly the same time? Where are the statements like &quot;Gerry said Maddy was so beautiful and I replied that we were so lucky to have all 3 kids.&quot; Two individuals having different thoughts, and sharing those thoughts, is wayyyyyy more normal than all the &quot;we thought&quot; statements. </p>

<p>Sorry this got long - there are so many shenanigans in this case, it&#39;s not even funny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not talking about moles appearing on live people, ffs.</p>

<p>My point is, an age progression artist is not going to add moles to someone&#39;s face that were not already there. </p>

<p>Tony podesta does actually have a mole over his eyebrow. It is on the opposite side of his face than the suspect image, but it is there.</p>

<p>Either way my original point is that there aren&#39;t two suspects. It&#39;s not the podesta brothers. It was an age progression. People already busted this theory and now they&#39;re trying to slip it under the door again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Moles on the face and the location of them are important in identification. The artist isn&#39;t just going to throw them in randomly. That&#39;s preposterous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are trying very very hard to twist the evidence to conform with your already-held belief. </p>

<p>You think an errant mole is really more preposterous than the police releasing sketches of two different suspects while at the same time saying they are the same person? (the police have always said it was the same suspect, from the very start. What on earth would be the point of this?)</p>

<p>Police sketches are very imprecise, it makes perfect sense to fuzz the details some to better cover the overlap generated between your sketch and the person you&#39;re looking for. </p>

<p>What?! &quot;Fuzzing the details&quot; is not something done with age progression.  Adding <strong>non-existent</strong> detail, such as a mole that was <strong>never present in the original description</strong>, would not ever be done in an age progression. That would be equivalent to the artist saying, &quot; I&#39;m guessing this guy might get a tattoo on his neck,&quot; and actually adding a non-existent tattoo to the sketch just because that&#39;s what he is imagining. 
Absolute foolishness.</p>

<p>It is you that is &quot;trying very very hard to twist the evidence to conform with your already-held belief&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the police have always said it was the same suspect, from the very start. What on earth would be the point of this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The e-fits, supposedly of the same man, were released by British authorities. The narrative that this is one man, not two, came from who? British authorities. </p>

<p>It is interesting that Goncalo Amaral thinks there was a cover up executed by MI5. He is the police officer who led the initial hunt when three-year-old Maddie went missing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The now retired detective was removed as head of the investigation after criticising British detectives.</p>

<p>Madeleine McCann’s parents lost their third court appeal to silence ex-policeman Goncalo Amaral, who claims “they covered up their daughter’s death and MI5 helped hide her body”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2751442/goncalo-amaral-madeleine-mccann-cop-mi5/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2751442/goncalo-amaral-madeleine-mccann-cop-mi5/</a></p>

<p>The courts apparently think there&#39;s more merit to his claims than not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amaral was ordered to pay Kate and Gerry £430,000 plus interest in damages after losing round one.</p>

<p>But this decision was reversed by appeal judges in April last year, siding with the former police chief and overturning a ban on his book.</p>

<p>Then a fresh appeal by the McCanns was rejected by the Supreme Court, the country&#39;s highest court.</p>

<p>It is the third time a Portuguese court has upheld Amaral’s right to freedom of expression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both parents show deception in their NUMEROUS and conflicting statements. Sometimes, though, guilty people will hint at exactly what <em>did</em> happen, and I believe that&#39;s what Gerry was doing when he said &quot;show me the body - if there&#39;s no body, you can&#39;t say we were involved.&quot; That&#39;s an odd denial. </p>

<p>Random person: Hey BobbleHeadDwight, did you kill your kid?
BHD: No! God no. </p>

<p>Reporter: Gerry, did you kill Maddy?
Gerry: That&#39;s ridiculous. Why would I do it? And how? And where&#39;s her body? Without a body, you can&#39;t prove anything. People are saying that she died in the apartment, we covered it up and then took her in the hired car 3 weeks later <em>and hid her body very cleverly, where nobody will find it</em>. It&#39;s ridiculous. (This is paraphrased.)</p>

<p>Suuuuper long explanation that 1) doesn&#39;t outright deny it, 2) introduces a ton of info that wasn&#39;t included in the question, and 3) may very well be a guilty conscious leaking information without realizing it. How hard is the word &quot;no?&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, also, his answer essentially lines up with forensic evidence like blood and cadaver scent in the apartment, still-unexplained conflicting statements from the Tapas 7, cadaver scent in the rental car, and oddities surrounding the photos that the McCanns gave to police (essentially creating doubt about the last time she was seen alive). At a minimum, this is what his answer confirms.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t even get me started on Kate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally, I found a 2007 article from the same website, and it brings up those exact words. </p>

<p>Its just weird that we have confirmed from Kate - and this article is about two people 2 stories up recalling from 10 years ago- &quot;the F----ing B----s took her -</p>

<p>it just feels very false, like when someone lies and they have too many details and it starts to sound like they are describing a set more than an event.</p>

<p>but thats just me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Daily Mail ran a story recently with an account from one of the staff at the resort who &quot;didn&#39;t want to be named&quot; but who made it clear that they thought the McCanns had nothing to do with their daughter&#39;s disappearance. Oh well, that&#39;s OK then, un-named source - I&#39;m sure you&#39;re decent and honest and totally not made up at all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d think after 10 years a proper police investigation would have happened? One where they dont remove the one person that actually had an opposing theory to their own, at the behest of a foreign police force? Dont be silly. </p>

<p>Mere mortals dont get the weight of Downing street&#39;s PR team behind them, less than a day after their child goes missing. </p>

<p>Somebody in that family is connected and im guessing its not Kate.</p>
