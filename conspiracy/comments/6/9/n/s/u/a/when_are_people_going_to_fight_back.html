        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The government is ran by crooks, sell outs, truly evil people, and pedophiles. We spend trillions on war instead of education. Wanting universal healthcare is suddenly socialist, and being called a Russian or liberal or conservative or any other term is suddenly worse than being called a racist. And on the topic of race, that still hasn&#39;t died out. Everything is built to divide us, and people play into that. People who tell the truth or question are killed. Actually want to fix something? Too bad, you don&#39;t have the money to do it. Everything is broken, the roads, the criminal justice system, the education system. The CIA has committed so many terrible crimes, MK Ultra is just scratching the surface. So, why are we all here on           r/conspiracy talking conspiracy when we know for a fact, right not the government is fucking us over. Edit: I like this post lol. </p>

<p>1) Are you circumcised? (Did they cut off too much? They left me with an 8 inch scare on my putz)</p>

Now all you have to do is go before this examination board of Black Hebrews, and let them ask you the same questions that they are asking this young Jewish man who wants to move to Israel.

    <div class="md"><p>These black dudes scare the shit out of the Jews. Where is the Jewish Defense League? They like beating the shit out of skinny Gentile boys, but why isn&#39;t the JDL standing up to these Black Hebrews? Nobody, except these black guys, would get away with talking shit about the holocaust, and screaming the obscenities that they scream at the white Jews. I am beginning to think that Jews with money are actually financially backing these Hebrew &quot;Ghetto Blasters&quot;.</p>

<p>If not, these Black Hebrews are some bad &quot;mofos&quot;. They could be the start of the &quot;revolution&quot; you are looking for. Do you have any African blood in your veins?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting about Lamar. I just read his bio. This makes sense. White people didn&#39;t enter the Mediterranean area until about 500 A.D. when the Germanic tribes (the Vandals; the Goths) invaded Southern Europe. Before that, the only people in the Mediterranean area were dark skinned. That is why us Jews who are light skinned cannot claim to be full blooded Jews. I am light skinned, and my grandmother had blue eyes and auburn hair. I have a Jewish uncle who has blond hair and blue eyes. So, for bigots like Wasserman-Schultz to worry about &quot;Jewish blood&quot; being mixed with Gentiles&#39; blood in mixed marriages is nothing but hate spewing from her mouth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1000% agree. I&#39;m not saying racism doesn&#39;t exist. I&#39;m not saying people don&#39;t deal with it. My mom is whiter than white and my dad is Hispanic native American. I think we as people have evolved enough to say yeah racism exists still but we&#39;re not focused on that. We&#39;re focused on ALL of us. So, people start waking up and the world freaks out and suddenly the LGBT community is the hottest subject. Raising similar crap to once again keep division.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol exactly. You can&#39;t fight by yourself. It always starts with spreading the word which I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all done at some point about whatever topic, then it&#39;s kind of like ok.. so...anybody? Then it just gets put on the sidelines. I don&#39;t have Snapchat. But Ive followed this subreddit for a year and this is the FIRST time I&#39;ve responded to something and that&#39;s because I&#39;m tired of it all and the OP just spoke to me. I&#39;ll fight with you. 2 humans are more than zero. Maybe we can make the fake news! </p>

But we&#39;ve watched the system slowly destroy real learning and my kid will be the first one to tell you how and why. People forget education is at a state level and in OUR hands. Education is supposed to be completely be out of federal hands. We bitch and complain, but what&#39;s really being done? If every parent said sorry my student will not take that test, what would happen? Who would REALLY lose in the end? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree with you there. The medicinal industry needs to be destroyed and rebuilt in a medical system that is homeopathic. Banking industry needs change and the Federal reserve has to go. Government needs to be a lot smaller and locally based.  What we promote as a society needs to change as well. Mainstream culture is toxic. To bad too many people today are ignorant as to what is going on around and are only looking to be easily entertained. Serious change is needed some or things are going to spiral out of control imo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more than that. They push girls to hard to be independent and encourage them to be super women and raise families and work 40 hour work weeks all while cooking, cleaning, etc which is just not possible. They also hypersexualize the the culture with mainstream women&#39;s fashion pushing out these slutty outfits and pushing narratives like, go to college and fuck as many dudes as you want. An interesting quote from a book I&#39;m reading where J.Edgar Hoover urged women to leave the work, Mary early, and have children as a way of fighting &quot;the twin enemies of freedom - crime and Communism&quot; which makes sense Communism attacks the families at their core since they are the individual building blocks of society. </p>

<p>Men have been demasculinized by the culture as well through bullshit like sports and drinking,  TV&#39;s and movies, and a lot of things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely true. I was raised kind of old school but am a very independent mother to a 13, 4, and 9 Mo old. Many many years ago I read an article similar to what Hoover said about America&#39;s attack on the family and ever since I wholeheartedly believe that. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I am not in favor of the NEW feminist movement. There&#39;s a reason why men these days are so different from their older generations. The family dynamic is so important and vital for the  human existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The battle between us and those in power will not be won through violence. We have all the tools we need to bring criminals to justice. What we need is reliable, fact providing journalism able to share information with the general public. </p>

<p>When the government puts regulations on journalists it has a ripple effect that causes the silence of voices we need to hear. When we allow media organizations to combine under the rule of a handful of people the information is controlled. When the news lies to us we will not look to them for the truth in the future.</p>

<p>If we wanted to win a major battle for humanity it would be the creation of an investigative journalism team which provided the facts we need to be informed voters. With our connection through technology it is incredible we can be so divided on the truth how easy it is to manipulate groups of people. There needs to be something we can trust to provide us facts relevant for us to be informed.</p>

<p>I acknowledge more than a few users here feel there is no power in voting, but then why are politics pushed so hard here? There are political agents and corporate entities operating on every sub throughout Reddit. That is because it is worth targeting, and we do have power.</p>

Sorta like they are detectives, they have a badge but don&#39;t take orders from the state.

I have some plans but I wouldn&#39;t be willing to discuss them here. Be patient and train your body and mind, grow a garden and try to exist without corporations. To me this is the best way to fight back without spilling blood. </p>
