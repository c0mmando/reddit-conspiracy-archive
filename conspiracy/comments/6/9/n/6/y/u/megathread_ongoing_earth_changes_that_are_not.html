       Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
       "Blessed are the meek:
for they shall inherit the earth.."
      </p>
      <p>
       Matthew 5:5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who mock the use of a quote from one of the most read pieces of discourse in history, regardless of how you view it, is not thinking clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that 2012 was the "harbinger," year.. when the countdown begins. We laugh at the doomsday thing now.. because it never happened!..
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at the stock markets at the moment, Friday was a day of lunacy. I believe we are going to pop soon and the bubble will be more dramatic than the 2008 crash. The geopolitical climate etc, does not constitute the DAX to be breaking records the week prior to the French Election. Le Pen will win... just like Trump and Brexit. The DAX will collapse in the panic, and probably never recover to where it is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have attempted to clean up some of the formatting to help aid in the flow.. I realise it is pretty fucked up and all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who reads this.. i'd like you to make a note to yourself to look at the sky with a critical eye over the space of a week. Look for the strange redness in the clouds, the whiteness of the sun.. the general strangeness that I believe I am not the only one to notice. I will go out on a limb and state I personally believe the sunrise/sunsets i've witnessed with my own eyes are irregular with a more intense red glow than usual. I don't know what this means, I just know that it is different than I am used to. I have always remained perceptive of what's going on in the sky and I just can't shake the feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly not - ..

       - Does anybody know what possible location those attacks that north of Antarctica are coming from? Is there a base down there? Is this a forward outpost of some breakaway civilization that's setup down in Antarctica.. pulling strings. Could be a base I am unwares of but there seems to be fuck all on a map in that location.
      </p>
      <p>
       The map of the UN is..interesting -

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is an equidistant azimuthal projection. Which is a highly accurate map and one that I believe an accurate geometrical map.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of Mercators early maps supposedly copied from older geometric maps is beautiful and extremely accurate.. -

       Watch this if you haven't, rare Richard E Byrd footage discussing Antarctica -
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdkhc1gdPr4">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdkhc1gdPr4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I value interviews with people who have "lived it," and take heed to what, and how they say things. I believe Mr.Byrd is being sincere in his talk of "land beyond the South Pole, larger than North America." This is one of the ultimate truths, what lies beyond the South Pole.. what land is he referencing here? What is "beyond" the South Pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the Mercator Map above, I think it make it makes a compelling case for a hollow or inner earth setup. What do the numbers mean that trail off in a specific sequence? Calling on any math related folk.. I think its sacred geometry. Watch THIS if you have never seen it. Not Antarctica related but geometry related..

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHiad18ZwcY
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This surmises to me.. and i'm sure you too that we know VERY LITTLE publically in regards to sacred geometry, what it means and how interpretations of it could completely alter our "reality." What we believe to be true..
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to Byrd.

       Operation Highjump -

      <p>
       Why did they have Cryptographic Aides?..
      </p>
      <p>
       What's this really mean Mr.Byrd..
      </p>
      <p>
       "The interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, and read in part as follows: ‘Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles"
      </p>
      <p>
       Copy of Newspaper -

        https://www.flickr.com/photos/peter-schmidt-berlin-zehlendorf/25512339496
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The year is 1947. What planes that are hostile.. would be from polar regions? How could they fly over "one, or both poles." So.. how far is pole to pole in our current Earth Model? 12,430 miles. Max range of any WWII-era plane that we know of would barely be over 1,000 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       What cohesive force in 1947 had access to both poles? with hostile planes that sent a massive operation PACKING..
      </p>
      <p>
       We may have a winner..  -

       EARTH HAPPENINGS -
      </p>
      <p>
       I have taken out a vast chunk and I refer you to older threads, or simply going to watchers.news or any other site that documents earth happenings. The pace is quickening folks and I don't know how to put it any other way than by relaying information.
      </p>
      <p>
       First.. read this -
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">
        https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;
      </p>
      <p>
       "But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It was a surprise to us," said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO."
      </p>
      <p>
       Was "Gotham Shield," related to Space Weather? hmm..
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0Dyhp4Tx_w&amp;feature=youtu.be">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0Dyhp4Tx_w&amp;feature=youtu.be
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the United States of America the victim of a coup many moons again that installed a pseudo government in power via Washington? There are 2 United States, one formed in 1787, the collection of the several sovereign states of the union, and another separate and different one formed in 1871, which only controls the District of Columbia and it’s territories.

       People have challenged why this is relevant. If the Economy was to sink due to The Federal Reserve, which is attached to U.S. Inc.. the debt could be eradicated and D.C. could be broken up based on the original U.S.A legislation. Notice Trump tweets #U.S.A. often. Who knows..

       Schumann Resonance -
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the Schumann Resonance? Why is it increasing?

        http://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/consciousness/what-does-the-spike-in-the-schumann-resonance-mean/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "On January 31, 2017, for the first time in recorded history, the Schumann resonance reached frequencies of 36+ Hz. It was considered an anomaly when in 2014 this frequency rose from its usual 7.83 Hz to somewhere in the 15-25 Hz levels—so a jump from 7.83 Hz to 36+ Hz is a big deal. That’s more than a five-fold increase in resonant frequency levels. What does this mean to us as inhabitants of Mother Earth? According to neuroscience, frequency recordings of 36+ Hz in the human brain are more associated with a stressed nervous system than a relaxed and healthy one."

       Information on the "Earth Wobble,".. or pole shift etc. Whatever you want to call it -

      </p>
      <p>
       We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. The Earth Wobbling is natural my only correlation in this is that where the graph gets more extreme is where I feel the world has started to respond at a similar pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this happening? I don't know. So many different things at once, so many theories and facts to digest and dispute.. so much fake information, shit sources!

       Fear is a weapon that is used on the weak, I am showing you a light that I believe isn't shined properly. You can either dissect SOME of the information (is a .PDF copy of the Atlantic Treaty..bs?) and hopefully start waking up.. or just trundle along into the abyss.

       Not atall. We watch them spray the atmosphere, even the old biddies here have been saying about the planes making their throats heart. Surprised me they even said it.  Got any ideas when things might go down? And dates your watching. We got a week of big earthquakes coming up due to the planetary alinements, should be interesting to see coverage

       I have to post under this guy. Especially when the post starts with a bible quote. Then goes on to say red sunsets. Um red-ish sunsets are not new. I couldn't read past that. And I let out a huge sigh as I scrolled down endlessly. There's always doomsday on the horizon. And a stock market crash is inevitable. Old news. Life goes on. I think OP might of missed his meds today.

       u/nibiru_chaser yet again with a fantastic write up. I think your stylized writing may turn people off, but it's dramatic! I love it. As should be. Serious shit, cataclysm. October. I don't know why. I feel like October.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, can definitely report a strange hue at sunset and a completely white sun in WA state. Weather has been fucky here in Seattle too. More fucky than usual.

       Thank you! I'm glad the find the writing interesting and hopefully informative.

       I couldn't put my finger on a date but things will heat up during the summer in my opinion (excuse the pun) and it will become more and more obvious that something isn't quite right..

       We might both be. What with the mysterious disappearance of u/Global_hell predicting earthquakes based on solar activity and the news last night saying the big one is coming to WA soon my conf bias is through the roof. I think something is fucky. Been recording time lapses of the sun too, but my phone cam is kinda shitty so nothing not normal. I'm not seeing 2 distinct spheres but I also live on the complete other hemisphere where people are saying they can see it in the day.

       I find that strange. The material could potentially have been interpreted as needing to be quieted down as our understanding of earthquakes needs to evolve more to account for the sun/space related energy.

      <p>
       I have not seen two anything, just two noticeably different intense colours during sunsets that are obfuscated by artifical and strange looking clouds
