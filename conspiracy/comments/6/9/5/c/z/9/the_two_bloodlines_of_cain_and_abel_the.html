       This is a primer I've compiled for anyone who is interested in looking into The Tri-Sovereign States and the history behind it, along with esoteric/occult history. Take everything with a grain of salt. There are plenty of breadcrumbs here to follow. Hope you all enjoy. Cheers!

       Still my favorite all-time r/conspiracy post by you. People need ti dive into this shit. IMO, you are probably closer to knowing who TPTB

       are than anyone else I've ever seen discuss the topic.

       Hell, I'm pretty red pilled (you know this by know Putes), and until I saw this post quite a few months back, I was under the same belief as most; that Rothschild, Rockefeller, Soros, The Queen etc were the top of the ladder.

       Seriously guys and gals. I say this with no particular bias, but, DIVE INTO THIS INFORMATION. It is absolutely fucking eye opening.

       Thank you, and thanks for the kind words. I by no means have the answers, but have leads. People need to step back and look at the bigger picture (and research actual history).
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is stranger than fiction. So many get caught in that rabbit hole (was once there myself), but never break through. If you know their names  (and their name is household), it's for a reason.

       I just hope maybe one or two people will see this, and think... huh, aint that some shit, then go deeper...

       When we boil it down, it's not the Romans (per se). This shit goes back to Sumeria, imo....

       Yeah pretty much. Sumer and Egypt were just some of the most advanced civilizations at the time since the cataclysmic comet impacts 12,800-11,600 years ago that destroyed the previous advanced global civilizations. They were advanced because they were given knowledge by the previous civilisations who handed their info down to them via monolithic architecture. The reason these ancient advanced civilizations are being hidden from us is because they had access to what was
       <em>
        essentially
       </em>
       free energy. And if we had that nowadays the whole hierarchical system we have in place would crumble. Look up Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson for more info.

       yeaa..but you have to have in mind that there are pyramids at both end of the silk road.. Cairo-&gt;Xian China.. i think the restart of the civilization was formed around the silk road.and that the silk road at that time was longer then we see today (like continues into the Sahara and beyond the Atlantic ocean .)

       Oh yeah absolutely! I only said Sumer and Egypt as they're just a couple of the most well known, but you're right it's global. To name just a few more I could say easter island, machu picchu, xian - as you mentioned, baalbek, and quite likely the grand canyon.

       funny that you would ask:) i think that the eye of Sahara/Richard structure is where Atlantis was once in a time. if we take away the rings ( that is like the most obvious signs of it ) there are a lot of things that points to that there was large rivers/oceans once in a time. that would make the west of sahara (morocco,wester sahara,mauritania and parts of Algeria ) into a isolated island..:P

       Ooh that's quite interesting! I hadn't heard that theory before. I'm still quite new to Atlantis, despite how I've done a fair bit of research into ancient civilizations, and while I do reckon at this point a place called Atlantis existed I've read a few conflicting theories on where it was and how long it existed etc, so I haven't formed any solid beliefs yet. Who would you recommend I look up for researching Atlantis?

       start whit the original sources of Atlantis.. there are like hundreds of different theory's to where Atlantis may be. but they all have the same roots.. and from there work your way up. 
 look into graham Hancock. and specially the pod cast whit Joe Rogan and Randal Carlson.. they speak a lot about pre-flood civilization, the actual flood and so much more.

       And if you actually read and understood the document (unlike OP) it's apparent the author (a Rosicrucian) was attempting to woo practicing Catholics while critiquing the persecution of his and related orders by the Catholic hierarchy (e.g. the Vatican) at the time it was written.

       Excellent post!  Myopia is an unfortunate characteristic of those who have access to so little information and this really puts things into perspective.  So many of us think power structures and control networks are a post 15c. phenomena and ignore the thousands of years prior.  These bloodlines didn't simply disappear!

       Thank you, and yes. People (imo) need to focus on a bigger picture. Ancient bloodlines do exist. They have power and have always ruled from the shadows. They caste no shadows, for there is not light where they are. Why in the hell if you are a ruling elite, would you want anyone to even know your name? This is what people miss, imo...

       Khazars (fake converted Jews) control the Holy Lands (Israel). Orthodox are strongly anti-Zionist. Ask yourself why. I'll give you a hint, Jews cannot have a land until their Messiah comes down. Rome, rules the West, and yes that includes Israel and the "holy lands"...

       I hate to say it, but the amount of disinformation (unintentionally repeated by OP) in this post would be comical if it weren't sad it is still believed and has obtained this many upvotes. Most of the connections OP makes are vague and tenuous at best, a handful of facts with a shitload of misinformation to form a narrative that deflects attention from those who really hold power (over the Zionists and Vatican alike).

       I've heard this argument before, time and time again, often from a pro-Zionist user who falsely accuses anyone who criticizes Israel of "anti-Semitism" and by others who repeat similar disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your post takes, as I pointed out, vague and tenuous bits of information to form a conclusion that the Vatican (yes, the Vatican) is somehow orchestrating world events, when in reality the past few centuries have seen the rise of an agenda (a New World Order) created initially with an emphasis to
       <em>
        remove
       </em>
       power from the once iron grip of the Vatican and monarchs of Europe at the time, via one elite-backed populist revolution at a time, to create a climate from which those groups nd orders had been persecuted as 'heretics' by the Vatican for centuries (the remnants of the Templars, early Rosicrucians and Qabalists) could arise to power while remaining in the shadows largely unknown to the masses. Since at least the early 20th century, the Vatican has been wholly subverted and subjugated by these groups, now largely supportive in promoting their agenda, however doing so as a puppet, not as the puppet master as your theory claims.

       I think you may have missed the point. Zionism and The Vatican (world bank) agenda are the same thing. The Vatican covers its tracks by moving Israel around the world chess board in the same way it does with the United States. Zionism is
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       , but it's just another pawn of The Vatican.

       You'd be surprised how much information can seep through the cracks, on occasion, and yes one should take their testimonies with a grain of salt, to look for inconsistencies or possible ulterior motives, but also for common themes and parallels one can fact-check against existing information. In doing so, the Vatican theory just doesn't hold water, and is one of the least plausible among them, often a form of disinformation used to deflect attention away from those who truly do wield power, and to confuse well-intended theorists with yet another red herring.

       That isn't what I said, nor implied. I'm aware the Vatican has been actively involved in money laundering operations for the elite in its region of the world, as well as other more nefarious deeds. However, after researching this and foremost the origins of how the Vatican was subverted in recent centuries, who truly has power and who is simply following orders, the overwhelming majority of evidence points to those higher up than the Vatican, and that the Vatican theory is more likely a red-herring to in Machiavellian fashion allow the elite to shift blame to one of their former enemies and deflect further investigation or scrutiny pointed in their direction.

       The P2 was one of the more revealing examples of so-called 'rogue' lodges engaging in nefariously subversive activity. I am aware of Lucio Gelli as well, and consider the two to be more on par with lower-level pawns of the elite, the Vatican perhaps serving as an intermediary if anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of subversion by the hands of the elite, in that region in particular, you may be interested to look into the role of the Carbonari, headed in its time by none other than Giuseppe Mazzini, having luminaries in its ranks such as Giuseppe Garibaldi and the Marquis de Lafayette. It's interesting to note the role the Marquis de Lafayette had played in the American revolution prior, and the ties to the less nefarious though perhaps equally subversive activity of his Masonic lodge
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Neuf_S%C5%93urs">
        Les Neuf Sœurs
       </a>
       and its grand lodge the Grand Orient de France having a perhaps equal
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Orient_de_France#French_Revolution">
        role in the French revolution as it did in the American revolution
       </a>
       .
      </p>

       You may also be interested to read about the
       <a href="http://www.freemasonrywatch.org/alta_vendita.html">
        Alta Vendita
       </a>
       and its implications in the ensuing subversion of the Vatican, and worth noting the Vatican had been rendered largely powerless in America and France after their respective revolutions, and that prior to its own subversion it had been aggressively anti-Masonic and diametrically opposed to secret societies, to the extent they and their Inquisition would abduct, torture and even execute individuals alleged to be members of certain orders well into the 19th century.

       It was a relatively obscure text in its usage until its 'rediscovery,' of particular importance to the Essenes and a handful of other sectarian groups of antiquity, with the exception of a partial Greek translation that was known to those in the religious hierarchy though not as widely so as today. It was excluded from popular canon for a variety of reasons, depending on the era and the religious sect. Some believed it was irrelevant, invalid, or contained false doctrine, others because it contained information they considered contested or blasphemous at the time, perhaps some due its narrative being counter to that of the religious establishment.

       For this is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one another.  Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother’s were righteous. Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.  We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death.  Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.  If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?  Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.

       I'm very cautious about what Benjamin Fulford puts out occasionally solid info mixed with the disinfo), and he recently listed the key bloodline families currently ruling which correlates with the ones listed here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fulford:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The following list of crime families are in total control of the company of Jesus (Jesuits), High Grey Council Of Ten, the Black Pope, the White Pope and everything else you often talk about including all kingdoms around the globe. These are the families that make up the intricate brain/head of the serpent. The self-designated Luciferian Demi-Gods who rule over their own G.O.D. (Gold-Oil-Drugs):
       </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        House of Borja
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Breakspeare
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Somaglia
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Orsini (Orso)
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Conti
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Chigi
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Colonna
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Farnese
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Medici
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Gaetani
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Pamphili
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Este
       </li>
       <li>
        House of Aldobrandini
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <em>
        As you noticed the Rothchilds don't make it to the top 13. There are of course other powerful crime families like the Maximus Family, The Pallavicini (Maria Camila Pallavicini is more powerful than Queen Elizabeth) Yes, Queen Elizabeth is a subordinate to this people. The most powerful man in the word is The Grey Pope, his name is Pepe Orsini and he lives somewhere in Italy, most likely Venice &amp; The Vatican. He controls the Black &amp; White Popes who are now both commoners. The Grey Pope always remains unseen!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Did you notice David Rothchild married Princess Olimpia Aldobrandini? Because they are all one huge family who are always changing their last names to keep the conspiracy hidden and to avoid public scrutiny. Many of this people now live in Asia, mainly China, India, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. What does that tell you, Yes, to create the New NWO with Asia at the helm? This is why they slowly moved all the US manufacturing infrastructure to Asia &amp; China.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In short, the Black Pope is the President of this world and the Bourbon King of Spain is the Monarch of the world (Not Queen Elizabeth as most believe) He controls the vatican through the Jesuits -The Spanish Borgias/Borja created the Jesuits- He is also Known as the King Of Jerusalem (What does this tells you about who secretly rules Zionists-Khazarian rough state of Israel?) and the Grey Pope is the "designated" Ruler of it all!

       "It is interesting to note that the world map from the 16th century shows Antarctica, which was officially »discovered« in the 1770s. Around that time the Farnese have decided to use Jesuit Adam Weishaupt to create Illuminati, elevate the Rothschilds to power and move the Farnese seat of power to Washington, DC. They have built their second Pentagon there. It is also interesting to see that Larry Farnese, a member of the family, is a senator:"
