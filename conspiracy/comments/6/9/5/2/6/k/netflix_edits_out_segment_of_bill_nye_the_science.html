        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>SKIP TO THE BOTTOM FOR A SHORTENED VERSION</strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a short synopsis of Bill Nye controversy:</p>

<p>Bill Nye has been a huge subject of controversy recently, over his Netflix Original <em>Bill Nye Saves the World</em> released last month.</p>

<p>Especially controversial is S1E9, &quot;The Sexual Spectrum&quot;, which covers a variety of topics, including advocating for gender fluidity.</p>

<p>Many considered this a contradictory statement and <a href="http://imgur.com/aT779py">this image</a> made the rounds. Snopes <a href="http://www.snopes.com/bill-nye-gender-chromosomes/">reported</a> this image as fake, and they were technically correct. That image came from S5E3 (Episode 28 on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80046974?trackId=13752289&amp;tctx=0%2C27%2C790c7f1f-79e8-4f66-aff2-e0a5a8183c3b-13530919">Netflix</a>), titled &quot;Genes&quot;, where at 9:30 he actually said, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Chromosomes contain all of the genetic information, all of the instructions you need to make a person.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many fired back, showing that in S4E8 (Episode 23 on Netflix), &quot;Probability&quot;, a segment explicitly states</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Inside each of our cells are these things called chromosomes, and they control whether we become a boy, or a girl.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>LOOK HERE FOR THE JUICY STUFF</strong></p>

<p>I have discovered that Netflix has now edited this segment out of the episode. <a href="https://youtu.be/7UkpiuSwzIY?t=7m35s">Here</a> is the original episode, and <a href="https://youtu.be/7UkpiuSwzIY?t=7m35s">here</a> is the episode on Netflix. If you have access to Netflix, you will see at around 9:00 that the segment is skipped with a cheesy &quot;TV Static&quot; effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For 40 bucks with of tools I got the best media center on a Raspberry Pi.  It takes a little bit to setup,  but when you do,  it&#39;s set it and forget it.  The user interface is so much better.  It&#39;s not like setting up a juniper firewall,  but it&#39;s not plug and play either.  There are plenty of step by steps on line. You just need to know what you&#39;re looking for. So,  here. Let me help </p>

<p>Buy a raspberrypi kit from Amazon. Comes with pi,  case,  power,  you might need to get a sd card if that kit doesn&#39;t come with one.  </p>

<p>Google. Osmc. Install osmc on sd card. </p>

<p>Osmc comes preinstalled with Kodi. </p>

<p>Google install exodus add on Kodi </p>

<p>Follow directions.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re now done.  </p>

When I told her she was right planes do create a trail when they are increasing altitude, but some also release chemicals. She couldn&#39;t believe me, so I pulled up articles about scientists using them to prevent globe warming. She just starts denying saying she&#39;s never heard of these sites. They are obviously lying. Thinks she knows it all because her dad works for an private airplane manufacturer too, go figure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Federalist, another right-wing site, pointed out that a 1996 episode of Bill Nye the Science Guy has been apparently retroactively edited to remove a segment where Nye seems to argue that gender is a fixed entity: “Inside each of ourselves are these things called chromosomes, and they control whether we become a boy or a girl,” Nye says in the unearthed clip, which has been cut from the Netflix rerelease of the episode, according to assiduous reporting by The Federalist.</p>

<p>What those outlets roundly fail to mention is that understanding of human sexuality and gender identity continues to evolve. In particular, the transgender rights movement has given voice to Americans who were largely silent—or silenced—when Nye’s episode first aired 21 years ago. Moreover, our understanding of the psychological and physiological underpinnings of gender continues to evolve. In 2013, for example, a Spanish study found that “even before treatment, the brain structures of the trans people were more similar in some respects to the brains of their experienced gender than those of their natal gender,” according to a summary of that study in Scientific American.</p>
