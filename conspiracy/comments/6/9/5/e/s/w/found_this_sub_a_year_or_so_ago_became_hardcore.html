        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m almost finished high school, but in the past year I&#39;ve become really interested in conspiracy theories. This made me question the &#39;facts&#39; I heard at school (because you&#39;re supposed to be a 21st century learner who critically thinks, right?) and question teachers who blindly say whatever they hear from the media or read in a textbook. Doing this has gotten me in deep shit now. All my teachers HATE me and hardly consider my opinions/thoughts anymore. Has this happened to anyone else? I&#39;ve not even said anything far-fetched that people would really disagree with. Is it dangerous to keep questioning like this? and could I be suspended for it?</p>

If I were you I&#39;d stop voicing my opinion in the public eye. Do it on YouTube or something more therapeutic.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. No one wants to be told that the foundation of what they know to be true, is a lie. You gotta pick your battles and only engage when you find a scenario that doesn&#39;t quite add up. 
First, show them that what they &quot;know&quot; doesn&#39;t quite make sense. Then give them a taste of other explanations. Once they realize that they were misinformed about one thing, they&#39;ll be more open to hearing more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say to suck it up until you are better at it. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you lived in a world where everyone was purple and you were blue. They see the sky as purple and you see it as blue.</p>

<p>How can you convince someone the sky is blue?  You have to prove it. But before you can prove it, you have to see though the eyes of a purple person.</p>

<p>My suggestion is that you join debate team or research on debate practices. There is a sort of finesse in speaking with people. It all begins with a specific plan of action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I have learned over the years is that you cannot let professors know your true frame of thought. At least not all professors, some will definitely hold it against you. Remember most professors only understand theories and do not have real world job experiences. </p>

<p>Having said that there will be professors that will understand your viewpoint, (only those that are open minded).</p>

<p>Professors love to say that students can express their opinions freely, but remember, at the end of the semester they will be assigning you a grade. </p>

<p>Become a wolf in sheeps clothing until you secure your degree&#39;s, when you have the backing of education no one can stop your viewpoint.</p>

<p>Remember, there will always be a time and a place to express your beliefs, just make sure you don&#39;t become overbearing with your opinions as it will create backlash from professors and people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edward Bernays the nephew of Sigmund Freud found that people will believe anything that&#39;s repeated in public by experts. </p>

<p>All you have to do is hire some experts to say so and people will  believe the moon is made of green cheese again. </p>

<p>Once experts have made a proclamation people will automatically believe that the experts have looked at the facts and reached an educated conclusion. The truth is that you can hire anyone to say anything if you have the money.</p>

<p>Edward Bernays proved his theory he called &#39;Propaganda&#39; while working for Chesterfield Cigarettes,  by having his hired radio and magazine spokesmen call smoking cigarettes smoking &#39;Torches of Freedom&#39; (look up the phrase)  </p>

<p>After hearing his spokesmen repeat the message millions of women began smoking cigarettes. That method is working on your friends. Once the expert has spoken almost no one will look at the facts themselves because the matter is &#39;settled&#39;.</p>

<p>Their psychological weakness is being exploited successfully. You may be best advised to not say so but instead point out the teachings of Bernays.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s his book explaining his invention of propaganda in pdf format.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had teachers actually refuse to teach me.</p>

<p>Use to read books in class instead of pay attention to my teachers as I figured I may as well learn something if I have to sit behind a desk all day. That didn&#39;t go down well with a lot of my teachers, although a few of them who actually took the time to know me understood and didn&#39;t mind. They knew I was well beyond the scope of what they were teaching. </p>

<p>The others however were either outright mean to me, or in some cases even afraid of me because I was so well researched and capable of debating logical arguments. </p>

<p>Unfortunately some teachers just want to hear themselves talk, and actually believe the bullshit they were taught without question and want you to do the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, in History/Social studies my teacher talks current events sometimes. Syria, Russia, Wikileaks (she usually says bad things about them), just that stuff. When I usually say something, though, she glares at me and doesn&#39;t even acknowledge my point, so it&#39;s a bit frustrating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s kind of an art in getting your family,friends, coworkers, etc to accept what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>If you find someone who strongly disagrees and gets emotional, don&#39;t even try. When those type of convos come up though, speak your piece matter of factly instead of trying to get them on board. In their quit time they will eventually incorporate what you&#39;re saying into things and at the least, take it into consideration.</p>

<p>Really, its the same for people who are willing to listen and be thoughtful about what you&#39;re saying, even if they don&#39;t quite agree yet. </p>

<p>Key is, don&#39;t confront or attack, don&#39;t be emotional about it...just throw facts out there.</p>

<p>Some people will take that seed you give them and water it and it&#39;ll grow. Some wont. Don&#39;t even bother trying on those people. It isn&#39;t worth it.</p>

<p>Biggest rule of all--never stop talking about it out of fear of being socially ostracized, suspended, fired, etc. If you do that, they win. That&#39;s what they count on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a similar experience. Except there were at least a couple of teachers willing to chat about unpopular opinions. Sadly one of those teachers would often say he would risk losing his job for discussing his opinion on the matter. I&#39;m sure the teachers don&#39;t hate you. If anything they probably envy you for speaking your mind. </p>
