<p>I posted links for you source whores. I&#39;m watching France 24 and they also report the same outcome. Everything about Macron and his rise to this point is sketchy. I wonder if the macron leaks will be forgotten also. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;7 ate 9&#39; was a mysterious post made (complete with borderline pornographic imagery) that many l33t interwebs surfers observed, but nary a shitposter could decipher. Some time after the post was made, the USG announced proudly there would be a 789 billion dollar bailout into the hands of some of the most despicable degenerates ever to draw breath on this planet, and quite possibly others!</p>

<p>It is unclear who exactly made the post, but what WAS clear was that a very significant decision was made long before it was to be supposed to have been made, and that this &#39;insider information&#39; was exploited in ways neither you nor I could ever hope to understand entirely.</p>

<p>The game is rigged, until enough people understand it is rigged, then suddenly its anarchy for a short time, until it gets rigged again.</p>

<p>In this threads case, 66.06% looks more like a thank-you note rather than a calling card. Don&#39;t ask me the difference please, I&#39;m still quite noobish!</p>

<p>We can&#39;t just accept the antichrist bits of the Bible and ignore the fact that Nostradamus is easily identifiable as a false prophet. </p>

<p>You would do better to call the Bible, &quot;God-inspired&quot; (lit. God breathed). I understand what you are getting at by crediting God with a co-author credit. inspired/breathed is what the commonly used verbage here. God breathed life into Adam, and he breathed life into His Word. </p>

I disagree with him killing a fig tree for not having fruit when it&#39;s not supposed to.  Him espousing love for other people is not unique to him or his religion, so disliking him has absolutely nothing to do with that concept.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, it doesn&#39;t seem like you know much about Christianity, clear  in the extremely simplistic ways you portray Christian teachings. Jesus Christ did in fact live and there&#39;s no reasonable position that says he doesn&#39;t. It is so contrary to the evidence that it is undoubtedly motivated by a want to deny the existence and as such deny Christianity. </p>

<p>A few reasons why he reason the existence of Jesus Christ is never honestly questioned are as follows:</p>

<p>One, if nothing else, the arguments against his existence are absurdly. That same extreme historical skepticism can also be applied to figures like Genghis Khan, Mohammed, Caesar Augustus, Alexander the Great and so on. </p>

<p>Two, there are historical sources outside of the Bible from the same period that reference him. The 1st century Jewish historian Josephus not only makes references to Jesus, his killing and his claims to being the Messiah, he even describes his supposed physical appearance. </p>

<p>Third, there&#39;s a historical continuity of Christianity. Unless history going back some two thousand years has been forged, which is spurious and in which case it defeats the purpose of history if history could be forged in such a way, there&#39;s no reason to doubt the historicity of Jesus Christ and therefore Christianity. It didn&#39;t pop out of nowhere.</p>

<p>The final and best point is that it doesn&#39;t make any sense whatsoever. There existed already the sort of religions that these Jesus skeptics suppose Christianity to be: the pagan state religions. It makes no sense to believe that a radically new religion would be created when there were already existing religions to use for that purpose and were far better suited for it. </p>

<p>But, and this is the most important thing to point out, is that the early Christians suffered heavily. The fact that the apostles and disciples of Christ were persecuted and most of the time died horrible deaths doesn&#39;t make sense in light of this claim that Jesus never existed because they&#39;d be dying for just some collective figment of their imagination. And it&#39;s certainly not the behaviour of conspiratorial masterminds creating one religion to rule them all either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man this is filled with bad assumptions. I want to address point three and then one. It is entirely possible for history to be forged, or at least manipulated to the point where continuity is lost. For example, of jesus history was genuine why are there so many biblical stories of jesus that are mirror copies of earlier stories, such as Horus- an egyptian God who was born of a virgin, with a birth announced by a star, who rose from the dead and walked on water? Or mithra- who was also born on December 25th to a virgin, had 12 followers, died to save the world, and resureccted after three days? If jesus existed, and if historical continuity matters, then the tropes of saviors throughout history show that these things are rehashed into new religious every so often. So there IS a reason to doubt the historical validity of jesus story. </p>

<p>The difference between jesus and Caesar or Alexander the great was the sheer amount of primary evidence for his existence. There is so much to back up claims of their actions that it&#39;s nearly incontrovertible, and they are dated in the tie frame where people would have witnessed them- not like the bible where some stories were written hundreds of years after the events took place. Additionally, primary evidence of Roman and Greek rulers were not picked and chosen to be put into history, the story is told by what is available. It&#39;s well known that there were books of the bible that aren&#39;t included in the zondervan translations, and the religious discrepency between the teachings of the old and new testament show that these aren&#39;t primary sources of evidence, if they were- how could they be contested?</p>

<p>Lastly, why would a new religion take hold if one already existed? Really? Why did Scientology and Mormonism spring up then? Power structure. You could join a religion, and maybe rise through the ranks to become a leader- but then you still have to operate within the foundation of the ideology and it would take way longer than a lifetime to change it in a way that would allow for any one person&#39;s ideas to become popular. What was easier was to create a new religion, or in Mormonism case, take an old religion and make new claims to make it seem like you&#39;re religion has more understanding of the supernatural, and has better answers. When Christianity became a real thing people barely understood why water fell from the sky. It&#39;s entirely feasible to think that people could be manipulated into following a new crowd of religious leaders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t. Your post, however, is filled with tonnes of inaccuracies, distortions and in addition to all of that it is rife with incredulity and ignorance. Did you watch Zeitgeist or some other New Age Gnostic bs by any chance? There&#39;s a lot to handle but I&#39;ll point a few things out.</p>

<p>Horus, f.e., wasn&#39;t born to a virgin, nor was he born on the 25th December. The birth myth of Horus is actually one of Osiris posthumously impregnating Isis (either through the creation of a golden phallus by Isis or by taking the phallus of the dead and chopped up Osiris). Egyptian myths tell us nothing about the date of Horus&#39; birth specifically. His birth was, however, celebrated in August. Nothing else you said about Horus is true either, which you&#39;d know if you&#39;d actually bother to read on this from reliable sources. Not only is it not true, it&#39;s blatantly false. This is the case for all of your supposed mythological knowledge.</p>

<p>If you had known better, you&#39;d also know that Christians do in fact not claim Jesus&#39; birthday to be on the 25th December. Western Christians celebrate it at that time, although the Bible gives no date on when it happened, while Eastern Christians celebrate it on the 7th of January. But they don&#39;t claim this is actually when he was born, it&#39;s simply when the birth is celebrated. </p>

<p>Do you know a single iota about the history of the Christian religion? Christians suffered massive persecutions. Visit Europe and take a walk through the catacombs and you&#39;ll understand exactly how bad it was. That doesn&#39;t fit very well with your narrative. And in your examples, the persons behind it have very obviously benefited massively from it, although the same couldn&#39;t be said for Jesus or for any of his followers. Not to mention how stupid your retort is when you consider how marginal these cults are and you then compare them to the old pagan state religions. All of it just reveals an incredible amount of ignorance on your part. </p>

<p>And actually, that sheer amount of primary evidence (fancy terms you&#39;ve got there although you&#39;ve never bothered to look through a legitimate historical source) is actually not there. On the same skeptical grounds that you, mr. Zeitgeist, doubt the historicity of Jesus we can also doubt every other historical figure.</p>

<p>So on and so forth. That&#39;s about it for me. What&#39;s better than for me to argue with you is that you actually stop listening to New Age bs and actually read some legitimate historians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again with the poor train of thought. The suffering of Christians has nothing to do with this discussion. Why you feel the need to bring up this point is beyond be- Christians suffering for their religion is not evidence for jesus existence or the continuity of his story. What&#39;s funny is that if you Google Horus&#39; story the Wikipedia article that comes up is nearly word for word with your explanation of his existence. Which is laughable after claiming I&#39;ve never look at a book. What I said was from what I remember reading in an actual history class, so sorry if my memory isn&#39;t as good as your ability to copy and paste from wikipedia, but there are large swaths of ancient stories which mirror the exact tropes of jesus stories. The congruence of this entirely highlights how, even if jesus existed, his importance and abilities were embellished. </p>

<p>You can critically think about why these stories match up, and how it disproves jesus miracle myths. It&#39;s probably safe to save that the average person in jesus time did not have access to the stories of Greek or egyptian mythology. So you can infer that these stories were rehashed after jesus life to create a god like person. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re wrong once again, the primary evidence for people like Julius Caesar are intense- he wrote a book himself about his conquests which largely survived the ages. Which you ca in google, as I&#39;m sure you will. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really weird to me that you think simply stating that someone doesn&#39;t know what there talking about makes it true, and that somehow you think making assumptions about people&#39;s background on the internet makes you a good debater. You&#39;ve used inconsistent points that have nothing to do with this discussion, have clearly used Wikipedia to sound smarter, and use a plethora of personal attacks to try and discredit me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just that there aren&#39;t these swathes of ancient stories which mirror the story of Jesus. And that story IS the birth story of Horus, whether it is on Wikipedia or not. You&#39;d almost think it is on Wikipedia because at the very least it&#39;s the most common view on that issue, but no, not so with you. I don&#39;t know how someone who I assume at least would pretend to have an interest in mythology doesn&#39;t know that. </p>

<p>The suffering of the Christians is very relevant exactly for the reason I have already explained. Clearly, however, you need to be spoonfed the reason why it is important. The Christians from the days of Jesus were persecuted and suffered immensely</p>

<p>Finally, how more delusional can you possibly be? You treat the historicity of Jesus with extreme skepticism despite the plethora of historical sources that show Jesus, the divine person of Christianity or not, to exist while treating Julius Caesars&#39; historicity—and it was Augustus Caesar I mentioned, not Julius Caesar, but the point remains the same—with nary a speck of entertainable doubt because he wrote a book—question-begging if I ever saw it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the suffering of Christians is not evidence to jesus divinity, which is the point I&#39;ve been making this whole time. Scientologists are ridiculed for believing in lord zenu but their &quot;suffering&quot; doesn&#39;t prove their God exists.  I never claimed that jesus existed or not, although I cannot make a claim one way or another.  as I said, the primary evidence doesn&#39;t exist, and books of the bible that the religious structure of Christianity redacted highlight how un-historic biblical stories are. You don&#39;t hide evidence to prove a point. And yes, there are many similarities in other mythologies that resemble biblical stories. Just saying there isn&#39;t doesn&#39;t make your statement true, regardless of if I&#39;m wrong about Horus. </p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m saying that jesus and Caesar  (Which ever one were talking about) is different is because of how historical texts work. There are sources of UFOs, and sources of climate change, but just because sources exist doesn&#39;t mean they both are valid because one phenomena has a higher quality of sources than the other. Same with jesus and Julius Caesar. Jesus stories were partially written by men who weren&#39;t even alive when jesus was, whereas there are government documents of Caesar and he wrote a book about himself. Not all sources are equal. </p>

<p>Once again, you show a poor train of thought. Reasonablness would not be personally attacking someone who disagrees with you. I&#39;m not delusional, I just have a different view point. If jesus did exist, his divinity was most likely not what the bible said it was. Once again, saying that someone doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about doesn&#39;t make it true. I can guess that you&#39;re religious and so any opinion that tries to disprove your foundational beliefs can warrant defensiveness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are a special kind of dense aren&#39;t you? I specifically mentioned that it shows, not necessarily Jesus&#39; divinity, but at the very least makes it very credible that they weren&#39;t just a bunch of people making up a religion to control the globe or whatever. </p>

<p>The reason Scientology and Christianity are different should be very obvious but I&#39;ll spell it out. Scientologists are making loads of money, being useful to the CIA and aren&#39;t being nailed to crosses. This isn&#39;t just the difference between apples and oranges, but between apples and arctic trout. </p>

<p>The Bible was written by men from Jesus&#39; period who at least claimed to have been his Apostles or disciples. And the main sources regarding Julius Caesar are not &quot;government documents&quot;, but his own writings and those of Sallust, Cicero, Plutarch and Suetonius, half of which are Caesar&#39;s contemporaries. We can just as easily doubt these as you doubt just about everything about the historicity of Christ and Christianity.</p>

<p>The point was, however, that the same skepticism shown towards the historicity of Jesus can be applied to countless historical figures. You wouldn&#39;t doubt, nor does anyone doubt, the historicity of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Socrates and others. The historicity of Julius Caesar or JFK is unimportant because I am making a very different type of argument. You are either unwilling or simply not competent enough at argument if you don&#39;t understand the point I made.</p>

<p>You do have a different viewpoint and it&#39;s delusional and clearly not motivated by knowledge and reason. Saying someone is ignorant does indeed not make them ignorant, which is why I am grateful that you have made it so that I only need to point out your ignorance.</p>

<p>Everything about Macron and his rise to this point is sketchy. I wonder if the macron leaks will be forgotten also.</p>

<p>Atleast he had to work to get to the top unlike Le Pen who got the leadership of FN because of her Nazi Daddy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should not be getting down voted. There is a major fallacy here.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t just accept the antichrist bits of the Bible and ignore the fact that Nostradamus is easily identifiable as a false prophet. </p>

<p>You would do better to call the Bible, &quot;God-inspired&quot; (lit. God breathed). I understand what you are getting at by crediting God with a co-author credit. inspired/breathed is what the commonly used verbage here. God breathed life into Adam, and he breathed life into His Word. </p>
