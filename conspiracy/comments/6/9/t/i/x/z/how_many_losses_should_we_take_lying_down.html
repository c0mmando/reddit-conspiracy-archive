       I saw that afterwards. My b. Albeit I don't think that makes him a globalist.

       There's a cynical saying "no one wants a democracy anymore. They want an authoritarian that agrees with them".
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling him a globalist for wanting things his way doesn't help anything. It's just a way to frame a "dirty word" against someone you don't agree with. Same with Fascist or Commie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Globalism is a terrible idea. But. I'm cynical enough to know the utopian version would never happen and we would end up with the worst possible version of it.

       Unfortunately, we will never have a Utopia friend. We can only fight for ours and our families. Too many care only about their politics being right to compromise and work together.

       This is NOT a white nation, nor is it a Christian nation. I see you've learned to hide your racism when you leave your altright safe spaces. Not just a bigot, also a hypocrite.

       I had to stop laughing before I could answer. 63% makes it white? Lol. Try mixing 63% white paint with 37% of ANY other color! And historically, before white people committed genocide by bringing their filthy germs here and the use of treachery and deceit,  America was 100% Indigenous culture. You just want to zero in on a certain period of time to support your flawed perception. The word "categorically" has no meaning in the context you use it.

       You know I am considered white right?
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if I was back in my paren't Mexico I'd lead the same life. My father and us have a very comfy live that we WORKED for. Came from nothing but now we enjoy life.

       Wasn't that your hand in the picture for your selective service letter?  If so, you are not a white man.  It doesn't matter, you don't have to he white, I'm just pointing out that you're an extremely dark skinned individual
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, you're not answering my question.  Do you dislike living in America, a white nation?  Yes or no?

       I've posted my face here plenty. Want a more recent picture and "proof of life" style pic let me know. I don't like LARPers so I do my part to always show proof.

       You look hispanic/latino to me, not European, but maybe Spanish (which is not Norse, but it is European)

       And no, I am not happy with my government.  I am happy with the life I have here though, which was built by white men

       When millions lost their homes, no one did much of anything.  When citizen's united passed, no one did much of anything.  As our freedoms are being taken, one by one, no one is doing much of anything.  As endless wars rage on many fronts, no one is doing much of anything.  As far as I can tell, there is no bottom, no end to this as long as a modicum of comfort exists.  I've pretty much become a cynic, and stopped believing my fellow american will ever get off their fat asses.

       I almost feel like the best option is to act like our ancestors and found another land bases on lessons learned. In with the good and out with the bad. Out of the fire a new Phoenix will be born, methinks. I made a post about unclaimed land in Antarctica, and starting a new country. I think that is the only way.

       Because anytime you want every nation to run according to your views that's called globalism. That's what people accuse globalists of or am I wrong?
