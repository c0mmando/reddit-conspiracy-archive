        Can we get FOX to run a hit piece on this guy, and CNN will run 24/7 coverage of the whole 'hiding' thing. The public will be furious on all fronts.

       Yeah, but there has been a HUGE amount of posts made by accounts that were all created 3 days ago, and are all posting the same conservative bullshit that almost no one commenting agrees with - yet the posts are upvoted like crazy.

       My read on his administration is that they will take decisive action and do what is necessary to unravel the global military quagmire.

       Bombing Syria after an obvious false flag, for one.  Also looks like he's gearing up to attack North Korea.  And lets not forget Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya.  Or any of the other half dozen countries he's droning on a daily basis.

       Trumps actions on the war front so far have been indistinguishable from Obama's or Bush's, except that he may be even more aggressively pursuing the war agenda.

       He said he gave the military full autonomy since he doesn't know about those matters. Seems like he is trying to absolve his responsibility for their fuck ups by staying out of it. We all know the

       He still has to take responsibility for that. He doesn't
       <em>
        get
       </em>
       to absolve his responsibility because he is the god damned president. No one forgives Obama for staying in longer than we wanted

        especially because
       </em>
       he campaigned on getting out, only to turn around and drone everywhere to hell. Trump doesn't get to point to his military leadership and say "oh it was their bad"; they're

       I wouldn't say he's completely turned against them. I voted for Trump and while he's doing things that I don't agree with, I still stand by my vote, as he was the better choice between the two.

       I dunno about better. But seeing Clinton humiliated was great. She expected us to just do the needful, like we were obligated to elect her. Regardless of anything else wrong in the world, her losing was some kind of justice.

       If you didn't vote for someone you wanted, you were throwing your vote away anyway, so I truly hope you do stand by your vote for the right reasons, not just because you preferred 1 shit over another. Trump and Clinton are as bad as each other, they play in the same circles, and as Trump has shown, they do the same things, the only real difference between them is Trump managed to convince you otherwise.

       I think America should just get out of being the "world police" and focus on the terrorist shit we have at home. Between antifa and BLM we have enough on our plates to worry about other countries.

       Gotta stop the black on black crime. A decent portion off of our population ~15% because they're getting systematically fucked by our Government. When we can elevate them and other groups to contribute we will do amazing things.

       Well it doesn't help that there is no uproar over the CONSTANT black on black crime like there is when the not so often police v black or white v black crime is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look I'm black, I grew up in Cincy, in a not so good area. I had the world against me. I grew out of it, first one in my family to go college, I have a degree and a job I love, a loving wife and kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes people just have to try. You can said "Well they aren't given any opportunities." Well guess what neither was I. I started working at 13 and was an assistant manager by 16 at a gas station. I could have been manager had I stayed until I was 18 but that wasn't the life for me.

       It takes effort that some people in those communities aren't willing to exert and would rather just have them handed to them.

       Are you incapable of thinking of even one reason why someone might make a new account to post something?

       You could also buy several-year-old accounts so that proves nothing either.

       I don't think "TPTB" actively rig the elections. Gotta keep in mind TPTB is not some single entity, it is a lot of different people/corporations and their interests often conflict with each other. The election process is more of a corporate war than a democratic election. The people don't play much of a role because our choices are presented to us and they are all 50%+ crap, and the only real difference between, what elections are decided by, are social issues that the corporations don't really give a fuck about.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I mean yes the elections are rigged in the sense that our choices are provided for us. I thought you meant rigged as in vote manipulation etc until I re-read your post.

       Agreed. We need to dismantle government altogether. We need to realize that both parties are corrupt, and that the elections are rigged entirely. They always win guys.

       Have fun with lead in your food because no epa/fda and with corporations paying you 50C an hour.  Yes dismantle the bullshit corporatocracy of the gov and lobbyists, but altogether getting rid of it will just hand the keys to the kingdom to corporations.  They're symbiotically just as at fault for the state of the union.  Break the strong ties between corp and gov and we'll have a much better country.

       You honestly believe that corporations should have free reign to do anything they please?  No shit over regulation is bad i'm with ya on that on tons of shit, like kratom, vaping, weed they want to regulate them to death to make $.  I'm talking about the laws saying employees need breaks, min. wage, and making sure people don't sell lead ridden food.  Imagine the world where corporations make the rules.

       I don't like him at all man, he wants to ban abortion.  He's not terrible compared to most mainstream ppl but I like Bernie's mentality so much more.  We need to have a nation for THE PEOPLE not for the .1% that want ALL the wealth.  Fuck the fact that people can INHERIT a job and make millions from the blood and sweat of their minions who struggle to pay for healthcare while they sit in their golden throne.  Fuck having children starve, 1 because the mom wasn't ready and couldn't have an abortion due to the state being a red one and 2. because she can't get a job anywhere that pays more than minimum wage.  We need to END class bullshit.  No man should have THAT much wealth when the very people that work their ASSES off for him have to die from some disease they cannot afford to pay to get taken care of.

       I dunno if Trump is that much of a globalist puppet, but more importantly he has become a puppet of the GOP and their decades-long efforts to remove every ("darn gub'ment") roadblock to handing the asses of the citizenry over to the corporations.

       The anti-Trump shit is just as bad, people foaming at the mouth about their beliefs instead of asking questions and presenting  theories without bias. At the moment there's more anti-Clinton stuff, but the anti-Trump stuff is growing, and fast. And it's of the same low quality low fact shit, just on the other side of the coin.

       Yeah, I got downvoted in that thread for questioning it.  We all know Hillary is a crook, but why the hell are we still focusing on it?  I get it, she should be imprisoned, but like all other corrupt elite politicians, she won't be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is bringing us back to Bush-era establishment republican politics so quickly it's actually frightening.  His entire campaign was a complete lie.  I was actually happy when he beat Hillary because of his promises of isolationism, anti-war, pro-working class, anti corruption.  But I quickly realized
       <strong>
        it was all bullshit.
       </strong>
       This guy is the epitome of a warmongering, bank deregulating, pro-big business, zionist, anti-healthcare establishment republican scum.

      <p>
       I say we fight back against the T_D crowd trying to influence this place by incessantly focusing on Hillary.  We aren't T_D, those lunatics would follow Trump off a cliff.  We are free thinkers.  After renewing tensions in Syria, posturing towards NK, Blackwater connections, increasing the military budget, attempting to repeal Dodd-Frank, dismantling healthcare, and Kushner NWO connection, Trump has made it abundantly clear that

        he is the enemy.

       You get it. They don't want to admit to being duped. And the posts on the this subreddit are diminishing in quality everyday because of the attention drawn by the anti-Hilldawg rants. Honestly, the top post is a "realization that the election was rigged to favor Hillary". How is that even quality?

       You know, I tend to do just that.  Usually I just offer info for easy debunks (because there's a lot of shit posted than literally 5 minutes of checking shows is wrong or blatant lies), but then a lot of the bullshit gets tons of comments regardless.

       Majority of us? How do you know, got a poll you've done on this sub? He's a puppet in your opinion, in my opinion, I don't know, I'll support him until it's crystal clear that he's a puppet. Assad called him a deep state puppet, maybe he really is? Who knows. Too early to tell!

       I'm honestly starting to think the main activity of this sub is just shills attacking shills. they could be all part of the same effort to confuse people and discourage them, or they could be competing agendas. who the fuck knows and sadly that's what they want.

Goldman Sachs pieces of shit and your think Hillary would be worse. While attacking people for their beliefs. You're a fucking mislead idiot attacking someone for an ideas just as crazy as yours.

       Hmm, guess I'm in the minority. I feel like if they are puppets, at least the let us choose the puppet we want preforming for us. Like I like the play that the trump puppet (if he is a puppet) is preforming more than I would have liked if the Hillary puppet had won.

       Anyone who starts with 'the media was biased for one person' just tells me they are pushing an obvious agenda.

      <p>
       If the media was really anti-Trump, they would have been talking about all his double standards, his ties to Russian oligarchs etc. Instead, they beat the 'grab em by the pussy' dead horse for two weeks so people would think 'is this really the worst of him?'.

       If the media wasn't shilling for Hillary they would have spoken about Wikileaks non-stop. Instead, they looked at the non-issues in Wikileaks and tried to sling the illusion that she was so far in the polls that she doesn't think about Trump anymore.

       This sub will always be "anti-left". The truth is that you're a fucking moron if you're left and believe in conspiracy. Because we all believe government is corrupt and evil that means less power and just overall less government is good. If that's what you believe you are right wing.

       This sub was strongly anti-left because of the right wing paid shills or brainwashed sycophants pushing the narrative that all liberals are evil. Also Trump voters discovered the internet in the last 8 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's calmed down recently... pretty obvious with what Trump turned out to be. You elected a reality T.V star "billionaire" who knew nothing of government policy. Now he's being controlled by people who do know what's going on. Great job.
      </p>
      <p>
       I voted for the status quo because as a leftie, I know the right wing wants me dead. I visit their sites all the time and I only follow right wing news media on facebook and twitter. I see what their white people say about people like me.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know recently Trump praised Australia's socialism... Not one right winger acknowledged it. Just said "when has communism ever worked". This and much more tells me all I need to know about these people and that we can't work together. They are fascist and it's their way the right wing way or the highway.

       I don't think that post was meant to stir up hate for the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       To anyone paying attention it has become staggeringly obvious that the election was indeed rigged, and it was rigged to Trump. The media smear campaign is just another illusion, they knew fine well it would grow his support and give him the image of being anti-establishment. An outsider does not get to become POTUS. Careful vetted and fully controlled people become POTUS.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, that post is blatant propaganda and a shining example  of how people are being fooled into thinking Trump's any different from the rest of those cunts. These are the type of manipulation tactics being used to control the narrative on forums.

       well i hope the good guys haven't taken on the tactics of TPTB, like the brock boys.  because that propaganda game won't go anywhere. but since a lot of posts are just repeating everything that's been said over the last year, and the usernames are clearly hamfisted political puns. I'd bet some money that it's just the brock bitches trying a new tactic of mimicking the opposition hoping through obnoxious posting can control the narrative by shitting on everything equally and constantly.

       Eh, I thought trump was genuine at the beginning. I'm okay saying that. Yes I was stupid, but it's the truth. Wasn't really into politics either. This election is what really brought me to understand it all.

       Trump must be battling the GOP during the campaign and when elected as the presidential candidate for show. He must be fighting with Republicans in Congress for show as well. All Democrats oppose his agenda for show too. No, it's not the lifelong politicians that are way richer than they should be that are corrupt, it's the billionaire businessman with decades of patriotism on video.
