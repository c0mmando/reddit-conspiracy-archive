<p>He still has to take responsibility for that. He doesn&#39;t <em>get</em> to absolve his responsibility because he is the god damned president. No one forgives Obama for staying in longer than we wanted <em>especially because</em> he campaigned on getting out, only to turn around and drone everywhere to hell. Trump doesn&#39;t get to point to his military leadership and say &quot;oh it was their bad&quot;; they&#39;re <em>his</em> military leadership. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it doesn&#39;t help that there is no uproar over the CONSTANT black on black crime like there is when the not so often police v black or white v black crime is.</p>

<p>Look I&#39;m black, I grew up in Cincy, in a not so good area. I had the world against me. I grew out of it, first one in my family to go college, I have a degree and a job I love, a loving wife and kids.</p>

<p>Sometimes people just have to try. You can said &quot;Well they aren&#39;t given any opportunities.&quot; Well guess what neither was I. I started working at 13 and was an assistant manager by 16 at a gas station. I could have been manager had I stayed until I was 18 but that wasn&#39;t the life for me.</p>

<p>It takes effort that some people in those communities aren&#39;t willing to exert and would rather just have them handed to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think &quot;TPTB&quot; actively rig the elections. Gotta keep in mind TPTB is not some single entity, it is a lot of different people/corporations and their interests often conflict with each other. The election process is more of a corporate war than a democratic election. The people don&#39;t play much of a role because our choices are presented to us and they are all 50%+ crap, and the only real difference between, what elections are decided by, are social issues that the corporations don&#39;t really give a fuck about. </p>

<p>So I mean yes the elections are rigged in the sense that our choices are provided for us. I thought you meant rigged as in vote manipulation etc until I re-read your post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like him at all man, he wants to ban abortion.  He&#39;s not terrible compared to most mainstream ppl but I like Bernie&#39;s mentality so much more.  We need to have a nation for THE PEOPLE not for the .1% that want ALL the wealth.  Fuck the fact that people can INHERIT a job and make millions from the blood and sweat of their minions who struggle to pay for healthcare while they sit in their golden throne.  Fuck having children starve, 1 because the mom wasn&#39;t ready and couldn&#39;t have an abortion due to the state being a red one and 2. because she can&#39;t get a job anywhere that pays more than minimum wage.  We need to END class bullshit.  No man should have THAT much wealth when the very people that work their ASSES off for him have to die from some disease they cannot afford to pay to get taken care of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I got downvoted in that thread for questioning it.  We all know Hillary is a crook, but why the hell are we still focusing on it?  I get it, she should be imprisoned, but like all other corrupt elite politicians, she won&#39;t be.</p>

<p>Trump is bringing us back to Bush-era establishment republican politics so quickly it&#39;s actually frightening.  His entire campaign was a complete lie.  I was actually happy when he beat Hillary because of his promises of isolationism, anti-war, pro-working class, anti corruption.  But I quickly realized <strong>it was all bullshit.</strong>  This guy is the epitome of a warmongering, bank deregulating, pro-big business, zionist, anti-healthcare establishment republican scum.</p>

<p>I say we fight back against the T_D crowd trying to influence this place by incessantly focusing on Hillary.  We aren&#39;t T_D, those lunatics would follow Trump off a cliff.  We are free thinkers.  After renewing tensions in Syria, posturing towards NK, Blackwater connections, increasing the military budget, attempting to repeal Dodd-Frank, dismantling healthcare, and Kushner NWO connection, Trump has made it abundantly clear that <strong>he is the enemy.</strong>  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let them distract us, because shit is going to hit the fan very quickly.</p>

<p>Indeed. Case in point: </p>

<p><strong>Haaretz- Israel- Election Day in the USA, 2016:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/sAXLG">Trump or Clinton, Israel Wins</a> - - - &quot;We can always play the victim to whichever non-Jew controls the White House. It’s worked until now; no reason it shouldn’t save Israel in the future as well&quot;</p>

<p>More at the link.</p>

<p>Now, if anyone thinks that too much attention is being focused on <em>&quot;poor helpless little Israel&quot;</em> and the insane amount of POLITICAL POWER that they and their Zionist brethren wield here in US, please feel free to snivel and whine... but really, you&#39;d do far better to A) Show that they do NOT have that much power, or B) show us OTHER minority groups who wield SIMILAR powers.</p>

<p>GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.</p>

<p><strong>Pound-for pound</strong>, Jews  - especially Ashkenazi and Zionist Jews - are THE wealthiest and most politically powerful/ influential  minority group on the planet. <strong>Hands down</strong>.

<p>Above I suggested that you <strong><em>&quot;B) show us OTHER minority groups who wield SIMILAR powers&quot;</em></strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub was strongly anti-left because of the right wing paid shills or brainwashed sycophants pushing the narrative that all liberals are evil. Also Trump voters discovered the internet in the last 8 years.</p>

<p>It&#39;s calmed down recently... pretty obvious with what Trump turned out to be. You elected a reality T.V star &quot;billionaire&quot; who knew nothing of government policy. Now he&#39;s being controlled by people who do know what&#39;s going on. Great job. </p>

<p>I voted for the status quo because as a leftie, I know the right wing wants me dead. I visit their sites all the time and I only follow right wing news media on facebook and twitter. I see what their white people say about people like me.</p>

<p>You know recently Trump praised Australia&#39;s socialism... Not one right winger acknowledged it. Just said &quot;when has communism ever worked&quot;. This and much more tells me all I need to know about these people and that we can&#39;t work together. They are fascist and it&#39;s their way the right wing way or the highway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that post was meant to stir up hate for the left. </p>

<p>To anyone paying attention it has become staggeringly obvious that the election was indeed rigged, and it was rigged to Trump. The media smear campaign is just another illusion, they knew fine well it would grow his support and give him the image of being anti-establishment. An outsider does not get to become POTUS. Careful vetted and fully controlled people become POTUS. </p>

<p>But yeah, that post is blatant propaganda and a shining example  of how people are being fooled into thinking Trump&#39;s any different from the rest of those cunts. These are the type of manipulation tactics being used to control the narrative on forums.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well i hope the good guys haven&#39;t taken on the tactics of TPTB, like the brock boys.  because that propaganda game won&#39;t go anywhere. but since a lot of posts are just repeating everything that&#39;s been said over the last year, and the usernames are clearly hamfisted political puns. I&#39;d bet some money that it&#39;s just the brock bitches trying a new tactic of mimicking the opposition hoping through obnoxious posting can control the narrative by shitting on everything equally and constantly.</p>
