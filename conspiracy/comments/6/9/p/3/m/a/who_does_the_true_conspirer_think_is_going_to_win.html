        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the light of all the emerging theories surrounding the Macron Email Leaks, who do you think is going to win the French election and how does this fit in with the wider NWO agenda.</p>

<p>And why did the leaker wait till the period right before the election to leak the emails when the media is under strict reporting laws, and have next to no time to turn around the polls.</p>

<p>Is a long game being played to ensure that a Macron presidency is loses legitimacy right from the start making his position untenable. Or is this a wider scheme to implicate the Russians to further smear them and provide an excuse for state mandated hacking and additional monitoring of certain web traffic, coming in and out of Russia to the western world.</p>

<p>Would like to hear your ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think whoever the leaker is has wants Macron to win, in order to destroy his legitimacy, and ensure that no one will trust a centre-leftist, globalist government in France, and ensure a right wing populist is ensured to win a big victory at the next GE. Plus this would be a much more devastating blow to the EU than Brexit, and cracks in Brussels will start to appear, as inevitably negotiations go South with the UK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting theory, so do you think the EU was setup to fail, or are &quot;they&quot; adapting to the changing political climate to maximise their gains? And playing both sides of the political divide to further their interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, i think the EU was a trial run on large world governments.  Being that not everyone played on the same field the bankers could not gain profit.  That&#39;s why the Brexit was so mediaized to make it look bad.  With Italy, Greece, Cyprus as well as other countries being forced to pay their debts to the EU bankers by stealing the people&#39;s money this could only continue for a few years.  If France falls into disrepair then most of the remaining EU will collapse by the end of the year.  Any banker worth their money will always play both sides of the bet.  Example, banks will lend to poor house buyers knowing that the gov&#39;t backs the loans AND the banks still get the house to resell.  Now think about it on large commercial properties and &quot;gov&#39;t owned&quot; properties that politicians have to sell off to pay their piss poor loans. I think that the world we live in now and have seen for the last decade will collapse into an &#39;expected outcome&#39; to push the NWO agenda.  I personally think the US of A will collapse or become a non-major power within the next 5 yrs thus allowing new powers to rise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair point. What do you think is the NWO endgame here though. Money is one thing, but it doesn&#39;t ensure control. And more and more people are becoming disillusioned with large government, and more and more skeptical of political institutions.</p>

<p>I have to think that whoever got this stuff did so in the past few weeks or months, checked for devious content, but found none. Then, he salted the emails with fakes that are not easy to quickly debunk, as the only controversial ones being promoted on this sub and twitter are each suspected to be fakes. Then they sat on the collection until just before the campaign and media blackouts began, dropping them anonymously through 4chan to rally the only &quot;official&quot; channel still running, the social media rumormill and the general internet. </p>

<p>Perhaps they didn&#39;t choose Wikileaks because they would have been scrupulous in verifying authenticity and rate of release, not a massive 9GB dump. Hasn&#39;t stopped their twitter from promoting them and claiming they haven&#39;t found any fakes yet (which of course they wouldn&#39;t this quickly, it&#39;s been one full day). This is assuming that WL is not playing a side here.   </p>

<p>I noticed you did not say hacker, do you think there&#39;s zero chance they were hacked?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree there&#39;s a lot of junk and jumping the gun with rumours regarding certain documents/emails but WikiLeaks said that one of the documents regarding offshore accounts was printed on a $100,000 dollar printer so seemed likely to be a legitimate document and not a forgery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw that tweet, I need more. I thought the issue was with the signature (blurry when blown up), then a second &quot;HD&quot; version was released to try and debunk that debunking (a clearer image, which could have been easily done in photoshop, focusing on sharpening the signature). I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested to see a breakdown of the printer idea. As a currently nauseous American, it&#39;s hard to have a problem with him even having an offshore account when our president&#39;s family is running real estate deals across the globe, no tax returns, you get the picture. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Macron is just as corrupted and fucked as Trump, Clinton, Le Pen, but heavily disputed one day old docs haven&#39;t proven that, not yet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree people want to jump from suspicion to guilt too quickly, more information has to firstly be ascertained, validated and contextualised before any assumptions can be reached. Going to be an interesting start to his presidency if any of the more controversial documents are found to be legitimate.</p>
