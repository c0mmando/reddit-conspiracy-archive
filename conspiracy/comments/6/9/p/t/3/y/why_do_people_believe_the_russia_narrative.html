        <h3 class="title">Why do people believe the Russia narrative?</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">81</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/whazzat1970.html">whazzat1970</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I was reading the Clinton and Macron threads on Twitter today and its seems almost everyone was parroting the Russia narrative. And these weren&#39;t trolls and media shills; they were mostly normies. Does nobody think for themselves anymore? Do they just believe everything they&#39;re told? Am I a fucking conspiracy theorist to know bullshit when I smell it?</p>

<p>Seriously, Russia has been the bogeyman for the better part of a century now. If you&#39;re writing a story, whether book, movie, game, or apparently news article and you have no creativity at all, they&#39;re the default villain to go with. And why not? Apparently nobody knows anything about Russia so you can just say whatever you want and people won&#39;t know any better.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying, of course, that Russia&#39;s reputation is not undeserved. The Cold War was a thing, and in the past spying and subterfuge was real. But McCarthyism was also a thing. Don&#39;t they teach that in school still? Was I forced to watch (and do homework on) that godawful Crucible movie for nothing?</p>

<p>According to information released by the FBI, Hillary&#39;s email server was a shitty old Dell running Active Directory and Exchange on Windows 2003 with Remote Desktop enabled and wide open. A child could have hacked that, but no, clearly it must be Russia. I&#39;m losing my hope for humanity here, and I&#39;m too young to become a cynic. Help me out here, folks.</p>

<p>Edit: Those of you who believe the Russia narrative, I&#39;m curious what you guys think Russia&#39;s motive is. Is Russia just forever on an evil crusade to take over the world?</p>

<p>Like the 1984 version, teenagers are forced to defend their hometown against a North Korean invasion.</p>

<p>They really just mean the part about teenagers defending their hometown. The North Korean part is not the same.</p>

<p>I guess the point remains though. To be honest I don&#39;t even think Kim Jung is really top dog.

<p>Trump forced the RNC to change their platform regarding Russian sanctions, but he was ok with them keeping the part of their platform that opposes gay US citizens&#39; right to marry?</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s entire campaign being run by someone who is literally a foreign agent. The real ruse here is obvious.</p>

<p>Trump putting someone on the national security council who took a bunch of money from a Russian state owned propaganda outlets. (hint: state owned propaganda outlets are the ones deceiving people with fake news) This same guy was also negotiating the stuff about sanctions, illegally since he was a private citizen at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point I give credence to &quot;the Russians did it&quot; on the Macron leak because Wikileaks noticed Cyrillic language in the metadata, and found a Russian security contractor&#39;s name (Evrika) on some of the documents. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence (and evidence to the contrary) that it was Russia regarding Clinton/Podesta/DNC hacks.</p>

<p>Regarding Macron, it&#39;s clear he&#39;s in favor of globalisation. This ethos hurts Russia politically and economically, namely because those in favor of globalization want to cut the country off at the knees in order to isolate its oil production, supply chain, and trade neighbors. This is why globalists stepped in with the Ukraine, Syria, and is eyeing Iran... all of these countries are strategically important to Russia. So, geopolitically, Russia has always been a threat to globalists.</p>

<p>Do I care if Russia is revealing the truth about who is running the west and why? No. It&#39;s about damn time we all woke up to it, anyway. Russia is just as dirty, so I don&#39;t pretend like they could be any savior. The direction globalists are taking the West is, to me, far more dangerous than &quot;Russians interference in democracy&quot; (which doesn&#39;t really exist anyway).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are people in government and media who have been pushing for conflict with Russia. A cyber false flag could give politicians and big media corporations an excuse to censor the web.

This increase in sales motivates the military industrial complex to stoke the fires of war. </p>

<p>If some corporation or foreign government stood to gain from swaying the French Election they would have reason to frame any hacking they do as a Russian hack.

<p>This whole thing is an intel battle in a bigger geopolitical war. Putin wants to destabilize Europe because sanctions are choking the Russian economy and it would give them more leverage at making better trade deals. He&#39;d also like to reconsolidate what was lost under the collapse of the USSR. The DNC shot themselves in the foot backing Clinton but that doesn&#39;t mean Russia is this perfect country thats just misunderstood and demonized by the West.

<p>In several places, the CIA talks about making sure that what they do isn&#39;t so unique, so it can&#39;t be attributed to them. However, Wikileaks&#39;s press release hints that the &quot;UMBRAGE&quot; program is deliberately stealing techniques from Russia to use as a false-flag operation. This is nonsense. For example, the DNC hack attribution was live command-and-control servers simultaneously used against different Russian targets -- not a few snippets of code.</p>

<p>In the coming days, biased partisans are going to seize on the CIA leaks as proof of &quot;false flag&quot; operations, calling into question Russian hacks. No, this isn&#39;t valid. We experts in the industry criticized &quot;malware techniques&quot; as flimsy attribution, long before the Sony attack, and long before the DNC hacks. All the CIA leaks do is prove we were right. On the other hand, the DNC hack attribution is based on more than just this, so nothing in the CIA leaks calls into question that attribution.</p>

<p>There are two factions that have a policy of escalating our relations with Russia.  You have the neo-conservative faction that is clustered around the Institute for the Study of War. They view the Cold War as being responsible for America&#39;s power and prosperity and wish to put us in a similar position. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_the_Study_of_War">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_the_Study_of_War</a></p>

<p>Robby Martin did a great documentary on the Neo-Conservatives titled &quot; A Very Happy Agenda&quot;.  Check out this clip on the New Cold war.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXpIfZqg8zA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXpIfZqg8zA</a></p>

<p>The second faction is long term geo-strategists who view the creating of a huge marketplace that would encompass the European and Asian marketplaces as a direct threat to American power and economic hegemony. Russia is at the center here,  and they believe that they can isolate Russia. To understand this start at the beginning with Mackinder, and this paper &quot; The Geographical Pivot of History&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geographical_Pivot_of_History">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geographical_Pivot_of_History</a></p>

<p>His theory is usually summarized in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland;
    who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island;
    who rules the World-Island commands the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Known facts about Russia:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trump took large loans from Russian banks when no other banks would finance him or his companies</li>
<li>Trump has had dealings with Putin&#39;s good friends that went a little too well for him</li>
<li>Le Penn has taken loans from Russian banks to finance her campaign</li>
<li>Putin hates NATO</li>
<li>Trump keeps saying things that could destabilise NATO</li>
<li>Le Penn wants to take France out of NATO</li>
<li>Putin wants to hang on to Crimea and possibly take more of Ukraine</li>
<li>Trump pushed for the GOP to weaken their stance on Russia re: Ukraine and Crimea</li>
<li>Le Penn wants to Frexit, reducing France&#39;s involvement in protecting Ukraine</li>
<li>Putin hates Clinton for challenging his legitimacy as Russia&#39;s leader</li>
<li>Putin arrests or kills people who threaten his power</li>
<li>While the DNC and RNC were both hacked, only Clinton&#39;s data was leaked</li>
<li>The leaks were timed for maximum damage to Clinton</li>
</ul>

<p>Stop looking this as a &quot;What Russia wants&quot; issue. This is a &quot;What Putin wants&quot; issue. Putin is ex-KGB. None of this is beyond him.</p>

<p>The more we learn about the Trump-Russia connection, the more it adds up to Russian interference in the US election and global politics. Governments around the world have started speaking up about Trump&#39;s communications with Russia. Republicans are running scared from the investigations. Obama&#39;s staff refused to give Trump&#39;s staff information about sanctions so they wouldn&#39;t be able to warn Russia. The author of That Dossier, Christopher Steele, <em>went into hiding for several months after Buzzfeed published it</em>. </p>

<p>Scepticism is a good thing but if you&#39;re still not convinced that Russia is interfering in global politics and influencing elections, you&#39;ve stepped the line from healthy scepticism to anti-vaxx level denial of evidence.  </p>

<p>To be honest that why I have no problem <em>not</em> deleting all my comments. I don&#39;t need to hide my partisan leanings and force people to treat each of my comments objectively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did I say that you disagree with the OP <em>because</em> you were suspicious?</p>

<p>I assumed you disagreed with it because you chose to jump into this sub to defend a random sketchy account while whatabouting another one, after having not posted in this sub in 2 months. This also led me to assume you agreed with the poster you were defending.</p>

<p>Both of these assumptions were correct. </p>

<p>If you spent time in this sub, youd know /new is being flooded by these 2 day accounts, which have an MO of not really interacting with the criticism they are getting. Therefore, calling it out would be moot. I&#39;m instead choosing to engage with the more active users, so I can actually engage them on the sketchiness of their accounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I didn&#39;t. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>As I already explained, the accounts that spam posts almost never engage in discussion and when they do it&#39;s open ended one liners that don&#39;t lead to discussion.</p>

<p>Like I already pointed out, if you were a regular on this sub youd know that.</p>

<p>Youd also know (though whether youd have a problem with it I doubt) that there is a huge narrative on this sub that &quot;Russian Donald nazi shills run this sub and all criticism and dissent of trump or Russia is downvoted to oblivion by shills and banned, CTR doesn&#39;t exist and there are no sketchy accounts pushing left wing agendas on here.&quot;</p>

<p>The funny thing is the Russian shills seem to operate with &quot;don&#39;t engage, just flood and spam&quot; while the other side operates with, &quot;immediately attack, criticize, and discredit anyone who questions our narrative with thinly veiled accusations, condescending dismissal and ad hominem attacks&quot;.</p>

I&#39;m all ears if you&#39;ve got a leaked email, document, or anything really that shows that there was collusion, coercion, or influence on the election, Trump platform, or campaign by Russian agents.</p>

<p>As it stands you&#39;ve provided absolutely nothing of substance. What&#39;s more referencing dossier is ridiculous--no on can say with any certainty that it isn&#39;t pure fiction from start to finish. There&#39;s no reason to believe a word of it. </p>

<p>In addition your last two points are just stupid. They just are. There&#39;s no real evidence that DNC servers were actually hacked, and saying the leaks were &quot;timed for maximum damage&quot; is meaningless. Of course Wikileaks was trying to maximize the damage--Hillary, the DNC, and her campaign managers were revealed to be a pack of corrupt, cheating liars. Why on earth wouldn&#39;t Assange et al want to sink her run for president?</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m not a Trump supporter. I think he&#39;s the worst thing that&#39;s happened to US politics since the assassination of JFK. But you and the rest of your Hillary fan base have yet to come up with anything other that the worst kind of flimsy, faith-based allegations that do nothing but undermine and distract from the awful truths about Trump&#39;s presidency. </p>

<p>Putin is already helping Le Pen financially, so its not much of a stretch that he would try to hurt her opponent by hacking.</p>

<p>Also Russian teams have consistently won international programming competitions so they have the tech savvy to pull off these politicized hackings.
<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/343723-russian-programmers-icpc-contest-victory/">Russian</a></p>

<p>So it makes sense that Russians could and would hack Macron.</p>

<p>As a counter question, if you don&#39;t believe Russians did it who do you think did it and why? It clearly seems politically motivated, so you can claim that a child could have hacked them or whatever, but why would they and why would they time the release like they did?</p>

<p>Also, do you believe all of these Western organizations that are tasked to do computer forensics are just making up stuff and don&#39;t actually do computer forensics?</p>

<p>So, a bunch of right-wingers attacking the left through misinformation and by exploiting public fears? They would have done that with any communist nation. How is this McCarthyism, except for the fact that Russia is involved? Are we blacklisting actors now? </p>

<p>IC says it was Russia, unanimously as far as I know. Either the entirety of the IC is lying to you, or you simply don&#39;t want it to be true. We&#39;re on conspiracy, so you can go either way here. That&#39;s fine. But let&#39;s not pretend the Russia narrative isn&#39;t backed by the people we historically have relied on as investigators. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Russia is what&#39;s left of the USSR after total collapse and a resulting hard-right/religious slide into autocracy. Its military is still powerful, but it has little to offer the world except oil. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe and the US have been organizing and trending liberal, which directly contradicts Putin&#39;s ideology and interests. So if you have relatively little real influence in the world, few friends, and a truckload of former spies, what do you do? You exploit the vulnerabilities of new technology to spread your own ideology and elect friendly faces in countries that would otherwise be your opponents. Nations that lurch hard right strain ties with their more liberal allies, everything splinters a bit, and suddenly Russia isn&#39;t the little guy on the big stage anymore. </p>

<p>Seems fairly obvious to me. </p>

<p>Those of you who believe the Russia narrative, I&#39;m curious what you guys think Russia&#39;s motive is. Is Russia just forever on an evil crusade to take over the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can answer this pretty easily. </p>

<p>For starters, Russia&#39;s motive is restored geopolitical dominance in it&#39;s old Soviet sphere of influence. That&#39;s it&#39;s number one main priority, with Putin even quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2005/04/25/2031_type70029type82912_87086.shtml">http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2005/04/25/2031_type70029type82912_87086.shtml</a></p>

<p>This gives you some insight into Putin&#39;s, and by obvious extension the Kremlin&#39;s and Russia&#39;s foreign policy goals. Now how would Russia, a country with a GDP roughly on par with Italy, be able to do that against the might of the EU, backed by NATO and the United States? </p>

<p>It would have to rely on a multi-pronged espionage effect, through information warfare, old-school blackmail and infiltration, and the undermining of it&#39;s rivals on the global stage wherever possible.</p>

<p>Even by Comey&#39;s own testimony to Congress, Putin and Clinton were enemies and Putin clearly had a preference for Trump. I don&#39;t see any logical reason to dispute this, as Putin would clearly prefer Trump over someone who had resided in the White House while the Ukraine crisis was unfolding. </p>

<p>So now you have the reason for Russia&#39;s interference. Attacking democratic elections and undermining their credibility, as well as the added benefit of hoping to tip the scales in favor of a preferred candidate is an obvious state-espionage tactic. </p>

<p>The easiest and most efficient current way to undermine the US/EU dominated world order is by undermining the EU, which Russia is engaged in through it&#39;s efforts of promoting people like Donald Trump, who upend the global order and creates distrust in NATO, and through supporting Le Pen who has openly questioned the EU and NATO and who coincidentally also receives funding from Russian banks. </p>

<p>Compare this with the timing of things like the DNC leaks, Wikileaks&#39; Assange rushing to Putin&#39;s defense with the Panama Papers and receiving a TV show on RT prior to that, as well as the timing of the Macron email leaks. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t even go into Russia undermining the EU through military means in Ukraine, where it annexed the sovereign territory of another nation and then created and continued to fund and arm a civil war in Europe. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s sort of a rant, but there is way too much to get into without making everyone of those a wall of text. Hope that gives you some idea though. </p>

<p>There you go.  This is a start.  Now I think the bigger is why so many of you are putting your in the sand about being attacked by a  long time enemy of the United States?   Putin was KGB.  Why would you think that he would somehow not be angry and want payback for the Soviet collasping that he blames(and rightfully so) on the the USA?  Or another way to think of it is:  Think of a person who you really  didn&#39;t get along with.  Now think of what you feel towards them if say they took your spouse(by marrying them) and just straight ruined your life.   Are you going to say that 20 years later your going to have forgiven them?  Or would you might try to get them back, if the opportunity presented  itself.  </p>

If a lie is presented on television on all the channels, every day of the year, for years on end, people will believe the lie. It is too much effort to think for themselves.

    <div class="md"><p>You are always allowed to question other people, I&#39;m not sure where you got the impression otherwise.</p>

<p>I just loved the fact that you questioned a commenter deep in this submission while you were silent about the OP - until I pointed it out.</p>

<p>I wonder where your skepticism was then.  Do you only look into accounts where you disagree with the narrative, or did you actually look into the OP&#39;s account and thought it was fine (until I called you out)?</p>
