       Don't let the shills get you down. Keep each other up. The system wants you to think that there's no hope d that we are screwed.

       It's all a psychological tactic to make us feel hopeless and give up. Let's take our destiny back once and for all.

       Well yes. it's hippie and all, but does it hurt having a positive attitude, hope and a message of unity? It's true that we can control our own fate, ultimately. Consciously choosing love and positivity even in a disgusting world is the first step to cleaning up the mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few months ago I hated everyone, everything and even my own self, for 24 damn years. Hated the "hippie" shit too. And then I had a brush with death and I have no reason why, a switch flipped and here we are. I can relate to this larger awakening everyone says is happening at once...and I feel it for some reason...

       You're right, it doesn't hurt and is better for your health. I just think phrases like "consciousness evolving" are cringey metaphysics. To each his own.

       I'd agree with you, just don't immediately reject it is all I'm saying. That's exactly what I did. Dude I used to have debates with family basically ridiculing their belief in the unseen. Saying things like "Well if theres a God up there, I dare him to try and fuck with me! TRY!" (Oh and shit did indeed pile up on me, whether that was a consequence of my threat remains to be seen (or unseen)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm obviously not implying you do anything close to this..but for example the phrase "consciousness evolving" doesn't have to be anything metaphysical...break it down to its simplest parts..just being more conscious/aware can be the definition of that. These concepts are what you make them.

       I feel it to mate. I've been experiencing some weird shit in my life. I'm more of an "empath" and in tune.... Peace and love... There will come a day where we need to fight, though. Keep that in mind. The great Awakening is good, but hellish times... Prepare. Mentally, physically, and spiritually....

       The true battle is waged in the heart and is not good vs evil but love vs fear. Say a "prayer" that the powers that be may have love enter their hearts so they too might awaken. Our minds and wills are powerful, that is why group meditations are more powerful than singular.

       Yes, we may not live to see it, but the tide is turning. You heard what Zbigniew Brzezinkski said about the internet causing a mass global political awakening and it's hampering the implementation of the NWO.

       Doubt it. We are tuned into love and empathy. Let it flow and leave the hate behind. Don't take anything personally and don't make assumptions. Do your best and youll be rewarding yourself every minute with a clear conscious.

       I'm 57 And it is a nice thought . It takes groups of good to over come bad.I do agree with turning the other cheek.And don't seek revenge ,it is a waste of future productivity.
   I am trying to keep my grandchildren informed that they need to make things happen .Things will not improve if not constantly on the ball.

       Twin Peaks was an early 90s drama/thriller series by David Lynch.  Plot centered around evil spirits emanating from the "Black Lodge" and possessed local townsfolk making them crazy and evil killers.  The new reboot starts this month on Showtime.  Good show, highly recommended.

       Research Edgar Cayce. Read The Journey Within. Or best yet--learn how to properly meditate and all answers you need will come. The truth is inside all of us already, you do not need a book to find it, only to quiet your ego's nonstop thinking so you can find it within yourself.

       I don't know if we can definitely say he was a fraud.  He seemed like a decent guy who from I've read about didn't the seem the type to be fraud intentionally.  If he really didn't have those special powers I always like to think that he believed he did and wasn't trying to con anyone.

       I can share my thoughts on this topic, and what I've kind of come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your gut has a large neural network. This has a huge influence on your actions throughout the day. The ecosystem and types of microbes that live there can actually influence your decisions. Most notably they influence what foods you eat in order to provide more nutrients for whatever said micro organisms. This leads us to consume foods that are great for them, but not so great for the individual. This in turn impairs our various cognitive systems. Since this has been happening pretty much the entirety of our lives, we have not really experienced what we should really feel like or think. This in turn blinds us to the fact that this impairment is in place and prevents us from taking any actions to correct it. Not because we would not want to, but we just didn't know it existed in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bad analogy to sum it up: It's like if the doctor at the hospital when you are born removed the weird round things in your face. It's just a tradition that's happened for generations. Everybody is blind, and nobody knows that it's not supposed to be that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: I click on a lot of things on the internet.

       i think something important are the psoas muscles, connecting upper and lower body, the "seat of the soul", your gut feeling and intution,  where emotional trauma is stored, which tenses up during fight and flight and many humans have unlearned how to naturally release that trauma afterwards. the point at the 3rd chakra is where psoas muscle and diaphragm latch onto the spine, influencing your breathing and many other things.

       I'm not quite sure where I initially started the line of inquiry that led me to this, but I can jump you to what I was looking into roughly a third of the way, which should bridge some gaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initial assumption: Your body is your own. Don't fuck it up, but feel free to experiment with unorthodox methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was looking into Wim Hof, the guy who climbed Mt. Everest in nothing but shorts and shoes. He had a serious brush with death when he was a kid and that experience has given him some fascinating abilities. He attributes these abilities to two things: Breathing technique and Diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried the breathing technique for a while. I had cognitive improvements, but it was very difficult to maintain. (Side branch investigation into maintaining a single thought. Results: this is a big part of what monks do while meditating. Tried, have improved, still trying.)
      </p>
      <p>
       His diet is eating once a day. I have been wary to attempt this because of work and home responsibilities that I can't really just be zonked out for due to a lack of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The eating once a day thing. I kept seeing it when I looked into other people who achieved a huge success in XXXXX. (One meal a day was the biggest common link I could find. The actual diet method and rules vary, but once a day is apparently a key.)
      </p>
      <p>
       My wife doesn't like to cook, and I work a lot. We eat a lot of fast food and quick processed meals. So I guess we are shooting ourselves in the foot? Sugar is apparently the devil. It's in everything. We can't plan 3 meals a day, cook them, tend to the kids, pay bills, track calories, and everything else you are supposed to just know how to do and do.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I started looking for ways to make our life easier. I was originally looking into starting a garden or something to supplement veggies and stuff, but that is just adding more work. Then it hit me. Eating once a day saves our family about 4 hours of time for life or whatever. Think of all those projects you wish you had time to get to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time. Not enough time. I realized I had
       <a href="https://youtu.be/4Lx1kIrempw">
        several addictions
       </a>
       . To sugar. To my phone. To the internet in general. Everyone knows the first step is acknowledging that you have a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that means I'm on step two?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife states that it sounds like an eating disorder. I acknowledge this. I have no idea if it will even work. She now has the final say to stop if I start looking unhealthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a plethora of TED talks and anecdotal personal stories, I came across
       <a href="https://youtu.be/PKfR6bAXr-c">
        This Video
       </a>
       , which connected a bunch of the dots I have been holding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea how credible it is, but I figured I might as well give it a try. The inquiry into the monk stuff provided some pointers on how to identify a craving or feeling and insert a small amount of space in between it and you. That's all you need to basically compartmentalize it from yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gut organisms influencing your actions ties in here. I'm doing things that are not really good for me. I don't know why. I can't really seem to stop myself. Is it influence from them, an addiction, or something else?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm on day 4 of one meal a day. I've cut all drinks except for water. I have a subscription on Amazon for a case of the Monster Ultra Energy Sunrise drinks, and for the past year I have had one each morning while I take a shower. (Similar to a beer in the shower, but for work!) I waited for the weekend to start cutting these things out. There has to be a hard transition period in the beginning. I expected my energy levels to tank hard. Being hungry seems to be just an indication. It doesn't mean I have to act on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel slightly hungry a lot of the time. (Slight negative) I feel more focused and my body feels a LOT lighter. I'm no where near in shape, but I feel like I am. (Huge positive) I have more time in the day to do what I want. (Positive) I save a lot of money by just not spending it. This sounds weird, but it is super hard to break out of the "consumer" mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, I would recommend.
      </p>
      <p>

       I am reminded of the saying when the student is ready the teacher appears. Thank you for sharing your experience and insights. I too am on a quest to be more positive and mindful of health. It's an amazing journey. I was just discussing the importance of fasting with a friend today. There was an oncologist who gave a speech on how the healthiest people with the most longevity regularly practiced fasting. This physician suggested simply starting with not eating after 7 and see how the body reacts. I am so glad you shared all those links food is not only fuel, but emotional as well. It's tough to find a balance. I am looking forward to delve into those links you shared. I have already shared them with some friends. I did come across a Netflix documentary that had a title called the brain in the gut. I cannot link at the moment but I will update it when I get home. Thanks again! And good luck on your journey.

       Fwiw that's probably the most interesting this I read on this sub. It reminds me of the idea of how the first humans probably perceived their own thoughts as coming from somewhere else. Who knows, maybe conception/birth could be a kind of gateway for these transdimensional parasites (us, lol) to enter the body. Or a less fantastical way of looking at it is simply that our brains themselves can be viewed as the parasite, all other stuff aside.

I find it amusing my comment got voted up and down back and forth as if I said something controversial. Maybe I'm just buzzed, or maybe some people either hate out of the box thinking or just don't get it. So it goes...

       I think believing in that is not crazier than believing in a religion, but the fact that people say it's ridiculous and then go and pray to Jesus makes wonder if at some point that way of believing had to be eliminated (ridiculed).

        Wonder if our consciousness is a parasite or microbe or some germ inside us
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You could say our consciousness is a worm. Once, according to Jayne's theory of the Bicameral Mind, we had connected brain halves and one was interpreted as "the voice of God". At some point, the lobes were disconnected. Further, our use of the Hippocampus and Pineal gland became severely hampered. We were anatomically the same, but functionally quite different. Consciousness will soon reach a new stage as our brains evolve to become more advanced receptors to the underlying plane of reality that allows our consciousness to emerge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worm enters a cocoon, and long after emerges a butterfly. Kali Yuga is ending, and the cycle moves from the decline of monotheism to the long (millions of years) ascent to that butterfly golden era. The universe is a consciousness incubator, not the real universe, and we are simply doing our job of moving along the stages. This is just a period of more rapid change within the cycle.

       I've never understood why people believe something like being on reddit eliminates any chance that a user is 'woke'. This is the age of the internet. Wouldn't a smart, woke person utilize the internet, particularly a website where people go to find information, in order to spread truth? It seems like an incredibly practical tool for an awake person to be able to get truth and positive energy out for the world to awaken with.

       No, you're right. I hope to not sound pompous, but I have spent the past, eh, 8 months surfing this sub and posting heart-felt messages that come to me during meditation. Slowly dripping truth and awareness into the bloodstream of the internet. I'd like to link you one, as I sense you're on a similar frequency. No obligation to read it. Just thought you might enjoy. Be well.

       I shall.  While the title sounds a little corny, well, that's where its at.  Being jaded and cynical just closes off options, and its mentally lazy (being cynical or misanthropic) because you don't have to do any work for it; everyone sucks, and thats that. You don't have to take anyone at face value, you then don't have to open yourself to being vulnerable.  Maybe I was cynical in my twenties.  That was twenty years ago. I will give it a read.

       I am with you. I'm 26 and was a manifestation of cynicism prior to going through a spiritual awakening, an awakening of consciousness. It was my cynicism/narcissism, in fact, that drove me to truth. Life is so much more full, more enjoyable, more simple, than we often care to see. And all we have to do is let go.

       I've read a few paragraphs so far (the 'conspiracy of love' link ... and the selfless thing, its easier than people think.  It doesn't mean that daily things won't trip you up, but in the overall, for example, forgiveness is a fuckton lighter to carry than hate, and blame, etc.

       Yeah, man. That was a big realization for me in my own journey. It can literally feel like weight dropping from your shoulders. There's a freedom that quietly sits behind the noise of thought. I am someone who genuinely believes that humanity is going through an awakening of consciousness (when consciousness becomes conscious that it is conscious).

       Gotcha. The simplest answer is that I had to face the fact that I really was selfish, and in order to do that (and here's the answer) I had to be more honest than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
       In truth, all the ego really is is the maintenance of an elaborate lie. We wake up each morning, and put energy into continuing to be this 'little me' that we have come to
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       we are. That 'little me' is established over the course of many years within consciousness, as the brain attaches itself to certain memories/experiences as a means of creating a center within awareness. Once this 'me' is developed, thought then thinks on behalf of the illusion. So, it can be a very hard process to let go of the ego. You are literally coming to terms with the fact that every belief you have
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       held is fundamentally not true. Thought is inherently illusory. Literally nothing you've ever known is true, other than the fact that you are. When you really understand that -- not intellectually, but when your conscience literally
       <em>
        sees
       </em>
       that -- it's hard to look away. It's hard not to change after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In actual reality, the 'me' center is not real. And in order to face that, I had to be honest. I had to find the fierce grace to be able to sit in a silent room and ask myself, once and for all, "What's
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       true? What is this 'I'
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       ?"
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of practice, I read plenty of books and listened to hundreds of YouTube videos by Adyashanti, Alan Watts, and Eckhart Tolle. I also finally started listening to my intuition. But, yeah, most important thing is just finding the courage to be more honest than you've ever been in your life. Have the fierce grace within you to be willing to let go of your entire world -- you have to be willing to die -- and that's when true freedom presents itself.

       Interesting ideas. Reminds me of the Sufi notion, "the trick is to die before you die." But when we share this knowledge outwardly, is it not confirming another state of duality? (A bit of paradoxical irony here). Also, in terms of transcending the false ego, why is this a process at all? If there is movement towards becoming the non-self, to what realm did that illusion belong? The Hindu notion of 'the veil of Maya' comes to mind, manifesting as

       I try to keep the process as simple as possible. As an over-thinker, I spent countless hours trying to
       <em>
        understand
       </em>
       the truth, which only led me to near madness.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we outwardly express 'truth', it's inevitable that we find ourselves with some sort of paradox because the very action of attempting to put truth into words is impossible. The truth is the ineffable. That which cannot be explained, but only guided towards. Ultimately, only silence is the 'perfect' statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'process' of it all is, also, an illusion. The word process implies some-thing going from one state or another. Evolving or devolving. Movement. Yet, in truth, awakening is the "process" of
       <em>
        remembering
       </em>
       who you are. You are already the truth, but humanity
       <em>
        believes
       </em>
       it is not. There is no forwards or backwards, in actuality. It's completely stagnant. But within the realm of thought, it seems, experientially, to be an incredibly profound process. Yet, there is no process whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe all of these paradoxes stem from one simple realization. In actuality, all we ever are is this moment, right here, right now, at all times, everywhere and forever. Yet, as long as we believe in ego, thought inherently takes us away from the 'here'. Eventually, we believe so deeply in thought that we cannot take it anymore and go on a quest for truth. And once you awaken, you realize that all you've actually done is gone on a quest within your mind -- a complete illusion -- when, all along, you've just been right here. Nowhere else. Just here, now. The entire journey is illusory. And that's why people have been known to have sudden awakenings, without really 'trying'. It can happen suddenly, without any understanding or knowing. I hope I somewhat answered your reply.

       it shows their ignorance of the big picture.  It is one thing to wish things would fall in a fire sale.  It is another thing to consider the aftermath of the fire sale - namely people killing neighbors over potable water or semi edible food.

       Your post made me smile.  I have no agenda other than freethought and certainly no propagandist.  You think I am pushing the fire sale agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if talking about reality post upheaval looks like an attempt to bring anyone down.  It isn't.  It's an attempt to prepare for situations, even those that aren't attractive or comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think a world with all dead elite powers that be and their stooges, everything will be fun and good?  Those companies ran because someone ran them.  Food was harvested and packaged and shipped because of the infrastructure is set to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you'll be ok.  You can just run to walmart after shit hits the fan and stock up.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: disaster preparation isn't meant to be a negative.  preparation against humans being desperate is part of that.

       This is the age of the meme. Information gets out, people awaken, and we naturally laugh about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with you. I think it's great that children -- especially children -- are able to laugh at the truth. When you pursue the awakening of consciousness, there's a chance you might recognize that anxiety and laughter are two sides of the same phenomenon. We can choose to be fearful of the world's atrocities, but that does not help. So, we can then choose to laugh about the entire thing, all while taking it 'seriously'.
      </p>
      <p>
       We want laughter. It's contagious. We don't anxiety. That, too, is contagious.

       indeed, wise words.  The awakening is just part of the equation.  The being prepared is the next part.  To think any revolution of any system is smooth and comfortable is just not reality.

       You're totally fine, man. Forget guilt or shame, forget all those low frequency vibrations. This reality is currently developed in such a way that negativity is
       <em>
        oh so easy
       </em>
       to fall victim too. But, you are becoming aware of that. I mean, how amazing is that? You are looking at yourself with pure objectification, recognizing, "Damn. I'm negative today. That's fine, but let's change it." The majority of humanity doesn't possess that ability yet. So, instead of focusing on being in a downer mood, maybe focus your energy and intent on the fact that you are evolving. And, quite literally, there is nothing to fear whatsoever.

       Be well, man. Sending good vibes your way.

       I feel we are on the verge of something. The world needs to realise that the only way we can change the world for the better is to stop "armchair protesting" and actually do something to stand up for human rights. If humanity stuck together and said to the scum running/ruining the Earth "fuck you" and downed their tools and refuse to work and pay taxes, the 1% would not stand a chance!
      </p>
      <p>
       This needs to be a global effort of "fuck you" for it to work. But, we are socially not quite there yet.

       I do as well! But I think we've come at the crux of the spiral, a point in collective consciousness where we realize and embody a deeper understanding of who we are. They can try all they'd like, but we're illuminating and realizing certain aspects of our situation as humans - and once they're truly comprehended and experienced by a large percentage of people, the elite will never have the level of control they have now again. The pendulum is swinging back and they're grasping at straws while they watch it crumble.

       The majority of people are holding so tightly to their comfortable lives that they are not willing to admit the truth because deep down they realize that if they do they realize that once they do, their lives will never be the same. Their world is given to them, and they know it can be taken if they oppose the beast system. The awakened are few and even they will not take action until it's too late.

       By spreading awareness by being it. The only way the Hegelian Dialect can be dismantled is by individuals realizing their personal opinions matter. People take stances in the blank vs blank battle because they feel like they have to, or they think they're not capable of making a proper decision because of the large scope of the 'problem' being presented to them- which technically they don't. And it's when people reach those conclusions, that they in fact don't have all of the answers and no one should, then it begins to sink in how fabricated everything around us is by experiencing it from that new perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if the situation with MLK is what really made this mindset take off (Hegelian Dialect)? It was great that he sacrificed himself to free black people from segregation, but it created a pattern of thinking in our society that EVERY problem should be solved that way. Participation in our local communities and unions is where it's at!

       Seeding truth to dispel fiction is a good beginning, however, the evil ones sow fiction to dispel truth. The problem here is that, like western medicine, most of us treat the symptom, not the cause. In other words, we know there's something wrong, yet we never hit the core of the evil. Some of us do, but not collectively due to our differences regarding the minor details.

       God your delusional. Ill give you 2 examples of a person "awake" I know. He is in his forties, looks crazy, acts crazy and openly talks about every conspiracy, spiritual awakening, lizards etc..... He is a nice person sure, but he will be turning people off conspiracys not onto looking for the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another is perfectly sane, intelligent but spends all his time on reddit talking about conspiracys with people who already believe in conspiracys.

      <p>
       2 common truthers, both useless at spreading information. We are not winning a war, there is just a few more people "Awake" because we have the internet and can reach abit further to people who otherwise wouldn't know anything about it. The banks are still strong, the 2 party system is still strong, the class system is still strong, Justice for the rich and injustice for the poor still strong, wealth gap stronger than ever, far-right tards believing the wealth gap is benefical for everyone stronger than ever, people believing we actually live in both a democracy and a civilization still strong.

       Then get out on the street and encourage them, go pass out information leaflets through doors, stand in towns and cities and tell people who will listen, protest, picket, camp infront of the white house, do something lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to sit on reddit and discuss existing conspiracys with other conpiracists who are already convinced and believe in conspiracys thats fine, but don't pretend your actually making a difference because its just 'bird in a cage' stuff.

       In the meantime, why do most of the largest corporations and businesses (owned by the elite who we already suspect of luciferianism) have logos that are occult related?  Saturns wings, saturns cube/hexagram, baphomets cross, nero's cross, sun worship symbols, Vesica piscis etc among others?

       It's true and I was just as bad as everyone here on Reddit at one time. the true conspiracy is were in a world of deception because of Lucifer and most of the conspiracies seen here are products of this.

       Why I don't need to? If there were mass riots and shit I would join in just because it beats day to day living and it would be exciting atleast. But as for starting these protests or riots, waking people up etc... Not really that interested and the future safety of this world is pretty irrelevant to me, Ill be dead.

       Im 25, not fussed if my current family die, a select few of them dying would give me a chuckle for the day. I have no kids, am anti-kids and when I die that will be the end of me and my bloodline. So no the future is worthless to me.

       Im personally not that awed by the world or the people in it. I think we are more expendable as a species then we like to admit. Of course Im one person with a view, doesn't make me right BUT we are talking about me so it obviously matters in this case.

       Crazy, simple, yet loving thought...

       If the majority op people in this world believe that TPTB have abolutely no power and Ferry's are real, there wil be Ferry's and no PTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Positive thougths bring positive change, we just need the majority to join the positive side.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the fear mongering, revengefull and selfish thoughts only will bring negative changes and can make this a world of misery even worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you look carefully and look past all the BS and disinformation you can see that the world around us is changing figurary as wel, in my opinion, literary.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, as i can see for myself, most of these changes are positive, and while we have a long way to go, we are heading in the right direction.
My only concern is the feeling that we are running out of time fast, but i love to think it will all end well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, it is an exciting time to be alive, and i find it a privilage to be able to see it all unfold and witness the truth starting to emerge from the gigantic pile of lies and BS we have been teached and told.

       Choosing to see all the negative is a choice. It's like news. If it's bleeds it leads. You don't hear about the 99% of people having a good day. You hear about the hate and fear of the 1%  There is love out there you just need to look with your heart.

       I agree. I've slowly moved to other subreddits. I still come by every so often and see a post I like but yes there is a lot of misery here. I use it mostly to stay updated with current events as crazy as it sounds.

       What subs have you been looking at? I've been following some that have broke away from here to look into issues further (pedogate, Antarctica). But I love this place and yeah I use here to keep up with current events too which is crazy! I can't keep away, like watching a car pile up, can't keep my eyes away!

       Yea me too. Latest craze involve the rc benzos like etizolam, clonazolam, and diclazepam. Been messing around with phenibut lately too. I've smoked weed for the last 15 years of my life everyday and just 4 days ago decided to take a break. I honestly don't miss it considering I hate how unmotivated I always am and the last few days have been uber productive. I've tried so many drugs I couldn't count. Got hooked on the synthetic cannabinoid a few years back and went completely bonkers when I stopped. 17 days in the psych ward.

       Regularly say a prayer for the ones that control the world, that love may enter their hearts. The more people who do this, the sooner it will happen. They are not our enemies, they are lost and merely need the love that they so clearly lack so that they may awaken themselves. Once they do, this can stop being a battle of "good vs evil" and become the one it really is: Love vs fear.

       Research Edgar Cayce. I am not religious. I read the Torah, New Testament, Quran, follow the path of Buddhism as best as I can (not a religion), and study things from The Holographic Universe to The Journey Within, The Emerald Tablets of Thoth, Graham Hancock's work and more.

       Wtf suicide cult. Leave me out of your blissful insanity of awesome global destruction.
Your evil NWO is nothing more than a choice of letting your nieghbors borrow the lawn mower instead of nuking them.....this is the  already the best equivalent of "humanity joining hands" post world war ....if you dont beleive me, try buying a mango, or a  refrigerator or xbox   after your evil NWO collapses

       That person is for globalization and thinks those commodities are only possible with it. As for the cult thing, I think it displays how narrow their mind is, in order to believe in this type of situation you're describing you have to be a part of an inclusive group? I could be wrong, but that's what I got from it.

       Numbered Days - Killswitch Engage
      </p>
      <p>
       The Time Approaches
Fall!
This is the voice of the Voiceless
We have learned about making choices
Not of persecution or dilution
We have severed the solution
To build our foundation on natural elements to preserve life
We will rise and battle on
Chanting inspiration for the righteous
Dislocation from the social order
Kingdoms will rise to power
But kingdoms fall to dust
To ashes of the dead
Will be a sign
The time approaches
Arms raised (raised)
Eyes gazed (gazed)
Tongues of fire whisper
This life (life)
Will soon (soon)
Slip away!
Babylon you will fall
Your days are numbered
Who will hear your cries as you fall

       It's not going to just come or be given. A lot of work, and dark times would happen, they have drones, satellites, nukes, bio poison, cyborg cats, super computers, algorithms , and selfish evil intentions for on their self betterment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever " they " wanted to, all opposition could be stomped out.  We still have relatively free passage online and in our everyday lives. However , the battle is long and constant and covert , and there's only so many "awakened" compared to the blind masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everything is a conspiracy theory, but the world is fucked up, and we follow all these old orders and traditions and false tales of who we are, when in reality we have the capabilities to become a highly effective and efficient species using our technological and manufacturing strength to safely and effectively be stewards of life on our world. We should aim to be crusaders of life , starting to spread and seed life in other places in the galaxy and universe(if it isn't already out there).
      </p>
      <p>
       Our human goal should be to protect and spread life in the universe and develop as much as we can safely. Until an alien or para dimensional space time traveling entity shows up and publicly and intelligently presents itself, we should assume we are the first life in the universe and possibly still the only . Maybe we were first, and we are here to spread it. Humanity needs a goal, not just to get rich, act happy and fulfilled and then die.

       Love you for doing this.  I actually haven't seen this sub in a worse state since we all bugged out after Assange went into hiding. It was picked up by trolls for a solid two months, then icann.. ever since we've been fending off attack after attack. Seeing this make the front has undoubtedly done good for moral.

       i don't know maybe this will get downvoted but i feel that even the "shills" whoever they are are our brothers and sisters from a higher perspective, otherwise its again an us vs. them.. everything is needed, even the "bad", without it there's no good. and love is the thing that transcends all this good vs. evil. this is not just a believe of mine, i can feel this love awakening inside myself and with that some weird abilities and ways of perceiving the world that might get labelled as paranormal..
      </p>
      <p>
       i am one of the "younger generation", and from many young people i know i have discovered in unthought of ways when i put my judgement aside (with that i mean people that might get labelled as "sheep" in this sub) that they feel this love too in their own way, this urge to help others and bring love into their lives (not just in a romantic way..)

       Exactly, its fine to have positive thoughts, but it is naive to think people will just come together after the NWO is removed, I don't even know how that will happen. In case people have forgotten, there is a huge divide (religion,politics,race,wealth) at present, and until people actually look past these things and view each other as equals, the pressure will keep adding up.

       Each and everyone of us has a means of sharing what has helped them along their journey and what helps them grow as beings. I also try to do my part here on Reddit and through my blog (link for the curious -
       <a href="http://www.embraceyourexperience.com">
        www.embraceyourexperience.com
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Help yourself first, find your own path to peace, then help others along the path. Aiding others will also help you beyond measure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love, peace and joy will prevail.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you come in touch with them? Stop seeking and simply be. Just for a moment let go of the past and future, let go of your concepts, of all that you are holding onto that is causing you pain and suffering. If and when you are ready, even the idea of yourself, of who you are (a thus find your deeper self, beyond the surface).
      </p>
      <p>
       Let go of everything and in the still silence the deepest beauty of the Cosmos shall be revealed to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then share it and spread it out towards the world.

       In other words, embrace resignation? One cannot resign short of death, for the very essence of life is struggle. Whether it be trees fighting for sun or animals fighting for another day, all life is this way. Thinking you can "just exist" is a luxury only the very top of the food chain can entertain. Existing means something must perish in exchange for your life.
      </p>

       This is the great meat grinder known as Earth. Tell me, how loved does the chicken feel, as its slaughtered? The pig? Do you think rice or broccoli feel comprehensible pain? They are alive are they not?
      </p>
      <p>
       To truly accept life, and to "drop all pain" as you say, is to fully embrace your nature as a killer. Is this what you mean?

       Whatever you can embrace you can transcend. You embrace resignation, you embrace your nature as a killer, you embrace the struggle of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe what I say, simply try it out, test it in your own experience. Whatever you resist in your life has its control over you, whatever you embrace and allow to be as it is loses its power over you, it loses its grip and you are free from the struggle, free from the pain, free from the suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       A decade of meditative practices has taught me that embracing something, allowing it to exist, accepting it, is far from being resigned to your fate. It is not resignation. Embracing resignation is a completely different process than resignation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look within and check what your experience is during resignation. If you observe yourself closely you will see it is a resistance to life itself. It is a resistance to action. Embracing life and your experience does not mean inaction, it does not mean passivity. It means a full life, a life lived in tune with the whole Cosmos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, life is full of suffering, but the only way to alleviate that suffering is to embrace it and transcend it within yourself and then help other beings do the same. Just existing does not mean looking idly as the rest of creation suffers. It means coming in tune with your own intuition and using it to guide you to help yourself and help others that need it.

       Not the same way.

       You will likely die of old age, an accident, or disease. You will not likely be killed for food.

       Killing each other for food is the cycle of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Animals kill other animals to survive, animals eat plants... these things seem horrible from a human perspective, but in reality this is simply the game of life. There are predators, there is prey, there are hunters and the hunted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans however do this very differently and in a very cruel manner. The way we treat other beings on this planet, the way we treat nature, the way we treat animals, is nothing short of atrocious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself do not support the killing of any beings for food. I'm vegan, so I don't consume any animals products, as I love animals way too much to see them suffer in any way. I do have to eat something to survive, thus I live on a plant based diet (even though you could say that plants are beings too and may feel pain as well in their own way).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even kill insects, because I feel like I don't have the right to take away another being's life without a good reason (such as that being attempting to harm me in some way, thus acting in self-defence).

       Agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem like a good dude, so I won't belabor the point, and you have also thought a lot about this, to your credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm trying to say is that the game isn't right. Just because something is a certain way, doesn't mean it's right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding cruelty, predator animals kill much more cruely than human factory farms do, I would wager. I can't imagine being eaten alive is more "humane" than being killed within seconds. Even a deer shot by a hunter seems preferable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can accept that we are human, but I am unable to accept the injustice of existence.

       I agree that the game isn't right. There are plenty of injustices in our existence and on this planet we live on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like the only way to actually change these injustices and improve them is to look clearly into them and embrace them as they are. Once embraced, the fog of the pain is lifted and we can see more clearly and know how to act to make our existence a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The macrocosm is a reflection of the microcosm and also follows the same rules. As I embrace my pain it dissolves and I gain a deeper understanding of it and the reasons it was there in the first place, as well as a deeper understanding of myself. If any action is needed to improve the physical manifestations of the pain, I will know what it is and take it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus one's microcosm grows towards peace and through that it reaches into the macrocosm, creating a more just and beautiful existence for us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the suffering of animals - the cruelty in factory farming is not in the killing of the animal, it is in the atrocious way the animals are treated and the horrific conditions they live in up to the point of death.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you only take death into account then it may be true that an animal in the wild suffers more. But the truth is that death is only a small fraction of the suffering experienced by animals in factory farms. If you feel so inclined you can look into it, but it is a difficult thing to stomach. Modern factory farms are akin to concentration camps.

       I just want life to be worth living instead of just waiting to die. My biggest fear is that it's psychologically too late for me and I'm gonna get filtered out by this awakening because of how cynical and misanthropic I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly feel like this great awakening is just another ruse, the forerunner to a one-world fundamentalist religion combined from all the others, as part of Project Bluebeam using Maitreya to decieve all the religious followers. This is why I'm trying to drive myself away from both organized religion and New Age shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want this world to be worth living in, otherwise it genuinely isn't worth the struggle for me.

       Yep, this is either a karma whore, deliberate disinfo or a pretty delusional mindset.  I vote disinfo.  In this way, they are reinforcing a desired notion to think something good is about to happen, so why protest or do anything to upset the apple cart?  What is

       What are you talking about? People are passive as hell and just frogs slowing boiling to death. There's a constant state of confusion on this sub Reddit because the elite are masters at division. theres right wing and left wing conspiracy theorists. Plus this is the internet. You're not some kind of warrior fighting the good fight. You're passively sitting around upvoting shit. You're right were they want you.

       The NWO will be defeated by Jesus Christ as He returns to defeat the real nwo instigator, the the beast, the dragon and the Antichrist (Revelations 13).... but it will get much worse before it gets better.

       Should read up on biblical end times prophecies.  Some are coming together these past few years--
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         one world gov't,
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         no cash allowed to buy or sell--must have # of the beast 666 --these are happening right. now.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Still to begin to surface-- the introduction of a charismatic, seductive leader that deceives and draws worldwide following-- the antichrist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jewish temple to be rebuilt in Jerusalem since the antichrist will seek and be able to sit there-- an event described in revelation as the Abomination that causes desolation. There are plans to rebuild that are very close to being implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
       A war that brings many to converge at Armageddon-- coming from the North (China, Russia?) culminating in the end of life on earth, therefore stopped by God. And Satan bound for a thousand years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, God will have a Kingdom devoid of evil, but it comes through faith in the Lamb of God who was slain for the sinners of the world (all men).  Do not be caught without Him, if you want to live.

       Very good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you probably know, they are being used by Satan, gladly apparently, to bring about this satanic fantasy for him. It was really shocking and sobering for this biblical reality to just come out of the secrecy it's been operating under, in all it's simplistic Satan vs God story that humanity has dismissed for so long.

       Interesting ideas. Reminds me of the Sufi notion, "the trick is to die before you die." But when we share this knowledge outwardly, is it not confirming another state of duality? (A bit of paradoxical irony here). Also, in terms of transcending the false ego, why is this a process at all? If there is movement towards becoming the non-self, to what realm did that illusion belong? The Hindu notion of 'the veil of Maya' comes to mind, manifesting as

       Yep, this is either a karma whore, deliberate disinfo or a pretty delusional mindset.  I vote disinfo.  In this way, they are reinforcing a desired notion to think something good is about to happen, so why protest or do anything to upset the apple cart?  What is

       Animals kill other animals to survive, animals eat plants... these things seem horrible from a human perspective, but in reality this is simply the game of life. There are predators, there is prey, there are hunters and the hunted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans however do this very differently and in a very cruel manner. The way we treat other beings on this planet, the way we treat nature, the way we treat animals, is nothing short of atrocious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself do not support the killing of any beings for food. I'm vegan, so I don't consume any animals products, as I love animals way too much to see them suffer in any way. I do have to eat something to survive, thus I live on a plant based diet (even though you could say that plants are beings too and may feel pain as well in their own way).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even kill insects, because I feel like I don't have the right to take away another being's life without a good reason (such as that being attempting to harm me in some way, thus acting in self-defence).

       I agree that the game isn't right. There are plenty of injustices in our existence and on this planet we live on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like the only way to actually change these injustices and improve them is to look clearly into them and embrace them as they are. Once embraced, the fog of the pain is lifted and we can see more clearly and know how to act to make our existence a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The macrocosm is a reflection of the microcosm and also follows the same rules. As I embrace my pain it dissolves and I gain a deeper understanding of it and the reasons it was there in the first place, as well as a deeper understanding of myself. If any action is needed to improve the physical manifestations of the pain, I will know what it is and take it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus one's microcosm grows towards peace and through that it reaches into the macrocosm, creating a more just and beautiful existence for us all.

       Regarding the suffering of animals - the cruelty in factory farming is not in the killing of the animal, it is in the atrocious way the animals are treated and the horrific conditions they live in up to the point of death.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you only take death into account then it may be true that an animal in the wild suffers more. But the truth is that death is only a small fraction of the suffering experienced by animals in factory farms. If you feel so inclined you can look into it, but it is a difficult thing to stomach. Modern factory farms are akin to concentration camps.

       I was, then whether I understood your comment or not, I commented what came to my mind. Ignore it if you will. I find it amusing my comment got voted up and down back and forth as if I said something controversial. Maybe I'm just buzzed, or maybe some people either hate out of the box thinking or just don't get it. So it goes...

       My apologies, thank you for the clarification. I didn't mean to come off as dismissive, but confused.
