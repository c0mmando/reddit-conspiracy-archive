        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s a working theory, not wholly original, yet a mutt of many different ideologies. </p>

<p>Let me preface and say that I support true Abrahamic Judaism, but not the inverse mockery that is the Synagogue of Satan.</p>

<p>These deceivers (who threw on a faux Jewish coat long ago) have begun the final play for the ultimate goal in their long con.  All of Palestine, and the Temple Mount.</p>

<p>Even freemasons and evangelicals will tell you that much of their endgame is a complete 3rd restoration of Solomon&#39;s temple.  What odds would you put on the parallel agendas of these modern titans of power and influence?</p>

<p>The current chaos we see is specifically ordered so these power brokers can fulfill their goals in plain sight of the whole world.</p>

<p>Couple that with spiritual Jews still looking for a messiah, millions of evangelical Christians looking for the second coming of their own Messiah, and both hoping they&#39;ll accept the others beliefs and live in harmony...</p>

<p>That is a powder keg for some apocalyptic scenarios.</p>

<p>In short, it could shape up that masons and charismaniacs build a house for the spirit of the devil, and his khazarian children fill it with him.  </p>

All the other stuff that is supposed to go along with the rebuilt temple has been ready for years by the temple institute. They are waiting on a perfect red Heffernan to be born without spot or blemish, they thought they had found one a few years ago but it had one black hair so it didn&#39;t qualify. When that happens the time will be very close. That is the last thing that needs to happen before the antichrist can be revealed to the world, biblically speaking at least</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2001, the year they marked the beginning of the New World Order, they had their current rendition of Solomon&#39;s temple destroyed. Yes, the WTC, I believe, was, at least a tribute to the old king. I mean, WTC 7 was known as the Solomon Brothers building, it had a pair of &quot;twin pillars&quot; in front of it. Whether this was simply symbolic or this was their honest rendition of the temple, I have no clue. I think it was symbolic as a way to show the &quot;old temple&quot; was being destoryed to usher in the new age as well as the new temple. </p>

<p>Freemason here. King Solomon&#39;s Temple features prominently in our allegorical lessons, but to suggest that we have some sort of goal of physically rebuilding the Temple is way off the mark.</p>

<p>The whole point of our allegory is that &quot;operative Masonry&quot; (i.e. actual building in stone) is only a metaphor. If a Mason takes away from the initiation that he should go start building a physical structure, then he didn&#39;t learn anything that we tried to teach.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the opposite direction from the one that Freemasonry is about. We used the operative to symbolically and allegorically get at the speculative.</p>

<p>This phrase doesn&#39;t really mean anything. It&#39;s like asking, &quot;what is the PhD level up to?&quot;</p>

<p>Problems that exist around your question:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 33rd degree is a part of only one group within Freemasonry, the Scottish Rite.</li>
<li>The 33rd isn&#39;t a rank or &quot;level&quot;, it&#39;s an honor. In the same way that a Medal of Honor recipient doesn&#39;t gain rank by getting that honor, so too Freemasons who receive the 33rd are just Freemasons, and it doesn&#39;t convey some sort of rank.</li>
<li>There are many other similar honors within Freemasonry.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what is it that you <em>actually</em> wanted to know?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I want to know if masons have nefarious goals other than what is publically presented.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to say, &quot;no,&quot; but the problem with that is that some people think that promoting reason <em>is nefarious</em>, so I&#39;ll just say this: Freemasonry isn&#39;t one thing. In the Southern US, there are Grand Lodges that push a very Southern view of what Freemasonry is, and that can be kind of distasteful to people like me. There are places like Sweden where Freemasonry is very closely attached to Christianity. There are places like France where Freemasonry is fractured into dozens of conflicting traditions, some of which are political and anti-Catholic, and some of which are just like the Masonry I&#39;m a part of.</p>

<p>But in general, and I think on balance, Freemasonry is a politically and religiously neutral and positive influence and does accomplish the stated goal of making good men better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also want to know why there seems to be so much Jewish inspired allegorical lessons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, those are Christian and Muslim allegories too... It&#39;s just the Old Testament. The specifically Christian allegories are mostly contained in the Knights Templar, a group unrelated to the historical knights of the same name, who are specifically for Christian Freemasons.</p>
