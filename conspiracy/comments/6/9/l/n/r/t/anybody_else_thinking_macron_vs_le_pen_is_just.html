<p>Look no further than rumblings across this sub of &quot;Gabbard 2020&quot;. Yet the Tulsi fans conveniently ignore her CFR membership, or try and justify it the same way Trump fans do with his equally suspect groups -</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your expectations have dropped from constant exposure to frauds. There&#39;s no reason for any honest politician to be a member of the CFR, nor is these are any reason for the President of the United States to sign an executive order to bring the power to create currency back to the Federal Government. Or use the $54Billion he raised the military budget by, and create a generation of debt free students. What would be more valuable to the country? External conquest, or the collective increase of the nations potential?</p>

<p>But Trump follows the model of oligarchy to a T. &quot;Send the plebs to war,  not School!&quot;
&quot;Cabinet filled with Goldman!&quot;</p>

<p>Trump has been backed by Rothschilds his entire  business career and supported by their vassals now he&#39;s in politics. Clearly not legit at this point.</p>

<p>Tulsi Gabbard is yet another progeny from the CFR, of Obama vein, being primed to pick up what Trump drops off in 2020.. The CFR is the &quot;establishment&quot; embodied. Left, right... Democrat, republican.. they run both sides of the political spectrum to ensure the progress you think is coming, never arrives with any real value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obamas entire platform to presidency was built in criticising Bush&#39;s foreign policy. Foreign policy  enacted by Cheney, Rice, Rumsfield and Bushs CFR filled cabinet. Obamas mentor and foreign policy advisor, Zbignew Brzezinski is a CFR veteran. In the first part of the 1970s, in the role of National Security Adviser, he was instrumental in convicting Carter to provide CIA support to create the Islamic fighting force that defeated the Soviets in Afghanistan - Mujahideen. Led by en enigmatic young &quot;freedom fighter&quot; Osama Bin Laden.</p>

<p>As we know, that force morphed into Al Qaeda, and most recently IsIS.
Giving Obama justification to conduct his endless wars across the Middle East.</p>

<p>So you see how apparently opposing actors, work for the same goals, despite the illusion of competition.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s Gabbard on <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zE3jbbhB0eA">CNN with Jake Tapper</a>. You laud her for the inconsequential truths she imparts, will you condemn her for the damaging lies also?
Gabbard believes and actively perpetuates the CIA/CFR narrative that Osama Bin Laden was the mastermind behind 9/11.
Her CFR colleagues had nothing to do with it of course. How does a Congresswoman with wherewithal to understand the Syria lie, still believe the easily debunked official version? Well maybe because she doesn&#39;t, and is feeding you bs half mixed with truths to appear credible, in the run up to a presidential bid?</p>

<p>Oh and CNN&#39;a Jake Tapper? <a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/membership/roster.html?letter=t">Also a member </a>.</p>

<p>See how laughable it is? The CFR having a conversation with itself about the propaganda it&#39;s created. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and the objective reality is trump is guilty of many things he constantly bashed obama for like golfing, wasting tax dollars (secret service has to pay 36 gs for a golf cart at his club, all the millions wasted housing them in trump tower).  Obama didnt salute someone once when he was getting on a plane and trump and friends blasted him for weeks about it but trump had to be reminded to fuckinh put his band over his heart for the national anthem.  His new healthcare bill is LITERALLY obama care but now theyre not forced to cover pre existing conditions.  Its a fuckin joke to think hes anything besides another globalist fuck.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For those unacquainted with the nearly 100 year old Council on Foreign Relations centered in New York City, it has provided virtually all our Secretaries of State, UN ambassadors, ambassadors to Russia and China and at least a third of all cabinet members of all presidents, whether Democrat or Republican, since its inception in 1921. The establishment press is largely their press. The CFR has never denied this influence and, in fact, boast of it.</p>

<p>Longtime CFR chairman, and now chairman emeritus of the organization, David Rockefeller, in his 2002 book, Memoirs, admitted. “For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum… attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a of a secret cabal working against the best interest of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure—one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is essential, if you&#39;re to govern what Muslims are and aren&#39;t allowed to do, to never forget that English law is above it and make that your starting point.  It should silence any arguments (from Muslims).  Anything they do, regardless of belief, is subject to it.   The neurotic whining about &#39;Islamification&#39; and Sharia law from the right is just scare mongering for their agenda.  It&#39;s embarassing. Nobody wants to convert to Islam and we&#39;re all quite secure in our Englishness thanks.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is from Russia&#39;s perspective; they seek the destabilization of the west through the cultivation of compromised political assets, elevated to positions of authority, and then pressured into adopting anti-western policies, creating internal division, and ultimately being destroyed once exposed.

<p>Anyone championing Putin as an anti-Globalist folk hero of some sort is a myopic fool - and naive beyond measure, besides. Putin is just another globalist, only he is looking to become The Globalist by destroying the power structure of the Western world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because &quot;Globalists&quot; is not a <em>team</em>. Globalist is a label that has some meaning in the realm of geopolitics - a label that has been appropriated and repurposed for political reasons. It is now trotted out and used as if to describe as coherent unit, one team of people who are united in purpose and methods. It isn&#39;t so, though. Beyond that, even the definition of &quot;globalist&quot; is so murky it has become basically nothing more than a slur to many - which was likely the intention. To take a word and make it both meaningless and offensive - yet at the core of it, a globalist is essentially a person with ambitions that affect the world stage and the power to effect that same stage.</p>

<p>So there <em>are</em> many globalists, but there is much drama among them, and many factions and players. Even among the factions that attempt to work in concert, in-fighting abounds. Outside actors oppose them in turn, etc. The animosity between Soros and Putin is a good example - it has nothing to do with the ruble, which crashed due to sanctions and oil prices/OPEC. Do you believe Putin opposes Soros from some moral high ground? No, Putin sees a threat to his own ambitions - domestically, sure, but mostly on the global stage and primarily in Eastern Europe - and so he acts against that threat. He can call Soros a globalist terrorist or whatever he likes as a pretense and as part of his attack, but it is a conflict and his words are part of that conflict. Just as Putin&#39;s attempts to undermine the west are part of his globalist agenda. Yet, they&#39;re celebrated by those who can only see things diametrically; as good versus evil. Putin opposes the <em>globalists</em> they&#39;ve long reviled (and who his agents have encouraged them to revile) ergo he <em>must</em> be good. To many that is the only possibility; the idea that there is another actor out there both attacking the people they consider enemies while also aiming to undermine their own nations and wealth doesn&#39;t enter into the equation. It simply isn&#39;t a possibility.</p>

<p>So, why do they rail against Putin? Because he is actively attempting to undermine them, NATO, the EU, etc. He is a major foe of theirs in the geopolitical realm, and by extension of their allies. They are fighting back. Is that shocking? Why does Putin rail against Soros, why do the known - and I mean 100% indisputable, admitted - Russian propaganda outlets target the people they do? Because they are Putin&#39;s geopolitical foes... ones he cannot simply silence.</p>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s also just coincidental that globalists support and implement the same agenda: open borders, mass immigration, multiculturalism, special protection for islam, demonization of Western values and culture and a convenient endless war on terrorism...but globalists aren&#39;t the same team?!

<p>So I think Macron is a Rothschild shill and Le Pen
a zionist shill of some kind.
Why would you want authoritarian Le Pen when
Hamon has almost the same economics (but better)
and WAAAY less authoritarianism?</p>

<p>This is how you know it&#39;s a SCAM.
It&#39;s Trump V Clinton all over again, just a little different 
in the positioning of the candidates on the political spectrum.</p>

<p>Hamon seems decent but I don&#39;t know how much
integrity he has.
Don&#39;t know if Melenchon is too far left or if he&#39;s at the sweet spot
but what I can tell is, the frontrunners Le Pen and Macron
are shills.
The French are screwed if they vote based on
polls and corporate media BS.</p>

<p>Polls are meant to influence public opinion, not measure it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have only a very limited understanding, but from what I do know of it - yes, its an apt comparison.  </p>

<p>I read an article in a German newspaper, and what I gathered from it is that if Le Pen is elected it will spell economic doom for the Euro.  I&#39;m just thinking off the cuff here - but is it possible that socialism (i.e., a reduction in wealth inequality) is not possible at this point, because Captitalism requires constant growth, which is unsustainable, so eventually you reach the point where the system has to be propped up, and if you don&#39;t prop it up anymore it will collapse.   </p>

<p>Anyone actually knowledgable about economics can tell me if this is off base or not?</p>
