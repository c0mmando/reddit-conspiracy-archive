    <div class="md"><p>I actually would be more curious if its possible to pick up sound through speakers. Iv manualy disconnected and removed both mic and camrea from my laptop. Mostly do it because of the whole Bestbuy fiasco years ago. In theroy speakers should be able to pick up sound. Have you ever reversed the settings on your headset and mic? where sound was comming from the mic portion and it was picking up threw the headphones? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount and type of info you get from each is different.  A laptop mic and camera can let people know if you&#39;re away from your house and often gives a nice wide angle view of the room.  This can be used to facilitate break ins, as well as shoot compromising video.  </p>

<p>A cellphone camera is more than likely in your pocket and would give less info through the camera than through the satellite connection or the mic.  Listening in, or seeing where someone is, are both much more interesting than the contents of their pocket viewed in the dark.  They are also both less valuable if you&#39;re a nobody where as someone will find value in candid videos regardless of the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have an android phone with google services on it, everything you say is being recorded. Your micrphone is constantly on and uses google&#39;s text-to-speech software to catalog a list of keywords you say often. They send this to google&#39;s data server&#39;s, google uses it for ads mostly but intelligence agencies intercept and back up all of it. It&#39;s almost impossible to notice any increase in bandwidth usage, since an hour long conversation would be a .txt file half the size of the html for YouTube&#39;s home page. Google has patents for all of this which anyone can see with a simple search. Facebook uses the same thing, but with your messages.</p>

<p>You can even try it yourself. Over the course of the next few days randomly say the name of a certain item you dont usually talk about, you will notice ads start to pop-up for that item. Welcome to the future of AI</p>
