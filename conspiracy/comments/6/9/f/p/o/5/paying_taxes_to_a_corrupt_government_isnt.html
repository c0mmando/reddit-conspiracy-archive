       Found this on facebook:
      </p>
      <p>
       Paying taxes to a corrupt government isn't patriotic, it is slavery. Let's quickly break it down shall we? You work and make money right? We all do. And we all have to pay taxes, but how bad is it really? Well, you pay 20-40% of whatever money you don't spend to the government. Whatever you do spend, that also pays taxes as you can plainly see on your receipt. The company that sold you those items got taxed on the sale of the items, on the purchase of the items, on the import of the items and any profit they have left over, same thing. Then the company that made the product gets taxed and who ever made the raw materials, yep, they get taxed too. The seemingly never ending tax layers harvest billions of dollars per year and of which about 50%+ goes on military spending, aka bombs, bullets and occupying foreign land to expand the corrupt empire unlawfully. Now here's the fun part. If you don't have enough money to pay your taxes, they will take your assets, car, house, etc.. or put you in jail... leaving you with no way to make more money to pay the tax. They do this not because this is mathematically sensible, but because they are making an example out of you so that others see what happens if you don't pay up. We live in constant fear of our over-lords and obey them out of fear of imprisonment or losing our assets. When we blindly obey we give them their power. They have ZERO power over you and I if we are self-sustainable. The reason they can justify so much tax is because YOU are nearly 100% reliant on their shitty little system that was designed to create dependency. Can't you see it yet? We need to take back our personal power by getting off-grid and self-sustainable. Then what? How can their empire stand when we don't need them and don't fund them? There need not be a violent revolution. We are intelligent now. We are awake now. And only what WE allow will continue.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I stumbled across this on facebook. The poster recommends getting off the grid but that's not convenient enough for a lot of people. My recommendation would be switching to a new economic system called sacred economics. See explanation here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sacred economics makes all progress profitable so we could easily take care of our own country without depending on our government. Basically, we choose our own path in work. If we want to rebuild the infrastructure, we can do so right away without having to wait on job openings or money to do it. We can do choose any job we want since everything is profitable (ie helping homeless find housing, helping prisoners, beautifying our freeways with art, ect..) and by choosing our own passion, the work will be done well which is profitable in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if we did decide to stop paying taxes, all that money we save would boost the economy but eventually we would probably have to take care of our own social needs (cleaning the streets, policing, DMV, ect..).
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also, a good replacement for money would be "proof of work cards". This would be a credit card type system that shows the cashier that you are working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week or whatever we agree upon.

       I would be curious where the person that originally posted this to FB is from, because their understanding of taxes work on the business side is completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the assumptions they make about taxes are completely inaccurate, I will agree that individual income taxes do amount to slavery.

       I would agree with that except that no one is telling taxpayers to wait until the last minute to do their taxes. In fact, the government itself specifically tells everyone every year to not wait until the last minute and to get them done early. So I can't say I follow the logic.

       I would argue that income taxes are only really slavery when you're taxing barter.  Currency isn't really a physical thing, it's a number.  A promise made by the government, that came with conditions.  The physical representation, bills and coins, aren't even yours to deface.  The government just lends them out to use as currency coupons.

       Technically you are correct. The currency itself belongs to the government. But they're not taxing the currency. Currency represents a debt that is owed to you for time/labor/skill that you traded and have yet to be reimbursed for.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the government takes their cut before you see a single dime, they are stealing your time/labor/skill.

       Maybe.  But if you're not getting paid in labor bonds from your employer, then you don't really have the grounds to claim slavery, since you're using government services simply by accepting currency-based payment

       It's a debt based currency. That's all that happens is the transfer of debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your employer receives something from you therefore they are in debt to you. They settle the debt by giving you currency. You redeem your debt by paying your mortgage, the plumber, buying groceries, etc. Just like you did for the employer, those entities gave you something but did not receive anything from you in return, except evidence of a debt that is owed - the currency. So to redeem the debt you owe to them, they in turn transfer it to someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currency is a mechanism that facilitates the trade of labor/skill/time.

       The difference between the employee's debt to you and the governments debt to the initial person who got the currency is that the governments debt was only offered conditionally to begin with.

       You're saying you should be able to transfer that agreement without transferring the obligations associated with it.

       Use the system thats in our place to our advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system is a tool.  Just take it back from the corporate elite.  Imagine what you could do with the current system in the peoples' power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not cut any current spending... Cut taxes to 0%, pay healthcare for everyone, yearly stipend for every american citizen (works in alaska).  With these 3 things alone, you could then be free to pursue your dreams and do what you wanted to do with your life and not be a slave

       That would be awesome. I mean, I understand the basic principles, I am just not so familiar with this that it is obvious to me why one is better than another, or more accurately what makes this such a vastly superior banking system.

       Governments aren't broke. They have hundreds of billions in assets. They just hide those assets in another set of accounting books. The comprehensive annual fiscal reports prove this. Governments don't include real estate or stocks owned in their regular reports. They only include taxes coming in and payments out. It is an illusion Thst they are broke. If we did this, we would be in jail for fraud and tax evasion. Google cafr account government fraud.

       I love the idea of sacred economics, but I'm unclear how we can shift to that type of economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, in that video the idea of factoring in hidden external costs to purchase prices is brought up. Good idea in theory; if executed well it would go a long way towards aligning our system with reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, under our current system we have nothing that can do this except for more taxes, which puts us right back at square one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it would be different if the government didn't spend our money on so many ridiculous things, but as it stands now I think such a tax would just be more money to the MIC in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a totally new way of thinking about society that doesn't involve a pathetic, corrupt, war-mongering government bureaucracy. Unfortunately it seems that TPTB have locked that one down by choosing our choice of representatives.

       We're serfs, with the "priviledge" to work for the system, with freedom to come and go and to attempt to benefit from the system as best you can. Evade taxes and then you will find out what slavery is: as a literal slave in the prison system with no freedom, and working for literal slave labor. Pay taxes, keep your freedom, just do your best to hold the government accountable.

       To a,certain extent that it is beneficial to society, regulation is good. A fine balance is needed though. Do I believe regulators should be fining ma and pa companies $10,000 for a few misunderstood errors? Nope. That's disgusting. They should instead inspect and work with the owner to meet regulations and then depart. Those monster fines aren't helping the middle class. They are hands down fucking us over.

       You mean like big pharma raising pill prices to a $1000 a pill just to make insane profits while literally killing off the people who can't afford it? Those mother fuckers need to be prosecuted for treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freedom is great until it hurts someone. What big pharma is doing here is taking freedom too far. Most big corps are taking freedom to such an extent that it's crushing the middle and poor class. Apple is making $120,000 net profit per minute of every day 24/7. These huge companies are literally vacuuming up all the loose cash in the country. How can we afford things without cash that looks like it's going extinct?

       Nope. Uncontrolled freedom and liberty would mean slavery. For one man to be completely free, the other has to be a slave. Look at gangsters who feel free enough to literally do anything (rob banks, ext..).
      </p>
      <p>
       The limit to freedom is the point where harm is done to others.

       Ah, but when one, let's say, robs a bank, it is possible, there are odds, that he will be shot. Also, if you rob the bank once and the bank closes, then, you have to look for other gig. What I'm trying to say is that we are all slaves to chance, from the day we are conceived till the day we die.

       It's more like peonship, not slavery. Slavery would imply that the master has absolute right of life and death over you, the right to mate you with whoever he sees fit, and to sell your children at auction. And work off your ass on the plantation till you croak. So, it must be something, but it definitely is not slavery.

       To me, it doesn't matter if "we" make all the shekels, what if "we" doesn't want to share the shekels? Big problem. It's either I make all the shekels or no deal. (not really the case, just theoretically speaking, I am not Jew and I am definitely not rich).

       Here's the biggest lie that was missed in the OP:
      </p>
      <p>
       Tax revenues are completely decoupled from the nation's budget. You don't have to believe me, look for yourself. Compare any year's tax revenues (2015 was
       <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/3248723000000-federal-taxes-set-record-fy-2015-21833-worker-feds-0">
        a record year @ $3.2T
       </a>
       ) to the actual budget (which is the national DEBT - and in 2015 was at a staggering
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_States_federal_budget">
        $18.16T
       </a>
       ) and you'll see quite clearly what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       The OP says
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The seemingly never ending tax layers harvest billions of dollars per year and of which about 50%+ goes on military spending, aka bombs, bullets and occupying foreign land to expand the corrupt empire unlawfully.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But in fact, ACTUAL (including black budget!) military spending in the US alone is quite a bit larger than the total accrued tax revenues over the same period. Which means, we are taxed and taxed and taxed simply because. That's just the beginning of the story. I'll leave it to you to follow the rabbit hole down, but if you want a short and easily digestible understanding of this farce,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23DNe0cJhcU">
        here you go
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now ask yourself, who do we owe the National DEBT to?

       It's not taxes I have a problem with. It's the fact that my pay check doesn't quite cover my expenses. No matter where I go, or how much I seem to be earning, rent seems to magically rise simultaneously.

       I would argue that income taxes are only really slavery when you're taxing barter.  Currency isn't really a physical thing, it's a number.  A promise made by the government, that came with conditions.  The physical representation, bills and coins, aren't even yours to deface.  The government just lends them out to use as currency coupons.
