    <div class="md"><p>there are a few different theories they subscribe to.  Imagine the world is in a huge snow globe, with Antarctica around the border.  If you see the UN flag, that is the earth they envision.</p>

<p>Some people see ships going out to the horizon and not fading out like they should and use that as proof.  They don&#39;t take light rays bending into consideration when they look at this evidence.</p>

<p>I think some famous people or sports stars have been talking about flat earth and it is gaining traction with those that listen to those deep thinkers.  I guess it is partly good because it is getting people to question facts they are taught as unquestionable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you find it interesting, do a search on youtube.  What I find interesting is how some people have put amazing amounts of time and effort making their case - even putting gopro cameras on weather balloons or designing amazing informational videos.</p>

<p>In summary, they really feel the earth is flat.  Some of them feel that this is a religious thing as the bible says certain things about &#39;firmament&#39; and infers a dome above us.  Some use the moon landing being fake as proof.  Some feel the earth is hollow and giants live in there.</p>

<p>It really is an interesting group.  I do recommend checking out YT though.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question though.  All circumnavigations of the &#39;globe&#39; have been east to west and vice versa.  Why has no-one ever gone north to south? or vice versa.<br/>
&#39;Oh there is ice in the way, the ships couldn&#39;t pass!&#39;  But now we have the tech and equipment to survive on the ice, we have planes that could fly right over it!  So why hasn&#39;t it ever happened?  </p>

<p>people can only be one of 3 things.  below average.  average.  above average.  Average would be the middle.  There should be about the same number of below average as above average.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, everybody who believes in the Flat Earth Theory reacted the same way when they heard of it: &quot;This is fucking bullshit! These people are either stupid and ignorant, or they want attention, or both!!&quot; But, being curious, we all take a &quot;peep&quot; at one the videos so that we can scream at the top of our lungs at the shithead who made the video. That is, until we realize that questions are being presented by the Flat Earthers that cannot be answered with sound proof. </p>

<p>All of this stuff should be cleared up with 8th grade science, but it isn&#39;t. And, it isn&#39;t a couple of dozens of issues the Flat Earthers present; it&#39;s literally hundreds of them. When I first heard of Flat Earth I was angry, then I was shocked, then I became numb to the whole thing.</p>

<p>I might add, I think the fact we were lied to about the Moon landing bullshit may be the reason that many Flat Earthers looked at the Flat Earth Theory in the first place. People are sick of lies. Open minded people will look at everything at least once. The only problem with the Flat Earth Theory is that once you &quot;look&quot; there is no going back.</p>

<p>Correct.  NASA even admits this but they say the images &quot;have to be photoshopped&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there&#39;s no &quot;curve&quot; to the horizon etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also correct the horizon (horizontal) does not show any curvature and rises to eye level no matter how high you go (not possible on a sphere).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if someone made a very powerful telescope wouldn&#39;t we be able to see the edge of the earth if it was flat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  A telescope (no matter how powerful) will blur out do to the atmosphere, clouds, dust, smog, etc.  Even if there wasn&#39;t an atmosphere to blur it out you are making an assumption that there even is an edge.  Can you take a telescope and see the edge of outer space?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should research into <a href="https://youtu.be/gKvWWY03IAw">Admiral Richard Byrd</a> (probably the most famous U.S. explorer) He led expeditions to the Arctics back in the 1930&#39;s-1940&#39;s.  He stated in an interview that there is unexplored land full of natural resources larger in size than the United States.  If there is edge, dome, or something else you would need to explore Antarctica (the icewall surrounding us) to find it.  Unfortunatly in the 1950&#39;s every country somehow signed the Antarctic treaty and nobody is allowed to independently explore there.  You can pay and go to a predetermined photo op area but you can not freely explore on your own.  <a href="https://youtu.be/mkq5CjLQFLk?list=PLj_nCPZAjSmZPSvA45jC9R8Lhld2hW0T3">Here is what happens</a> if you try to independently explore the Arctics.</p>

<p>There are a lot of claims as to what he has seen on his expeditions.  A supposed diary of his that has some pretty fantastic stories.  Some of it may not be true but the point is he did extensively explore the arctics and he did admit on a television interview that there was a huge amount of unexplored and uncharted land (full of natural resources) in the arctics.  He said there is no doubt that we would be exploring it for years to come.  In 1957 though (the year of Byrds death) the Antarctic treaty was signed and miraculously all countries agreed to not go to Antarctica...Hmm, sound legit.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=satellite+before+launch&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u">Loads here</a>. If you want pictures of them strapped to rockets before launch then these don&#39;t exist, they&#39;re put inside a case that breaks off once the rocket is out of the atmosphere (to protect the satellite).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>With my shitty telescope I have observed the ISS fly past the moon, yes. You can also see it pass by at night with the naked eye, looks like a fast moving star. I haven&#39;t tried with smaller satellites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think that would be hard to do on a $50 million a day budget? The movie Gravity had a $100 million budget for the entire film.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could make the argument that they have written software that simulates the Himawari 8 and generates images every 10 minutes. If you chose to believe those images aren&#39;t legit then I can&#39;t make an argument that will convince you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also why are there no stars or other satellites in the images from the Himawari 8?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t answer the other satellite question. But the star question; it&#39;s the way cameras work. You need a long exposure to let in enough light to be captured. When it&#39;s dark out, go take a photo of the sky with your phone, you&#39;ll notice that it doesn&#39;t pick up the stars.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.physlink.com/education/askexperts/ae323.cfm">&quot;Any picture that you may see of stars are from time-lapse photos. To take a time-lapse photo of the stars, the shutter must be left open on the camera in order for the lens to focus enough light on the film for the image to show up. Longer times allow more photons to enter the camera and record the image. The image is built over time from the total number of photons striking the film. The dimmer the object, the longer the film must be exposed because there are fewer photons per unit of time reaching the camera than for a brighter object.&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely. They have been busted so many times with green screen fails and as well as harness and wire fails that it&#39;s not even funny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the videos that you got these ideas from. The green screen glitches can be explained by video compression/bitrate failures. If a video stream doesn&#39;t have a high enough bitrate to fill the data being processed (or if it loses data), then it will attempt to fill the area and it looks glitchy. It doesn&#39;t help that the video is being streamed from 250 miles away. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Rp-uo6HmI">A quick video with more info on this</a>.</p>

<p>As for the harnesses, I couldn&#39;t really see anything convincing in the numerous videos I watched on this in the past, just folds in clothing. It&#39;s possible they have faked some interviews, I don&#39;t take everything they release as gospel. If you have specific convincing videos on the greenscreen/harness topic then feel free to link them.</p>

<p>So the argument I&#39;ve heard, correct me if you have/heard of another theory; is that the ISS is actually one of those &quot;zero gravity planes&quot; decorated inside to look legit. This theory quickly falls apart (as does the harness/greenscreen theory) when you watch tours of the ISS. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhGydridbEA">First video</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTmdIhYnes">Second video</a>. These videos are long (the zero g planes cannot simulate it for that long), they show how massive the ISS is, there&#39;s lots of turns/corridors that are impossible for an aeroplane, and they have no harnesses.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust everything NASA does, I don&#39;t trust anything at face value. I&#39;ve gone deep in the Flat Earth realm because it&#39;s fascinating. Before that I was a space geek and because of my knowledge of the universe, physics, telescopes, and things I have observed independently in my home/garden (looking at planets, the moon, the ISS through my telescope); ultimately I know the Earth is round.</p>

<p>There are plenty of obvious examples.  <a href="https://youtu.be/TbdvuVNfDh8">Here</a> is one where one of the guys obviously pulled on an invisible wire that has been edited out.

<p>That&#39;s another piece of evidence.  Most of the time they put in the fake delay to make it seem like there is a long distance for the communication to travel.  Problem is  Chris Hadfield did a <a href="https://youtu.be/AvAnfi8WpVE"> live music collaboration</a> and it was perfectly synced.  That would not be possible with the delay, they screwed up on that or just didn&#39;t care because they knew everyone would just eat it up.</p>

<p>It is possible that some scenes are cut together using zero gravity planes but I don&#39;t claim that all of it is.

Even the show <a href="https://youtu.be/MNR99u4MLDY">Big bang theory</a> and I&#39;m sure they tried 1% compared to what NASA would be capable of.</p>

<p>Exactly, that is what blows me away about people that still have so much trust in NASA, a NAZI/government creation.  It&#39;s well known to anyone that has researched it they have lied many times in the past should not be trusted at all.</p>

<p>It may or may not be like the truman show.  That is just an assumption.</p>

<p>The current mainstream theory is that we are a speck in the vastness of nothingness and came from nothing, created by nothing.  That seems way more far fetched to me than we are the center of everything and the &quot;elites&quot; are trying to hide that fact.</p>

<p>No we didn&#39;t.  Pythagoras came up with the globe idea as a thought experiment.  Copernicus even admitted it was though experiment and likely not reality.  Erastothenes had to assume the sun to be millions of miles away for his famous experiment to &quot;prove&quot; a globe, otherwise you would get the same results on a flat earth (if the sun were smaller and closer as it has been shown and measured to be).</p>

<p>They have.  In the 1800&#39;s there were several scientific books written that rejected the globe earth model and scientifically proved it was impossible.  Now in 2017 the beans are completely spilled and thousands upon thousands of people now know it, with the numbers increasing everyday.  </p>

<p>Satellites are relatively tiny and separated by thousands of miles. Exactly <strong>how</strong> do you expect pictures to be taken of small targets from that far away when they are each moving at thousands of miles an hour? The extent of your demands and your ignorance continues to astound everyone...</p>

<p>From the ISS or from another satellite</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably pretty hard to take a picture of another satellite because they all move at different speeds/orbits. But I&#39;ll give you this point, I don&#39;t have an answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There would be tons of videos of the the satellites being launched into space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a lot of them online actually, but you&#39;ll just claim they&#39;re fake/cgi anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are even telling the truth how would you possibly know it is the ISS? The ISS tracker has been shown to be BS and even if by some chance you did see something in the sky that is 0 proof that it has humans in it. BS. You are not seeing something the size of a jumbo jet from 250 miles away with your naked eye, are you serious?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used the ISS tracker before, but at times have just seen it randomly while outside. It moves faster than a plane and is bright. You can see it with the naked eye because it reflects light, that&#39;s why it looks like a bright star. It&#39;s larger than a jumbo jet btw.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So where are the long exposure shots? Surely there would be pictures in space where they try to photograph all of the stars. It would be too difficult to fake all of the star locations so that is why they don&#39;t do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what satellites like the Hubble are for. You realise 99% of satellites are for weather pattern tracking and telecommunications? Very few are sent up to take long exposure shots of stars. You think the Hubble photos are fake too? Even though some of the galaxies pictured have also been photographed by amateur photographers on Earth (albeit with much worse quality). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of obvious examples. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbdvuVNfDh8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Here</a> is one where one of the guys obviously pulled on an invisible wire that has been edited out. Ironically the interviewer asked if they were really on earth and and just faking it (which made the AstroNot do his little trick).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this video before, and I&#39;ll admit it looks a bit sketchy. But when you look at the actual ISS tours then you can&#39;t rely deny its existence or the fact that there are humans up there. Flat Earthers have no legitimate response to the ISS tour videos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think that you understand would is possible with Hollywood technology, green screens, and a $50 million a day budget. Look at the making of the movie gravity. Even the show Big bang theory and I&#39;m sure they tried 1% compared to what NASA would be capable of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having worked with this technology and having a deep understanding of motion graphics, film making and CGI; it&#39;s VERY easy for me to tell what is computer generated, even to the point of not enjoying fiction because I analyse the techniques instead of enjoying the story. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UblcNFVVHT8">FF Kingsglave</a> is the example I point to of our current best Hollywood CGI techniques, and it&#39;s still obvious.</p>

<p>Not to mention the years it would take to create a 50 minute CGI ISS tour video. You cannot just throw out anything as fake/CGI when it doesn&#39;t align with the FE narrative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the time they put in the fake delay to make it seem like there is a long distance for the communication to travel. Problem is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvAnfi8WpVE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Chris Hadfield did a live music collaboration</a> and it was perfectly synced. That would not be possible with the delay, they screwed up on that or just didn&#39;t care because they knew everyone would just eat it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen this before, but yeah the delay would make this impossible. Probably pre recorded, pretty cheeky of them to attempt that. I&#39;ll ask someone more knowledgeable for a proper explanation and get back to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theoretical math not natural science. No you don&#39;t. 99% of scientist have never even contemplated round vs flat earth since the theoretical math works out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They may not think about the FE vs GE conspiracy directly when working, but all the current models work on a GE model. You can even test some things yourself; go to a beach and watch the sunset sitting or laying down, as soon as the sun disappears stand up or run to a hill, you will see the sun peaking again. You cannot zoom a telescope and see the sun again like FEarthers claim with the ships, that&#39;s a myth that you can debunk yourself. Please do so.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/KSNd7nh.png">You can see further by going higher</a>, telescopes on a flat plane do not debunk this.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of convenient theories to throw away things like eclipses, star constellations being different around the world etc, so I can&#39;t use them against you.</p>

<p>Lots of this can be debunked yourself without having any scientific background. I&#39;ve seen FEarthers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpVKkC0gz8E">claim the Sun in 3 miles away</a>, if that was the case then amateur pilots could just fly right in to it. Even if we consider that he means it&#39;s always visually 3 miles away then those same amateur pilots could just fly towards it and never see it fall below the horizon. Point of convergence/rule of perspective is bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current mainstream theory is that we are a speck in the vastness of nothingness and came from nothing, created by nothing. That seems way more far fetched to me than we are the center of everything and the &quot;elites&quot; are trying to hide that fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah we don&#39;t know how it all started, we probably won&#39;t even know, all we have is theories. If the Earth was flat and being controlled by elites, then the power would need to be handed down each generation to new rulers around the world. The elites are puppets, but they still have real wars and hatred for one another at times, this isn&#39;t something that stays a secret. It definitely doesn&#39;t get uncovered by YouTube video creators with no scientific background.</p>

<p>Even if we say the Earth is flat, what purpose does it serve to keep it secret? The only thing I&#39;ve heard from FEarthers is that &quot;it&#39;s easier to control people on a globe&quot; but that makes zero sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No we didn&#39;t. Pythagoras came up with the globe idea as a thought experiment. Copernicus even admitted it was though experiment and likely not reality. Erastothenes had to assume the sun to be millions of miles away for his famous experiment to &quot;prove&quot; a globe, otherwise you would get the same results on a flat earth (if the sun were smaller and closer as it has been shown and measured to be).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Egyptians, Mayans and other ancient civilisations planned their buildings around star constellations. They also did things like record the shadows of sticks at different times of the day and compare them with cities 100&#39;s of miles away. A globe earth was still a theory for thousands of years because of the belief in god and us being the centre of everything, but there was still experiments that disprove the FE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Utter bullshit.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of why this guy is a moron.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/9pEALdw.jpg">He uses this image as an example of convergence.</a></p>

<p>In this image he&#39;s saying that the green line represents a parallel row of flowers 100 miles to the right of the observer, converging to a single point in front of the observer.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/rOfRibj.jpg">But there are several problems</a></p>

<p>If his theory is correct, why are the trees that are obviously beyond this &quot;horizon&quot; not converged to a single point? Why are the buildings not &quot;converged&quot; to that same point?</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/64pKAjU.png">Here is a simplified diagram of what he&#39;s claiming happens</a></p>

<p>At the top are parallel rows of flowers 100 miles across. At the bottom is a crudely drawn example of the perspective convergence he&#39;s talking about. Notice how the point of convergence represents a distance of 100 miles compressed into a single spot?</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what happens, is it? The trees and the buildings in the distance are not hundreds or thousands of miles across, are they? Yet, according to him, they must span hundreds of miles to appear to be the size they are in that image.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, this was such a waste of my time. You got me invested and then this guy didn&#39;t even have an interesting hypothesis. He&#39;s just dumb. </p>

<p>This guy doesn&#39;t understand basic perspective. Parallel lines converge into the distance. You learned that in school in like 3rd grade. So the fact that lines converge towards the sun shows that the sun is either located where those lines cross (eg infinity) or at least far enough away that lines look like they converge to the naked eye. Dude in the video says that&#39;s 3 miles so whatever. The sun is further away than 3 miles and closer than infinity. Astounding. </p>

<p>Then he goes on to make the same mistake with the crepuscular lines. We already know that parallel lines converge so those lines coming from the clouds might very well be parallel and they would still look like that. This is basic perspective and shouldn&#39;t be confusing. It especially shouldn&#39;t be confusing to someone who spends hours of their time researching it. </p>

<p>He&#39;s also wrong about the basic geometry in the flower patch. A point a hundred miles to your right and three miles out would not look like it was straight in front of you. It would be 88.29 degrees to your right. You just have to take the arctangent of the horizontal distance divided by the forward distance to get these numbers. It&#39;s not like perspective is some mysterious phenomenon we don&#39;t understand. You can calculate it with ease. So when he&#39;s saying the sun is only 3 miles away he&#39;s going to have to work really hard to explain why people 500 miles north or south of me don&#39;t see the sun at 1.71 degrees above the horizon. In fact, you know what? I&#39;m going to call up my friend halfway across the country and ask him if the sun on the horizon where he lives. Hang on a second.</p>

<p>Well that was enlightening. He thought I was a moron. It&#39;s noon where he lives and the sun was high in the sky just like I knew it would be. With telephones and a working knowledge of geometry there is no excuse for believing this crap. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, &quot;fact&quot; becomes arguable in this discussion. It&#39;s a known fact gravity exists, yet it doesn&#39;t on a FE. (There&#39;s no need for it) So for some people, making the assumption gravity isn&#39;t real is too much, because that&#39;s a &quot;fact&quot; they can&#39;t ignore.</p>

<p>In reality, there&#39;s plenty of material provided by FE&#39;ers that explains how and why this could be <em>possible</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagnac_effect">The Sagnac Effect</a> is a good example.</p>

<p>From the 1000&#39;s of hours I&#39;ve invested into this, I&#39;ve learned more about our globe-model, and history of science, than I ever thought possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the solar system model has a lot of flaws, and the flat model better represents what we see in reality. Any country developed enough to have a space agency is developed enough to be under the control of a central bank, and they&#39;ve all been caught faking space travel several times. Examples: even if you&#39;re near the terminator line, it&#39;s impossible to see the sun&#39;s inner valencees while facing away from the sun, I&#39;m talking about seeing Mercury and Venus in the middle of the night; look at the stars and make note of where a constellation is in relation to something that doesn&#39;t move (your house for instance), then check back in precisely 24 hours: the stars will be in the same place, but nudged to the side one degree. Come back in another 24 hours and it&#39;s the same thing. It&#39;s because the stars are attached to a rotating dome (firmament) that makes a full rotation slightly faster than the sun, so in the time it took for the sun to do a lap, the stars were able to too, plus a little more. How does that make sense on Spaceship Earth? Check my comment history for more. <em>How could they have me thinking I lived somewhere I don&#39;t my entire life</em> Because they&#39;re rich, crazy and powerful and have been in control for 500+ years. Don&#39;t let ego hold you back. <em>Why would they lie to me and my ancestors?</em> To hide intelligent design (God), to hide your divine nature, to push global warming for global taxes, to have such a thing as fossil fuels (hide free energy), to laugh at you, etc. Research it a lot, even if you love outer space the way Christians love God. </p>
