    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I completely agree, and I think that&#39;s where this came from. I&#39;m tired of standing down when I see someone is being mistreated. I can clearly see I was wrong here, but I&#39;d rather be wrong for speaking up then wrong for not saying anything. One means I tried to make the world a better place and the other means I didn&#39;t think it was worth the attempt. I know drinking doesn&#39;t help but at any rate if we see one of &quot;or own&quot; that is, &quot;free thinkers&quot; being mistreated, we have to fight back. I&#39;m sick of letting us be shut down for our beliefs. If anything, r/conspiracy should be the place where you bring proof or your argument means nothing. I couldn&#39;t stand the idea of you being shit on for being religious, even though I was wrong I&#39;m my assumption. I may be right in morals, but I was wrong I&#39;m practice. Please leave the downvotes as a reminder for me to be sure before I post. Much love and respect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to :)   Thank you.  Again,  no worries.  Once I saw it was a big misunderstanding and you apologized...we good.</p>

<p>Believe me, I&#39;m Catholic....am a big believer in owning up to junk.  I go to confession every week to apologize to God for things I&#39;ve done against him and against others (which hopefully becomes less and less, but still). </p>

<p>We all fall short...   God bless.  Thank you for writing this nice post and for sharing your thoughts.</p>

<p>When I  looked through your previous posts, I could seem you seemed a reasonable person and so something had just gone wrong in the threads. There had been a miscommunication somewhere.  I read back through the thread and saw that you meant to direct it to the atheist and that you thought I was that person!</p>

<p>Honestly, once you apologized....it was all good!  We good, bro.   Jesus loves you, if I may say so.</p>

The teachings of Jesus Christ are very powerful, and if adhered to would serve a lot of people in bridging gaps and spreading love and goodwill throughout humanity. Modern Christianity is the last thing this country needs. It&#39;s been one of the key destructive forces in dividing this nation and giving people a cop-out for their fucked up beliefs and attitudes.

<p>The solution is to return to what made America great in the first place. Get rid of the Federal Reserve and their private banking usury, start making investments in productive projects like thorium reactors, cheap access to space, hyperloop transportation, etc.</p>

<p>These will create incredible surplus for the government, and drive unheard of economic growth for the private sector, hope in the future, and cooperation between formerly bickering nations and people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The modern Democratic party is definitely neoliberal, at least amongst its leadership. Read your own citation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Early roots of neoliberalism were laid in the 1970s, during the Jimmy Carter administration, with deregulation of the trucking, banking, and airline industries. This trend continued into the 1980s, under the Reagan Administration, which included tax cuts, increased defense spending, financial deregulation and trade deficit expansion. Likewise, concepts of supply-side economics, discussed by the Democrats in the 1970s, culminated in the 1980 Joint Economic Committee report, &quot;Plugging in the Supply Side.&quot; This was picked up and advanced by the Reagan administration, with Congress following Reagan&#39;s basic proposal and cutting federal income taxes across the board by 25% in 1981.</p>

<p>During the 1990s, the Clinton Administration also embraced neoliberalism by supporting the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, continuing the deregulation of the financial sector through passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act and the repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act, and implementing cuts to the welfare state through passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act.</p>

<p>America&#39;s Democrats are a little to the left of Australia&#39;s Liberal Party. The Liberals are our right-wing conservative party. They are called the Liberal Party because of their economic views. They pay lip service to things like welfare while propping up big business and selling-off anything that isn&#39;t nailed down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct, people in the middle ages had much more control over their lives and much more free time.  In fact they mostly had time on their hands through their entire lives.  Modern society turned our time into their time and mostly for their benefit.  So while every second of our working time is watched and must be productive, they take leisurely lunches, extended vacations and schedule themselves as they see fit.  In the 60s-80s there was less emphasis on squeezing every drop of blood out of an employee every second of the work day.  This is relatively new phenomenon that has benefitted the ruling elite immensely.  Technology delivered almost exactly the opposite of what was promised, few work harder, longer for much less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is estimated that 1 in 20 people (5%) are &#39;sociopathic&#39;</p>

<ul>
<li>&gt; <em>It is believed that psychopathy is the largely the result of “nature” (genetics) while sociopathy is more likely the result of “nurture” (environment)</em>. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Psychopathy is related to a physiological defect that results in the underdevelopment of the part of the brain responsible for impulse control and emotions. </p>

<p><strong>Sociopathy, on the other hand, is more likely the product of childhood trauma and physical/emotional abuse</strong>. Because sociopathy appears to be learned rather than innate, sociopaths are capable of empathy in certain limited circumstances but not in others, and with a few individuals but not others.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), released by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013, lists both sociopathy and psychopathy under the heading of Antisocial Personality Disorders (ASPD). </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>These disorders share many common behavioral traits which lead to the confusion between them. Key traits that sociopaths and psychopaths have in common, include: </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>A disregard for laws and social mores</p></li>
<li><p>A disregard for the rights of others</p></li>
<li><p>A failure to feel remorse or guilt</p></li>
<li><p>A tendency to display violent behavior</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In addition to their commonalities, sociopaths and psychopaths also have their own unique behavioral characteristics, as well</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sociopaths tend to be nervous and easily agitated. They are volatile and prone to emotional outbursts, including fits of rage. They are likely to be uneducated and live on the fringes of society, unable to hold down a steady job or stay in one place for very long. </p>

<p>It is difficult but not impossible for sociopaths to form attachments with others. Many sociopaths are able to form an attachment to a particular individual or group, although they have no regard for society in general or its rules. In the eyes of others, sociopaths will appear to be very disturbed. Any crimes committed by a sociopath, including murder, will tend to be haphazard, disorganized and spontaneous rather than planned.</p>

<p>Psychopaths, on the other hand, are unable to form emotional attachments or feel real empathy with others, although they often have disarming or even charming personalities. Psychopaths are very manipulative and can easily gain people’s trust. They learn to mimic emotions, despite their inability to actually feel them, and will appear normal to unsuspecting people. </p>

<p>Psychopaths are often well educated and hold steady jobs. Some are so good at manipulation and mimicry that they have families and other long-term relationships without those around them ever suspecting their true nature.</p>

<p>When committing crimes, psychopaths carefully plan out every detail in advance and often have contingency plans in place. Unlike their sociopathic counterparts, psychopathic criminals are cool, calm, and meticulous. </p>

<p>Their crimes, whether violent or non-violent, will be highly organized and generally offer few clues for authorities to pursue. Intelligent psychopaths make excellent white-collar criminals and &quot;con artists&quot; due to their calm and charismatic natures. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The cause of psychopathy is different than the cause of sociopathy</strong></p>

<p>It is estimated that 1 in 20 people (5%) are &#39;sociopathic&#39; </p>

Every other option is sold as a communism and dictatorships. In reality we should have people in power that are righteous and don&#39;t seek the crown. They should be elected by the people and not by some committees. Then we should get experts from every field to give advice and slowly with a plan return to the natural ways of living, with technology or not. Recreate the way and places we live and dumb the old ways to throw millions of people in a cities. When the money system is slowly with time destroyed and resources used so people can do whatever they want and do community work projects to create all that benefits them and others. That would even revolutionize the school system and create more bright minds to create ever better future. Sounds like an utopia? Who says it can&#39;t be achieved?</p>

<p>Generally species are decided based on whether they can reproduce with each other, so sociopaths are not different enough to meet that distinction.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Are you sure? If people with empathy make better rulers that allow their citizens to be more prosperous, why does natural selection continue to create sociopaths to fill leadership roles? Why hasn&#39;t natural selection eliminated sociopathy after all this time if our species would really be better without it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is no conspiracy. This is the inevitable result of exponential growth curves meeting the limits of a finite planet with finite resources.</p>

<p>Why was having a college degree such a big deal in the past? In the 1940s, only 1 in 20 American adults had a bachelor degree. By the 1970s, it was 1 in 10, and many of the women who had one still didn&#39;t work after having children. Today, it is 1 in 3. Among Millennials, it is almost 4 in 10. Generic college degrees aren&#39;t special anymore. They are a baseline now.</p>

<p>In 1987, we had over 240 million people in this country. Now in 2017, we are around 327 million. Being able and willing - maybe even qualified - to work is no longer all that is necessary to having a decent-paying job.</p>

<p>On the one hand, you have reproduction, migration, urbanization, people living longer, immigration (both legal and illegal), and people who can&#39;t afford to retire. On the other hand, you have off-shoring, automation, computerization, organizational flattening, mergers and acquisitions/consolidations. Overall, it&#39;s more people more desperate for fewer jobs. Corporations don&#39;t talk about the &quot;cost of living&quot;. They talk about the &quot;cost of labor&quot;.<br/>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1pxxfh/americans_with_a_73_unemployment_rate_116_million/cd79vo6/">https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1pxxfh/americans_with_a_73_unemployment_rate_116_million/cd79vo6/</a></p>

<p>And in the housing markets of major cities (where the remaining jobs are), we see households with multiple incomes (whether roommates, multiple immigrant families, two-income households, or Millennial children living with Boomer parents) bidding up pricing on single units, while competing with cash-rich foreign investors and those who have access to low-interest loans.<br/>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5lkbsa/what_487_a_month_gets_you_in_hong_kong/dbwdfry/">https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5lkbsa/what_487_a_month_gets_you_in_hong_kong/dbwdfry/</a></p>

<p>Think of birds seeking nesting places. The best spots are taken first - they are staked out first and defended rigorously. Then less optimal spots are then occupied as more birds arrive on the scene. Finally, when there are too many birds and too few trees, what is left for the late arrivals and those unable to defend the best nesting sites are the spots nearer to the ground and more exposed to predators, or spots on flimsier branches that are more exposed to the elements and to the wind.</p>

<p>The birds with the least desirable nesting spots - especially if they are low on the dominance order and/or dancing or singing ability as well - are the least desirable males, chosen last by the least capable females. They will put effort in, but they, their eggs, and fledglings are the least likely to make it - stricken by malnutrition and predation. Some may not even have the resources to lay an egg. (Amongst humans, at least in some countries, those who produce multiple offspring they cannot afford to feed will see the government take resources from others to redistributed to them.)
This is ecology.</p>

<p>Marginalized humans in Third World countries live in garbage-strewn, polluted, crowded places working for 25 cents an hour. Marginalized humans in Second World countries work in factories or offices for $2 to $5 per hour, while renting tiny closet basement apartments or living with their parents in tiny apartments. Marginalized humans in post-Industrial First World countries work part-time retail or service/hospitality jobs or can&#39;t find work at all, live in urban ghettos with their relatives, in trailers in rural areas, or rent a room or couch-surf in busy metropolises. They may be highly educated, but they have a hard time finding jobs or eking enough of a living to save for any kind of meaningful future as their parents had.</p>

<p>We are in the last stages of overshoot now. The vast majority of what is valuable and income-generating is already owned by somebody else. Everyone else is just competing with their labor - and the labor supply continues to grow even as labor demand decreases due to automation, computerization, off-shoring, and economic decline.</p>

<p>With a human population in severe overshoot, on a finite planet with depleting resources, we have crowded out almost all other life - causing more than half of all other wildlife out there to have disappeared since just the 1970s alone. Now we are crowding each other out.</p>

<p>(Ever wonder why the New World was such a huge, wide-open opportunity full of promise for everyone escaping the crowded, feudal Old World where all the land was already claimed? Millions of Native Americans had been wiped off the map or subjugated. Every immigrant dream was planted on Native American nightmares. Most immigrants and their descendants just don&#39;t even think about it.)</p>

<p>The problem is that in the American system only sociopaths can get ahead</p>

<p>did you know that sociopaths constitute ~5% of the world&#39;s population? That&#39;s more than <em>any other</em> &#39;minority group&#39; <em>including</em> such groups as hopmosexuals!</p>

<p>There are enough sociopaths in the world to create their own &#39;subgroup&#39; of people!</p>

<p>Next question; &quot;How do these sociopaths go about <em>decreasing</em> the world&#39;s population by 90%?&quot; (as it&#39;s suggested they want to occur- i.e. Geogia Guidestones) </p>

<p>aaaannnddd, what better way than &quot;civil war&quot;?</p>

<p>Let the people kill each other .. and in the US, there&#39;s no shortage of weapons for &quot;the people&quot; to use <em>against each other</em>!</p>

<p>Can you <em>imagine</em> how say, Hitlary&#39;s supporters would&#39;ve reacted IF they were &#39;allowed&#39; to Kill their &#39;opposition&#39;?</p>

<p>Syria was a simply a &quot;dry run&quot; to see how well TPTB <em>could arrange</em> a &#39;civil war&#39; and it&#39;s turned out better than they thought! </p>

<p>More death and disarray = more Kontrol as the &#39;scared masses&#39; will <em>let them have</em> whatever powers they ask for, in the <em>hope</em> &quot;things <em>will</em> get better&quot;!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh look, another 2 month old account resorting to insults in the 1st response.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know it&#39;s not a federal agency, don&#39;t you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And slavery is freedom, war is peace, etc.</p>

<p>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is a government agency, and system of regional Federal Reserve Banks is more like a non-profit organization. Whatever profits the make they are required by law to return them to US Treasury.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is key to the extraction of wealth from the former middle class: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It allows the government to borrow at low interest rates, and use that money to stimulate the economy at a time of recession. Without the Fed, government would have to raise money exclusively from private investors, allowing private investors to dictate the rates.</p>

<p>Without the Fed being able to control the rates, any significant recession would turn US into Greece. Anti-Fed movement is nothing but a thinly disguised pro-austerity propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>does it not strike you that cutting interest rates to zero, when they did it, corresponded exactly to the top of the curve for the baby boomer&#39;s retirements. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much conflation.</p>

<p>Again, educate yourself on what the Fed is actually doing. The have a mandate to maximize employment. When the recession hit and the employment dropped, the Fed had to lower the target rate. It is the law! (it is subject to interpretation, see below, but it is the law nonetheless)</p>

<p>Now there is an argument being made that the employment drop is not due to recession, but due to baby boomers retiring, and this argument is being used to convince the Fed to raise their target rate, because this drop in employment is not actually &quot;real&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do retired people generally live on? Savings, dummy, and what did the fed to to their savings, fuck you very much?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it is the recession that fucked up their savings. I suggest you blame the people who are responsible for the recession.</p>

<p>There is also social security. I bet most retired people&#39;s income come from social security checks, and money for social security comes from payroll taxes, and guess who is tasked with keeping employment rate high so that there is enough people paying those taxes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me take a swing at this. Home mortgages and renting have been commonplace for several centuries. Imprisonment is too high. But mental illnesses are better diagnosed now than ever before. I guess if you&#39;d like to go back to vapors, melancholy, and sadness to be the prominent diagnoses then I&#39;d say we carry down our path. Salary doesn&#39;t really determine the number of children you have, just look to sub Sahara africa. It&#39;s just that people don&#39;t want to take decreases in their standard of living to pump out a few more children. Employers owning your time and keeping you for long stretches of time has existed for basically eternity. Hell in the bible, referring to events over 2000 years ago, talks about day laborers and how they work all day in fields. That isn&#39;t quality family time. We haven&#39;t experienced a generation defining war in the west for quite some time. Yeah the middle eastern conflicts have lasted far far too long and must be stopped but that war, outside of very troubling violations of my privacy and legal rights hasn&#39;t impacted the west the same way say, rationing and daily bombing raids people in WW2 had to deal with. I cannot speak to the last point you make. </p>

<p>I make no value judgements and want to start no trouble on the rest of this I just wanted to point out a few flaws I think exist in your premise here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is 100% right. Because of the &#39;system,&#39; people have been evolving in Western countries to not have as many kids or to opt out of having kids all together because of the burden and how fucked the system is in the first place. </p>

<p>Same deal in Japan, which also gives rise to reclusive socially withdrawn movements like Hikkomori:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori</a></p>

<p>Or in the U.S. called NEETs:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET</a></p>

<p>Because of this, there are less tax producing cogs in the machine feeding it and fattening the 1% at the top. Same deal in most European countries, so what dod the Globalists decide to do in Europe? Open the floodgates for millions of Islamic economic refugees to come into Europe to replace the lack of child bearing in order to become e replacement cogs.</p>

<p>Only that these refugees majority go on government handouts, refuse to work, refuse to pay into the system, because an additional strain on the system, bring in disease and fundamentalism, and seek to replace the inherent cultural identities in these countries which is going to create eventual civil wars.</p>

<p>So my theory is that Humanity as it becomes more conscious of the debt slavery machine, has consciously to not partake in it as much, and by extension, to not reproduce as much as in the past. This would have been a brilliant move because it would result in lest strain on resources, our own systems (agriculture, energy, infrastructure, etc) would become more efficient with less strain.</p>

<p>In the U.S. there&#39;s a still a chance for this to happen, as it is already underway in Japan, Iceland, and a few other countries, and you can already see in what ways they are all evolving.</p>

<p>But the countries bringing in Islamic refugees by the millions are going to self destruct under the cultural pressures they bring with them to change everything back into the 3rd world crap holes they come from and become a strain on the countries they immigrate to</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what OP was getting at, and what I certainly think is true, is that people are getting squeezed out of normal milestones like having children by messed up economic structure of their lives. </p>

<p>I do not believe everyone in the west decided they didn&#39;t want kids in the last 50 years. People are &quot;choosing&quot; not to have kids like they&#39;re &quot;choosing&quot; to live in tiny apartments into their forties. Endemically stuck in a position where you can&#39;t even afford a car on your wages? No problem, just read one of the many op-ed articles about how &quot;millenials are doing it they&#39;re own way&quot; and about how &quot;they don&#39;t even want cars cause big city transit is GREAT&quot;</p>

<p>Not buying it. </p>

<p>Get rid of the Federal Reserve and their private banking usury, start making investments in productive projects like thorium reactors, vacuum tube rail, an orbital ring for cheap access to space, geoengineering projects like NAWAPA, and soon thereafter anti-aging therapies.</p>

<p>this only happens in Statist environments.

    <div class="md"><p>I am more then suspicious. This isn&#39;t the first post that reached the front of this sub lately with this type of content--this thrown together, scattered list of things that paint this &quot;dark&quot; picture of our society. There was a very similar post a week or so ago that was exactly like this, but the poster wrote a huge novel about this existential bullshit. And it got gold! Who on r/conspiracy gives gold?! This is not the normal, focused Conspiracy sub that I love. I feel that this is a shill topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the run of the mill &quot;researcher&quot;.</p>

<p>Understanding how this world operates on all levels is my true life&#39;s work.  Along the way I gained respected degrees in psychology and law and have done top level analysis for a number of non profits and private clients.  </p>

<p>The flip side of that is my now 32 years of being a practitioner/investigator of occult systems and orders.  I&#39;ve written, under a pseudonym, articles about the history of some of these orders focusing on the branches from the oldest part of the tree.  </p>

<p>But....being noticed is no joke, being targeted by these &quot;people&quot; is a horrifying fate.  Zersetzung operations are widely in effect and the targets can often be completely at a loss as to why they are targeted.  Couple that with the extradimensionals slithering in and you&#39;ve got major problems.  So, I just drop hints here and there, little breadcrumbs....</p>

Also remember it&#39;s not just wealth, power and access to off the hook tech, it&#39;s active assistance from the Others that you go up against.

Raising the federal minimum wage, per all the &quot;neoliberals&quot; peeople like to harp on, might actually be a pretty direct solution to wage suppression...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According the offensive realism there can be only 1 military power. If you allow a foreign nation state to build its weapon stash you threaten your own state in the future, because its intentions are unknown. This is why the TPP was developed to economically encircle China.</p>

<p><strong>Here is my study:</strong></p>

<p>If you really want to know why and how shit is happening listen to this video series. You&#39;ll need a few hours, but it is worth the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReSWxNGtzjE">John Mearsheimer outlines US foreign policy and it&#39;s relationship with Russia and China
</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_UlgxI8MHg">America is circling China in preparation for war</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-K2AoA9iWg">John Mearsheimer explains US Mideast Policy and it&#39;s failures</a>. Note the Anomaly in US policy. Did Israel influence regime change policy?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzXS3tmZrcU">AIPAC and its influence on US Foreign Policy</a></p>

<p>Post Gulf Wars US has had no interest in Russia other than help to contain China. Recent Russia provocations indicate US interests that are not in line with Realism which is explained by:</p>

<ul>
<li>NeoCon Influence on policy</li>
<li>Christian Zionism influence on policy</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFr4C2BPLeM">Hastening for a Messiah</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Putins own advisor Alexander Dugin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dugin">calls to hasten end times</a></p>

<p>What we have are 3 tracts of policy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Classical Realism as explained by Mearsheimer</li>
<li>End times policy as influenced by Neocons, Christian Zionists, Alexander Dugin</li>
<li><a href="http://cgsrs.org/files/files/publications_30.pdf">Defensive Realism as it relates to Climate Change as a result of the Paris agreement.</a></li>
</ol>

<p>If you can wrap your head around the three policies, you will be able to see why things are happening the way they are.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pivot to Asia and checking China militarily</li>
<li>Mid East End timers (Zionists and Putin)</li>
<li>Climate Change Policy. Which is being developed and evolving. </li>
</ol>

<p>With Respect to Climate Change, some countries are going to cooperate and some are not. Britain is going to isolate itself with its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc_4Z1oiXhY">&quot;Life Boat Britain&quot; policy</a>. This explains the Brexit vote. </p>

<p>US and China are cooperating on Climate, but fighting for hemispherical dominance.</p>

<p>Key points in Offensive realism:</p>

<ol>
<li>Behaviour is amoral</li>
<li>Political affiliation and ideology is irrelevant</li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree about eating out and house sizes (to some extent), but the fact is most people who have a full-time job don&#39;t have time to mow gardens or make a supplemental income.</p>

<p>Last year I was away from home 72 hours almost every week, how&#39;s anyone have time to do anything other than sleep after work? I should have made big money but of course I was salaried lol.</p>

<p>After that, I was done. Doing the work of two people and having a ton of financial responsibility with no real upside. Fuck that shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tech firms should get into the housing business.  Build them cheaply with robots.  Build them on top of each other cheaply if land is the expense problem.  Instead housing is slow and expensive as its always been.  The finance sector is built on investing the 30 years of labor workers put in to pay off their house.  I don&#39;t care for that.  iPhone good enough.  Houses not good enough.  It is also a smart market to go into, just like self driving cars is a good move for tech companies who have already maxed out their space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this is getting off my point, which was that it&#39;s not new that the world is crap, it&#39;s always been that way, it&#39;s not a new hype. Today and the last couple of centuries, in my opinion it&#39;s been a lot more about quality of life than surviving past 30.</p>

<p>And for this particular issue, is that no matter the time or place, children are always more burden then help.</p>

<p>That being said, since I am stating past as in millenias until a couple of centuries ago, a child would no longer be a child by the age of 13-14 (not sure what age you were considering), age of which he should carry his own weight and would start having children of it&#39;s own. </p>

<p>But now we live in a world where everything including the government, money, and even your job is owned by a few who can make trillions of dollars doing nothing from the work you make while you spend your entire life only being paid enough for a house worth only 100,000-200,000 dollars and food you would have been able to grow if you could afford the land they snapped up centuries ago through war and deceit (by owning the government).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider myself to be pretty staunchly liberal on most issues. Not all issues, but most issues. I don&#39;t believe that both sides are exactly the same, but we certainly live under the power of a political venn diagram. That said, the title of this post is so lacking in awareness that it makes me cringe.</p>

<p>Liberals are the ones who have ruined the country? And the examples given specifically are supposed to support that argument? Let&#39;s see:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imprisonment and mental illness are unprecedented.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Liberals want real justice reform, including ending the racist failure that is the War on Drugs. Conservatives, namely Nixon who started it and later Reagan who made it worse, have been hardcore supporters of this cruel joke of a policy since it began.</p>

<p>Liberals want to expand public access to health services and take a science-based approach to battling mental illness. They also want socialized healthcare so that the number one cause of bankruptcy in this country isn&#39;t medical debt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our salary determines if we can have children, how many. Employers own our time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conservatives have been against the formation of labor unions, against passing laws that protect workers, against raising wages, against free access to education, and against environmental protections. Not liberals, conservatives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We barely raise our kids or spend time with people we love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, conservatives are against increased maternity leave and paternity leave, and all of the points I made just a moment ago prove that they are not interested in affording Americans more time and security in their lives to encourage parents spending more time with their children. Some conservative representatives have even gone so far as to suggest &quot;Get a second job&quot; when questioned about the issues of stagnant wages, lack of vacation/sick/mat-pat leave, and lack of benefits. So much for spending time with your kids.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>War is endless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a tough one, and both liberals and conservatives have been tooting the nationalist horn in regards to America&#39;s interventionism for a long time. However, going back through the last century we can see that it was not liberals, but conservatives who have started most of the wars America has been involved in. Korea (Truman), Vietnam (4/5 Presidents residing were Republican), Gulf War (George HW), Iraq War and Afghanistan (George W). It&#39;s a nasty history. Now, liberals, Democrats or whatever you want to call them, are not completely free of blame for these conflicts (Obama&#39;s atrocities in the Middle East), and they certainly carried out their own horrors, but they didn&#39;t start the wars.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I do not believe that the representatives and politicians involved in all of this represent the views of the their constituents 100%. I know that many conservatives are tired of the bullshit their greedy, whoring, political clowns are responsible for. However, the ballots don&#39;t lie. 90% incumbency in Congress, 10% approval. It&#39;s a fucking shit-show. People need to open their eyes.</p>

<p>Truman was a liberal Democrat.   LBJ started the Vietnam war.   Nixon ended it.  Democrats Wilson and FDR started US involvement in the world wars. Clinton had his war in Yugoslavia, he bombed Iraq more than Bush I or II  did, to say nothing of the sanctions that killed hundreds of thousands.  He also bombed  Sudan to distract from the Lewinsky scandal.    Obama started  Libya War.  Jimmy Carter has relatively clean hands because he didn&#39;t fight any direct wars, just covertly supported violence in countries like East Timor, Guatemala, and Namibia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I support your general attitude, I take issue with a few things said here.</p>

<p>Your salary has <em>always</em> determined if you can have children. If you were a bad hunter, you were unlikely to find a mate. If you did not control any good land for farming, you were unlikely to be able to support many or even any children. The framework has changed but the rules are still the same -- a Darwinian survival game.</p>

<p>I do not agree with the supposed conclusion that I (or society at large) should be forced to support your offspring.</p>

<p>You are not a slave, employers do not own your time, slaves do not have agency and are not free to leave. Employers may <em>rent</em> your time, if you enter an agreement with them. Some consider this uncouth, as though it is akin to being a whore. I don&#39;t find it uncouth, I have rented plenty of my time out to employers voluntarily. Because of this I don&#39;t look down upon whores for their chosen profession.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like the arrangement with your current employer, leave. If you don&#39;t wish to rent out your time, if you find it unbecoming, then don&#39;t do it. Make something and find some people to sell it to. Go live in the mountains on fish and game and berries for all I care. But don&#39;t claim you have no agency, because that is insulting to the millions of slaves in the history of humanity, and it is insulting to the thousands(more?) of slaves that still exist today under force and coercion.</p>

<p>I would like to end with a positive note, regarding the amount of work it takes to own a home. I wholeheartedly agree that this is ridiculous. Society would be better off, IMO, without the excessive money-lending that goes on today. The problem is further exacerbated by government intervention and support of the lending -- long term this only serves to artificially inflate the price of homes. We can see the same problem in education, with government guaranteed loans artificially inflating the price of higher education.</p>

<p>I hope you do not take this missive too negatively. While I agree with many of your concerns in our current society, my goal here was to illustrate that you are truly in control of your own destiny, and no change of policy at a political level will free you from your chains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Power structures and hierarchy control the population. Love in the family keeps us from rioting. When the average american family unit is attacked and suffering we will see change. When we run out of love, maybe well see change. When the family system breaks, maybe well see progress or maybe well see a more effiencient form of breeding and continuity of the human condition.  As it is right now we still have alot of freedom to build ourselves in this psuedo-meritocracy.  There will still be certain unfairnesses and grievences in this current system but I believe the good still outweighs the bad. This is all from my perspective as a lowly peon. I wish I knew what the .ooooooo1 percent of people thought, I wish I knew what they knew of the future that is more firmly in their grasp. I wish I was able to see reality from the perspective of the ones who own and manage the means of production. Maybe there is just as much illusion/misinformation at the top levels of hierachy/power structures as there is at the bottom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agreed all the way to the point until you mentioned neo-liberalism. Don&#39;t buy into the false dichotomy man - dividing people into liberals and conservatives is the hook that makes it seem like the left and right is always about &quot;us&quot; against &quot;them&quot;. The divide and conquer strategy is a classic and has been used for centuries (or millennia even) by the corrupt elite.</p>

<p>Neo-conservatism is just as bad and it&#39;s supposed to be on the opposite side of the spectrum as neo-liberalism. The whole structure, the very foundation of the system is rotten, the surface agendas like liberalism and conservatism are really irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is no conspiracy. This is the inevitable result of exponential growth curves meeting the limits of a finite planet with finite resources.</p>

<p>Why was having a college degree such a big deal in the past? In the 1940s, only 1 in 20 American adults had a bachelor degree. By the 1970s, it was 1 in 10, and many of the women who had one still didn&#39;t work after having children. Today, it is 1 in 3. Among Millennials, it is almost 4 in 10. Generic college degrees aren&#39;t special anymore. They are a baseline now.</p>

<p>In 1987, we had over 240 million people in this country. Now in 2017, we are around 327 million. Being able and willing - maybe even qualified - to work is no longer all that is necessary to having a decent-paying job.</p>

<p>On the one hand, you have reproduction, migration, urbanization, people living longer, immigration (both legal and illegal), and people who can&#39;t afford to retire. On the other hand, you have off-shoring, automation, computerization, organizational flattening, mergers and acquisitions/consolidations. Overall, it&#39;s more people more desperate for fewer jobs. Corporations don&#39;t talk about the &quot;cost of living&quot;. They talk about the &quot;cost of labor&quot;.<br/>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1pxxfh/americans_with_a_73_unemployment_rate_116_million/cd79vo6/">https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1pxxfh/americans_with_a_73_unemployment_rate_116_million/cd79vo6/</a></p>

<p>And in the housing markets of major cities (where the remaining jobs are), we see households with multiple incomes (whether roommates, multiple immigrant families, two-income households, or Millennial children living with Boomer parents) bidding up pricing on single units, while competing with cash-rich foreign investors and those who have access to low-interest loans.<br/>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5lkbsa/what_487_a_month_gets_you_in_hong_kong/dbwdfry/">https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5lkbsa/what_487_a_month_gets_you_in_hong_kong/dbwdfry/</a></p>

<p>Think of birds seeking nesting places. The best spots are taken first - they are staked out first and defended rigorously. Then less optimal spots are then occupied as more birds arrive on the scene. Finally, when there are too many birds and too few trees, what is left for the late arrivals and those unable to defend the best nesting sites are the spots nearer to the ground and more exposed to predators, or spots on flimsier branches that are more exposed to the elements and to the wind.</p>

<p>The birds with the least desirable nesting spots - especially if they are low on the dominance order and/or dancing or singing ability as well - are the least desirable males, chosen last by the least capable females. They will put effort in, but they, their eggs, and fledglings are the least likely to make it - stricken by malnutrition and predation. Some may not even have the resources to lay an egg. Amongst humans, at least, some who produce multiple offspring will see the government take resources from others to redistributed to them.</p>

<p>This is ecology.</p>

<p>Marginalized humans in Third World countries live in garbage-strewn, polluted, crowded places working for 25 cents an hour. Marginalized humans in Second World countries work in factories or offices for $2 to $5 per hour, while renting tiny closet basement apartments or living with their parents in tiny apartments. Marginalized humans in post-Industrial First World countries work part-time retail or service/hospitality jobs or can&#39;t find work at all, live in urban ghettos with their relatives, in trailers in rural areas, or rent a room or couch-surf in busy metropolises. They may be highly educated, but they have a hard time finding jobs or eking enough of a living to save for any kind of meaningful future as their parents had.</p>

<p>We are in the last stages of overshoot now. The vast majority of what is valuable and income-generating is already owned by somebody else. Everyone else is just competing with their labor - and the labor supply continues to grow even as labor demand decreases due to automation, computerization, off-shoring, and economic decline.</p>

<p>With a human population in severe overshoot, on a finite planet with depleting resources, we have crowded out almost all other life - causing more than half of all other wildlife out there to have disappeared since just the 1970s alone. Now we are crowding each other out.</p>

<p>(Ever wonder why the New World was such a huge, wide-open opportunity full of promise for everyone escaping the crowded, feudal Old World where all the land was already claimed? Millions of Native Americans had been wiped off the map or subjugated. Every immigrant dream was planted on Native American nightmares. Most immigrants and their descendants just don&#39;t even think about it.)</p>

<p>Is nice you trumpists learned a new word but it&#39;s so infuriating to see you banding it about without understanding what it means. Neoliberalism means pseudo technocratic arguments for dismantling the social democratic state. </p>

<p>Neoliberalism can&#39;t be destroying your country because economic liberalism has always defined your country and there was no social democracy to dismantle. </p>

<p>You are the ones who gave us Ayn Rand and Milton friedman and Alan greenspan who created the intellectual underpinnings of neoliberalism but those arguments were not necessary in the U.S. They just made the wealthy feel good and righteous to do what they were already successfully doing anyway.</p>

<p>There is no going back to social democracy. There is no rowing back globalisation. No matter what system we have we will be outcompeted. The developing world can easily trade amongst themselves but don&#39;t worry there&#39;s plenty to go around in our countries, it&#39;s just not being shared with you. You used to get your share by using economic leverage. Now your only option is to use political leverage. Capitalism is the disease. Socialism is the cure.</p>

<p>The fact is, the left right paradigm is designed to keep people enslaved. Put bad policies on both sides, constantly flip flop, and divide everyone with wedge issues.</p>

<p>The solution is to return to what made America great in the first place. Get rid of the Federal Reserve and their private banking usury, start making investments in productive projects like thorium reactors, cheap access to space, hyperloop transportation, etc.</p>

<p>These will create incredible surplus for the government, and drive unheard of economic growth for the private sector, hope in the future, and cooperation between formerly bickering nations and people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I completely agree, and I think that&#39;s where this came from. I&#39;m tired of standing down when I see someone is being mistreated. I can clearly see I was wrong here, but I&#39;d rather be wrong for speaking up then wrong for not saying anything. One means I tried to make the world a better place and the other means I didn&#39;t think it was worth the attempt. I know drinking doesn&#39;t help but at any rate if we see one of &quot;or own&quot; that is, &quot;free thinkers&quot; being mistreated, we have to fight back. I&#39;m sick of letting us be shut down for our beliefs. If anything, r/conspiracy should be the place where you bring proof or your argument means nothing. I couldn&#39;t stand the idea of you being shit on for being religious, even though I was wrong I&#39;m my assumption. I may be right in morals, but I was wrong I&#39;m practice. Please leave the downvotes as a reminder for me to be sure before I post. Much love and respect.</p>
