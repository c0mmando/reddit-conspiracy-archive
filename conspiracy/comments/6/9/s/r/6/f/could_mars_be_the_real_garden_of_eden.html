       I'm an agnostic so whether its even real im unsure of but i can imagine early religion living on mars (we know it was probably more hospitable and had water in the past.) I can imagine Mars being covered in oceans and forests. We see the bible talk of humanity being cast out of Eden and the world eventually being flooded only to be saved by Noahs Ark. What if Noahs Ark isnt a boat but a spaceship that held the DNA of all the life we know today. That's certainly more believable and manageable than a boat holding 2 of every animal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Noahs Ark bring us to Earth? Could one of the other planets be "hell"? Was Jesus crucified because he was an android/alien sent down to communicate with us by whoever "god" was? I can imagine god being a super advanced A.I or Alien. That would explain all the miracles in the bible "sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".
      </p>
      <p>
       With this perspective I bet there are many instances in the bible that could be ancient humans trying to make sense of an "all powerful, all knowing" creature or machine. Think about it back then they had no concept of what technology could accomplish or the vastness of space.

       Just had one last thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan gave us fruit from the tree of knowledge?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if this "fruit" was some kind of genetic supplement like the pill from Limitless? What if thats why we are able to do what we do today? What if that is what gives us the consciousness that separates us from animals?

       Or, what if, it just tells the story of how we start as children. We are in the garden, with g-d, not aware of our surroundings. As we get older those arounds us give us fruit of knowledge of good and evil (or so what they believe). Soon enough we grow and go out of the garden.

       Instead, try checking this out as a purely symbolic event in our genetic history. A fruit is literally the trees ability to reproduce. Eve is tempted out of her childlike reverie by the instinct to reproduce. Then she gains the ability to concieve good and bad, (for our purposes think about it in terms of things that will either help or harm her ability to carry and raise a baby, and you can pretty much reduce even our modern sense of ethics to this basic historical idea. Life and children = good/conclict, hardship, and death = bad)
      </p>
      <p>
       Once eve becomes aware of good and bad, she gains the very first human instance of the ability to plan for the future. As a punishment she is given birth pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason girls have birthing pain is that the human cranium is way to big to pass through a vagina. The primary reason are heads are this big is that our brains have evolved the capacity to abstract, which in turn evolved specifically beecause abstraction gives us the ability to concieve of and plan for a future frought with potential positive and negative events that will effect our ability to produce offspring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eve was the first monkey to become anatomically human, and Genesis is the tale of how she gave birth to psychology. This is all left over knowledge from an ancient civilization that already understood the mechanics of evolution imo.

       Who is Satan then? What motives could he have had? Maybe they we're space faring scientists terraforming our little solar system. Satan, gods favorite. Maybe some kind of unauthorized experiments?
      </p>
      <p>
       God places the first man and woman in a garden with trees of whose fruits they may eat, but forbids them to eat from "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"
      </p>
      <p>
       In Genesis 3, a serpent seduces the woman to eat from its forbidden fruit and she also lets the man taste it, God expels them from the garden and thereby from eternal life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eternal life? If we are talking about beings capable of terraforming and godly technology im sure they would have unlocked immortality. Heck we are already on the path to unlocking it ourselves and we have to be 1000s of years behind those beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we were originally intended to be a pure species free from the "knowledge of good and evil" maybe the creator realized giving immortality to humans now capable of evil would end very badly.

       But the tree does also represent free will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we were a pure utopian species but with no free will? Satan being one of the godly figures may have had pity on a planet full of intelligent life with no free will. We may have even been nothing but breeded work horses obviously taken care of because the bible says all the fruit and meat was for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we were similar to dogs. A utility species loved by their owner/creator and given good food and treatment but with no will no knowledge. Satan rebelled against god (our creator but also possibly our enslaver) and gave us that knowledge. God knowing what he had created could not survive destroyed the planet  (rain for 40 days and 40 nights). Wiping the slate clean and moving on.

       What if I told you that the God of Abraham is the God the Father as proclaimed by Christ, but that the God of the Scribes and the Pharisees is that which you'd call Satan and his servant Lucifer, who physically manifests in this dimension?
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the Gospel of John.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ flat out tells the Scribes and the Pharisees that their Father is from hell, the underworld...the inner Earth where the Serpent God lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Scribes and Pharisees reject Christ and crucify him, the Apostles fan out across the world to preach his message...each being a Son of the 12 tribes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the Scribes and Pharisees, whose Father was Satan and his Anti-Christ servant being Lucifer for the 3rd Dimension, never ceased to exist. Rather, they just adapted and blended in as best as possible as they bounced from one nation, society and culture to another. They still exist today (
       <strong>
        <em>
         cough Zionism cough
        </em>
       </strong>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ was begotten, not made, of his Father and both were and are not if this world. However, Christ's Father was not "God". For you see, Christ was "begotten" in the sense that he was born to a woman (Mary) who had a compatible genetic composition.
      </p>
      <p>
       What am I getting at you might ask?
      </p>
      <p>
       That homosapiens came into existence via genetic manipulation and or breeding with humanoid ETIs. There is evidence to suggest that these humanoid ETIs were Lyrans, Arcturians, Sirians and Pleiadians. The "Aryan Race" whose earliest known recorded presence in history dates back to Ancient Persia and Zoroaster. There's a reason why Zoroastrianism is viewed as having heavily influenced the three Abrahamic faiths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moses delivered the Israelites out of Egypt, but the name "Israel" only came about when Jacob's name was changed to such.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israelites, prior to being called such, were slaves and prisoners to the Pharoahs of Egypt and also to Ancient Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about the name Israel....
      </p>
      <p>
       Is = Egyptian Goddess Isis
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra = Egyptian Sun God Ra
      </p>
      <p>
       El = Saturn the God
      </p>
      <p>
       Israelite is LITERALLY the name bestowed upon those who were once prisoners and slaves to two Egyptian Gods and one Babylonian God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judaism in the modern era is Judaism in name only. It is Zionism, which is Babylonian Talmudism...the worshipping of El (Saturn).
      </p>
      <p>
       Free Masonry is the worshipping of ISIS and Ra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three gods...two separate belief systems....but each of which enslaved homosapiens at some point in our history. Sound like they'd be a fitting alliance to once again try and enslave humanity once more via subtlety and trickery?
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ was a man born to Mary, who was a human hybrid (as all modern humans are) of a compatible genetic construct of his origin humanoid ETI species (always comes up as Pleiadian).
      </p>
      <p>
       At 27, Christ completed the awakening of his consciousness, remembered where he truly came from and why he was sent to Earth. His Father was the "King of Kings"....the King of the ETI humanoid race which created modern humanity, thus the King who reigns above all Kings of Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       He "purchased out of the Earth" 144,000 human souls...12,000 from each of the 12 tribes of Israel. These were humans who heard his message, converted, and had their conscious awakening. The ones prophesized to remain here on Earth...behind the veil (in the 4th Dimension)...until he returned. Now whether that means he returns physically as he was or in a being whose consciousness / brain is so advanced that they can perform miracles (matter manipulation at the atomic level...MKUltra confirmed over and over this exists. Read the 
work of Astronaut Edgar Mitchell), I cannot say one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I do know is this....the Holy Ghost / Holy Spirit is that which can elevate your consciousness and unlock your brain's untapped capacity. Again, look into Edgar Mitchell's work and the idea that deep within the neural network of our minds are Hologram databanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory is that the correct combination of Energy, Frequency and Vibration can unlock the information stored within the Holographic database in the neural network of your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is completely in line with Tesla's theory that the secrets of the universe are energy, frequency and vibration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now one of these days....either in the evening or in the morning early before sunrise....go out and take a look at Venus. It is extremely bright and both expands and contracts its Light as if to look like a UFO.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, Venus currently has a giant structure rotating around its surface. It is baffling scientists, but many believe we have long known about life on Venus at surface level below the gasses. Tesla himself flat out claimed he was from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaseous planet + giant rotating object on surface = Artificial EM field.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you think WiFi works? It is just information transmitted from Point A to Point B via Earth's natural EM field. A computer and all its components are no different than your body and your brain...computer requires electricity and your brain is an electro neural network.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if your mind has a holo database of info built in and waiting to be activated, how could that be done?
      </p>
      <p>
       Point A....an ETI planet far away (let's say in the Pleiades) just sends out the correct code to unlock that information in your mind. It uses natural radiation, light and EM frequencies to transmit the information through space from Point A to Point B.
      </p>
      <p>
       .....and a planet with either a natural occurring or artificially created EM field can act as a "node / relay point" for transmission of this information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence why Christ is begotten of his Father, but his Father is not "God". Islam (Isa = Christ  Lamb = The sacrifice....Isalamb...Islam), through Mohammad, corrected this with the concept of Tahwid...that God/Allah is not limited to one planet or even one community within a planet. That which we call God/Allah is...quite literally...The Force of the Universe which connects all living things. All living things created of this force are inherently of Light, yet also have Free Will. Thus, Light vs. Dark....and why the institutionalization of the Spirit of the Word of each prophet has convinced humanity that it can just sit back and wait for Christ to return at the last moment and save us. That's not how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Ra El
      </p>
      <p>
       Isa Lamb
      </p>
      <p>
       One hates Christ via the Talmud, yet galavants around the world and makes everyone kiss their ass out of a completely fictitious guilt brought about by horrible actions committed by Zionists and "Crypto Zionists" (House of Saud, ISIS, Wahhabi Sunni Islam) and...yeah you won't believe this but there is clear evidence via old British Foreign Minustry cables from the 1900s....that Atta Turk was a Crypto Zionists. Crypto Zionists are Talmudics who outwardly profess Islam as their religion....they are the ones who have given Islam a bad name...the Bin Ladens, the Saudis, Wahhabism....all of whom were put into place when the British created Wahhabism in Arabia in the 1700s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whore of Babylon, that woman who mated with the Serpent and then formulated with all men to corrupt the seven continents. She sits on the throne of that city which rules the world....City of London, the "true London"...from whence the Rothschilds ensured they received a British homeland via the Balfour Declaration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Book of Ruth....becoming Jewish (Babylonian Talmudic by choice)...Rothschild = The children of Ruth, who married into Babylonian Talmudism over 2,000 years ago and took Baal and Moloch...the sacrificial Gods of Clay from whence the Draco Reptilian of the unseen 4th Dimension draw their energy source.

       A river flows out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divides and becomes four branches. The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Cush. The name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

       Then the Lord God said, “See, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever”—  therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.  He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a sword flaming and turning to guard the way to the tree of life.

       This.
Jesus is here now as our exit from this existance to move on to our next form, one of unity and harmony, free of the material experience for a time while we learn of other perception and other realities. Have no fear, we are moving forward in our learning. Far in the future we will experience all of these things again on a higher frequency.

       Please no Jesus! When all powerful being needs to sacrifice THIS own son for the appeasement of others. Not to sound so bad but he sounds like some sort of jerk off masturbating god. I mean sadist will love to burn in hell forever, meanwhile people are possibly worshiping him as angel doing the "Wave" for near eternity til the "new heaven" and "new earth" are created. Remember Jesus did NOT stay 3 days and 3 nights in the tomb. Modern Christians don't understand that Jesus still needs to fulfill "Jewish messianic prophecies" on his 2nd coming.

       To explain how they arrived, look at the Celestial Event over Nuremberg in 1561.
      </p>
      <p>
       A significant number of the most ruthless SS officers in WWII were Hungarians who were later to be found as Babylonian Talmudists (Zionists).
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros, as we all know, was a Nazi collaborator. Do not buy his bullshit SOB story about "doing what was necessary to survive". As time passes, it is becoming far more obvious that SS officers from the Eastetn European battalions were Zionists who had no problem whatsoever with the extermination of Orthodox Jews (Torah Jews...real Jews). You know why this was the case...
      </p>
      <p>
       Founder, former CEO and current chairman of Stratfor is Hungarian.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dig deep enough, and trace the history of Hungary post-1561, you find that Hungarians are disproportionately involved at the top of many conspiracies.

       On a serious note though, what you described is exactly what I have been believing in for years. When People very often think it's outlandish and weird, but it makes total sense when you think about it and piece everything together.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's definitely a far more scientific and realistic view (think of how another primitive species would interpret and record US if we came down on their planet) than literally believing in the Bible's story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, there are plenty of instance and descriptions in the Bible which are very similar to modern day UFO encounters.

       Some scientists think the very first microbial life on Earth (or pre-life organic molecules maybe) came from Mars via an asteroid impact on Mars that sent small pieces of Martian rock (containing microbes) flying into space and eventually landing on Earth.
       <br/>
       But it makes no sense to think that humans -- as humans -- came from Mars.  Where did the chimpanzees come from?  They share most of our DNA.

       The Deluge/Noah's Ark definitely pertains to Earth if you cross-reference multiple ancient folklore/religions as it doesn't only pertains to the Bible. I personally think Eden is underwater.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Mars, it does seemed to have been habitable once, whether by our ancestors or other intelligent beings, but I think it has no resemblence to Noah's Ark.

       Even if Mars had once an atmosphere and was closer to the Sun with higher temperatures the 2.66 times lower gravity would have lead to significant different bodies. So it makes no sense to me whatsoever.

       Check out the Law of One: Ra Material
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can't help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of "God"/existence as well in session 13

       Lol. I mean i respect the amount of thought that went into this idea, but its based upon the premise that religious tales are literal representations of encoded historical events.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you read the genesis myth closely, its actually a tale of the birth of human psychology through the eternal conflict between confidence and doubt. And when you read it in that light it becomes a very clear argument for a certain view of the human condition transcending time and generation. As a thought experiment, go back and check out the text of genesis viewing every character, not as a person, but as a symbolic carrier of the original themes of eden replayed over and over throughout history as the ideas evolve over the course of the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religions are in no way factual, or even representative, depictions of actual historical events. (Excluding perhaps the great flood which pervades so many cultures that a good case has been made for it being an actual historical occurance) The realm of myth is there to inform us of who we are spiritually and psychologically through the use of symbols and characters whose circumstances and decisions reflect our own circumstances and decisions in ever day life. They are a roadmap to our inner selves and, i would argue, not a space map to mars.

       The first part of what you said is true. Theres no factual way to tell. But we can gather evidence and draw from it inference. So the second part of what you said is not true. The two ideas are not necessarily just as likely to be true just because we cannot be certain. I would argue theres alot more evidence in the text for my version of these events.

       I find this CIA experiment with Ingo Swann to be interesting and relevant:
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago. This is the result.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from "The Face on Mars", and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what it looks like on Google Earth (Mars):

       Who is Satan then? What motives could he have had? Maybe they we're space faring scientists terraforming our little solar system. Satan, gods favorite. Maybe some kind of unauthorized experiments?
      </p>
      <p>
       God places the first man and woman in a garden with trees of whose fruits they may eat, but forbids them to eat from "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"
      </p>
      <p>
       In Genesis 3, a serpent seduces the woman to eat from its forbidden fruit and she also lets the man taste it, God expels them from the garden and thereby from eternal life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eternal life? If we are talking about beings capable of terraforming and godly technology im sure they would have unlocked immortality. Heck we are already on the path to unlocking it ourselves and we have to be 1000s of years behind those beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we were originally intended to be a pure species free from the "knowledge of good and evil" maybe the creator realized giving immortality to humans now capable of evil would end very badly.

       But the tree does also represent free will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we were a pure utopian species but with no free will? Satan being one of the godly figures may have had pity on a planet full of intelligent life with no free will. We may have even been nothing but breeded work horses obviously taken care of because the bible says all the fruit and meat was for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we were similar to dogs. A utility species loved by their owner/creator and given good food and treatment but with no will no knowledge. Satan rebelled against god (our creator but also possibly our enslaver) and gave us that knowledge. God knowing what he had created could not survive destroyed the planet  (rain for 40 days and 40 nights). Wiping the slate clean and moving on.
