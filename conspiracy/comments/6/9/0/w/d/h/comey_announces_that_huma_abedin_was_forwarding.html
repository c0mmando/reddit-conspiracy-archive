    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In 1941, the U.S. Supreme Court heard a case which challenged whether the phrase “national defense” in this Espionage Law was too vague and overbroad. The answer was no onlybecause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“we find no uncertainty in this statute which deprives a person of the ability to predetermine whether a contemplated action is criminal under the provisions of this law. The obvious delimiting words in the statute are those requiring intent or reason to believe that the information to be obtained is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation. This requires those prosecuted to have acted in bad faith.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Supreme Court clearly never envisioned a prosecution under the Espionage Act without “intent” to injure the United States and in “bad faith.”  (This was in reference to a different section of the same law but the point remains the same.) Other courts have interpreted the phrase “national defense” narrowly as a direct result of the fact that on its face, the words seem so broad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She lost the presidential bid because of this.  It was her responsibility to have the best protection for classified information which she did not uphold.  She can blame Wikileaks, the timing of Comey&#39;s investigation, etc for her loss but it was the handling of classified information that caused the October issue that arguably may have cost her the election.  It usurped Trump&#39;s grab him by the vagina statement.  Her punishment was having Trump elected which is everything she detests.  Comey is not beyond reproach though.  The private letter hit news within minutes which either makes the FBI look bad or the committee that received the letter look bad.  Both sides need to look at this objectively and find the flaws in their operations and fix it so that investigations don&#39;t become politically motivated.</p>

<p>She was likely guilty of something though.  No one wipes servers without a reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>fficials from the Michigan secretary of state’s office have announced that they will pursue an audit of the vote in 20 precincts in Detroit after the recount turned up inconsistencies. By some estimates, a third of the city’s precincts were deemed not “recountable” because the number of voters recorded on Election Day did not match the number of ballots stored in containers in case of a recount.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the nytimes likes to gloss over is that all the recounts had various inconsistencies about machine number counts not matching actual ballot counts printed out from the same machine. So with shit like that going on how impossible is it to believe the votes were tampered with? The whole Jill Stein recount effort was the biggest fraud I have ever witnessed that people just bought up. In fact I remember seeing the donation page go up one night between the hours of 1am to 6am, go up by 125,000 per hour. I wish I had saved the thread where we all talked about it but alas I was tired and stupid thinking someone else would save the evidence.</p>

<p>I hope though that you dig deeper to get the full details instead of just reading what the spin is on the major propaganda pushers.. I mean news publishers say happened.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s not what it said. It said that the results were several standard deviations from the norm in states with no paper trail, and normal in states with a paper trail.</p>

<p>Exit polls varying by several standard deviations from elections are a standard way to determine that voting fraud has occurred.</p>

<p>And ignoring Mitt Romney in Pennsylvania in 2012. Bush in 2000 and 2004. And the fact that Hillary&#39;s friends own the voting machines.</p>

If I was France right now, I would watch the polls for any spikes in Le Pen without cause and confirm engagement with anti-Le Pen voters.  This group has watered down their ideals so that it appeals to the common man but when they no longer depend on those ideals, they will remove them fast.  </p>

<p>He literally tweeted it. The committee (head by Chaffetz) asked Comey for anything, Comey was obligated to give him the news that the FBI found new emails, and then Chaffetz tweeted about it.</p>

<p>Honestly, Chaffetz is one of the biggest pieces of shit in Congress. He&#39;s massively partisan in running the ethics committee. He outright said he&#39;d hammer Clinton with investigations, yet decided to not have a single one into Trump.</p>

<p>Looks like an excerpt from a book this page talks about &quot;Presidential Models&quot; that are privy to all the deep dark secrets because they are basically the sex slaves of the politicians. Anyway I cannot verify the authenticity or anything of these statements, but Hillary being a lesbian is a rumor that&#39;s been around for awhile. But she isn&#39;t totally a lesbian, just remembering how Bill Clinton admitted he shoots blanks (sterile) and seeing that chelsea before she grew up looked like a clone of Webb Hubbell. Anyway cheers mate.</p>
