       Remember, free speech equals $$! The Vatican just received the legal opportunity to buy a voice in American politics, and as the wealthiest organization on earth, presumably the "loudest" voice. Christian conservatives did not think this through, but I promise you, the Catholic Church has, and they are playing the loooong game. I grew up Catholic but I certainly don't want them setting US policy. Think I'm crazy? Here's the short list of Catholics in the Trump top administration: Mike Pence, Steve Bannon, KellyAnne Conway, Sean Spicer, Reince Preibus, John Kelley, Gen.Mattis, Gen. McMasters, Gen. Dunford, Andrew Puzdner, Wilbur Ross, Alexander Acosta, Mick Mulvany, and Andre Bremberg. Oh, lest I forget- Micheal Flynn, Carter Page, and Paul Manafort- ALL Catholic. And our Supreme Court has a Catholic majority 5-4! It's now a Vatican controlled New World Order ready to roll.

       I'm fairly convinced that there's a threshold at which it doesn't really matter. The Koch brothers are a good example. They don't like Trump and they have a
       <em>
        ton
       </em>
       more money than he does. So why not engineer their own candidate and put him in the WH? Hell, with Koch level money, why not own every political office from the WH on down? But they don't. And they haven't. And that's why I'm convinced that money can
       <em>
        help
       </em>
       a person get into an office but you still can't
       <em>
        buy
       </em>
       your way in.

       And ten other people on this sub think they're Rothschilds stooges. Or Mercer stooges. Or secret Zionists. Or what the hell ever. The fact is, there is no hard evidence that these people are controlled by any unified force. I'm not saying it's not possible to do favors for people once you get into the office, but it's not possible to just throw money at a candidate to guarantee they win the election.

       What is it that you don't get? Let me say it again: It is entirely possible for people to do favors for others once they take office, but if it was possible to simply buy your way into the WH with money and political connections, then Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, and John Kerry would all have been presidents by now.

       That's a pretty broad statement (about Hillary, al gore, and kerry). You have no idea man. They know what they're doing and we don't know what they're doing. It's impossible to say what things would've been like in certain scenarios.

       Oh come on. Saying "they" doesn't mean "secret illuminati group" lmao. There are individuals out there with corrupt agendas; you can't deny this. It's upsetting that you try to dismiss what I said when all I stated was an obvious fact. You can't predict what the outcome of a hypothetical scenario would be, especially considering what little knowledge the people have on what's actually happening in governments and affairs around the world. I said "they" because we do not truly know who holds the real power and I'm not going to pretend I do.

       I thought I smelled the Republican aroma wafting off of you. Despite your attempt to appear loftily objective, your Trumpism is showing. As a result, your opinion has no bearing on the topic at hand. I can't seriously consider the rationalization involved to follow a line of reasoning that completely discounts the effect Citizens United has had on this election.

       That order was penned by the CNP - Council for National Policy. The same CNP that's funded by the Mercer Family. The same Robert Mercer that funded Trumps campaign, who counts Bannon and Conway as long time family assets, who worked on Ted Cruz's campaign before Mercer switched support to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is anyone's executive order it's Robert Mercers, not Donald Trumps.

       Agreed, but regardless, it is Trump's administration and now it's our government. Though I do expect he's being duped, he meets with the Pope May 24th. Timing is everything.

       I brought up Mercer to highlight the wider agenda behind Trumps actions. You're aware he funded Breitbart as well, yes? Here we see a man who provides the means to pull of the greatest election shock in history: Trump was elected to President on a platform owned by Mercer, advised by his family assets, with his personal policy generator writing executive orders for him to sign...

       .. yet if you go across any top stories in the sub, or even check through the comments, and I doubt you'll see him mentioned at all outside of this dialogue.

       I've been watching Mercer since he dropped Cruz last summer, which I think is the reason Ted quit. Have you looked into his company, a giant algorhythmic electronic stock trade system called Cambridge Analytica, and how it was used in the campaign to manipulate voter info? Also, Mercer just happens to have a case before the IRS right now that is going to cost him $7 million if no one intervenes to have it dropped. It involves bundling derivatives on Wall Street to avoid taxes, and is the biggest part of the mess that caused the 2008 recession.

       Oh come on. Saying "they" doesn't mean "secret illuminati group" lmao. There are individuals out there with corrupt agendas; you can't deny this. It's upsetting that you try to dismiss what I said when all I stated was an obvious fact. You can't predict what the outcome of a hypothetical scenario would be, especially considering what little knowledge the people have on what's actually happening in governments and affairs around the world. I said "they" because we do not truly know who holds the real power and I'm not going to pretend I do.
