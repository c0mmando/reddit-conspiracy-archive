The Vatican just received the legal opportunity to buy a voice in American politics, and as the wealthiest organization on earth, presumably the &quot;loudest&quot; voice. Christian conservatives did not think this through, but I promise you, the Catholic Church has, and they are playing the loooong game. I grew up Catholic but I certainly don&#39;t want them setting US policy. Think I&#39;m crazy? Here&#39;s the short list of Catholics in the Trump top administration: Mike Pence, Steve Bannon, KellyAnne Conway, Sean Spicer, Reince Preibus, John Kelley, Gen.Mattis, Gen. McMasters, Gen. Dunford, Andrew Puzdner, Wilbur Ross, Alexander Acosta, Mick Mulvany, and Andre Bremberg. Oh, lest I forget- Micheal Flynn, Carter Page, and Paul Manafort- ALL Catholic. And our Supreme Court has a Catholic majority 5-4! It&#39;s now a Vatican controlled New World Order ready to roll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fairly convinced that there&#39;s a threshold at which it doesn&#39;t really matter. The Koch brothers are a good example. They don&#39;t like Trump and they have a <em>ton</em> more money than he does. So why not engineer their own candidate and put him in the WH? Hell, with Koch level money, why not own every political office from the WH on down? But they don&#39;t. And they haven&#39;t. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m convinced that money can <em>help</em> a person get into an office but you still can&#39;t <em>buy</em> your way in.</p>

<p>It hasn&#39;t been our government for some time now, but I see your point.</p>

<p>I brought up Mercer to highlight the wider agenda behind Trumps actions. You&#39;re aware he funded Breitbart as well, yes? Here we see a man who provides the means to pull of the greatest election shock in history: Trump was elected to President on a platform owned by Mercer, advised by his family assets, with his personal policy generator writing executive orders for him to sign...</p>

<p>.. yet if you go across any top stories in the sub, or even check through the comments, and I doubt you&#39;ll see him mentioned at all outside of this dialogue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been watching Mercer since he dropped Cruz last summer, which I think is the reason Ted quit. Have you looked into his company, a giant algorhythmic electronic stock trade system called Cambridge Analytica, and how it was used in the campaign to manipulate voter info? Also, Mercer just happens to have a case before the IRS right now that is going to cost him $7 million if no one intervenes to have it dropped. It involves bundling derivatives on Wall Street to avoid taxes, and is the biggest part of the mess that caused the 2008 recession. </p>
