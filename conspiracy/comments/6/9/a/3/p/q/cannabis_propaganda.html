       With the pinned post on this forum talking about propaganda,  does this news story seem to anyone else like they are trying to demonize the "Devils lettuce".

       I know people who have smoked all their life and this "story"  makes no sense.  Her shit was laced plain and simple,  or it aggravated an underlying condition.

       Very likely that the weed had anything to do with it, and more likely some prescription medicine that is conveniently not being talked about.

       Excessive, regular use of really strong weed can cause disassociation and depression and such, but that's about it. However, it also can speed up the processes of mental illness you're already going to get should you abuse it. Pot may have induced the schizophrenia, but this woman was already going to get it eventually.

       Okay so the study I think I was thinking of was probably relating to psychosis caused by LSD, but mostly I worded it poorly,
       <a href="/u/SativaGanesh">

       </a>
       had it worded better.

      <p>
       BUT, drug induced psychosis can mimic disorders like schizophrenia, and if left untreated, can continue to persist if you're already predisposed to it.

       LSD, moreso than other psychedelics, seems to not agree with some people (based purely off my own limited observations). That's not to say that ANY drug is free from the potential to essentially break your brain.

       It generally seems to only exacerbate underlying conditions. People don't go crazy from smoking weed, but some crazy people smoke weed.

       I mean how many violent crimes have been committed by opiate addicts, how many people have been killed or injured by a drunk driver, yet it's marijuana that's somehow the real threat to society.

       Exactly, in the same way stress and other life conditions can push people to the brink. I myself have had struggles with mental health and at certain points cannabis has helped, at others it's been something I've had to avoid. We should be informing people and helping each other to be responsible, not fear mongering.

       I do believe the point he was making is that: 
1) IF you already have a genetic predisposition to mental illness
2) AND you smoke lots of weed with high THC levels.
 3)  THEN it can speed up the onset of such illnesses and/or exacerbate their effects
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're right, without genetic predisposition, no amount of weed will 'make you crazy'

       see, we don't even know if that is true, it may be quite contrary. There is no hard evidence that says weed can or may trigger a 'dormant' mental illness. I know someone who is a schizophrenic who smoked and drank and it wasn't until he smoked meth that his dormant mental illness showed. Now the doctors told him the meth definitely triggered his episode and opened pandora's box of mental, however they also told him that it very likely would have happened with age, as it does with most people who are predisposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know weed can help with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and a list of other mental health issues, so for me, personally, it's hard to say weed, even at high levels, can bring on mental illness. That's just my experience tho.

       Right. If you are already likely to get a mental disorder with age, then maybe (just maybe) those disorders can appear sooner than they already were going to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Couple years back I was smoking with some friends (all longtime smokers). We were passing the joint around and one person out of the entire group has a full blown multisensory hahallucination and panics to the point where we actually called an ambulance. They tested his blood and the only thing in his system was MJ. To this day he swears that joint was laced with something.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a similar note, I know somebody who is genuinely allergic to pot and pot smoke. If she touches a bud she breaks out in hives, if you smoke around her, her throat starts to close up and she gets wheezy(not in some lame dramatic way, you can just hear it)
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive smoked almost every day for the last 12 years and insofar haven't experienced any seriously negative effects at all. Guess what I'm saying is everyone's experience is different, and not to ignore that what's fine for 99.99% of people might not be for that other .01%

       I too have ran into some people who couldn't take MJ, either cause they were allergic, which at first I was aghast that someone could be, but it's real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would wonder if the friend was taking any prescribed medication, cause if they test you and that shows up, it's prescribed, they're looking for illicit drugs. I just wonder.

       just met a guy gaming the other day who is allergic to MJ, said only a few really strong sativas dont make him instantly sick, but he doesnt risk it cause he usually gets really sick and throws up for a day.

       It could honestly be that most don't smoke weed until their late teens to twenties and most people don't display mental illness or seek diagnosis until their late teens to twenties

       Sure. I guess the end argument would be about correlation vs causation. And since until recently both subjects were too taboo to be discussed openly, there's not much census style data to fall on, making it all speculation for now.

       cannabis has been known to increase the likelihood of mental illness showing in those predisposed to it, this is why you shouldnt smoke as a minor, your brain hasnt fully developed and smoking weed can worsen the likelihood of a mental illness popping out.
