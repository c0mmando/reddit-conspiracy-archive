<p>With the pinned post on this forum talking about propaganda,  does this news story seem to anyone else like they are trying to demonize the &quot;Devils lettuce&quot;. </p>

<p>I know people who have smoked all their life and this &quot;story&quot;  makes no sense.  Her shit was laced plain and simple,  or it aggravated an underlying condition. </p>

<p>Thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe the point he was making is that: 
1) IF you already have a genetic predisposition to mental illness
2) AND you smoke lots of weed with high THC levels.
 3)  THEN it can speed up the onset of such illnesses and/or exacerbate their effects</p>

<p>But you&#39;re right, without genetic predisposition, no amount of weed will &#39;make you crazy&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>see, we don&#39;t even know if that is true, it may be quite contrary. There is no hard evidence that says weed can or may trigger a &#39;dormant&#39; mental illness. I know someone who is a schizophrenic who smoked and drank and it wasn&#39;t until he smoked meth that his dormant mental illness showed. Now the doctors told him the meth definitely triggered his episode and opened pandora&#39;s box of mental, however they also told him that it very likely would have happened with age, as it does with most people who are predisposed. </p>

<p>I know weed can help with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and a list of other mental health issues, so for me, personally, it&#39;s hard to say weed, even at high levels, can bring on mental illness. That&#39;s just my experience tho.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. If you are already likely to get a mental disorder with age, then maybe (just maybe) those disorders can appear sooner than they already were going to.</p>

<p>Couple years back I was smoking with some friends (all longtime smokers). We were passing the joint around and one person out of the entire group has a full blown multisensory hahallucination and panics to the point where we actually called an ambulance. They tested his blood and the only thing in his system was MJ. To this day he swears that joint was laced with something. </p>

<p>On a similar note, I know somebody who is genuinely allergic to pot and pot smoke. If she touches a bud she breaks out in hives, if you smoke around her, her throat starts to close up and she gets wheezy(not in some lame dramatic way, you can just hear it)</p>

<p>Ive smoked almost every day for the last 12 years and insofar haven&#39;t experienced any seriously negative effects at all. Guess what I&#39;m saying is everyone&#39;s experience is different, and not to ignore that what&#39;s fine for 99.99% of people might not be for that other .01%</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too have ran into some people who couldn&#39;t take MJ, either cause they were allergic, which at first I was aghast that someone could be, but it&#39;s real. </p>

<p>I would wonder if the friend was taking any prescribed medication, cause if they test you and that shows up, it&#39;s prescribed, they&#39;re looking for illicit drugs. I just wonder. </p>
