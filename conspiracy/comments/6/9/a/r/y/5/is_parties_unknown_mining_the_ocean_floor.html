       While reading this article I came across a interesting chain of comments:

        http://www.mining.com/worlds-first-seabed-mine-to-begin-production-in-2019/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All that follows is comments from that article, formating is not my strong suit so it's presented raw:

       " Michael White • a month ago
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1st big under-ocean-miner was in 2009 at 31deg 18' N by 23deg 14' W over 3 miles deep. The trenches were over 500' wide spaced 10 miles apart over a 100 mile by 100 mile grid. No small feat. United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs has not issued any permits in this area, nor is aware of any under-ocean-mining at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       See a new trench to the right of the above listed location cutting a trough from the Mediterranean to Dakar in Senegal Africa, visible on Google Earth. Note this trench is 5 miles wide, who can do that? Must be a ship with a side to side rover moving back and forth under a ship on the ocean floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill The bottom of the Gulf of Mexico was scraped and dug along the bottom of the Continental shelf on North, West and South sides still barely visible on Google Earth. After finishing the Gulf of Mexico the crew moved to Southern Southern California and began moving North in the Pacific two years ago. Their under-ocean miner swipes side to side over 4 to 5 miles wide then moves forward and swipes again. I assume they are scooping up globs of oil along the base of Continental bench at ocean floors. No clue who this is, UN and the oil co's don't admit anyone is mining. Must be a Govt involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this little adventure is late to the ocean-bottom-mining game.
Also, the tracks look to narrow, on the above pic, for ocean bottom goo, just saying.
      </p>

       Interesting. What was the company's name? What about the project? What kind of venture was it? Did it ever make it into production?
      </p>
      <pre><code>Michael White 

There are two groups mining the Pacific this year. One out of Hawaii and the other out of Pape'ete Island in French Polynesia Islands. You can see their 1 mile wide mining troughs leading from the islands on Google Earth.
</code></pre>
      <p>
       I talked to UN's ISA, they are clueless to any activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       To regulate seafloor mining, in 1994 the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea spawned the International Seabed Authority, or ISA, an independent treaty organization. It has jurisdiction over the seabed outside the exclusive economic zones that surround nations’ shorelines—an area it efficiently calls The Area. The term refers only to the seafloor, not to the waters above it (they’re called the “high seas” in legal parlance). The rules dictate that the ISA make licensing decisions and, remarkably, that a portion of all profits from mining in The Area be used to benefit the world’s developing countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never found out anything about who is ocean-bottom-mining. I annually monitor sea floors for activity via Google Earth. NOTHING. UN is clueless. Can't find anyone in oil biz who knows. And it is all in open seas so no nation would have given approval.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1st listed above is in Canary Basin west of Canary Islands was an actual deepwater trencher. All the rest are some form of "side to side" rover attached to a ship with a 1 mile swath of ocean floor at a time.

       Lately I've been digging into Antartica.  Back in the 1970's, there was a push to keep the UN out of Antarctica.  I kept running into talk of seabed mining in reference to manganese nodules.

       I set the seabed mining references aside to work on later.  I'll dig back in and post what I have.

       There's a spot near Antarctica that was discussed.

       The manganese nodules seem to be important.  There are cables discussing processing plants for them as well.

       We have been 'dredging' for centuries now, and under water mining is just a step up from that. We have FPSO's and the new Prelude vessel where the oil processing all happens underwater at source.

       The article you linked too, read the comments, no one that knows anything about Mining are taking it seriously. Some snake oil salesman has managed to get an exploration permit, that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To assume there is a secret company 'digging' up the ocean floor, shows you have little understanding of how difficult deep sea operations are.

       Well here's an actual subsurface miner saying someone is stripping the seafloor on a staggering scale, not dredging in the old bucket or suction hose style, but with huge crawlers, and non of the authorities he's contacted knows silch. Spotted the conspiracy yet?

       A guy on a website has commented that something is going on. 
Hasn't provided anything to back the claim other than "I monitor google earth annually".
      </p>
      <p>
       To consider google earth a reliable way to monitor the sea floor is insane. Otherwise we wouldn't pay millions for advance sonar and associated software systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wikileaks stuff posted earlier wasn't secretive, it was a set of meetings in the 70's to set the ground rules for whom gets mineral rights x-distance from their territories etc. And note they are talking about Hydrocarbons. That's oil or gas. Not minerals.

       I've been hearing something strange in Hawaii.
      </p>
      <p>
       Went camping deep in the North Coast of the big Island, nothing around except jungle and ocean, and heard what sounded like a jack hammer loudly from the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thought it was an animal noise because it only happened at night. Searching for similar sounds returned nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we're hearing the same sound very faintly in the distance like we're attuned to it. Happens in the day too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just figured it was a jack hammer, but it was clearly coming from the ocean when camping. Maybe it's this.

       I had someone tell me about a company that was trying to mine phosphates for fertilizer off the coast of Mexico... Not sure if that is of interest to you.
