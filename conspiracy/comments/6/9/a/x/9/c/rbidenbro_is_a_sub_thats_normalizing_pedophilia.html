       Good point. It's always been a propaganda platform. I guess I'm just shocked that people are buying into pedophilia of all fucking things. First, Bill Clinton next Joe Biden. It's obvious they are lubing-up (no pun intended) the Internet for a Biden 2020 campaign.

       Their was an image posted, I think it was on r/fakehistory. Originally of the Fonz in the 50/60s beside his bike but he was replaced with Biden. So I commented "How you know it's not Biden. He's not touching a young girl inappropriately." I've never been down voted as hard and as quickly.

       Google trends for 'Biden' and 'Joe Biden' show high interest in 2008, 2012, and 2016-2017.

       Now, just copy and paste that, fill in the blank with any liberal you like. Also try to mention Hillary's emails when you do it.

       We're talking about comments down playing pedophilia. Not solving who blew up the twin towers. Want proof? Go on the shithole of a sub yourself and be exposed to raw propaganda.

       My favorite professor in college gave a bad grade to a girl. She accused him of sexual assault that didn't happen in a revenge attempt. It was proven fake as all hell, but it still nearly ruined his career.

       Just because you disagree with evidence people have presented does not mean it doesn't exist. I would imagine 99% of people accused of being a pedo probably have a reason that people would think that. Its not like people are drawing names and randomly assigning meaning to them.

       It's not random. It's anyone connected to Hillary. It's a targeted smear campaign. The "evidence" is all just twisting people's words and seeing triangles in logos and stuff. Things you could use against any person on the planet. No victims, no witnesses, nothing. Just taking shit out of context and assigning meaning to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet with Trump, there are actual accusers. People saying "this man raped me as a child" - more evidence than there is against anyone from pizzagate - yet any time that is brought up, the comments are all "fake news!" and shit like that. While a hundred PG posts pop up everyday. Why are they treated so differently?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, there's a post today about one of Trump's guys
       <em>
        actually getting charged with human trafficking
       </em>
       , and it barely has any comments after 10 hours. If criminal charges of human trafficking were brought against someone from Hillary's camp, it would have exploded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sort this sub by top. HALF of the posts are about Hillary, even just dumb shit like "she bought fake twitter followers", and other non-news. Trump has multiple court cases against him for sexual assault and raping children, but he's nowhere to be found on the top posts.

       Hey guy, we think both sides are up to no good. Trump was probably fist-bumping Biden while raping some underage girl on Jeffery Epstein's rape-jet. There are mountains of evidence that all kinds of politicians are involved with pedophilia and child porn. Hillary is a demon. Stop defending her. Trump is a demon too. I know, it seems crazy for people to not pick a side. My point is that there are pedophiles running this country. Pieces of shit like you are diluting discussions and supporting the said demons. There is a dire need to end human trafficking, and I will gladly call out the cunts involved.

       Bidenbro is the quintessential example of the CIA's Memetics Department (real thing, thanks Wikileaks) at work.  Shitty forced memes shilled to the top, still didn't work out, but now it's a platform to plant divisive and degenerate ideas in people's heads.

       Exactly. It's clearly propaganda, but what's their goal? Is he going to run in 2020? I don't get it, but it's definitely there to make him look good online. Fuckin' bizzaro world we're living in.

       The same reason birdswitharms or prequelmemes exist. Someone posted one meme, people found it funny and ran with it. It the same as every other meme.

       Just because you disagree with evidence people have presented does not mean it doesn't exist. I would imagine 99% of people accused of being a pedo probably have a reason that people would think that. Its not like people are drawing names and randomly assigning meaning to them.
