    <div class="md"><p>Adding fluoride to the water supply was a cheap and easy way a local government could prevent dental diseases among its citizens. It was introduced as a practice when people still routinely died from tooth infections. Fluoride binds to enamel and creates a tougher compound that is harder for bacteria to wear away.

<p>Fluoride actually has a rich history of conflicts of interest, corruption, and even eugenics. It is actually a toxic byproduct of aluminum production and phosphorus mining. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a significant IQ drop. The real point is this should be a choice. If you feel you need fluoride you should take it. Why force everyone to take it when it poses a risk? That goes against the idea of informed consent. Also why bathe in it? Skin absolutely allows fluoride into the blood, just read the mds, probably in much higher dose than ingestion. And we got no benefit. Almost every toothpaste has fluoride in it. So why bathe in it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the concern. I was born in 1961 making me 55 and counting. I have had rotten teeth all my life due partly to a pharmaceutical drug my Mother was prescribed before I was born and partly due to too much sugar (most kids have this issue) and partly due to <em>smoking cigarettes</em> for 40+ years (which I gave up a year ago). I am much relieved to be free of the tooth aches, root canals, fillings, abscesses, x-rays and all of the other multiple horrors that accompany the &quot;Dentist&quot; experience. I had the misfortune of having to have a tooth pulled at the age of five years - while I still had other &quot;baby&quot; teeth. So, this would be about 1966. A Dentist office in 1966 looked, to young me, like Frankenstein&#39;s laboratory. That experience traumatized me severely for the rest of my life. So much so that needles (which I am not fond of to start with) to inject local freezing don&#39;t work on me at all - much to the amazement of many Dentists. But, I don&#39;t have to worry about all that horror any more. </p>

<p>Though, I don&#39;t imagine smoking cigarettes for 40 years did your teeth any favors. Congratulations on quitting!</p>

<p>And local anasthetics don&#39;t work anymore? Anasthetics aren&#39;t affected by trauma though. Maybe your dentist was just really shitty. Though what was the reason for the removal of your teeth at 5? Could it have been a disorder or maligned growth?</p>

<p>They never have. One Dentist had to use 9 needles before my jaw froze and I could <em>still</em> feel the pain.</p>

<p>Not on most people, no. But I&#39;m not &quot;most&quot; people.</p>

<p>Some where, yes. I have also had some very good Dentists. I have seen <em>countless</em> Dentists of all types of quality. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Though what was the reason for the removal of your teeth at 5?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t remember the reason. What I <em>do</em> remember was walking into a horror show, and leaving scared to death and in (to me at the time) much pain. You have to remember that in 1966 there were no computer aided equipment, no air assisted equipment and everything was real &quot;old school&quot; - just like to see in Western cowboy movies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could it have been a disorder or maligned growth?</p>

<p>I really can&#39;t say. But being just a wee five year old, I just did what I was told - and regretted it.</p>

<p>Thanks. But in the end (now) I am happy to report that I have only 5 teeth left, all bottom teeth. I have learned to manage without my Dentures (which, in my case, suck). So - life is good. No more &quot;Dentists&quot;. No more tooth aches. No more root canals. Life is finally good. Cheers, mate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the concern. I was born in 1961 making me 55 and counting. I have had rotten teeth all my life due partly to a pharmaceutical drug my Mother was prescribed before I was born and partly due to too much sugar (most kids have this issue) and partly due to <em>smoking cigarettes</em> for 40+ years (which I gave up a year ago). I am much relieved to be free of the tooth aches, root canals, fillings, abscesses, x-rays and all of the other multiple horrors that accompany the &quot;Dentist&quot; experience. I had the misfortune of having to have a tooth pulled at the age of five years - while I still had other &quot;baby&quot; teeth. So, this would be about 1966. A Dentist office in 1966 looked, to young me, like Frankenstein&#39;s laboratory. That experience traumatized me severely for the rest of my life. So much so that needles (which I am not fond of to start with) to inject local freezing don&#39;t work on me at all - much to the amazement of many Dentists. But, I don&#39;t have to worry about all that horror any more. </p>
