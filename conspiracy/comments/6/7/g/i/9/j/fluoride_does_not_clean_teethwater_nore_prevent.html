       After some extensive testing I have concluded that fluoride does not clean teeth, purify water, or prevent tooth decay. I think the the combined chemicals that we intake Can make us more susceptible to psyops or tracking if needed. another thought is that it is more of a prep for something.

       I can verify that. If Fluoride prevented tooth decay then I would still have all my teeth.

       Use Baking Soda and salt. Toothpaste is useless, and, even creates problems. Bathing in fluoride does no harm, as far as I know.

       Adding fluoride to the water supply was a cheap and easy way a local government could prevent dental diseases among its citizens. It was introduced as a practice when people still routinely died from tooth infections. Fluoride binds to enamel and creates a tougher compound that is harder for bacteria to wear away. Cmon guys use your noggins.

       Well that is how it is packaged and sold anyways.

       Fluoride actually has a rich history of conflicts of interest, corruption, and even eugenics. It is actually a toxic byproduct of aluminum production and phosphorus mining.

       The dose makes the poison. The study acknowledges that levels of fluoride in drinking water (in the US at least)  are far below levels that lead to these results. Read it.

       For a significant IQ drop. The real point is this should be a choice. If you feel you need fluoride you should take it. Why force everyone to take it when it poses a risk? That goes against the idea of informed consent. Also why bathe in it? Skin absolutely allows fluoride into the blood, just read the mds, probably in much higher dose than ingestion. And we got no benefit. Almost every toothpaste has fluoride in it. So why bathe in it?

       Then fuck off to a town where the water isn't fluoridated. My university's town doesn't have fluoridated water, God knows why. It's the same reasoning as vaccines. The social benefit outweighs the individual risk by magnitudes. And if you don't like situation, you are free to not partake in the public school system. Makes perfect sense.

       Thanks for the concern. I was born in 1961 making me 55 and counting. I have had rotten teeth all my life due partly to a pharmaceutical drug my Mother was prescribed before I was born and partly due to too much sugar (most kids have this issue) and partly due to
       <em>
        smoking cigarettes
       </em>
       for 40+ years (which I gave up a year ago). I am much relieved to be free of the tooth aches, root canals, fillings, abscesses, x-rays and all of the other multiple horrors that accompany the "Dentist" experience. I had the misfortune of having to have a tooth pulled at the age of five years - while I still had other "baby" teeth. So, this would be about 1966. A Dentist office in 1966 looked, to young me, like Frankenstein's laboratory. That experience traumatized me severely for the rest of my life. So much so that needles (which I am not fond of to start with) to inject local freezing don't work on me at all - much to the amazement of many Dentists. But, I don't have to worry about all that horror any more.

       Wow, that doesn't sound pleasant at all.

       Though, I don't imagine smoking cigarettes for 40 years did your teeth any favors. Congratulations on quitting!

       And local anasthetics don't work anymore? Anasthetics aren't affected by trauma though. Maybe your dentist was just really shitty. Though what was the reason for the removal of your teeth at 5? Could it have been a disorder or maligned growth?

       They never have. One Dentist had to use 9 needles before my jaw froze and I could

       feel the pain.

       Some where, yes. I have also had some very good Dentists. I have seen
       <em>
        countless
       </em>
       Dentists of all types of quality.

      <p>
       To be honest, I don't remember the reason. What I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       remember was walking into a horror show, and leaving scared to death and in (to me at the time) much pain. You have to remember that in 1966 there were no computer aided equipment, no air assisted equipment and everything was real "old school" - just like to see in Western cowboy movies.

       I really can't say. But being just a wee five year old, I just did what I was told - and regretted it.

       Thanks. But in the end (now) I am happy to report that I have only 5 teeth left, all bottom teeth. I have learned to manage without my Dentures (which, in my case, suck). So - life is good. No more "Dentists". No more tooth aches. No more root canals. Life is finally good. Cheers, mate.

       I have no idea either. I've been trying to clean fluoride and metals from my diet and have seen incredible changes in my health(mostly due to it being a healthy diet in general) but I can't find a good way to completely eliminate certain things.

       Just for my initial weight loss goal, fruits are very high in carbs. I've maintained ketosis for three weeks by cutting my carbs down less than 5g a day. I also eat &lt;1800 calories a day.

      <p>
       6,3 230lbs, my target is 190. As I approach 200 i'll start to re-introduce sugar and maintain the caloric deficit.

       Well the purifying water is a known fact, i just threw that in there to nullify another argument.  but fluoride on its does not clean teeth, the abrasive texture of the toothpaste is what cleans teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The study was focused on reversing and strengthening tooth enamel and dentin decay by using tablets of Sodium fluoride. The sodium fluoride effects were nil to minimal. Whereas the calcium magnesium group had moderate to significant enamel and dentine strengthening.

       What about the NDA you mentioned before? And u/a_trashcan makes the good point that you wouldn't know anyone else's results. Surely if this was a study where they decided to use an NDA, because it sounds like there were super-secret substances involved, them telling you all that is odd.

       if fluoride prevented tooth decay we would rarely need dentists. The degenerative condition Alzheimer's has recently been linked to the calcification of the brain or build up of plaque. The number of people encountering this condition at a younger age and in general has risen dramatically since it was introduced to the water supply. It calcifies the Pineal gland. And HITLER thought it was a good idea.

       No one has ever claimed fluoride cleans teeth or water. There are very many peer reviewed studies, hundred of them, showing that fluoride  prevents cavities.

       Smart Water...funny, I wonder if they're called that for a reason.

       Isn't Aquafina also very low? It's purified by reverse osmosis.

       Thanks for the concern. I was born in 1961 making me 55 and counting. I have had rotten teeth all my life due partly to a pharmaceutical drug my Mother was prescribed before I was born and partly due to too much sugar (most kids have this issue) and partly due to
       <em>
        smoking cigarettes
       </em>
       for 40+ years (which I gave up a year ago). I am much relieved to be free of the tooth aches, root canals, fillings, abscesses, x-rays and all of the other multiple horrors that accompany the "Dentist" experience. I had the misfortune of having to have a tooth pulled at the age of five years - while I still had other "baby" teeth. So, this would be about 1966. A Dentist office in 1966 looked, to young me, like Frankenstein's laboratory. That experience traumatized me severely for the rest of my life. So much so that needles (which I am not fond of to start with) to inject local freezing don't work on me at all - much to the amazement of many Dentists. But, I don't have to worry about all that horror any more.

       What's your point? Chlorine is a poisonous gas, and sodium explodes when it comes in contact with water. But put them together and it's delicious on your chips. Think about that for a long while.
