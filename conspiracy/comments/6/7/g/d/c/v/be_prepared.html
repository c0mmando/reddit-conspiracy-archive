    <div class="md"><p>I honestly believe we&#39;ve been lied to about reality and all this fear porn is meant to, ultimately, lead humanity to question what it is. That&#39;s the point of all this suffering. There <em>is</em> a point. And it&#39;s to recognize that the real you cannot know fear. You are not &#39;thought&#39;; rather, you are the awareness in which Thought appears. We&#39;ve misunderstood reality for centuries and our &#39;mistake&#39; has created a dense reality, full of suffering. I won&#39;t be preparing for any nuclear threat, personally, because I literally feel no fear. I have no motive to live other than to simply enjoy being, in this moment. I&#39;m going to roll with it, because I don&#39;t fear death. Fear only exists when you still believe you are your ego, which creates the sensation of &#39;lack&#39; which is the root cause of fear and anxiety. Let go of lack, let go of need, and understand that all this shit is a play being put on by the universe, in a sense, and we are watching it for the purpose of it driving us to question who and what we are. </p>

<p>When you accept that you literally know nothing, all this shit is a lot easier to swallow. We can use the Bible as reference for finding a motive to stay alive, but tptb undoubtedly tampered with its legitimacy, so even the Bible isn&#39;t something I can trust completely. I&#39;m not trying to be anyone, or maintain anything. That shit is so false and illusory. It just feels like it&#39;s time for all these sick attachments we all hold to this false reality to finally come to an end, and I am cool with that. </p>

<p>If you are one to prepare, that&#39;s all good. I&#39;m just underlining how some people feel and experience reality differently than the masses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re definitely right about the nature of our reality, this life isn&#39;t all there is I believe that. But our current existence is what we know for sure at this time and our bodies are a vessel for our consciousness so we should try to save it imo. Being free from the fear of death is the ultimate freedom so that&#39;s good. I do believe realistic preparation or a &quot;go bag&quot; or something of that nature is just smart. But ultimately this game is going to play out regardless of what we do. </p>

<p>The best thing you can do is bug in. Stay where you are, stay inconspicuous, and secure your home and assets. Live off of supplies and stores long enough for everything to metastabilize, and you can scavenge and hunt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on, brother.  But most people don&#39;t know <em>how</em> to prepare.  Here&#39;s a quick starter:</p>

<h2>Core Concepts</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Situational Awareness:</strong>  You should always start your preparations from a mental &amp; spiritual point of view.  This includes things like immediate physical environment (blind spots from which your house can be approached?  up on a hill or in a valley?  natural barriers?  etc), demographic surroundings (any people or groups that cause concern?  anyone with special skills in your neighborhood that would be useful?  any like-minded people in your area?  etc), and what I call <em>world pulse</em> (what&#39;s in the news?  are there any indicators of upcoming man-made disasters?  etc).  A good resource for the world pulse can be found <a href="http://modernsurvivalblog.com/survival-blogroll/">here</a>.
Spiritually-speaking, you have to be prepared for the reality that people will die in the event of a disaster, and that you may be in that number.  Face your mortality, come to grips with it, and know that you <em>will</em> someday die, and that day might be today.  Once you&#39;ve worked that out -- and it isn&#39;t easy -- then you&#39;re less prone to panic in emergency situations and more likely to act quickly and decisively, which <em>will</em> save your life and the lives of those around you should you survive the initial event.  Get to know that &quot;higher power&quot; in which you can place your trust, faith, and confidence, and you&#39;ll hold your own life with an open hand.
Also, do <em>not</em> rely on emergency services like 911 -- assume the standard communications lines will be down, and that emergency personnel will be otherwise too occupied to respond anyway.  Take ownership and responsibility for your <em>own</em> well-being and for that of your family.  Even if your wife looks at you like you&#39;re a total whack-job, it&#39;s worth the peace of mind that comes with reasonable preparedness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-term prep:</strong> <em>Most</em> disaster scenarios resolve within about 72 hours.  This is your standard weather event, earthquake, power grid disruption, hostage/terrorist situation, or any other of the more common types of emergency situation.  Even solo-events, <a href="http://modernsurvivalblog.com/survival-kit/preparedness-items-to-bring-when-traveling-in-your-car-or-truck/">like running your car off into a ravine</a> where you aren&#39;t easily seen, generally resolve in rescue within that period of time.  But most people can&#39;t survive three days because they haven&#39;t taken basic precautions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-term prep:</strong> In the event that some situation lasts more than 72 hours, you need a plan.  Does your situation allow for you to sit tight and wait it out?  Or do you need to bug out to a fall-back location?  There is no set answer for an individual as each scenario will present different opportunities and challenges.  Prepare for <em>both</em> options -- plan to have long-term food backup, a source of potable water (or way to purify available non-potable sources), and enough personal protection to last -- and ammo will be <em>great</em> for barter purposes in long-term events.  Mentally note fall-back locations like national parks, uninhabited areas, vacant warehouses, etc.  Then draw up a plan with your family, rehearse it, and make sure they know what to do and where to go in an emergency situation.  Again, assume cell phones will not work, and keep GMRS band radios handy in case something new and unexpected comes up.
A contentions topic is the firearms question.  Do you really need a gun for emergency preparedness?  Well, let me ask you this:  What will you do a few weeks after the complete halt of shipping and distribution, the stores are empty, and people have banded together to begin taking resources?  When an armed group of thugs decides they want your food, your water, and your wife?  Are you going to politely ask them to stop and be reasonable?  <strong>You need at least one firearm, and you *must know how to use it.</strong>*
Optimally, you have a semi-automatic .223 / 5.56 AR-15 with several 40-round magazines of XM855, a single-shot bolt-action long-range rifle with scope, a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun with high-grain shot <em>and</em> slugs, and three people who can simultaneously and skillfully operate each one.  And everyone should have their own side-arm and blade.  This is not about being a local Rambo.  This is Tactics 101.  If you have this setup, and if you really know how to use your weapon, you&#39;re far more likely to survive a situation when you&#39;re out-numbered and out-gunned.  Personally, I find tactics, rehearsal, and training to be the most important component of the defensive aspect of preparedness.
And the most under-rated component, yet most critical piece of long-term prep, is community.  You can have the largest armory and the biggest dick in town, but if you don&#39;t have community, someone will take everything you have.  Get to know people in your local area who are like-minded.  Start having discussions with them about planning.  Not a huge group -- just a core of about 3 or 4 families with diverse skills.  If your core is strong, your community will grow naturally when the time comes.  Ensure you trust these people with your life, and make sure they can trust you with theirs.</p></li>

<p>Then remember that living in fear is of no benefit to you or your family. I&#39;ve seen too many people fall into this trap (myself included), but it is counter-productive, causes stress (which is detrimental to your mind and body), and robs you of the life God intends you to have. For we are not given a spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m familiar with this concept and it does resonate with me, I have found the Bible to be a good authority on taking back free will and to recognize what has happened to this reality we find ourselves in. I found my center and have taken control of my emotions as I am no longer swayed easily by anything I see or hear that is supposed to evoke an emotional reaction or fear or any other negative energies. I believe the NWO system is these dark entities last grasp on total control over mankind as they can no longer sway us or control us like they used to, that is why we will need divine intervention to save us or no flesh would survive these events. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cash won&#39;t really mean anything if anything HUGE happens. You&#39;re going to want access to food and water, a guaranteed shelter (camping tent), means of making and sustaining fire, a firearm with plenty of bullets (the new currency), first aid, and a whole lotta luck. Also a gas mask and full tank of gas wouldn&#39;t hurt. Basically pretend you are going on the most intense camping trip of your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly believe we&#39;ve been lied to about reality and all this fear porn is meant to, ultimately, lead humanity to question what it is. That&#39;s the point of all this suffering. There <em>is</em> a point. And it&#39;s to recognize that the real you cannot know fear. You are not &#39;thought&#39;; rather, you are the awareness in which Thought appears. We&#39;ve misunderstood reality for centuries and our &#39;mistake&#39; has created a dense reality, full of suffering. I won&#39;t be preparing for any nuclear threat, personally, because I literally feel no fear. I have no motive to live other than to simply enjoy being, in this moment. I&#39;m going to roll with it, because I don&#39;t fear death. Fear only exists when you still believe you are your ego, which creates the sensation of &#39;lack&#39; which is the root cause of fear and anxiety. Let go of lack, let go of need, and understand that all this shit is a play being put on by the universe, in a sense, and we are watching it for the purpose of it driving us to question who and what we are. </p>

<p>When you accept that you literally know nothing, all this shit is a lot easier to swallow. We can use the Bible as reference for finding a motive to stay alive, but tptb undoubtedly tampered with its legitimacy, so even the Bible isn&#39;t something I can trust completely. I&#39;m not trying to be anyone, or maintain anything. That shit is so false and illusory. It just feels like it&#39;s time for all these sick attachments we all hold to this false reality to finally come to an end, and I am cool with that. </p>

<p>If you are one to prepare, that&#39;s all good. I&#39;m just underlining how some people feel and experience reality differently than the masses. </p>
