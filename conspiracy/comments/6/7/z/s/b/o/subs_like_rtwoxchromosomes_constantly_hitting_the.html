        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems that there really is not an aborted child that <a href="/r/TwoXChromosomes">/r/TwoXChromosomes</a> doesn&#39;t like.  Every other day the front page is graced with that sub&#39;s enlightened viewpoints (just look at the comment section for the articles they post) of venomous hatred for children and anything to do with child-rearing</p>

<p>The entire philosophy over there seems to be the agenda foisted on society at large: &quot;children can only be bad for you, the family is an evil institution, have as much sex as possible and expect others to pay for it.&quot;</p>

<p>All this seems to come straight from the pages of Aduous Huxley&#39;s 1932 novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;.  Words like &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Father&quot; were seen as disgusting and pornographic, while real porn was freely available along with contraceptption (this book was written decades before the Pill was created).  Families didn&#39;t exist and child birth was all but outlawed.  Natural childbirth was looked as something shameful and revolting. Communal sexual activity was encouraged and indeed enforced, to keep out the family unit from forming and being a viable source of values to children, who have to rely on the state and the propaganda-laced media as the source of their values. </p>

<p>I think Huxley summed up the philophy of the vile harpies at TXC quite well. Just look at the comments of the posts. These people hate human life and natural social systems with an undying passion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because those people probably have low self esteem and probably hate themselves. You see this often w the liberal left. They are degenerates who despise the normal traditions and values of the people. </p>

<p>They have no morals.
No pride.
No confidence.
They are often unattractive or overweight.
They don&#39;t want other people to be happy because they aren&#39;t happy.</p>

<p>Just a few reasons off the top of my head.. don&#39;t let it bother you, they will be sad the rest of their lives. The best thing to do is to make sure you live a fulfilled life and be as happy as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Liberals pervert morals. Liberals pervert traditional values. Trump has a normal family and plays a traditional gender role within his family unit. So idk where you&#39;re getting Trump has bad morals? I said he betrayed the right when he bombed Syria among other moves he&#39;s made.</p>

<p>And for the 5th time I&#39;m NOT a conservative. Trump was elected because the left is full of self loathing whites and racist minorities and the silent majority of white people saw through their BS and wanted to send a message that we are still the majority and we did, successfully. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say it was a &#39;normal family&#39; I said it was a traditional family or at least that&#39;s what I meant. You know, man.. woman.. children.

<p>No I don&#39;t live on a farm, I live near a big city. No I don&#39;t think only minorities are racist but they sure do voice their racist a lot more than white people. The BLM is racist, obviously. The White lives matter group has been labeled a hate group but it&#39;s okay for the BLM. That&#39;s racist.</p>

<p>You&#39;re obviously still reeling from the last election, you better get use to it. I doubt there will be a dem in office for a long, long time. So kiss your perverted liberal utopia goodbye, for awhile at least.</p>

<p>He probably won&#39;t get re-elected but itll still be another republican in 4 years, you can count on that :)</p>

<p>The traditional family unit, they would rather two lesbians or two homosexuals raise a child.</p>

<p>The traditional male and female roles, they would rather have mommy in construction and daddy playing house.</p>

<p>Also, the left despises traditional sexual relationships. They would rather have females w females and men w men or females w animals or men w transsexuals. Along w needing new bathrooms for all. :)</p>

<p>That&#39;s just a few off the top of my head but there are many more.</p>

<p>Absolutely not. Children are children and cannot consent to sexual activities.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather have all orphans raised by lesbians who love each other (because, hey, you&#39;re the one who said they need moms and dad&#39;s are nurturing. I guess TWO moms must be automatically better, huh?) than have any more children go through foster care in this country. The system is a fucking wreck. </p>

<p>Maybe instead of criticizing everyone else you put some effort into actually fixing society and proving that your way is right. Because the way I see it one group is actually out there helping kids out of the system and the other is sitting on their ass calling them gross from behind a keyboard.</p>

<p>Also &quot;men aren&#39;t nurturing by nature&quot; my ass. It sounds like you had some shitty male role models.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So you don&#39;t have evidence of your opinion and want me to find it for you. Fine. Yes, there were protests. Protests were not the cause of the change. The APA held a symposium to review the inclusion of homosexuality in the DSM. A subcommittee tasked to review this concluded &quot;“reviewed the characteristics of the various mental disorders and concluded that, with the exception of homosexuality and perhaps some of the other ‘sexual deviations’, they all regularly caused subjective distress or were associated with generalized impairment in social effectiveness of functioning”. They decided to remove it from the DSM, and the members of the APA voted to uphold that decision with a majority vote.</p>

<p>Is there any reason for me to believe that you somehow know better than the majority of the American Psychological Association as to what constitutes a mental disorder? Again, saying &#39;no&#39; will save us both time.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So are the 70s the cut off? By the 1970s we had psychology figured out, and any changes after that were due to political correctness? </p>

<p>You&#39;ve got no evidence, you&#39;ve got prejudice and hatred.</p>

<p>Untrue. They just want people who would ALREADY BE TOGETHER (in this case, lesbians) to be able to raise children together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The traditional male and female roles, the left would rather have mommy in construction and daddy playing house.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also untrue. Third wave feminism is one thing, but at the core of it what they&#39;re trying to say is that men should be allowed to stay home with children if that&#39;s what they want, and that women should be breadwinners if that&#39;s what they want. Why the fuck would you ever want a child to be raised by a parent that doesn&#39;t want to be doing that job. If the dad is the better stay-at-home parent then he sure as fuck should be allowed to do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol you&#39;re so brainwashed and indoctrinated by your precious Marxist ideology you can&#39;t even see the harm it does to society. </p>

<p>Feminists brainwash women to believe that a career is more important than a family. If a parent doesn&#39;t want to raise a child then they shouldn&#39;t have children! There&#39;s no choice in the matter, once you have a child. Do you realize how hard it is for a woman to be a breadwinner over the man? It RARELY occurs and then when she can&#39;t make more money than her man..</p>

<p>It causes resentment. There&#39;s tons of ways and reasons why your disgusting Marxist ideology should be eradicated off the face of the planet but I digress. </p>

<p>I do not think that word means what you think it means. You&#39;re just using it as an insult. We aren&#39;t talking about economics here, and you can&#39;t just use &quot;Marxist&quot; to mean &quot;Things I disagree with.&quot; Words have meanings.</p>

<p>Also career IS more important than having children. Women should absolutely learn skills that can earn them money before they have children <strong>because other people cannot be trusted to take care of them and their children.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve got some news for you pal. &quot;Feminism&quot; as we know it wouldn&#39;t exist if men could be relied upon to treat their women well and raise their children. If you could <em>guarantee</em> a woman that she and her children would be cared for if she didn&#39;t get an education then you&#39;d <em>never</em> have seen so many women gravitate towards feminism.</p>

<p>But you know what? You can&#39;t guarantee that. every time a women has sex in this country she&#39;s risking her personal health to bring a child into this world, a child which may or may not have two parents willing to take care of it.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t you dare pull the &quot;well women shouldn&#39;t have sex unless they&#39;re married&quot; card here, because there are countless men every god damned day who straight-up abandon their children. And why should they care? There are no negative consequences for them if they leave. They could have been the sweetest, kindest man before they got married, but as soon as the going gets rough the temptation is there. </p>

<p>They find themselves thinking &quot;Why do I have to provide for this woman? Why do I have to care for this child? I never did before?&quot; and off they go.</p>

<p>So what happens then? Then the woman has to find a way to provide for her child. If she has no skills she&#39;s reliant on another person to care for her, like a fucking child, when she has a child of her own to care for.</p>

<p>But if that woman studies? If she gets a degree? Then she&#39;s safer, because even if her husband bails she can still find employment and give her child a decent chance at a normal life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol there are no negative consequences if a man leaves his woman and child? Haven&#39;t you ever heard of child support? Men still have to pay for their child even if they aren&#39;t w the woman any longer. And there you go typical feminist blaming men for gravitating towards feminism. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not men&#39;s fault women gravitate towards feminism. It&#39;s the medias fault for brainwashing women into believing this fairy tale that they don&#39;t need men. Empowering, my ass. It&#39;s destructive to a woman&#39;s mind. Women are easily influenced that&#39;s why when they go out w their &quot;girls&quot; they act 10x more annoying and slutty, because they are easily influenced by their degenerate friends, much like feminism.</p>

<p>Women shouldn&#39;t have to worry about a degree. If we didn&#39;t have sissy liberal men walking around more women would have men that stuck around and foot the bill for them. But noo in this day and age we have weak beta male liberal boys that run away from their woman and child because it&#39;s &quot;too hard&quot; to be a real man and be there for your family.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not men that are ruining women, it&#39;s your degenerate liberal utopia that you love so much, that we live in, that is ruining it for you. </p>

<p>If you knew the history of child support, you wouldn&#39;t be undermining your own argument by citing it as an example.

<p>Every single man I&#39;ve ever known who ran from his family (going back to the 1930s) considered himself to be a &quot;real man&quot; who defined himself by his physical strength and  his &quot;lack of emotions&quot; when really they were hyper-emotional manchildren who never learned to cope with their feelings. Not one man who people like you consider &quot;weak&quot; has done anything of the sort and those of them with children have families that adore them because they actually spend time with their children and prove time and time again to their children and their wives that they love them and aren&#39;t ashamed of that fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you call a man paying for his child a punishment? I call it a duty as a man. And women may have fought for child support laws, but in the end it was a man who made it law. Men are the ones who gave women rights, don&#39;t forget that. We didn&#39;t have to do that but we did that because western men take good care of their women, better care than any other civilization even today in the modern world. Look at how Arabic women are treated, for example.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m pretty sure you didn&#39;t know any man in the 1930s that would make you pretty old. You&#39;re making assumptions that all men have little care in the world for their families which is so incredibly untrue I&#39;m still wondering how you could make such outrageous claims, but that&#39;s a liberal for ya. </p>

<p>Liberals are so indoctrinated and brainwashed to the point that they don&#39;t even know what&#39;s true and untrue anymore they just spew the same rhetoric, over and over. It&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>And yet if men could be relied upon to do their &quot;duty&quot; (as you call it) then the law wouldn&#39;t be necessary would it? </p>

<p>I was referencing my grandmother&#39;s father, who beat her and her mother, then left her mother for a women who was only 16 at the time they got married. It set the tone for how the rest of the women in that family line would behave for the next 70 years.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>These are the kinds of statements that make women push women towards feminism. Stop blaming the big bad media and shadowy evil forces. Women are people and can think for themselves just as men can. In the case of things like these two statements right here, any decently intelligent women who has studied history would understand that what you just said is a threat. &quot;We gave you rights, you better be good or we&#39;ll take them away.&quot;</p>

<p>If a woman starts believing that all men are like you, why would she ever want to marry someone like you or have a child with you, knowing that you don&#39;t see her a partner to raise a family with, but as someone to be controlled by you. Why should she ever risk her safety to be with someone she thinks thinks he is entitled to harming her if she does something that displeases him?</p>

<p>It&#39;s happened before on a society-wide scale, after all. I mean, you were the one that brought up the middle east. Women there in the 70s had rights, they could live and thrive and protect themselves, and that was all taken away from them. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/16/boxed/women-and-saudi-arabias-male-guardianship-system">Now they can&#39;t even do the most basic things without a man&#39;s permission.</a> </p>

<p>Face the facts, man. The world doesn&#39;t work the way either one of us wishes it did. You and I may disagree, a lot, and this argument has been fun, but I think we can both agree things are fucked up out there. Otherwise we wouldn&#39;t even be talking to each other <em>here</em> on this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep deflecting. You know what you were implying. And stop typing like that because white people don&#39;t type like that so it doesn&#39;t make sense. You try to play stupid like minorities don&#39;t often use hillbilly to describe white people they think are dumb. </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what you were implying and then you went off and called &quot;my women fat&quot; as if all white women are fat? White women are statistically less obese than every other minority races women.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not playing the victim lol you aren&#39;t even close to being enough of a threat for me to ever be any sort of victim. You&#39;re just saying things that don&#39;t make sense that I&#39;m trying to understand. </p>

<p>If you were implying all white people are hillbillies then why don&#39;t you enlighten me on what you meant? Or can&#39;t you because it was a racial slur?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you read up on it? There are a TON of valid reasons to be scared of procreation. I don&#39;t think the issue is brainwashing, I think the issue is what happened to female relationships. In the old days women spent a lot of time talking with each other about sexual things (always behind closed doors before). Female children were exposed to childbirth and child rearing from an easy age (babysitting is absolutely not a good replacement for this whatsoever) and knew the risks involved. They learned from their mothers and sisters and they knew how to keep each other safe, healthy, and alive as best they could. </p>

<p>Nowadays women never talk to their children about sex and childbirth, it&#39;s considered taboo and overly sexual, so women don&#39;t learn it anymore. Instead they find out about it in unnatural ways or they never learn about it at all until they have children and find themselves traumatized by the experience. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fucked up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why fewer people want children, is because we as a global culture go out of our way to make life hard for children and their parents.</p>

<p>In the good old days, children would spend most of their time laying on their mother/father&#39;s chest, peacefully forming the crucial bonds between parent and child.</p>

<p>Now, with C-section, vaccination and a host of other unspeakable medical procedures, every attempt is made to break those loving bonds.</p>

<p>The people you see on r/childfree are not &#39;socially dysfunctional leftists&#39;. They are normal people like you and me, who probably had an unusually traumatic birth experience.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more please google &#39;Jeanice Barcelo&#39;.</p>

<p>The second issue is taxation. Governments do not need to collect their currency in order to spend it, this has been admitted by Beardsley Ruml, Paul Samuelson, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke. </p>

<p>The ever increasing amount of tax we pay (not just in income tax but on consumer items) is part of the reason why both parents must now work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but dude, do you know what happens to a woman&#39;s body during childhood? It&#39;s not as simple as popping a baby out and going back to normal. Being pregnant and having the child can KILL YOU. What&#39;s more, women these days (In the US, Canada, and western Europe at least) don&#39;t have the social networks they used to have. Instead of having a sister or a mother around to take care of you and your baby, you have to do it all yourself. </p>

<p>C-sections can save women&#39;s lives, and even if the women&#39;s life isn&#39;t in danger, an easier birth means the mother is able to recover more quickly and take care of her child better.</p>

<p>I mean FUCK, dude. Human babies aren&#39;t even <em>done</em> when we pop them out, by normal standards all human infants are premees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re also trying to say shit like how empowering it is to keep their last names when they get married b/c they don&#39;t belong to anyone.  I&#39;ve never felt that was the reason for a woman taking a man&#39;s last name in marriage but these feminists think it&#39;s like their man pissing on their territory.  Shit&#39;s getting way out of hand from lefties.  And don&#39;t worry people, I don&#39;t dislike lefties at all, I&#39;m a center guy, my lady is a lefty, but the shit they&#39;re trying to pull is a fucking disgrace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My whole childhood and adolescence all I wanted was a partner and a family etc. Part of me will always want it. I&#39;m not religious at all, I&#39;ve been agnostic since 6-8 yrs old. I didn&#39;t find anyone who shared this dream, all I found was heartbreak and betrayal. I&#39;ll always love all of them but they didn&#39;t share my dream I guess. That made me re-think my existence. I can&#39;t blame them, and I can&#39;t blame myself. I&#39;ve tried so hard to blame myself and figure out what I did wrong in my life... Can&#39;t find it. Nobody is to blame in that situation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably never have kids at this point, I&#39;m not bringing anybody into this world of shit until it starts to look like it&#39;s getting better. It&#39;s not fair to them to bring them into a world where everything is in an epic downturn. I don&#39;t want to believe this wholeheartedly though, because some things are getting better.... but we lose more freedoms and part of our humanity every single day. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t ask to be born and neither did I...</p>

<p>Kids are expensive these days. The times where a family of 8 can live on a single breadwinner is over. People want families, but they know it is reckless without the resources to do so. Hard economic times cause people to be frugal, and that includes life decisions such as family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Western women in the USA are not too into the idea of becoming mothers because being a mother in a society that requires you to have a two-person income per household is extremely difficult to pull off. 
Daycare for ONE child is on average 1000/per month. A lot of people can&#39;t afford this and pay other bills with an average salary. Rent is high, insurance is hardly affordable, and almost everyone is in some kind of student debt. </p>

<p>I am pregnant with my first and there is no way that I can afford to work outside the home. I am lucky that I have a family that can help me out and a partner who is sticking around, not everyone has this I would argue to say that most people my age do not (22 yo). A lot of people come from broken families and have partners that are commitment-phobes. Do you know how difficult it is to find a partner who wants to settle down in this day and age?</p>

<p>What woman in her right mind would want to raise a child where financial stability is rare, partners are non-committal, and family support is hard to come by? Sound-minded women are selective when it comes to having children because they want to avoid raising fuck ups.
Don&#39;t blame women for speaking out about how shit the world has become for child-rearing.
I&#39;m sure that there are many women who would kill to be in my position as a mother because it&#39;s an impossible choice for them in our current society.</p>

<p>That said, though. I&#39;m absolutely down for women-related conspiracy theories. I&#39;d love to see any that anyone has.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I don&#39;t mean conspiracy theories ABOUT women, but I mean things like the forced sterilization of women (confirmed to be real) and the birth-control placebo-week thing that&#39;s also real but people just don&#39;t know about.</p>

<p>This sort of thinking leads to men who can&#39;t communicate with their wives or children. They just scream, yell, and hit when they don&#39;t get their way. Your definition of masculinity leads to the creation of emotionally-stunted manchildren.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you call a man paying for his child a punishment? I call it a duty as a man. And women may have fought for child support laws, but in the end it was a man who made it law. Men are the ones who gave women rights, don&#39;t forget that. We didn&#39;t have to do that but we did that because western men take good care of their women, better care than any other civilization even today in the modern world. Look at how Arabic women are treated, for example.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m pretty sure you didn&#39;t know any man in the 1930s that would make you pretty old. You&#39;re making assumptions that all men have little care in the world for their families which is so incredibly untrue I&#39;m still wondering how you could make such outrageous claims, but that&#39;s a liberal for ya. </p>

<p>Liberals are so indoctrinated and brainwashed to the point that they don&#39;t even know what&#39;s true and untrue anymore they just spew the same rhetoric, over and over. It&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t honestly believe what you&#39;re saying about men. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, we are talking in circles and will just have to agree to disagree. The world is fucked up and we tried it the liberal way so let&#39;s be fair and adults about it and try it the other way around and maybe come back and have this conversation again in 80 years and see if the right wing way was actually better than the leftist way, I&#39;d say that&#39;s fair.</p>
