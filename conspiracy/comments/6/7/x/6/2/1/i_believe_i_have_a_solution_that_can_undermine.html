<p>Imagine if many many folks from numerous countries established very deep, deep connections. We all become super friendly with folks in Iran, In Cuba, in the middle east. We have awesome communication where we all communicate what exactly is going on in our respective countries. We will know when the criminals in charge are lying and our power in numbers can let them know we are aware of their propaganda and that it does not work anymore.
We can put mass media out of business. No one will believe them anymore.</p>

<p>It can all be achieved through open communication across many countries.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember we live in a reality governed by the law of duality.</p>

<p>For every measure of love, there must be an equal and opposite amount of hate.</p>

<p>The world will never be filled with love (nor hate), because of duality.</p>

<p>Its a great thought OP.  You appear to be one of the influences for love and good in this reality so just keep doing that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is necessary duality in terms of perception but the idea of &quot;equal and opposite&quot; is a myth. The overriding aspect of existence, or creation whichever way one looks at it, is mercy. If that weren&#39;t the case things would cease to exist as they are or at all. So being, the dark-siders and those who choose the left hand path are totally deluded by what is a potent and insistent arrogance. It is invisible to them. And with it they inflict great suffering on themselves (which they, by their nature, &quot;cover up/over&quot; and bury) and this skill of concealment and reframing of ill will and ill action is performed as a sleight of hand trick to those who are victims in this human game. Their doing, i.e. karma, has not gone unnoticed and even though as it presently unravels, the responsibility for it will be a phenomenal burden to bear for those who participated in such an inwardly sick and misguided experiment. An inward expression of compassion is a natural state for those who become aware of &quot;what is&quot; in each moment of their experience and this then becomes a natural external expression of compassion and sympathy without need for morality or a framework of rules to abide. Shining a light on darkness is both inevitable and a crucial task since the delusion and destruction of our Earthly companions is reaching a fever which at its crescendo will eventually burn out. The candle pierces <em>all</em> darkness equally and evenly and by its light digitally decides on the nature of experience. Each human can either be a candle or a void. A void cannot contain light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respectfully disagree.  I see there are opposites in all things and it must be so in order to understand the world we live in and experience what we are meant to experience here.  How do we define love and compassion without hatred and malice to compare it to?  How do we choose good if there is no evil?  The ultimate example of duality is life and death,  creation and entropy.  </p>

<p>A candle will not stay lit in a void, by the way, because it needs oxygen to burn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on the point of duality being necessary and of being in a realm of duality. It&#39;s just that I see that &quot;light&quot; takes precedence over &quot;dark&quot;. The front of a tapestry for example in all its beauty takes precedence and is what is chosen to display over the back where all the tangled thread lives in an unaesthetic mess. The back is vitally important of course because without it we wouldn&#39;t have the front. The thing the remember is that the back takes care of itself while the front is being weaved. No specific effort or attention needs to be paid to the back in order for the front to turn out as it is. So in the same way, the &quot;darkness&quot; in the world by way of human action, doesn&#39;t, as some mistakenly believe, need some special attention and activity in order to bring about or hasten the &quot;light&quot; side of human experience. We just need, as humans, to focus on creating pleasantness in ourselves first, then around us, and let the unpleasantness take care of itself. Right now, there are those who are very consciously and deliberately making things unpleasant for a lot of people, believing it to be in some way &quot;tough love&quot;. This isn&#39;t tough love but a misguided malice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You hit the nail on the head. That isn&#39;t just a good solution, it IS the solution. </p>

<p>100% this has to include all people across the globe whether they are from Iran or Africa. Love means wanting to do good things to other people and once that is established as a cultural norm, it will transform this planet from a bunch of people out to save themselves to an entire planet of cooperative winners. The whole world will turn into a single family unit. </p>

<p>That is great on the people scale but I also realized we actually need a 1 world government but a real government (not this fake satanic mafia government). The reason this is necessary is because it will not only end wars but it will unify the people into pushing towards a collective ideal. </p>

<p>Man, we are on our way. I see it unfolding. Even this post is a sign. People need to think hard about this because this IS the solution that will push us into a better future. There really is no other way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a nice sentiment but how close are you to your neighbors? To strangers in just a city or a state over from yours that you can visit? You can&#39;t just force connections with people you don&#39;t know because you want to save the world. Real connections matter and have power because they are real. And yes, we need more of them, but it starts with reaching out right where you are. Go volunteer, show compassion to people you interact with, forgive yourself and others of the past. Start there, then make your way overseas when you have exhausted those avenues.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve ever taken LSD then you 100% know that this is the solution. Hence all the hippies in the &#39;70s and the subsequent psychedelic prohibition that follows. The criminal elite know damn well that this is the only viable solution. Therefore they spend so much time and energy into dividing the country and creating conflicts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted the other day that devide between left and right suits only TPTB.  And they are making both side go more extremist. They are planting Antifa to most extremist leftist ideas, and to rightwing, most extremist isolationism, antisemitic or hitler ideas, both sides borderline fascist ideas. So the gap gets wider. </p>

<p>Who benefits from that? Only those in power , which are basically on the one side - money/power side. And they rule by inducing constant fear of something or someone.</p>

<p>Everyone is enemy, and everywhere lurks one terrible pandemic desease.</p>

<p>But, I also feel people are on a awakening path.</p>
