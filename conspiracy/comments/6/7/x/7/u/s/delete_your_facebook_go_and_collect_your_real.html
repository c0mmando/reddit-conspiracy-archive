        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, I used to obsessively watch my facebook. I would go on to check for a message for a friend, but then get caught in the mix. Oh, wow, an article on why I shouldn&#39;t use canola oil. Then I see a friend is in NYC, oh cool, she got creme brulee donuts! Before I know it, it&#39;s an hour. Hour a day X 7 in a week....times 52 weeks... is 364 hours a year. That&#39;s about 15 days. Half a month I spent on garbage content? </p>

<p>I am also in school, and I noticed my attention span is better and more controlled. I am not as depressed. It&#39;s wonderful to be disconnected. I don&#39;t need to know to the exact hour that you are engaged or preggers. I don&#39;t need to know what you ate, that your were at a truck stop in Utah. It&#39;s wasting mine and your time. </p>

<p>I am sick of trying to like people&#39;s content, trying to play these stupid social games. Popularity contests I thought where back when I was 16, not close to 36! </p>

<p>Maybe I am alone, but if you feel like Facebook is taking something out of your life, at least deactivate it for a week, see how it goes, and maybe you&#39;ll love it out of your life, you&#39;ll say goodbye forever!</p>

<p>Also, out of the 300 &quot;friends&quot; I had on there, I only really wanted 10 people&#39;s email and phone number...that&#39;s it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deleted mine almost a year ago, I don&#39;t miss it at all. I use Reddit for news and stuff and I post pictures on instagram here and there. But Facebook had me hooked. I was on it for 5-6 hours a day. I even bought a spare battery and an external charger for my cell phone because my phone would die around 1-2pm every day. I still use social media, but probably around 1 hour a day now. Still seems like a lot, but it&#39;s a significant drop. Another factor is my overall mood is better. Facebook always got me riled up over stupid shit. </p>

I spent a few years building up and creating that playlist. But I changed <em>all</em> the personal details I could on my Facebook to do what little I can to muddy the waters of their data collection on me. I deleted the app off my phone, only open it in incognito mode, and delete Internet cache and history both before and after using it. I very rarely open Facebook though, only to check details on someone I may need to contact. </p>

<p>I was in the same boat.  I pretty much only looked at it while I was pooping but all I found myself doing was judging people and saying things like why the fuck would you post that.  Then there&#39;s the people that seem to do nothing but go on a vacation to exotic places.  I missed it slightly for about a month but after that it was so nice I will never go back. I oversee my gf browsing it sometimes and it looks like there is even more garbage than years ago when I deleted mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happy to see that you&#39;ve joined the club dude. I deactivated Facebook in January as a test to see how I would feel and react to it. I have not look back since. My social skills have excelled and my attention span, just line yours, has increased immensely. </p>

<p>That website takes so much time away from ones life  and I feel like I&#39;m an tuning back into reality.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m with people I know, they always ask &#39;did you see this the other day?&#39; &amp; &#39;Have you seen my photo&#39; blah blah blah. They always react surprised that I have deactivated Facebook and question me intensely on why I have done so. Many people I talk to are in disbelief that it turns you into a zombie.</p>

<p>You only have to stand in your town centre for 10 minutes and look around; I guarantee, most people will be glued to their phones, starting and giggling to themselves at Facebook. It&#39;s depressing to see it so many people detached from reality.</p>

<p>I applaud you fella! Congratulations on achieving what many people dare to think about doing!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strangely enough, whenever I&#39;m wading through the sea of broken or empty vessels outside, they do the same thing whenever I point out their still depressed despite their habit they claim &quot;makes them happy.&quot;  That means most grown adults have as much concern for themselves or ability to care for themselves as a runaway 11 year old.  They&#39;re intensely depressed and anxious, they need &quot;comfort animals and vomit bags just to be around real people, yet they insist the source of all their drama and materialism is what makes them &quot;happy.&quot;</p>

<p>Kudos to the Yahude.  They won.  Goddamn it, those fucking desert rat gypsies infiltrated our entertainment, our schools, our businesses and made use all believe their dysfunction is &quot;evolution.&quot;  Constant navel-gazing narcissism  and <em>SEVENTY FIVE GENDER CHOICES</em> are good things that should continue into the future, even though the overall happiness of the general population continues to plummet. Think of all the control you need over the media and pop culture for how many decades or even CENTURIES to make people so self-destructive and complacent.  But they did it.  The average person thinks Bill Bye is saving the world.  I&#39;m inclined to agree with God that a nuclear format is about due for the Earth Computer.   </p>

<p>Everyone I know that I&#39;ve mentioned this to said they aren&#39;t putting anything zuckerburg has touched anywhere near there brain. &quot;I don&#39;t need ads and auto play videos in my brain&quot; is the general idea of what they said.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for brain computer interfaces for things like VR, direct consensual information transmission(aka telepathy), making music by thinking, things like that, but I will <em>never</em> put <em>anything</em> near my brain made by <em>anyone</em> who would benefit from it with a different product. No google, no facebook, no reddit sponsored interfaces.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a product I&#39;ve dreamed of for years and I can&#39;t say I wouldn&#39;t use it. It&#39;s up above &quot;personal AGI assistant&quot; and &quot;Research AI&quot; on my &quot;I really want to use this one day&quot; list.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit gets a pass from me. The fact that it&#39;s not actually tied to your real name means that even though it&#39;s a pretty social place, you can cut and leave at any time with no real trouble, which keeps it from weighing heavy on your mind.</p>

<p>Yeah you may keep coming here more than you should but it&#39;s not on the same level as FB, which has the sole purpose of trying to get your to move your entire life online. There&#39;s something very different about it that I can&#39;t really put into words. Facebook requires part of your soul while Reddit is way more casual - plus the fact that it is a text based platform means that the discussions are usually way better.</p>

<p>Then again I could just be rationalizing everything, who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been off for many years now. I gave it try, and all these &quot;friends&quot; that I had let go of years and years ago, including high school and college acquaintances, all started coming out of the woodwork. I found it completely stressful, annoying, and wrong for me. I also had problem with Facebook as a company and what they were really doing. Between games, friend lists, conversations, likes, and tracking you all over the web, they were gathering a lot of personal and psychological info on their users. I decided to get off of it. </p>

<p>A few people actually emailed to see if there was something wrong with me. No, I just don&#39;t want to be on that artificial social construct designed to gather as much information as possible on people anymore.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t miss it. I like Reddit. It&#39;s anonymous, I don&#39;t have to have friends, and I can find some good stuff here. I&#39;m sure Reddit is gathering info tied to my ISP, and I have been thinking about what it is they are gathering and why. But I&#39;m okay with it right now.</p>

Unfortunately, it&#39;s the only outlet that I have where we are all connected and it leaves them no choice but to face the music or should I say the facts? This is why I won&#39;t deactivate.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s actually an extension for Firefox that will automatically go through your history and actually delete EVERYTHING you&#39;ve ever done on Facebook.  It took over 5 hours for it to successfully delete every like, picture, tag, share, and comment I had ever made. It&#39;s so much more rewarding to do it this way, knowing that even if you tried logging back in, everything is still going to be deleted.  If you simply delete account, if you ever log back in, even 2 years later, all of your data will still be sitting right there waiting for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kept mine, but turned off all features. It&#39;s the main way of speaking with family members that are out of the country. Also, the video chat works better for me than google voice or skype. I don&#39;t allow people to tag me and I don&#39;t share anything besides what is types in the chat. They are going to get your info one way or another, it&#39;s hard to avoid if you want to participate in the ridiculousness of our tech society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only keep a fake alias facebook account for my job. I am on there for a few mins when i have to use it for work and then I sign right off.

<p>I&#39;ve literally had college peers say &quot; well , I&#39;ll try to communicate with you but you don&#39;t use Facebook very much so its hard , etc etc ... &quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my author website:</p>

<p>You may notice there are no links to Facebook. That’s because I actually don’t use Facebook. As an author writing about dystopian worlds and alien take-overs, Facebook has always seemed like a dangerous mechanism to me. Currently Facebook has over 1 billion users. 1/7th of the human population is using something that barely came into existence a decade ago. Something that has immense power in influencing our likes/dislikes, social etiquette, popular culture, and social circles. And that’s not even taking into account the usual privacy issues people criticize Facebook for. For these reasons, I cannot support Facebook.</p>

Bought the cheapest phone I could find for $30 and only use it for calls and texting otherwise it stays in my backpack. I feel so free from that world and even forget it exists for the most part. Hanging with certain friends you just see how addicted to that stuff they are as social media comes up in conversation more than it should and sometimes I&#39;ll walk into a party and everyone will be on their phone mindlessly scrolling like real life comes second to it.</p>

I had an appointment with my physcatrist today, and she asked how my mother was doing (I&#39;ve previously told her how my Mom has completely been sucked into&quot;the matrix&quot; and has completely stopped living her life outside of Facebook, like hardcore, not even interested in having any kind of relationship IRL with her kids or her grandkids, no longer goes to church, and has a difficult time even having a 15 minute conversation when I go and visit her, without going to check Facebook) to which I told her that I had deleted my Facebook account in a last ditch attempt to try and pull her out of the matrix, which she then told me they&#39;re were 3 other people that had told her today that they too had deleted their Facebook accounts.</p>

<p>There is definitely a trend to move away from social media, Facebook especially.  This is great news, and hopefully it will be a chain reaction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was having this conversation with a group of friends the other day. We were discussing &quot;the good old days&quot; before Facebook, and how we all cherished those memories much more, because it was just that, a memory. There was no Facebook to post pictures to so you could go back and revise them, it was memories that we all agreed were more special because we didn&#39;t have a timeline to go back and look at, we had to remember them.</p>

<p>It just seems that life was so much simpler, and rewarding before Facebook came along. I look at the generation after me, that has pretty much had Facebook around for most of their lives, and I genuinely feel bag for them, because they&#39;ll never know what it was like to live without Facebook, and actually have real social skills and connections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I quit Facebook about a month ago (deleted, not disabled), and I&#39;m a better person because of it.  I feel Facebook is the most perverse way to run a social network.  I&#39;m all for connecting to people online, sharing and spreading awesome ideas, meeting people with your passions, and growing your knowledge through what other people have to say.  In this context, I think a social network like that can be one of the greatest things on the internet.  I hope someday there will be a social network like that; in order to achieve that, the mechanics of how it works would have to be fundamentally different from that of Facebook.</p>

<p>Facebook &quot;likes&quot; really aren&#39;t different from points on this site, reddit.  You want to post the &#39;best&#39; content to your local hivemind, who will respond with meaningless intangible points that serve nothing more as a temporary endorphin bump.  In this hypothetical network I&#39;m speaking about, it would still retain the latter part of what I said, because after all, its important for people to be happy and feel good.  What would change is the <em>why</em> behind that trigger.  It&#39;s not because you took some black and white picture of yourself dressed nice standing on some bridge, or showing off the new x, y, or z thing you brought.  Instead of points that are meaningless considering the nature in which they come from (obligation from most), you&#39;ll instead (perhaps) be able to see traffic metrics of your post/proposal/idea/speech, along with any comments people wish to give.</p>

<p>This idea is still in alpha in my mind, but tl;dr- don&#39;t hate social networks because the mainstream ones out there are BUILT to be addictive and toxic.  Systems, like tools, are neutral objects.  You can&#39;t get mad at them.  Build a social network wired fundamentally differently that assists in GOOD THINGS propagating and spreading, and you just built one of the most beneficial things on the internet.</p>

<p>To each your own, but personally, it&#39;s not for me. I am too sensitive, and an empath, it&#39;s not somewhere I want to be. Once I had a friend tell me &quot;you better like my picture tonight&quot;, that was my tipping point. Yep, I am done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit gets a pass from me. The fact that it&#39;s not actually tied to your real name means that even though it&#39;s a pretty social place, you can cut and leave at any time with no real trouble, which keeps it from weighing heavy on your mind.</p>

<p>Yeah you may keep coming here more than you should but it&#39;s not on the same level as FB, which has the sole purpose of trying to get your to move your entire life online. There&#39;s something very different about it that I can&#39;t really put into words. Facebook requires part of your soul while Reddit is way more casual - plus the fact that it is a text based platform means that the discussions are usually way better.</p>

<p>Then again I could just be rationalizing everything, who knows.</p>
