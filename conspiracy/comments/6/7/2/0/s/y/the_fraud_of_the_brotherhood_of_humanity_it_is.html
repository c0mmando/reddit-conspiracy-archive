       Whether you consider the issue from a secular or Biblical perspective, all "humans" do not share a common ancestry. The idea that all humans are "family" is a lie propagated by the ruling Jewish Establishment and the apostate "Judeo-Christian" churches -- and supported by the fraudulent theory of evolution -- which serves as a basis for the "multicultural", race-mixing, and "one world community" agenda that is designed to destroy the white race through mongrelization and absorption with the non-white races.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biologically and scientifically speaking, how is it possible for the pure-blooded black, asian, and white races to have descended from Adam and Eve, Noah and his wife, or any other common ancestor? Could Adam and Eve reproduce and have black, white, and asian children? Of course not. That's biologically impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black, white, and asian races -- in their pure-blooded states, absent any mixing among the races -- are of completely different lineage. They were created separately, and are essentially different species of "humans." The fact that separate races can interbreed (and produce hybrid species) is not proof of common origin or common species, as this phenomenon exists among other animals -- eg, lion and tiger can mate and produce a hybrid "liger", horse and donkey to produce mule, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible, when translated and interpreted correctly, confirms the fact that Adam was not the first "human." There were other people on the earth before Adam was created. That is why Cain feared other people would kill him after he was banished, and how Cain was able to find a wife, have his own descendants, and build a city after being banished from Adam &amp; Eve and their descendants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who, then, are the descendants of Adam and Eve? The evidence strongly indicates that it is the white race. The word "Adam" in the Hebrew is "aw-dam'", which means "to show blood (in the face), i.e. flush or turn rosy". Only the white race can blush and show blood in the face.
      </p>

       Raycism smaycism.   Talking about the origins of the races is "racist"?  What does that even mean anymore.  The term "racist" is just a Marxist smear buzzword used to silence debate.  Is that what you want?  To shut down debate in the forum, so that the Establishment/Leftist positions cannot be challenged?

       You're putting the "white race" in a superior position, using the Bible as a source lol. Sounds like a white Christian superiority complex, not a conspiracy. There is no higher power. The universe is one and we are a fragment of it, deciding to experience itself in a limited dimension.

       The superiority of the white race (in intelligence, the civilizations they create) is a FACT.  It's not something that I or anyone else have to advocate.  We didn't create ourselves this way.  It's the way the Creator made us.

       White people originated in the Mid East.  That's why my original post was about.   Only the white race descends from Adam and Eve.  The true descendants of the Israelites are the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, and kindred European peoples.   The Israelites migrated into Europe after they were released from the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities, around 700 BC and 500 BC respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who created great civilizations in the Mid East thousands of years ago were WHITE.  They have since migrated all over the earth.  For instance, the ancient Egyptian pharoahs were white.  Google "blonde and red haired mummies of Egypt":

       No.  The Messiah was an ISRAELITE.  Not a "jew".  The people calling themselves "jews" are not the real descendants of the Israelites, but rather descend from Esau (Edomites), Canaanites, and the Khazars.

       That's just one indicator of intelligence.  The greater test is to examine the level of creativeness and technology and level of civilization created by each race.  If you do that, it is overwhelmingly clear that the white/European race is superior in intelligence, creativeness, technology, and level of civilization.

       The non-whites are the once suppressing the whites.  Whites have been a net BLESSING to the other races.

      <p>
       Whites simply want to be left alone and to live amongst themselves.  But non-whites want to leach off of whites/Europeans -- eg, demanding to immigrate to white nations, etc.

       "White" countries should be able to close their borders to a flood of refugees (I'm pro nationalism).
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is these racial problems you talk about are manufactured.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB have been proven to exploit poorer nations through bribery, corruption, puppetry and outright war.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also purposefully disenfranchised the ethnic communities of Western countries by segregating them, flooding them with drugs, profiling them through law enforcement etc. This obviously creates disdain for the overwhengly white establishment they perceive as being responsible. Combine that with the manufactured content you read and we have white nationalism.

       I would expect that means black people are meant to live there you FUCKING autist, how you can come to the conclusion that it's for white people. Personally as a white man I can't wait to have as many children with other races as possible to contribute to the "white genocide" you're so worried about.

       The Iranians are not white NOW, yes.  But the people living there 3,000+ years ago were white.  There has been a lot of race-mixing over the course of 3,000 years, and migration of various races into and out of the region.

       You are so easily-demonstrably wrong on this. Ignoring the facts doesn't mean you're finding some higher truth. Look up any anthropologist's or geneticist's position on what "race" these people were and you'll see that you're wrong. And continuing to persist in your wrongness is putting tissues in your ears and yelling "I can't hear you, I can't hear you!"

       The Arabs didn't invent shit.  Look at the Arabs now.  These people have average 80 IQs, and live a primitive existence (without European/white-created technology).
      </p>
      <p>
       The races of people living in various parts of the earth changes a LOT over the course of 1,000+ years.  Can you not see that?  Do you think white people have always lived in Australia or North America, for instance?
      </p>
      <p>
       The white race originated in the Mid East.  Over the course of thousands of years, they migrated elsewhere, and other races migrated into the Mid East, mixing and mongrelizing with whites who stayed there -- resulting the mongrelized Arab races, who are clearly inferior to the white/European racial type.

       If, as you claim, the Africans and Arab peoples were the "creators of civilization" (or some shit), then why are Africans and Arabs so primitive today?  Have they regressed?

       The ancient Egyptians, the Sumerians, and the Babylonians were all WHITE people.  The white race originated in the Mid East, and then migrated all over the earth over thousands of years.

       No. I am not race-mixed.

      <p>
       Racial segregration by law has been the norm throughout much of history.  It is the natural tendency of most people -- ie, to "self segregate" and primarily associate with others of their race.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that there is a lot of mongrelization.  The easiest thing to do is to distinguish between the following groups and enforce segregration among them: whites (pure whites), pure blacks, pure asians, and all other mongrels.

       Retardation is someone who believe the fairytale of the theory of evolution.  Or believes that a first human pair could reproduce and have white, black, and asian children.  Or someone who believes that "all races are equal", when reality show the complete opposite -- ie, that there are huge differences between the races, and some are superior and some inferior.

       No, a retard believe in your master race, hybrid baby nonsense. A normal person believes in evolution, because it's been heavily proven.

       1) No. A pair of humans would have their children die due to inbreeding in a few gens. You need a few breeding pairs to avoid that.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) it's called evolution, it can lead to all the differences between the races.

Extracting resources from the ground (like farming) also meant northern peoples required a bit more ingenuity to survive than southern latitudes with their ideal sunny, tropical weather. That ingenuity wasn't based on intelligence or "whiteness", but necessity. Innovate or die. It's a microcosm for all of nature

       Sorry m8, your source is about as substantial as your claims in this thread. Sunny climates lead to darker skin, there's literally no way around that

       That's preposterous.  There is ZERO evidence to show that the color of the skin of the race of a people will change due to sunlight or climate.  None whatsoever.  That's a fairytale.

      <p>
       Will white Australians who now have blue eyes and blonde hair have black skin, and brown eyes, and jet black hair in a couple hundred years from now just due to sunlight?  Lmao

       Of course I've heard of the black aborigines.  But they don't have black skin because of being in a stronger sunlight.

       Again...how long will it take for blue-eyed, blonde Australians to magically get their black skin, black hair, and black eyes from nothing more than being in a stronger sunlight??  300 years?  500?

       Think about your question for second. Really think about it. Ready?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         We don't live outdoors anymore. By and large we don't farm, raise animals, or hang outside a majority of our work lives like we used to, hence we don't get nearly the sun exposure we used to either
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Humans travel and mate with humans from all over the world. Light, dark, it all gets mixed and the trend goes to lighter skin colors, not darker ones. Australians are not limited to mating with Australians
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The modern world is more aware of sun exposure than ever. Women wear makeup, people wear lotions and sunblock, we wear more hats and longer sleeved clothing
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If all of the above were not true, the answer to your question is Yes, we would see a marked change in skin color over time and those people would naturally acclimate to their environment. But because we have all the modern accoutrements like air travel, office jobs, nice clothing, and sun block it couldn't happen like the old world
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       TL;DR: You are not thinking through your arguments, just defending empty assertions. Wouldn't expect any less out of conspiracy though

         Nature has selected for people with darker skin in tropical latitudes, especially in nonforested regions, where ultraviolet radiation from the sun is usually the most intense.  Melanin acts as a protective biological shield against ultraviolet radiation.  By doing this, it helps to prevent sunburn damage that could result in DNA changes and, subsequently, several kinds of malignant skin cancers.  Melanoma  in particular is a serious threat to life.  In the United States, approximately 54,000 people get this aggressive type of skin cancerevery year and nearly 8,000 of them die from it.  Those at highest risk are European Americans.  They have a 10 times higher risk than African Americans

       The theory of evolution is not science.  It's science fiction.  I'm 100% in favor of real science, which is based upon observation, facts, and the desire to pursue truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolutionists only promote THEORIES (not observation), and have no facts or evidence to support their theory.  For example, if the theory were true, there should be millions of "transitional fossils".  But there are none.  There is no "half human, half ape" hominid.  Hence, the "missing link".  All that exists are HOAXES and FRUADS deliberately perpetrated by evolutionists -- such as "Piltdown Man" and "Nebraska man".

       "Species" is a human terminology/definition and distinction.  Fallible humans made those classifications.  And any determinations and deductions drawn from those are subject to error.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because humans group two "kinds" or "races" of animals or humans into the category of "species" does NOT mean that they share a common ancestral origin.  In reality, many are separate creations, and have no common ancestral origin.

       As I mentioned in the initial post, ability to produce hybrid offpsring is NOT proof of common ancestral origin.  For instance, a tier and a lion can reproduce and produce a hybrid, called a "liger".  Horses and Zebras can also reproduce a hybrid.  But this is not proof that horses and zebras share a common ancestral origin.  Etc.

       I did prove it, over on the evolution thread.  You didn't recognize the most basic scientific explanation of evolution.  You thought it was some "new theory", when in fact, it's the basic theory.  I know you may not have recognized some words,such as allele, but it's established science.  You are a fraud.

       Whether or not it can be "proven" completely is never the point. The leading theory is one that takes account of the most evidence, which evolution does. Your theories take account of very little evidence, and are even further from "proven."

       For starters, you claim adherence to the concepts of Christian Identity, a hate group.  One only needs to read their literature to see.  CI is monitored by the FBI as well.  Also, you spoke poorly of "Arabs" (your term), mixed-race people, Jews, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       For sake of honesty, I look down on some people too, but only because of certain personal choices, not the things they can't control, such as their race.  For example, I think people in the Christian Identity movement are weak-minded losers who can't acknowledge or accept their own personal failures, so they lash out at others to make themselves feel better. They need to scapegoat others because they are too weak to make positive changes in their own lives.

       What truths?  Nothing you've posted is true.  It's the Christian Identity movement ideals to which you subscribe.  I've run into your ilk before and read about the movement.  Totally white supremacists.  I didn't need the ADL, SPLC, FBI, or anyone else to tell me that.  But the fact that they all seem to agree is significant.

       Your post is not an argument.  Your disagreement does not prove me wrong.  You provide no argument, no logic, and no evidence.

      <p>
       All you offer is an ad hominem attack.  That is indicative of someone on the losing side of the argument, who cannot argue using logic or facts.

       The so-called "scientists" of today do not use facts and logic.  Look at the theory of evolution, for example.  It's a total fraud, supported only by more theories, and blatant frauds and hoaxes -- like Piltdown Man and Nebraska Man.  Modern scientists who promote evolution are actually promoting a religious belief (atheism).

       The Bible is a historical record and is scientifically accurate.  Can you provide any example of something in the Bible that has been proven scientifically inaccurate?

       I have not denied that supernatural entities exist or that supernatural events can occur. You asked for "...any example of something in the Bible that has been proven scientifically inaccurate."  I gave you four examples off the top of my head that
       <em>

       Yes, the ruling elite (jews) promote race-mixing.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the core of that agenda is the lie of the elite that all humans are "brothers" and share a common racial origin.  If you believe this lie, then your are much more likely to have little opposition to their race-mixing/multicultural agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the contrary, if you know the truth (ie, that the various human races do NOT share a common ancestral origin), then you are much more likely to resist their race-mixing/multicultural agenda.

       1) The Bible is not a scientific source. Any attempt to introduce it as evidence to support a racial theory is preposterous. Science is based on facts, not myths and legends.

       2) Humans around the world are of the same species,
       <em>
        Homo sapiens

       (around 200,000 years old), and can accordingly produce fertile offspring, unlike hybrid mules and ligers, which only reproduce in exceptionally rare cases. However, even early modern humans interbred with Neaderthals, as small traces of their DNA (1-4%) are still present in modern-day non-African people, including Europeans and Asians.

Any differences that you see on the surface, like hair, eye, or skin color are merely relatively short-term adaptations (in our long-term history) to local climate, geography, and diet. We otherwise have **a lot more DNA in common than not.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Christian Bible may be "historically" accurate in some aspects because it is based on even older written histories compiled by the Jews around 450B.C., called the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh">
        Tanekh
       </a>
       , or
       <em>
        Hebrew Bible
       </em>
       . However, outside of names of rulers and kingdoms,
       <strong>
        there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever for any of the supernatural or claims in either the Old or New Testament
       </strong>
       , for example, the creation of Adam and Eve, the worldwide flood, etc., but especially the existence of God. That said, one cannot prove there was ever any 10 Commandments written by God in stone. Nor is there any mention of Jesus in any contemporary historical narrative outside of the Bible itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) If you call science preposterous just because it doesn't confirm your bias, then you simply can't handle the truth. The Catholic church did the same when Galileo aimed to prove that the Earth circled the sun back in the 17th century. It wasn't until 1992 that Pope John Paul II even apologized for that, so I won't be holding my breath waiting on you to admit you're wrong either.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) DNA testing proves no such thing. DNA proves that the separate races have unique DNA profiles. The race of a person can be identified from their DNA. The races do not have identical DNA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Um, no one said we all have identical DNA. Even you and your siblings don't have identical DNA. You have 99.95% identical DNA, but any 2 humans on Earth have 99.9% same DNA. That's a fact. You clearly don't understand science, so you don't trust it. However, you choose to believe the myths and legend of the Bible.
Fine, but don't expect people to ignore an irrational argument. Which begs the question, why are you even posting here if you're going to just close your eyes, put your fingers in your ears, and keep repeating "it's all a bunch of lies" to yourself?

       The Bible does not truly teach/record that the earth is only 6,000 years old.  It only records (via the genealogical records) that Adam and Eve were created around 6,000 years ago.  The earth is much older than this.

       Examples of historical inaccuracy in the Bible--
      </p>
      <p>
       Enslavement in Egypt and wandering through the desert - despite there being supposedly hundreds of thousands or millions of Jews involved in this, there is no archaeological record of it happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Destroying of the walls of Jericho - Jericho did exist but archaeologists have found that it was destroyed at a different time and by different methods than described in the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prophecy of Tyre - Prophecy claims the city of tyre will be destroyed and never rebuilt. It still exists to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of Jesus Life - Only one non-religious contemporary of Jesus writes about him (Josephus) and all he says is that he was a leader of a religious sect. Nothing about all the amazing miracles and world going dark that supposedly happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can keep going, but there are about a billion lists you can look up for yourself. Regardless, even these few should call into question for you whether or not the Bible has been "proven over and over to be completely accurate. And if none of the counter examples to your point are robust enough evidence for you to at least wonder about the complete historicity of the bible, maybe ask yourself why every time something contradicts the views you already hold, you just say that piece of evidence doesn't count.

       No.  There is quite an archaeological record of the Israelites being in Egypt.  The mainstream archaeologists are wrong about Jericho.  Their carbon-dating is wrong.  There are other accounts of the Messiah than by Josephus.

       Maybe you've changed your beliefs about other things but I see how you're responding on questions on this subject and you're responding like a dogmatist.

       It's a tactic the church teaches you. Simply discredit any dissenting voices. Learn them just enough to give them a straw man representation, and then refute it. It makes you feel like you've explored all the options and christianity is simply the most true. But let me tell you man, it's so much more fulfilling to give an honest voice to the ideas that disagree with you. To really look and see if the white race is superior, by listening to people who think it's NOT. How else will you know if what you know is true? If it is, then your beliefs shouldn't be threatened anyway, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I know you'll want to say you have looked at all the sides, but honestly consider if you have. Evolutionary theorists are smart people, just like you, and there's a reason that almost all of them agree that evolution is more or less what happened. And consider that your reaction in reading that, in wanting to respond with, "Yeah well the scientific establishment is run by jewish sjw cucks," consider that that might be another mental tactic that the "meme" of christianity has taught to you in order to be able to immediately discount any dissenting view without ever considering it.

       Again, you realize that responding by demonizing the "establishment" isn't actually engaging in the dissenting views. It's discounting them without consideration. You know you're doing this over and over again. It's like if you told me Jesus is the truth, and I responded by saying, "Oh yeah well Christianity is an Illuminati plot to control my mind." I haven't actually engaged with what you're saying.

       And dude, I see you throwing around "strawman" in the comments now. Honestly, I know it's hard to see past just the act of arguing. I know it's hard to consider that you're not in the right... But you are the one strawmanning here, not everyone else you suddenly realized you can apply it to. If your first instinct when you see a new argument tactic is to just grab it and turn it on your opponents then you're probably not honestly considering any viewpoints. You're probably just trying to "win." And you'll never know what's true that way. You will spend your whole life not know if what you know can stand up to honest debate.

       So you really meant to ask for some examples of the Bible depicting something historically inaccurate but which don't involve modern or mainstream scientific or archaeological evidence with which you don't agree. Tall order. Taller than... a tower built by Bronze Age people that reached all the way to heaven.

       I was referring to any evidence of it being inaccurate relating to history or science.  I reject the writings of Saul of Tarsus (Paul) as being included as "canon law" -- on "theological" grounds.  Saul of Tarsus is a false prophet and fake apostle.

       The Bible is a COLLECTION of books.  By different authors.  Fallible men made the decision of what books to include -- ie, the Roman Catholic Church initially.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be one thing if I was rejecting and keeping books by the same author.  But that's not the case.  I simply disagree with the decision by the Roman Catholic Church to "canonize" the writings of Saul of Tarsus.
      </p>

       The Protestants have already done a similar thing by rejecting the "Apocryphal" books that the Catholic Church still keeps.

       1) The flood was not worldwide. That is a misinterpretation of the Scripture, arising from an imprecise translation. The flood of Noah's time was in a localized geographic area.  See here for proof:

       You are embarrassing yourself here, my friend. Its fine to argue, if you have any clue what the science actually says. But you are doing the equivalent of showing up in church and arguing with the preacher about bible concepts without having any clue what's in the various books. Its embarrassing. Do yourself a favor and just delete all of it.

       I perfectly understand the theory of evolution.  I've had the garbage force fed to me my entire life. I went to public schools in the USA.  And I have a "vast" knowledge of the Bible, when compared to the average person.  I'm hardly someone ignorant of these subjects.

       When you claim that races have different DNA, you are being pedantically ridiculous. Of course they do.
       <em>
        We all of have different DNA
       </em>
       except for identical twins.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you claim certain races aren't human, you clearly have no idea how speciation works. All races can reproduce with one another. The definition of a species is literally "can produce fertile offspring".
      </p>
      <p>
       That shit is embarrassingly, awfully, totally ignorant and frankly, unintelligent. Just stop. Science isn't the Bible. Whatever bible based science claims you are reading are almost certainly completely ridiculous. Go learn something about this stuff.

       Cool.  What are your thoughts on gene expression in relation to selection?  We know the population-genetical theory of selection puts emphasis on genes, and the single-gene theoretical model emphasizes the relative "selective values" of alternative alleles of one gene.  Do you believe natural selection acts on phenotypes or the underlying genes?

       Okay... so first of all, you know that these ideas are fringe right? Both in the secular world and even within Christianity these are out-of-the-ordinary interpretations of the material. Whether science or the Bible, your thinking on this is well outside the norm. Why is this interpretation of the Bible more convincing to you than a more conventional Protestant interpretation, and why is this interpretation of genetics more convincing that the one put forward by people that study genetics every day for a living?

       Fringe or being a minority does not mean you are factually wrong.  It's the opposite.  What is popular is usually wrong.  Most people are deceived.

       I absolutely agree that it doesn't mean you're factually wrong, but it also doesn't mean the opposite. What is popular is often wrong, but that doesn't mean that the fringe is more often right. If that were true, than a religious sect even smaller than yours would be the right one, wouldn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       But still, a hatred for the popular can't be your only reason for believing something. That's only a reason to be skeptical of what's popular, it doesn't actually lend any support to the Church of True Israel being right. 
What reasons do you have to think their interpretation of the Bible and beliefs about race are more true than others?

       Bahahaha!!   This isn't a new idea, it's the very basic stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural selection acts on phenotypes, resulting in expression of the genetic change in the later generation.  You claim to "fully understand evolution", yet you FAIL at even the most basic scientific concept at the core of the theory! You think this concept is the "latest delusional theory".  You not only do not have "sufficient knowledge of the theory of evolution", you FAIL at the very basic concept!  I asked ONE question with scientific language, and you can't even form a valid response?  YOU ARE A TOTAL FRAUD.

       If you're going to try and refute a theory and make others believe  your refutation, it's a good idea to at least have a rough grasp of it it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the answer to your question 'could Adam and Eve have had black white and Asian children?' Is 'nope'. But if the question is 'could  thousands of generations, geographically dispersed populations of humans gradually diverge into the 'races' we see today?' Absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       All evolution through natural selection requires is some variation with in population (caused, say through random mutations) and for some of those traits to effect the likelihood of having offspring).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not rocket science, it doesn't require any leaps of faith of 'delusions'.

       The answer to your question is also "No".  No amount of passage of time can result in children of the same original human pair "diverge" or "evolve" into the races we see today.

      <p>
       I have more than a rough grasp of the theory of evolution nonsense.  The difference is that I wasn't duped by the Marxist propaganda, and don't just parrot or regurgitate it back, like a good little robot.

       You say that no passage of time could account for divergence from a single human phenotype, how do you account for the extraordinary diversity in form in domestic dogs, where artificial selection has managed to create everything from the chihuahua to the bull mastiff from the dachund to the greyhound within a few centuries.

       All dogs do not share a common ancestral origin either.  There is no way that an original wolf pair reproduced, and somehow thousands of years later we have hundreds of breeds/species of canines, including wolves, dogs, coyotes, etc.  There were originally a number of separate creations, including a number of different dog breeds.  Subsequently, there has been some mixing, producing hybrid breeds of dogs.

       Except of course that we have really quite good records showing the breeding  of new breeds of dogs, fancy pigeons, breeds of pigs, cattle, horses etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of evidence of plenty of variability within natural populations. There's plenty of evidence that it is possible to create new breeds through artificial selection. I just don't see why you are so determined to cling to the idea that you can't create new dog breeds.
      </p>

       Seriously, the bullmastif was created in the U.K. In the 1800s, the chihuahua was bred in Mexico. No need to invoke separate acts of divine creation for the 340 breeds of domestic dog we have today.

       You can't start with a male and female wolf, and keep breeding them and then result in the vast array of dog breeds, coyotes, etc that we now see. Biologically impossible.

       Dogs appear to have been domesticated from the ancestors of today's grey wolves about 15,000-30,000 years ago. Really, that's plenty long enough to breed a population of nice cuddly pooches.

       Spread em across the globe, aggressively select for different purposes - running, retrieving, hunting, terriering, fighting and you can get some big old differences in say, 10 generations. Assuming years between generations, we're looking at around 2,500 generations.

       Not really pure speculation. There's good archeological evidence of when humans and dogs started living together (burials, gnawed bones and whatnot) there's DNA evidence showing the degree of relationship between them.

       But most importantly we have breeders diaries from the 1800s setting out how they created many of the breeds we have today.

       I acknowledged that there has been breeding of dogs to create hybrid breeds.  What I'm rejecting is this idea of all dogs originating from a single wolf pair, or whatever the latest garbage official theory is by the evolutionists.  And where did the first wolf come from, per the evolutionists?  Did it evolve from a rat, which evolved from a lizard, which evolved from a fish?  Which all evolved from the first bacteria in the primordial soup?

       And immediately labeling them "crackpot theories" is a good way to never actually know what they are. To echo everyone else on here, you don't understand evolution, no matter how much you rant that you do, this is a cognitive blind spot for you.

       I grew up in the US public school system too and yet I can tell that the way you've described evolution in all these comments is a completely incorrect description. So whether or not you've "had it shoved down your throat" you were so busy rejecting it you never bothered to learn what you're rejecting.

       These aren't all about evolution, but they're all truth claims where you're rejecting millions of experiments and pieces of evidence. I know you hate the mainstream and blah. But you should think about why so few people believe your alternative beliefs. Sure there are flaws in the mainstream versions, but if you apply the same standards to your beliefs I know you'll find even more massive holes in them.

       There's a concept called steelmanning. After your opponent speaks, you restate their position in a such a way that they would say, I wish I had described it like that. It shows that you understand what they believe and you're responding to what they actually believe, rather than your own distorted version of it. Do you think that your version of evolution is such that an evolutionary theorist would say, Yeah, I would describe it that way. Because if it's not, then that means you're not actually arguing against evolution, you're just arguing against your made-up, easy-to-argue-against version of it.

       Yes, your simply rejecting how much the malleable canine family can change in 20,000 which is extraordinary when you can see how much a breed can change in size and character in less than 100 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, there is nothing biologically problematic in getting breed populations to diverge in that time. We're not talking about hybrid breeds here we are talking about taking litters of pups and consistently taking (say) the largest ones to breed from.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fossil evidence suggest that the first canines (which wouldn't have been like a modern wolf) sprang from the

       This is one of those pat-statements the church gives you to restate as an argument so that you don't ever have to find out the truth. There are millions of transitional fossils. If your tactic is to say that all of them were their own species and therefore not "transitional", you're ignoring the glaring fact that in these fossils look very much like one species -transitioning- to another.

       There MUST be a Higher Power, as supported by evidence and logic and physics. The physical universe is finite in both space and time. It had a beginning. It cannot have existed forever, or else it would be in a state of infinite disorder per the second law of thermodynamics. Since it had a beginning, some "entity" separate from the physical universe must have caused it to come into existence. That "entity" is what we call "God".

       I'm not trusting what any man says.  I'm relying on evidence.  The fact that the physical universe exists (ie, the evidence) is proof that there must be a Creator (ie, who caused that physical universe to come into existence).

       Hello, 
A fascinating read. I respect your courage to voice an opinion so diffident to everyone else's. I wanted to say a couple of things about Physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a person with a degree in science I felt that I just had to reply to this post. Physics is an empirical science. This means that it only concerns itself with questions that can be answered by performing experiments and gathering data. There things which can be measured and experimented upon (width of the Observable Universe, density of a proton? half life of radioactive particles or the rate of expansion of Space). Whether the universe is infinite in time and/or space hasn't been confirmed yet. We've only got it figured ~13,000,000,000 years backwards and then we've hit a problem that we don't understand (yet)- Singularity. It also is not confirmed whether it has existed forever or not (expanding and collapsing in cycles similar to cycles of a pendulum). This means that we don't know whether the universe had a beginning. (What is a beginning anyways if it isn't an end of some previous state?) Some questions simply don't have answers. It's a logical fallacy to assume an answer before acquiring data to analyse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really understand why the thermodynamics states that universe cannot have existed forever. Please, elaborate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wonder: where does your information come from? It seems like you've replaced difficult to understand facts with your opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been no empirical experiment devised yet that proves that god does or doesn't exist. I am fairly confident about that. This means that existence of God is a question outside the realm of science. Which is a system that confirms facts through empirical evidence. Without a designed, repeatable experiment the existence of God cannot be scientifically pondered upon. Thus it's illogical to evoke science as a proof of Gods existence. It's like trying to use a 30cm ruler to measure the colour schemes of one's favourite memory. It simply isn't the right tool for that task and none has been devised yet. To the best of my knowledge that is.

       OP challenged some others with completely ridiculous nonsense, but dared not responding to your actual science. That in itself is the ultimate tell-all here. I've seen some shit, but this thread is beyond nuts.

       What amazes me the most is how much time was seemingly put into being so obtuse to reality.

       It is against the Law of the Heavenly Father.  He commanded that "kind was to reproduce after kind".
      </p>
      <p>
       Race-mixing destroys the races as they were created by the Heavenly Father.  If all whites mix with non-whites, then the white/European race as we know it will cease to exist.  And all of those unique characteristics of the white race will cease to exist -- notably the ability of the white/European peoples to invent, create, and maintain the high level of civilization we now enjoy.

       Wow so because of a difference in the tint of the melanin in my skin due to my ancestors proximity to the equator I am more capable of invention and creativity than the likes of Alexander Dumas, George Washington Carver, and MLK Jr. I had no idea thanks for clearing that up.

       No I don't believe that there is a "superior race" any notion of the sort is likely racist, and you are mistaken, a simple google search will reveal all the brilliant inventions and innovations that black people are responsible for.

       Then reality is "racist".  It is just a fact that there is no equality among the races.  Some are superior and some are inferior.  Just as humans are superior to other animals (eg, cats, dogs, cows).
      </p>
      <p>
       That is just reality.  Now, if you want to believe the jewish/Marxist propaganda about "equality of the races", then you are just kowtowing to propaganda.

       How is one race better than another? You've made several extraordinary claims that require extraordinary evidence if you expect people to come to your line of thinking. Is there ANY reliable scientific evidence that supports one race being somehow superior to another? I'd love to see it.

       I disagree that Asians are smarter than whites.  Are you saying that? I argue that whites/Europeans are the most intelligence.

       I fucking wish the establishment was Marxist, all we have is self destructive neoliberals now. What I think is that IQ has no value as an assessment of genetic intelligence, and more to do with upbringing. Also it doesn't equal intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       What YOU are doing is basing all your beliefs on IQ differences, except for when it doesn't apply (asians) for some reason. I really hope you're trolling or mentally ill.

       My beliefs on differences in the races is based on a vast array of evidence -- ie, from the Bible, logic, biology and science, history, reality (eg, the types of civiliztions created by the various races), etc.

       As someone has said before, the egyptians and later the arabs were  living in splendor while europeans were eating mud. The Aztecs had a bigger city than anything in europe, complete with schools, water services and parks. And I don't believe any german or Englishman would be willing to let you appropriate their cultural heritage as something you had any part in.

       "Species" is a HUMAN created defintion/terminology/distiction.  A lion and a tiger can breed with each other.  So can a horse and zebra.  This does not prove common ancestral origin.  Lions are separate creations from tigers.  And horses are a separate creation from zebras.  They did not descend from a common ancestor.

       So you are saying that there is no supernatural realm?  No supernatural entities?  No supernatural "events" are possible?

      <p>
       The universe being created was a supernatural event.  There must be a "Higher Power" that created the physical universe.

      <p>
       You don't want limitations because you only have one resource for the creation myth...a 2,000 year old book.  You know without this ONE book, you have zero argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are thousands and thousands of research documents supporting evolutionary theory. You are typing on a device which allows you to access this information and learn so, so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google evolutionary theory, do some reading, and get back to me when you understand concepts such as observation and extrapolation to larger groups, taxonomic patterns of relationships among organisms, vestigial organs, biochemical similarities, genetic drift, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you are one who believes the creation myth, I suspect it will take you some time to ramp up to debate level, and I don't have time to bring you up to a high school-level understanding of science.

       Well, I had to get condescending because your a dense and there was no other way to get the point across.  I was aiming for your shoelaces with my comments, but they still went over your head.  The point is that while there are literally THOUSANDS of documents supporting evolution, you have one old book.  Without that book, you have nothing!  There is not even any credible evidence for Jesus outside of the bible. It is a book of stories, with supernatural effects thrown in to arouse emotions.  If you are looking to the bible for scientific answers, you're going to come up with nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need to convert anyone because most thinking people understand the theory evolution is supported by facts.  Just because you don't agree with the fact dos not negate them.  These facts still exist.  You can't say that about burning bushes or dead men rising from a grave.  These things do not happen in reality.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       This comment alone shows the depth of your ignorance, and I mean that with full condescension.  A simple Google search will put plenty of evidence right before your eyes.  You are making the choice to not look into all the evidence supporting evolutionary theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The limitations on the discussion rest fully in your court.  You have no source other than the bible, and you appear to have not even a basic understanding of science or evolutionary theory.  If you did, I would have expected to see something of it by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I won't debate you for a few reasons. First, your position is "God did it.", and there is no evidence for any god at all.  So you'd have to prove the existence of one before you can even say the words "God did it".  Otherwise, it's just me sharing facts and you replying "God did it". Second, because you haven't used facts or reason to reach your beliefs, so no amount of facts or reason will move you away from them.  Trying to put facts in front of you would be the proverbial "pearls before swine".  (That's a bible reference, btw.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I won't continue because you put forth information from a Christian Identity website and espoused similar beliefs in your post and comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christian Identity is a known hate group.  You are promoting their beliefs.  I'm just here to point out to you what is obvious to so many others; your beliefs are hateful, outdated, and have no relevance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't lost a thing.  You have failed to show even a basic understanding of science.  When you can demonstrate you've grasped the concepts I mentioned earlier, we'll talk.  Until then, good luck with your little hate group.

       Perhaps I am pompous.  But I'm also right.  And there is plenty of evidence, you just don't have the will to review it or the capacity to understand it.  So you simply call it BS.  This way, you don't have to acknowledge your inferiority.  A lot of Jews and non-whites understand evolution, you know.

       I have reviewed it.  That's why I realize the theory of evolution for what it is.  Garbage. Here is an article I wrote on it.

       Because we know/believe the jews to be imposters.  They are not real Israelites.  They are not of the tribe of Judah.  They are actually children and followers of Satan, and the biggest enemies of the true Israelites (ie, white Europeans).

       Maybe you had a bad teacher?  My high school biology teacher was an over-the-top christian, and he addressed evolution as little as possible.  Fortunately, in college, I was able to seek out more classes and gain a better understanding of evolution.

       I love how, when challenged, conspiracy theorists just tell you to look something up. They can't be bothered to present any evidence or even a CliffsNotes version of what they're trying to assert.

       Wow, I've read all you're comments, and must be certifiably bat shit crazy or an epic troll. Like flat-earthers and the like, you completely dismiss science and logic where it suits and yet incorrectly use it where it to suits to fit your narrative.

       Oh mine was removed. Fair enough, however in future it would be better if you removed comments by the normal process, with an official message from the mods and not just you replying to the comment and this would avoid such confusion.
       <br/>
       Also it would be great if reports of definitive breaking of all rules were removed like my "must" comment was followed with an pretty clear explanation.

       This is our standard procedure here, and in fact not all the mods here give a reply to each removed comment. I distinguished my comment removal as a mod (my name is in green), and listed the rule violated. We get ~200 reports a day, maybe more, and the mods have lives outside of this. If we sent mod mail notices for each removed comment, it would clutter it more than it already is.

       Ok thank you, I wrongly assumed that there was a procedure across Reddit but now understand that you are not even required to inform that it has happened, so I thank you that you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I appreciate that you are busy, but for future reference, if something is inferred but not stated, is going that in violation of the rules e.g.
      </p>

       As much as we try to enforce the rules as consistently as possible, each mod interprets them slightly differently when it comes to applying them, trying to uphold the spirit of the rule. The reason we have rule 10 (and rule 4) is to encourage users to attack arguments, not other users. Rule 10 specifically (but not exclusively) prohibits users from calling others shills or trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem if we let users make indirect but clear implications of these accusations or insults is that the real problem users (which I don't at present think you are) just couch their language in thinly veiled suggestion, and we end up back where we started, with users attacking
       <em>
        users
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We're more likely to let something like that slide than a direct accusation, but I wouldn't count on it. I think you'd be better off saying something like "I disagree with you on x, y, z, but I don't think you're arguing in good faith so I won't continue this conversation." If the user is truly a troll, what they want is to provoke you and drag you into a conversation you cannot "win," and get you to break our rules.

       Can you imagine how annoying it would be if someone repeatedly said your favourite book or video game didn't exist? Like if a group of people were repeatedly to tell you "Yeah, Mario Bros 1 for NES doesn't exist." "People have claimed to play it, but I know it never even came out." "It doesn't matter that there are screen shots, cartridges, and first hand accounts, I know it's fake." See how stupid your type of thinking is bud?

       I do love seeing ridiculous posts like this one downvoted to zero. Evolution is not fraudulent, the Bible is a joke, and the history of the Earth is far more complicated than you imagine it to be. Dinosaurs didn't walk with humans, Jesus didn't come back to life, nobody has ever lived to 900 years old, etc. etc.

       From reading this thread, OP has gone to great lengths to rationalize white superiority/racism by means of religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strange that so many extremely religious, anti-jewish, racist, hateful people have found their way here recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone hasn't noticed, this has a lot to do with /altright, their new home at /pussypass, the Antifa craziness, and an overall push by white nationalists to infiltrate different places on this site. It ramped up within the past two weeks, here in this sub at least. (I observe such things).
      </p>
      <p>
       Surprisingly, on such hot-button issues, most of the people here are being cordial and inquisitive. OP is not interested in constructive discussion or debate though, that much is clear by reading the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's here to push his agenda and perhaps seek out/recruit like-minded people.

       "White" countries should be able to close their borders to a flood of refugees (I'm pro nationalism).

      <p>
       The problem is these racial problems you talk about are manufactured.

       TPTB have been proven to exploit poorer nations through bribery, corruption, puppetry and outright war.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also purposefully disenfranchised the ethnic communities of Western countries by segregating them, flooding them with drugs, profiling them through law enforcement etc. This obviously creates disdain for the overwhengly white establishment they perceive as being responsible. Combine that with the manufactured content you read and we have white nationalism.

       All dogs do not share a common ancestral origin either.  There is no way that an original wolf pair reproduced, and somehow thousands of years later we have hundreds of breeds/species of canines, including wolves, dogs, coyotes, etc.  There were originally a number of separate creations, including a number of different dog breeds.  Subsequently, there has been some mixing, producing hybrid breeds of dogs.

       Far from it.  Those books have predicted future events in detail and with accuracy that can only be explained by a "supernatural" authorship.

       Fringe or being a minority does not mean you are factually wrong.  It's the opposite.  What is popular is usually wrong.  Most people are deceived.

       For starters, you claim adherence to the concepts of Christian Identity, a hate group.  One only needs to read their literature to see.  CI is monitored by the FBI as well.  Also, you spoke poorly of "Arabs" (your term), mixed-race people, Jews, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       For sake of honesty, I look down on some people too, but only because of certain personal choices, not the things they can't control, such as their race.  For example, I think people in the Christian Identity movement are weak-minded losers who can't acknowledge or accept their own personal failures, so they lash out at others to make themselves feel better. They need to scapegoat others because they are too weak to make positive changes in their own lives.
