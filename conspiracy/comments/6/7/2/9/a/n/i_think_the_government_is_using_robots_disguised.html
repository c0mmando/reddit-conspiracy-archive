        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am being serious about this, I&#39;d appreciate any advice you can give me. I&#39;ve heard for years now that they have the ability to make robots the size of pennies that can fly like mosquitoes. I think a similar thing is happening to me right now. I&#39;ve been looking at conspiracy websites more than usual lately, and I think the government is sending bird robots to spy on my house because of this. It&#39;s been happening to me for the past couple weeks. </p>

<p>I have noticed a lot more birds than usual lately, and they&#39;ve been acting very suspiciously. I see them when I walk in the door from work. They&#39;ve been on my rooftop and they just.... they look at me, they jerk their heads around in this robotic way and make these monotonous chirps, like an audio file playing over and over again. They don&#39;t act like normal birds, they don&#39;t seem that afraid of humans. </p>

<p>For the past few days, I&#39;ve been at my window staring at them as they hop all over my lawn and my driveway. The way their heads move, as I said, it&#39;s in these sudden jerks, like they&#39;re trying to get a better angle. I&#39;ve never seen them eat, poop, mate, nothing that could suggest they&#39;re biological. They also always stay in these groups though. </p>

<p>I am not an expert on birds, so I don&#39;t know what kind of bird they are, they are brown though, and kind of small. Anyway, I&#39;ve been watching them from my window, and they seem to gravitate around my car, especially the license plate part. They might be sending pictures of my license plate or other information to the government so they can identify me. </p>

<p>Whenever I walk outside, they fly away, but not like how you&#39;d expect a bird to. They still stay in the general area, they perch themselves on the rooftop and they continue to stare at me. One day I just lost it. I yelled at them, &quot;LEAVE ME ALONE&quot; I yelled at them. They flew away, as if on cue, but they&#39;ve kept coming back. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to take pictures and videos of them, but they evade any attempts to get a good picture of them, like they recognize the camera and are evading it. I&#39;ll try to maybe throw rocks at them and maybe destroy one so I can dismantle and study it. I need advice, there&#39;s been more birds lately and I&#39;m freaking out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like u/sailorchubbybutt said, get a BB gun. However this is for your own sanity. You&#39;re caught in a spiral of going to. Conspiracy websites, thinking you&#39;re on to something, and thinking you&#39;re now important enough to spy on. That&#39;s why you noticed the birds. Besides, how many act weird? They would only need one. Besides, birds all act weird you are just now noticing it because you are spooking yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are going to take the piss out of you but I believe you , I had a similar experience and even took a picture of them, they looked like seagulls but we&#39;re behaving strangely , also rare for us to get seagulls in our area, this one seagull looked like it had a camera mounted on its head behind the eye , it was a black circle , it was flying slowly by my window and honestly though &quot;I&#39;m going nuts here &quot; but after getting my camera out and shooting some pics they left, immediately. Very strange. Im at work now but will try to find them on my SD card tomorrow. No promises but I&#39;ll try . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On this subject randomly, I lived in an area called Cape Coral FL. There was this weird ass group of large flies. Like very large and about the size of a dime for their body. They would fly and circle me and anyone who walked around outside. And they would also just camp outside the window holding position staring into it.</p>

<p>But the weirdest thing of it all is there was no source of food to explain these flies. One time my brother left his window open and his room literally filled with flies. He had to just basically grab bug spray and u I am not saying it was robots or spying. But insects can do really reallly weird shit. I attributed it to a possible native american curse on the land or something supernatural because it defied reason.</p>

<p>Actually I asked my brother and he said he just happened to try casting a stupid harmless spell off the internet. Weird coincidence but that is my story. Insects can be weird.</p>

<p>Go to Wal-Mart, buy a pump BB gun, come home, find target, adjust for windage, eliminate the target and then examine the remains for any electronic stuff.</p>

<p>I have two questions for you though: 1) what makes you so special that resources of this nature would be allocated to be used against you personally?  2)  If you excommunicate one of those birds, or many of them, and discover they are just normal birds, how will you respond?</p>

Just make sure you don&#39;t shoot something else by accident and get in trouble.  And don&#39;t let your neighbors see, probably freak them out and call the cops.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s plenty of explanations that don&#39;t involve making up hypothesis after hypothesis to explain what you are noticing and theorizing. Figure out what kind of bird they are. If you don&#39;t know much about birds their habits might seem strange. It might not just be coincidences, there could be reasons but they could be perfectly normal reasons that you just haven&#39;t thought of yet. Maybe the monotonous chirp is a special mating call that they don&#39;t normally use. Maybe they normally tilt their heads to get better angle at the ground to look for worms or bugs. Maybe they are nesting in the area and and are watching over the area to look for possible predators (including you). Maybe there are lots of them lately because they just got back from migrating, or maybe there was an overpopulation last year. Being paranoid about something that suddenly seems unusual to you is normal enough, just keep your wits about you and try not to blow it out of proportion by forgetting to consider normal explanations or perspectives on whatever you think is strange could exist that you just might not be aware of.</p>

Stand casually near the birds and start loudly saying things things like &quot;Lady Di was killed by the North Koreans&quot;, or &quot;UFO Jesus comes tonight!&quot;.
