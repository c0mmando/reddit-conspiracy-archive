       Didn't want to post this in r/movies because I'll have everyone jump down my conspiracy nut job throat.
So I took my 5y/o niece to go watch this movie the other day and boy was I confused. 
I've never seen a movie except maybe Star Wars being pushed in advertisement as much as this (I'm from the UK), even more so than Frozen and Moana was, I have been seing that stupid baby face EVERYWHERE for months!!! I've seen people talk about this movie and maybe it's relevance/references to Trump. This isn't far fetched at all as I would go as far as saying the baby even sort of looks like Trump, but this wasn't the first thing that caught my eye. It's not new to have ideas that they put all sort of messed up subliminal messages and symbols in kids films and for whatever reason, or whatever out come they might have- this movie is messed up. The story line is just fucking weird beyond belief and it kind of doesn't really make sense. The little boy jumps in and out of reality and they change the art style when he's in his "imagination" which of course looks like an insane acid trip which we've all seen hundreds of times in kids movies. But sometimes when strange, unimaginable things are going on the art work remains as if he's in his "reality"... It just doesn't make a lot of sense and if I had no clue what the heck was going on then I'm sure no kid would either lol. 
One of the very first scenes talks about triangles and how it's the strongest shape and how his family is based upon that shape. Continuously throughout the movie there are triangles (wall paper, toys, photos) Which then cuts to a cute picture of the family with the little boy pointing at his one showing eye. 
The story gets weirder, so the baby is on a mission to stop the mass production of a puppy that stays a puppy forever. (by the way even though it's just a kids film and it's just animation, the way they portray the treatment of the dogs in this film is kinda fucked up) This puppy is "stealing" the love of people so that families don't love their kids as much as they love the dog and this is actually in the script... Super weird. 
Another point is the HUGE undeniable amount of sexualization of babies and children. There's even a scene where babies gather around squirting milk on the naked main baby!!! Lots of touching and slapping naked baby bums. 
One of the last scenes (I might be wrong, only watched it once) it looked to me like the Dad had a boner lying on the sofa... Maybe I'm wrong about that one though. Even so, this film was fucking weird and I might be crazy but yeah. Just wanted to know if anyone else saw the same shit as me.

       OMG, that movie was so so so so so indescribably horrible. We hadn't seen any trailers for sausage fest so had no idea what it would be, but the written description sounded like it could be stupid-funny when it appeared on Netflix or Amazon prime so we gave it a shot. We watched the whole thing with jaws dropped in horror. We wanted to turn it off, but it was so bad we couldn't look away. We had to talk about how bad it was when it was over. The next day over breakfast we had to talk about how bad it was some more. Sometimes I still get flashbacks of the douche and the juice box!
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't understand how that many people were involved in making something that fucking awful! That's more than too much coke &amp; weed can explain, and I don't know any psychedelics that wouldn't make such a horrific screenplay seem
       <em>

       horrific.

       Sausage Party had a great message though. Not to believe in retarded shit without evidence. The whole point of the movie was that these old foods were telling a false story of what happens after they leave the store, and it was only good things. And this made all the food really happy and they all wanted to leave, and thus were easy to control. Just like how religion is so controlling in today's society. The movie was pretty dumb, but the message was clearly there, and a good one too.

       it's anyone's interpretation.. kinda relates to religion a little more since there's a Jew, Arab, buddhists, and the majority are Christian. The main theme is clearly there, but other messages can be found as well.

       I got a bj during the movie, so can't complain. Also, how dumb are you to lump an adult-themed movie with a children's movie? They're both animated, and that's where the comparisons end.

       Well that sounds horrible... I agree it sounds so shady. I think I'm trying to avoid the normalization of "babies are just like us, treat them like adults!"-thing after watch the fucked up Miley Cyrus video (baby talk) lol it just freaks me out too much.

       Right??? I do believe it is a part of a very sick agenda to normalise the sexualization of children. This goes out so far as well, I'm not sure how to explain it without rambling. All of these pedo groups (NAMBLA, Heart Progress) are all trying to join the LGBTQ as "pedosexuals". And this huge push on tolerance and accepting difference is getting worrying. I'm sure there's enough decent people in this world to never let these groups get what they want (age of consent laws changes, decriminalization of sex with minors) but it does worry me greatly that this left wing culture of accept EVERYONE could go too far... Now I'm aware of it, I see it everywhere. It makes me sick.

       P.s there's sooooooo much conspiracy about Miley Cyrus, she got fucked up as a kid. Probably raped and sold out by her dad and Disney. There's no denying that Disney kids get horrifically abused...

       Spoil away!  You couldn't pay me to sit through a contemporary mainstream animated children's film.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a sidenote, I just saw "Moonlight" which was tediously slow, underwritten and poorly written.  It wasn't just me who was bored. 
 A couple of people walked out of the cinema: others played with their phones the whole time.  How the hell did this get the Oscar for best picture?  There is something very wrong with Hollywood right now.

       No. He understands that teaching children to confuse themselves over gender is not to empower their rights. It's to confuse and demoralize them. This was proven in the wikileaks email of Bill Ivey to John Podesta.

       A friend of mine watched this movie recently, and she had to tell me about how fucking bizarre it was.  I can understand now why the trailers were so misleading before the release:  it's a complete garbage fire.

       That being said (and keeping in mind I have no intention of watching it), it's worth keeping in mind that you may be looking too much into it.  Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

       Totally agree! But after having see this shit repeated in sooooooooo many movies, Disney especially. It's really super hard to not notice it. Since it's all animated, everything put in them is 100% intentional. I duno, it's weird!!

       The list is quite a long one. So many of the (old, I'm young so I guess they're not really that old) movies for kids are pretty weird, endless sex jokes and drug references. People think it's innocent and shrug it off cos kids don't see/notice it, but that's why it is called subliminal. lots of rude images and as much as people would like to say "you're only seeing it cos you want to see it" or whatever, the problem I have with that is it's all animated. Every little bit of art work on the screen is intentionally put there. I don't know, maybe it is harmless, maybe it's not. But I do know it's there

       Really?! Just google Disney drug or sex reference and you'll find a whole bunch of em lol. Monsters Inc one where there's a drawing of a man having sex with a woman on the little girls wall is fake, I spotted this one when I watched the movie the other day. So take some of it with a pinch of salt, but keep an open mind still.

       Discussing this movie elsewhere and this is a response I get, it sounds insane but once you start seeing it in almost every disney movie and sooo many kids tv shows it really does make sense.

       "Don't watch those movies. Your subconscious is picking up things you wouldn't believe. Your subconscious is incredibly smart. Can see nano second images flashing on the screen that your conscious mind will not detect. It can read/listen forwards and backwards at the same time in a few nano seconds. Later words, images, or sounds will trigger something that was stored i your subconscious and you will think they are your original thoughts. I know and could replicate this wicked technology myself but it will still fool me. No one is immune, even the creators and designers of it. Kind of a beast technology that turns on everyone. Your niece will start acting sexual and crave drugs and partying and won't know why. Poor children today. A complete onslaught against their fragile minds. Remember the road to Hell is paved with the best intentions. Your niece will remember eating someplace with you or going to the park much more favorably down the road.﻿"

       Any movie being promoted and glorified by the machine is inherently toxic.

       Thanks for posting your feelings and gut intuition about this fucked up movie. I have thought that something is weird about this movie by just watching a few trailers, and now I know it's fucked. As a preschool teacher I hear my kids talking about this movie and it creeps me out. I wish there wasn't such thing as pedos and sexualizing children, but its real and it's being done more than you think and by people you would never think could do such atrocities. We can act like its not there and go on with our ignorance, or we can choose to acknowledge it and try to protect against it in our lives as best we can and Kerri each other informed about things like this that make us uncomfortable. Man, I can't even eat pizza nowadays comfortably, dammit, but that's the price I pay for being awake to this shit. Keep up the good fight and never let others opinions or reactions hinder you from trusting your gut! ✌❤

       My wife and I watched this while tripping on acid, and we came to almost the same conclusion. Something didn't seem right about the way life and families were portraid.

       I currently do some security work at a cinema and last weekend this film was without a doubt the most popular. Every screening of Boss Baby was busy and all the others were pretty quiet. You're right when you say it has been heavily advertised and kids seem super excited to be seeing the film. Even parents seem to be excited about seeing it, something that's pretty uncommon for films like this. I can't say much about your ideas on subliminal messaging as I haven't seen much of it, but I can definitely say something about it made me really uncomfortabe, even though I was only ever there for 5 mins tops each time. I quite enjoy a good animated film and often get a good laugh from them. This one is different though, I genuinely hate it. It makes me really uncomfortable and I'm not sure exactly why. Maybe you're onto something.

       Well, apparently it was a shitty movie. Why waste the entire 2 hours just to find out the shitty ending?

       it's anyone's interpretation.. kinda relates to religion a little more since there's a Jew, Arab, buddhists, and the majority are Christian. The main theme is clearly there, but other messages can be found as well.
