    <div class="md"><p>I believe you should be able to think, feel, and say whatever the fuck you want, even if its racist or stupid or anything. Its when you act on things or talk about how you&#39;re going to murder someone that it becomes a problem. You don&#39;t have to be tolerant or even fucking like anyone, and when you tell someone they can&#39;t say this or use that word, it violates freedom of speech, and is basically a form of control. Should you want to get along with everyone and say nice things? Sure. But should you HAVE to, by force or threat? Fuck no. No was has the right to tell you how you should talk and think or what words you can say or opinions you personally hold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious, but are you a libertarian by any chance?</p>

<p>I hold similar views and feel like a lot of things: drugs, hate speech, etc. should NOT be policed by governments and the only acceptable situation where &quot;free speech&quot; isn&#39;t allowed is if you violate someone else&#39;s rights. Preaching violence/death threats, etc. shouldn&#39;t be allowed. But people need to stop fucking pretending like they have a right to not be offended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I have no idea anymore, but I guess some of my values align with libertarian. I just want my family and I to be left the fuck alone. If I don&#39;t want to use roads or government services and just want to be a self-sufficient hermit, on land that I already own, I shouldn&#39;t have to pay taxes, property or otherwise. I feel that as decent human being we SHOULD want to help out our fellow man in whatever capacity we can, the old, disabled etc, but we shouldn&#39;t HAVE to by law or threat of force. I feel like we could benefit from some sort of communal safety net that if we put into it and end up sick or jobless, we can use it, but if you don&#39;t put into it and you get sick, guess what, you&#39;re on your own. I feel like all the shit has been passed off as so complicated for so long by TPTB, we feel the only people who can run it or maintain it are the same sheissters who fucked it up in the first place. Just be a decent person, don&#39;t fuck with other people even if you don&#39;t like them, and do what makes you happy. Ha, sounds pretty libertarian I guess, but I don&#39;t like being pigeon holed into a single concept, that&#39;s how people use your own believes to attack you, through bullshit labels. Just be human.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. I wish it were possible to completely do away with countries/states, etc. all over the world and if we respected each other and helped people in need without being forced to do so. Unfortunately, this will probably never become real and will always remain a delusional wish since negative traits like greed, jealousy, etc. cannot be eradicated.</p>

<p>A lot of problems with the current world are due to how the money system, education, etc. work. Society pretty much expects you to behave/think in a specific way and you become an outcast if you deviate too much from it. Also, if the elites stopped being so greedy and worked towards positive change, humanity could achieve so much more...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole greed thing isn&#39;t natural I believe. The elite have perpetuated it for centuries and have turned it into some twisted kind of &#39;value&#39; and made life so the only way you can get ahead or support yourself is to be as selfish, self-important, and competitive as possible, when in reality, most of us have a common goal that could be accomplished a lot quicker and better together. That&#39;s why they pushed that Ayn Rand garbage to the younger generation so hard and you still hear politicians talking about it as one of their influences or values to this day. Its absolute shit, and essentially churns out psychopaths. That&#39;s why I&#39;m saving up for a tiny house, or two, getting a little patch of land and some solar panels and my wife an I will make just enough to cover property tax and health insurance if needed. And any G-men that come sniffing around will be dispatched. I wish we could get enough people together to try another attempt at one of those communes they started in the 60&#39;s n 70&#39;s(a few still exist) and grow our own shit, make our own products, provide our own protection, and mind our own business. The only reason others didn&#39;t work out as well was because of electricity and taxes, but we got all sorts of fantastic technology and renewable energy now, it could totally work...ah to dream..</p>

Now that there&#39;s a groundswell of pushback wishing to reclaim aspects of our country that were taken from us they have dropped the mask and revealed that they care not about free speech but marxism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They literally advertise r/AskThe_Donald on the top of the sub to get people with different opinions to ask questions and create discussion.</p>

<p>Almost every sub is a safe space for their topic.  You can&#39;t go to a sub for a specific game only to talk shit about it and expect not to be banned, you can&#39;t go to a singer or artists fanboy sub and expect not to get banned for talking shit.  That&#39;s just how Reddit works.</p>

<p>The titles you&#39;re complaining about are literally just to trigger you.  That&#39;s the goal, you see it and you can&#39;t do anything about it, it&#39;s only purpose is to annoy you, and for other people to laugh about and shitpost in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s beneficial to everyone involved.  On the separate sub you&#39;re more likely to have your topic discussed by people open to discussion.  I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a bad thing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really get the hate, I&#39;d happily ask a lefty if I could without immediately being downvoted to -50 and being called a bigot/moron.  I love civil debate and discussion. </p>

<p>And td&#39;s censorship complaints are about their subscriber and online numbers being fudged, and being quarantined from all.  Those are different than moderators deciding what is appropriate for a subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s still an ignorant statement. For one you speak in absolutes by calling alt-righters racist &quot;because they are&quot;, which is no way evidence to support your claim. Also you state that white supremacist created the &quot;term&quot; (not the movement) alt-right to make themselves mainstream. I see the correlation between racism and the alt-right, but I don&#39;t see how a small faction (white supremacist) of a larger group (alt-right) makes you reach the conclusion that the alt-right are racist. There are racist people on the left, doesn&#39;t mean the left is racist just means they have some racist people who also agree with their ideology. I personally can&#39;t stand anyone who plays in identify politics, if you consider yourself left or right, alt-this alt-that then most the time I don&#39;t care what you have to say cause I can just turn on the TV or go online and have someone else regurgitate the same talking points to me.</p>

In the first paragraph it mentions how Richard Spenser appropriated the term. The term itself was first used by a humanities professor to describe paleoconservatism so I was wrong about white supremacists actually creating the term. There are some interviews where Richard Spencer himself talks about using the term to normalize anti-Semitism that I can&#39;t find on a quick google search. You can believe me or not or find them yourself I don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>Richard Spenser then went on to create the website &quot;Alternative Right&quot; which he used as a platform for his white supremacist ideas. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Right">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Right</a></p>

<p>Are there self identifying alt-righters out there who aren&#39;t racists? Sure there probably are, just as there probably are self identifying vegans who eat meat. But to say that the alt - right movement wasn&#39;t founded for the sole purpose of promoting racism is naive and ignorant. </p>

<p>But yes I am talking to you.  I think you have a rather prejudiced view of &quot;conservatives&quot; based on your comment. And though Ann Colter does say some crazy things she also says true things too.  And that&#39;s why they won&#39;t let her speak.  People might listen to her say that whatever we are doing now isn&#39;t working re economics, illegal immigration etc.  It&#39;s time to own the truth of the incarceration rates and the real unemployment numbers.  Her answers may be wrong but her questions are often extremely relevant and shrewd.</p>

<p>A wall is absurd... or scary and she needs to stop and rethink that and how it worked for East Germany walling out the west because they were really walling in miserable East Germans.  That will be us...</p>

<p>If it is so fundamentally and obviously flawed why the terror at letting a conservative speak? Why avoid even a reasoned discourse and debate that would do more to sway people against a &quot;flawed&quot; belief system than censorship, bans and violent attacks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The worst part of this, in my opinion, is that by essentially taking their platform, they&#39;re pushing more people further to the right.  College exists to challenge your ideals and to learn.  Plugging your ears and taking away someone&#39;s right to voice their opinion is... discourse in this country should not be like this.</p>

<p>So many of the more extreme views of the alt-right can be made to look foolish through intellectually honest debate.  That they choose to go this route is idiotic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is that conservative beliefs are usually based on appeal-to-tradition fallacies in the social realm (many times, conservatives are correct in economics), as people like Coulter are arguing.</p>

<p>The problem is that there is no real left in the US. Bernie is an example of a true man of the &quot;left&quot; as opposed to radical liberals - or postmodern &quot;regressive leftists.&quot; Their arguments are based on no truth being objective, and, therefore, <em>any</em> argument contrary to their regressive ideals can be taken as a threat. For, how can one argue in the realm of ideas if no idea can claim objective truth?</p>

<p>The fact is, we don&#39;t have right vs left in the US, in which the left generally holds more objective arguments because they shed the constant appeals to tradition and religion. We have right vs postmodernist, in which both sides are appealing to nonsense. </p>

Neither of us cares a whit for the crap Ann Coulter has to say, and I bet he thinks she is as intellectually dishonest as I do - but that just makes the things she says easier to refute when they need refuting, anyway. Most claims of censorship I see anymore are basically &quot;all I did was call the mod a ###### jew ####, because they said they don&#39;t believe in lizard people! wtf did I get banned?! TYRANNY!&quot; Where the pound signs/hashtags represent some form of generic disgustingness that is obviously beyond the bounds of acceptable common decency or the like. Often by people who defend the practice of heavily moderating their own favorite subreddit, etc. Reddit drama versus real world censhorship, which can be pretty dire in particularly draconian regimes... people comparing their shitty ban to the other makes my blood boil.</p>

<p>if you only read one, read the one from the black agenda report, it offers the best explanation of sheepdogging i&#39;ve seen recently.</p>

<p>to know the true bernie, all you have to know is this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2007/07/feingold-finds-little-backing-for-censure-005098">http://www.politico.com/story/2007/07/feingold-finds-little-backing-for-censure-005098</a></p>

<p>that he voted for AUMF and every airstrike and sanction against iraq in the 1990s, the same ones that killed 500,000 iraqi children that madeline albright sad was worth it.</p>

<p>and that he choses to cynically call himself a socialist, when nothing could be farther from the truth. by definition, socialists are dedicated to erradicating capitalism, not putting lipstick on the capitalist pig. they believe that workers should own the businesses at which they work (and thus the means of production) and that workers are by inalienable right, entitled to all of the profit their labor generates. </p>

<p>bernie is a kensyian capitalist, in europe, where there are actual socialist parties, he would be a social democrat--a person who throws the 99% a bone, but essentially supports the social power structure status quo. it is not the fact that he is not a socialist that is the problem, but that he employs orwellian newspeak to pervert its definition.</p>

<p>there is the left. there are the &quot;progressives/liberals,&quot; who&#39;ve chosen to adopt the names of two conservative ideologies (the progressive party was a republican splinter party. liberals, properly, are people who believe in classical liberal, laissez faire economics. in europe, the proper definition has never stopped being used. in europe, &quot;liberals&quot; are firmly on the right of the aisle). and then there are democrats (whom are kept in power by sheepdogged progressives/liberals.</p>

<p>Realizing all my life I have really been a classical liberal most of my life. But the terms all get twisted and hijacked.  Like &quot;capitalism&quot; is demonized but that&#39;s not actually what we have at all.  No one has true capitalism that I know of now, only know of Iceland throwing out the bankers.</p>

<p>We have a manipulated economy controlled by bankers and the biggest corporations who also control the regulatory agencies, politicians etc.</p>

<p>Also, yes, Bernie reacted to the violence in that quote selfishly. He&#39;s fine with it as long as it is distanced from him. He&#39;s a shit. I&#39;m glad he lost and lost so badly in the primaries against one of the most unelectable people to ever run. He and Hillary could not have done more to hand the presidency to Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, reddit has gotten to the point where reason, logic, and common sense has flown out the window. </p>

<p>That you can&#39;t even grasp the difference between Sanders denouncing <em>all</em> violence and distancing himself from violent supporters of his halfway across the country <strong>with</strong> Trump literally calling for violence and championing violence at his rallies and skirting any denouncment of violence and you not understanding your own hypocrisy in your initial post is beyond astounding. Mental gymnastics galore. </p>

<p>&quot;Sanders is evil because he didn&#39;t denounce violence the way I wanted him too! O yeah, Trump championed violence and egged his supporters on to be violent but HEY, that&#39;s different!&quot; 😂🤣</p>

<p>Bernie didn&#39;t have to denounce the protesters at the trump rally it wouldn&#39;t have made any difference to him or his popularity among leftists, the point is that he did when he really didn&#39;t have too. The selfish thing to do would be to not denounce any violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will admit I felt a bit at odds with myself watching those clips out of context. </p>

<p>But the fact remains that Trump was reacting to violent Bernie supporters attacking people at his rallies with (famously in the case of San Jose and now Berkeley) violently.</p>

<p>At the time I suppose I saw this as Trump rallying people to not submit to the violence against them, but out of context like this I can see how you would assume he was calling for it.</p>

I also never attacked wikipedia because as soon as I asked if you read their sources YOU were the one who immediately started showering me with more links to go through. I would love nothing more than to go one reference at a time with you and discuss them, but you dump wikipedia on me so I (not you) read the sources. Don&#39;t try and shift the focus on me when it was you who didn&#39;t do their homework.  </p>
