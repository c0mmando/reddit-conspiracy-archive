       Ok, so chances are I'll get banned for this as I was from (The_Donald) for asking a serious question.
      </p>
      <p>
       A year ago, this sub was full of genuine theories relating to classical conspiracy topics. It's now morphed into something different. 80% of posts now are related to pizzagate, the Clinton's and Podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not conspiracies, if anything they are legal issues. What happened to everything else?
      </p>
      <p>
       I miss things like the advanced space programs, 9/11, secret weapon systems, GOOD alternative history theories, ancient history and civilisations, CIA/NSA programs, black budget programs, media control, political control, Antarctica, mass surveillance, Illuminati, Golden Dawn, Bohemian Grove, Petro Dollar, the IMF, the Rothchilds, Rockerfellers, the Central Bank, Genetic Engineering, Alien and reverse engineered technology and the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it time to go back to a true conspiracy forum as opposed to the day to day ramblings of of a few people placing their entire belief structure around some 4 chan pranksters claiming to be part of the establishment when in reality they are probably 15 year old kids sitting in their bedrooms trying to feel important?
      </p>
      <p>
       Things have changed around here so much over the last year and in my opinion not for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm banned for speaking my truth so be it, but keep in mind I was banned from the Don (because people take offence to having to answer a genuine question) when it doesn't fit with their narrow world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im simply interested in how people feel about the way this sub has changed over the last year and whether people believe its for the better or worse.

       You don't remember Bill Clinton being impeached for lying to congress about sexually assaulting women with an illegally imported cigar? John Podesta was his chief of staff and Hillary Clinton Called his accusers whores and bimbos.

       You don't remember Bill Clinton being impeached for lying to congress about sexually assaulting women with an illegally imported cigar? John Podesta was his chief of staff and Hillary Clinton Called his accusers whores and bimbos.

       I am actually happy with the content.
      </p>
      <p>
       The politics is stuff which interests people, and without it there wouldn't be very many posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think that we should clamp down on the kind of abusive 'debunking' which we tend to see on science discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that you can only violate rule 10 by calling someone a shill, troll, or telling someone to kill themselves. I think sarcastic comments like 'haha, what use are scientists against conspiracy nut jobs', should also be considered a violation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe in censorship, but the science conspiracies do need to be given protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only a few places we can discuss conspiracies about DNA, bacteria etc., so it would be a shame if this sub became anti-skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to prevent medical fraud is to hold scientists accountable, so that's what we should do...

       Thanks for your input, I agree with pretty much you say. Just sometimes feels like directing some of that scepticism towards certain topics puts you in the "shill" category for not being on board with something which is put forward as being proven beyond doubt.

       is now more a politics sub because the mods here do not censor, and it's sort of off the beaten path so shills haven't identified and destroyed it, yet. Why the hell would anyone ban you, this is not the donald.

        A year ago, this sub was full of genuine theories relating to classical conspiracy topics. It's now morphed into something different. 80% of posts now are related to pizzagate, the Clinton's and Podesta.

        They are not conspiracies, if anything they are legal issues. What happened to everything else?

       Legal issues?

        Conspire - to join in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement

       No, these are, by definition conspiracies.

       It sounds like you're either a liberal partisan, or you just don't care about politics. Either way, you can't hope to control the content of the sub based on what you're personally interested in. Instead of whining about what other people are in to, make posts about whatever

       There is a lot of conspiracy crossover with alt-right. For example check out their sidebar "red pills" section:

       Broadly, a conspiracy is a plan devised in secret by individuals that goes against the interests of those not in that same circle.

       Pizza gate most definitely belongs in this sub.

       People should be able to talk about whatever they want.

       And I take issue with your 80% figure that you pulled out of nowhere, it is currently nowhere near that.

       Yeah, OK the 80% figure was pulled out of nowhere but it's a pretty good percentage. I never said people shouldn't be able to talk about what they want, my question was about the direction of the conspiracy discussion. Conspiracy and politics are different topics. Child abuse is a different topic. Are they not?

       I'm going to retreat and consider people's responses. Unless others would like to debate. I would like to say thanks to everyone who's contributed in a constructive way to my original question which is nearly everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may not post a lot but have lurked for longer than my current account has been active. I think what I've learned from this is that everyone has the right to make the sub what we want it to be which in my case means to add the topics I'd like to see discussed just as everyone else should.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for keeping this civil
