       Many of us have speculated that there will be a false flag attack, but here is another idea. What if the government set up these drills because they have intelligence that there will be a real attack on the 26th? Maybe they know something is going to happen, and realize they won't be able to stop it, but have set up triage to deal with it when it happens? They know it would cause chaos and pandemonium to announce what intelligence has gathered, so they are just preparing for it's eventuality in the next few days. I'm not saying that I believe this, but offering it as another theory to ponder.

       My theory is that the US is planning on going to war with NK. They expect the possibility that NK will attempt to nuclear strike the US and these drills are in anticipation of this event.

       You realize that the magnitude of such planning across so many Government agencies takes months if not years? Knowledge of an attack and spent countless effort and resources to pretend to deal with it doesn't make sense whatsoever.

       That's actually a pretty solid idea. I mean if there is an attack they will get blamed for incompetence no matter what. At least this way they have an excuse to get all the material in place to mitigate as much loss as is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But otoh, weren't they ready to nuke Pennsylvania or Virginia awhile back as a false flag? I wouldn't put anything past them.

       If you knew someone might attack you today, and you didn't want to make it public knowledge, but you still wanted to prepare, what better way than to have a "drill" right at the same time? It's perfectly plausible that that might be why they had the drills, just like it's perfectly plausible it was to cause confusion and hinder responses. Neither are a coincidence, and neither of us can definitively say who's right.

       Ooh, yeah I see what you were saying. Unfortunately I think it was probably part of the overall plot and meant to hinder a response instead of helping. Sorry if that's what you meant the whole time and now I'm just beating a dead horse

       My favorite explanation is China and the US are playing good cop bad cop. US shows a ton of force, preparation etc. NK says oooh shit! China says dont worry we got US on lock those crazy bastards. Just listen  to us and we will de escalate the situation. No more nukes NK.

       Why would they announce the gathering location of all these senators and government officials etc? You'd think this would be top secret shit. Or maybe it's just a diversion location.. But you'd think with all the tension and hatred toward the US government, their location would be a prime ope trinity to wipe them all out in one glorious swoop.
