        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many of us have speculated that there will be a false flag attack, but here is another idea. What if the government set up these drills because they have intelligence that there will be a real attack on the 26th? Maybe they know something is going to happen, and realize they won&#39;t be able to stop it, but have set up triage to deal with it when it happens? They know it would cause chaos and pandemonium to announce what intelligence has gathered, so they are just preparing for it&#39;s eventuality in the next few days. I&#39;m not saying that I believe this, but offering it as another theory to ponder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually a pretty solid idea. I mean if there is an attack they will get blamed for incompetence no matter what. At least this way they have an excuse to get all the material in place to mitigate as much loss as is possible.</p>

<p>But otoh, weren&#39;t they ready to nuke Pennsylvania or Virginia awhile back as a false flag? I wouldn&#39;t put anything past them.</p>

<p>Either way if something happens we will be arguing over the sketchy details in a place just like this, 10 years hence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you knew someone might attack you today, and you didn&#39;t want to make it public knowledge, but you still wanted to prepare, what better way than to have a &quot;drill&quot; right at the same time? It&#39;s perfectly plausible that that might be why they had the drills, just like it&#39;s perfectly plausible it was to cause confusion and hinder responses. Neither are a coincidence, and neither of us can definitively say who&#39;s right.</p>
