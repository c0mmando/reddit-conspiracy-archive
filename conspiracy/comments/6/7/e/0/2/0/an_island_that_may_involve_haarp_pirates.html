        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>200 miles off the coast of Yemen in the gulf of Aden lies the nearly impossible (ask Johnny Ward) to get to island of Socotra. <a href="https://americaforyemen.wordpress.com/2017/03/16/visiting-socotra-its-not-impossible-merely-unpossible/comment-page-1/">https://americaforyemen.wordpress.com/2017/03/16/visiting-socotra-its-not-impossible-merely-unpossible/comment-page-1/</a></p>

<p>Unless of course your royalty from the UAE. They have no problem at all stopping in, by landing at the airbase they just rebuilt to stay at the residential city they are building.
The New Arab - Jan. 7, 2017 UAE build &#39;Zayed residential city&#39; on Yemen&#39;s Socotra island</p>

<p>With Somali pirates being purported in the waters around Socotra once again, while Yemen&#39;s civil war rages on, I suspect Johnny Ward will be the last uninvited visitor to Socotra for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Now I know the title of this post has promised a spectacular confluence of conspiracies so bear with me.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a trip back in time...not as far back as the prehistoric era that the rare plants hail from. Just back to 2008 when Blackwater announced to the world that they would take care of the Somali piracy problem that started giving the world of crude oil a headache.</p>

<p>The world didn&#39;t take them up on that offer mainly due to the leaking of the fact that Blackwater didn&#39;t intend on taking prisoners. Big publicity scandal results in other merc companies getting the contracts.</p>

<p>Strike one Erik.</p>

<p>Onward we go, into a quiet period for Erik and Somalia until we find out in 2011 (from Salon, no less) that Erik has been arming and training Somalians to battle the piracy problem.</p>

<p>Note: 2010 - I see lots of YouTube videos about strange lights in the sky and a possible vortex or stargate in the gulf of Aden, but no solid evidence. (If you have links to some, please share)</p>

<p>Now we all know how that arming and training of third world countries go, so I&#39;m just gonna give ole Erik his second strike right here until he can prove to me that the pirates showing up in 2017 aren&#39;t the ones he trained.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Yemen: (forgive me if I borrow from the BBC)
The conflict has its roots in the failure of the political transition that was supposed to bring stability to Yemen following an uprising that forced its longtime authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to Mr Hadi, his deputy, in November 2011.</p>

<p>Mr Hadi struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including attacks by al-Qaeda, a separatist movement in the south, the continuing loyalty of many military officers to Mr Saleh, as well as corruption, unemployment and food insecurity.</p>

<p>Well, we all know how those pesky peaceful transitions of power go these days. And we all know that depending on the country, the year, and the agenda, Al Qaeda could very well have been working for the US when they were giving Yemen and Mr. Hadi so many problems.</p>

<p>Through the years of 2013 up until 2015 we hear random reports of the US building a naval base on Socotra. I found one source on Google for US bases near Iran that actually lists Socotra, but with a plane symbol.</p>

<p>Now we find ourselves in 2015, when the fan really gets in the way of the feces for Yemen and the island of Socotra.</p>

<p>War is officially acknowledged in March. And then two back to back cyclones created by &quot;abnormally high water temperatures&quot; (insert HAARP here) in October and November rock the island of Socotra and flood Yemen.</p>

<p>Enter the humanitarian efforts of the UAE where Erik Prince now runs his new outfit from and where Dynacorp has just been awarded a multi-billion dollar contract to fight in Yemen. (March 2016)</p>

<p>The UAE has reportedly signed a 99 year lease for the island of Socotra, which is viewed as one of the most militarily crucial points in the gulf of Aden.</p>

<p>Which is what the war in Yemen is all about:</p>

<p>Formerly a part of the Yemeni province of Hadhramaut, Socotra became a separate province in 2013. Before the former nation of South Yemen was granted independence by Britain, Socotra was a possession of the Mahra Sultanate of Qishn in Hadhramaut in the Protectorate of South Arabia. Hadi&#39;s removal of Socotra from Hadhramaut control and his reported lease of the island to the UAE is not recognized by the pretender to the throne of the former Mahra Sultanate, Abdullah bin Isa.</p>

<p>Now we have the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and the US bombing the crap out of Yemen. </p>

<p>Meanwhile on the island of Socotra:
Last year, Yemen&#39;s minister of tourism said the government would work towards establishing the unique island as a tourist hotspot.</p>

<p>Moammar al-Eryani said the ministry will set up a company to run tourism investments in the island, in partnership with business people from members of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC)</p>

<p>What could possibly go wrong on an island:</p>

<p>No one can get to.</p>

<p>Has a tourist hot spot for the ultra rich.</p>

<p>Involves Dynacorp and Eric Prince.</p>

<p>Involves a hot war where: </p>

<p>Children refugees are being created. </p>

<p>Civilians with expensive black market organs are being slaughtered on a daily basis in bombings not being covered by the media.</p>

<p>And yes, Socotra has 37 plant species from the prehistoric era that can only be found on Socotra.</p>

<p>Next up: How big pharma made sure the world didn&#39;t get a cure for cancer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It truly does look like a fascinating place. I really hope they didn&#39;t build a military base on it. But as I said, it is listed as having at least an airbase on it. It&#39;s curious that Johnny Ward doesn&#39;t actually talk about what he saw on Socotra. Just that it&#39;s a real beautiful place.</p>

<p>Talks about weather controlling magic amongst other dark things.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s a film called Socotra Island of Djinns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is that. The Middle East is always overly complicated, I have heard of flights being cancelled and then rescheduled hours later or the next day but that&#39;s just how shit happens here so u fortunately not unusual.

    <div class="md"><p>Throw in some black magic connections.</p>

<p>Marco Polo did not pass anywhere near the island but recorded a report that &quot;the inhabitants are baptised Christians and have an &#39;archbishop&#39;&quot; who, it is further explained, &quot;has nothing to do with the Pope in Rome, but is subject to an archbishop who lives at Baghdad.&quot; They were Nestorians but also *<em>practised ancient magic rituals *</em>despite the warnings of their archbishop.[13</p>

<p>I give you my word that the people of this island are the most expert enchanters in the world. It is true that the archbishop does not approve of these enchantments and rebukes them for the practice. But this has no effect, because they say that their forefathers did these things of old.[43]</p>

<p>Then you have a connection to the blood of the dragon (Lucifer):</p>

<p>One of the most striking of Socotra&#39;s plants is the dragon&#39;s blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari), which is a strange-looking, umbrella-shaped tree. Its red sap was thought to be the dragon&#39;s blood of the ancients, </p>
