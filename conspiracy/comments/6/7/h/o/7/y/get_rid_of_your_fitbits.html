        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-04-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/nobodyspecial45.html">nobodyspecial45</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There’s a new dawn in America. After the Bush years where it was acceptable to get fat because “we we&#39;re at war” everyone suddenly decided that fat was out and health was in. The end of an era. No longer can you go to the krispy kreme just around the corner from the office because “fuck man we have people dying for this shit.” When the war in iraq and afghanstan ended we all woke up feeling like a teenage girl trying to fit into that prom dress. </p>

<p>Then came the Obama’s and thin was in and exercise was the staple of any affluent household diet. Enter, the Fit Bit. The fit bit is the new fitness craze taking over the hearts and especially the minds of your average day housewife, hip finance executive, and all the plebeians in between. For the reasonable price of 130 bucks you can essentially become a slave to your wrist and mindlessly putz around while counting the distance you covered while contributing literally nothing to anything at all. </p>

<p>The Fit Bit is a watch meets pedometer meets crossfit technology incarnate. I dont know if youve ever talked to someone who owns one of these things but its like talking to a missionary trying to sell u the healing power of walking at your door while u can smell your dinner wasting away in the dining room. The idea of this modern day ball and chain is that it counts the steps u take each day giving u a way to quantitate how healthy u we&#39;re that day. Ask anyone who owns one how they are doing and all u will get is “well i did 9,000 steps today which is ok but i really want to do 9,500. Do you wanna go for a walk? How many steps have you done today?” No i dont want to go for a walk and im not sure how many steps ive taken today im sure im still working over all the negative steps ive earned from never actually getting dressed and eating microwave corn dogs for a whole week . </p>

<p>People who own fit bits are the same type of people who will invite you on facebook to a walk-a-thon for Lupus. Hard pass. How much money do i have to cut a check for not to walk? </p>

<p>But here&#39;s the future; </p>

<p>By the year 2032 the government will use fit bits to control the masses. Its not hard to see. If you know someone with a fit bit you know that all they are concerned about is how far they have walked all day. These people walk circles in their house just to get the number on their watch to move. This is perfect for the goverment. Soon fit bits will be handed out for free as part of a health initiative and everyone will be so concerned about how many steps they have taken they wont realize Donald Trump lost the election to the NSA and the security agency is on its third executive term. </p>

<p>Soon fit bits will have authorized walking locations to exclude areas like polling locations and book stores. The only upside is global warming will be fixed because the government will set up hamster wheels downtown where you will be able to lineup to increase your steps while generating electricity. The downside, while you are walking on the wheel the FBI will be searching through your underwear drawer to make sure you don&#39;t have any unauthorized items i.e snickers or a pocket constitution. </p>

<p>The fit bit is a genuis move to be honest. I mean it even vibrates when u reach 10,000 steps in a day. The device literally pleasures you once you fulfill your daily commitment to it. Im surpised i havent seen more people praising their watch in the shopping mall once they reach the prescribed goal. “Oh my watch is vibrating thank you master! I will walk for you forever.” </p>

<p>In closing. If you have a fit bit. Take it off and smash it with a hammer. After that throw it in the ocean and scream in cliche hollywood fashion at the god’s. You will not be a slave to your wrist no more. </p>

<p>I called the NSA. They didnt answer. So i put in a Freedom of Information Act request. They responded by saying this was not a legimate 
request or news source. Which is exactly what they would say if they had something to hide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure but you could also see that by doing some introspection rather than tethering yourself to a silicone umbilical cord. Now that you k ow you were lazy toss that tech and go take walks, change your diet and do workouts that raise your cardio and have fun. You don&#39;t need a bloody watch that counts your steps to get in shape and stay in shape. And if you truly do, I pity you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Take your life into your own hands and stop asking someone else or something else to do it for you. You wanna get in shape, go get in shape. Nothing and no one knows your body better than you. So look inward and do what you already know you need to do to affect the changes you want. </p>

<p>Cutting that umbilical cord can be hard. Rest my soul I&#39;m still working on it so please do not take this as an attack on you. (We all have room for growth). </p>

<p>But you&#39;re just making excuses. Same as all those people I meet daily that bitch about lack of privacy on Facebook but then tell you their mountain of reasons for still having one/or why the literally CANNOT stop using it when you tell them that you don&#39;t. I did all those things. Same can be said for the fit bit. The meat of this post has a lot of personal flair but the point is very valid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t think it&#39;s giving them an illusion of improving their fitness. it&#39;s just a baseline, relatively inaccurate, measure of basic movement. </p>

<p>if when you start wearing it, it&#39;s only showing you getting 1000 &quot;steps&quot; a day, and later it&#39;s showing you up around 10k, then it shows that you have at least been moving more. for some people, that in itself is a worthy goal.</p>

<p>it gives people a metric to go by. something that they can SEE get better every day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about Garmin? It even tracks my sleep and heartbeat, it is actually a great training tool and can help you keep track of healthy habits, take for instance my sleep cycle, which was messed up by working graveyard shifts... By cutting off electronics and certain foods from my diet I could actually improve my sleeping cycle </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really think that GPS/HRM/stepcounters are evil, they are just tools and if used without Internet connection to sites like Facebook I think are pretty safe </p>
