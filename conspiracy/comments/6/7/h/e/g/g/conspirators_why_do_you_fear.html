<p>And with regards to the &quot;New World Order&quot;, what is so bad about it that everyone hates it? Doesn&#39;t unifying the world under one vision appeal to you? </p>

<p>One world, One government, One people, it sounds almost like a Utopia; yet people scream about it saying how it&#39;s going to be the end of the world.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t take this to offense, I merely wish to understand your derivative of fear. I&#39;m not disputing the existence  of secret organisations, or a higher intelligence, I just wonder why you fear these if they appear to be true. </p>

<p>Who rules over this utopia?

How does your utopia come into being? Does every nation and every person need to be subjugated or do we choose to join the new world order? </p>

<p>Again though, you described what a utopia is, not why you think &quot;One world, One government, One people&quot; would equal a utopia? 
I would also argue that the world would still be attacking each other and fighting only the game is not nation wars it could just as easily be corporate wars for financial control, technological control (its arguable that it already is) </p>

<p>One thing more, who polices your planetary utopia, does the new world order put down its deep state surveillance tools or is it now in the hands of one singular government with total control.</p>

<p>When speaking of corporations and financial control, I see capitalism. Which I think is also a huge issue in unity; it&#39;s effectively a divisive ideology.</p>

<p>Look at the title of your own post. You&#39;re the one generalizing the topic of fear, dude.</p>

<p>What specific scenario are you referring to so I can give you my opinion on it? A &quot;new world order&quot;? If so, the fact you described it as a utopia should be as red flag #1, as the most horrific societies in history are brought about by self-described utopians like Marx. </p>

<p>It&#39;s under my assumption that most here believe the destruction of freedom of thought has well been accomplished.  The majority of people sit at home watching TV, being fed whatever it is the people in charge of these television stations want them to see. </p>

<p>They pretty much control the reality of the world for these people. </p>

<p>And yes, their goals are control and order, THEY want to be the ones in control.  Their may be more goals beyond that, depending on how esoteric you want to get.  </p>

<p>The idea is that the world could be a whole lot better than it is, the world doesn&#39;t need to run on money.  And the people behind it all don&#39;t care how many die or are lost in the process of gaining the control/power they want.  </p>

<p>If we were all peacefully merging into one society, i&#39;m sure it&#39;d be an entirely different story.</p>

<p>It only sounds like a utopia because in your biased vision you are imagining a system that works in the people&#39;s favor.  History shows that is not often the case.  Most often people are exploited by their rulers.  This is literally a fact proven by history, so why is it that so many people like you cannot remember their history and cannot even fathom the possibilities of why someone would not want a world under one ruler??</p>

<p>At least now, if you are being exploited by your country, you can try to escape and flee to somewhere else.  Where will you flee when the whole world is under one dictatorial ruler??  Why do you think this system will work in your favor??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I have to unpack the logic behind my response to your question. </p>

<p>First of, I agree that one world living in harmony is ideal and does sound appealing </p>

<p>Second, the reason I think that people fear the New World Order you mentioned is not derived from fear of the one world system, it&#39;s a fear of who will be in control of that system. You see, while it is an attractive notion it comes with some drawbacks, one example is that individuals will inherently become less powerful because we will all be diluted from our nation state voting populations into a global voting population. </p>

<p>However, if the fear is derived from a one world system something to consider is that it could be that a one world system scares people in America because it replaces our national identity, yes we will still be Americans, be it has less of a meaning perhaps to them in the event of a world system. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that the fear is irrational, change is always scary and this proposal would usher in perhaps one of the biggest changes to modern civilization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this response, equal arguments.</p>

<p>I agree that it would defeat differences and replace identity of a nation, but I see that as a good thing, less pride of differences = less arguments and conflict. </p>

<p>I think it is important that those in control do so peacefully and with a level head. I don&#39;t think a single leader would be good, more of a council that&#39;s made up of the people as opposed to the rich leaders we have now. Those that live in the world and can argue on behalf of the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great point on the elimination of differences derived from national identity. I find that to be an interesting argument. A counter point would be without differences how do we have a leader. The appeal of nation states is that there are different methods for developing or problem solving. In a one world system there may not be the opportunity for that diversity of methods, so to speak, to exist. </p>

<p>Your logic I believe is stemmed from the theory that conflict is not progressive where the foundational economic principle of America is that competition drives progress. This is kind of similar to the idea of competing nation states. </p>

<p>The world living in harmony does not depend on us living under a one world system. What we need to do is work to level the playing field. It&#39;s hard to do when you have a zero-sum energy source. </p>

And to some extent that could be true, however I do not think that the theoretical council of your should exclude people who are rich because being rich doesn&#39;t make you an inherently bad person. There are certainly many cases where people&#39;s wealth was obtained due to their contribution to society which was reaffirmed by the money given to them whether it be by selling a product or providing a service. Just something to consider in future proposals, because although I agree with your logic there are certainly plenty of examples of people getting rich by providing good in people&#39;s lives and those would be the people you want on a council. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not so much fear of anything as wanting freedom to choose.</p>

<p>In a world of Grey, a single governing body makes all issues black and white - with the government or against it.  </p>

<p>And as we all know, power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. How could anyone trust a single government to do right by the people when no government in history has ever done so? And with all power consolidated to a single body there would be nobody in existence who could keep it in check.  </p>

<p>A one world government makes sense only when we have colonized other planets, IMO.</p>

<p>Plus, the differences between people are what makes life exciting, they are what make people strive to DO something or to go places. I liken a one world government to being in an all white room - might be nice in some ways, but life needs a little color.... room for contrast.</p>

<p>(Panic, however, is a necessary instinct that may save your life. You can panic, while evacuating a burning building without ever being fearful.)</p>

<p>Being One is in our nature, but it&#39;s not a goal. It&#39;s more of a process... separating into something smaller, slowly collaborating and forming a single entity... just to repeat the same process again. That is the way of existence.</p>

<p>Why do you carry your own fears over to us, and accuse us of having them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm.... I guess it depends on the reason the unity occurs; I for one would unify for peaceful reasons. Pax Per Bellum. Conflict comes from differences, and it may not work in our favour that much I agree with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great point on the elimination of differences derived from national identity. I find that to be an interesting argument. A counter point would be without differences how do we have a leader. The appeal of nation states is that there are different methods for developing or problem solving. In a one world system there may not be the opportunity for that diversity of methods, so to speak, to exist. </p>

<p>Your logic I believe is stemmed from the theory that conflict is not progressive where the foundational economic principle of America is that competition drives progress. This is kind of similar to the idea of competing nation states. </p>

<p>The world living in harmony does not depend on us living under a one world system. What we need to do is work to level the playing field. It&#39;s hard to do when you have a zero-sum energy source. </p>
