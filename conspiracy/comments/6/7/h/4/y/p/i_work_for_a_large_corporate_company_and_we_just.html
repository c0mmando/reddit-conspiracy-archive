       omg just started raining like fucking crazy outside my window. like maximum 2 minutes before i read this post. just a funny coincidence.

      <p>
       that sounds weird, have you ever gotten similar warnings before? in relation to other drills etc? why would your company get warnings of such drills? what kind of company? which country?

       What happens if you don't 'shelter in place'? Like what does that even mean? You're forced to stay put in your residence and can't do anything, or what exactly? What if you said you dont care if you're trained for a disaster or don't want to participate in the drill

       Not trying to down play or dissagree. Just noting that in my city we have the sirens go off every wednesday morning around 10(11?):15 for abot five mins. Irregardless of forcast, except in winter. ... Since a tornado can litterally develope out of seemingly nowhere in les than an hours forcast. Live under constant threat of sudden weather here, so drills are regular.

       Irregardless isn't a word. Be careful accidentally using that because your intelligence may be unfairly questioned and the topic of whatever you were talking about possibly ignored.

       Perhaps the spelling is off, but in my part of the country and culture it is a word i and people around me have used their entire life, so becareful before you jump to the grammer police flag. You may be suprised by how much of what is spoken in america does not fall under 'real or proper english' with no regaurds or irregaurdless or intelligence. As per my ideas, ill let them stand for themselves. Any intelligent bloke with whomes opinions i would enjoy an exchange with should be ok with that. ;)

       I haven't gotten any news about drills where I work, but it's prompting me to take a look at the town and area around me
      </p>
      <p>
       I work for a very well known University, University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. They are constantly doing drills and testing alarms either with no warnings or warnings at the last minute, which is a pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       What usually happens is they test an alarm/send out warnings, then as the testing is going on they will email/text everyone who's signed up for notifications DURING the drills. Gonna take a look now and see if they mentioned anything in the School news paper about upcoming drills now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Totally slipped my mind to actually check that for some reason.

       You got any friends in facilities management? Plans for drills are posted well in advance. I mean big crises management drills that require coordination. Spur of the moment notices to facilities are rare and suspicious.

       I just work at the bookstore and don't really know any of the maintenance crews unfortunately.
      </p>

       Yeah, it's a pain in the ass. Out of no where we will here some sort of alarm go off, then half way through it, we get a text message of 'this is just a test' and are told to ignore it ugh.

       last year they freaked everyone out because they decided to test the tornado drill on the one sunny day out of that week of big thunderstorms and didn't even get told what was up until AFTER they were done testing it!

      <p>
       I checked the campus news paper and didn't see anything either. If it ends up happening here though I'll just add it to the list of fuckery that's going on...

       Just throwing this out there.... Weather is general normal for here in the uk, bit warmer maybe and recently its been super sunny here, BBQ weather, cloudless skies etc.. Then today out of nowhere (bit chilly but sunny all day and a few clouds) the sky turned black and it absolutely pelted down, and even snowed. Birmingham uk, 7pm(bst / gmt+1). Be nice to see some world weather maps and see if any correlations or patterns or anything happen. Might be a global thing and not just usa/localised?

       Same here in Manchester. I stepped in from the garden and it was very hot and sunny. I went upstairs and not 5 minutes later I hear my kids shouting "it's snowing!". I thought they were having me on but I look out the window and it was actually snowing. It was so much darker than it was 5 minute previous and the snow was followed by some pretty large heavy hail.
