       First try to find some evidence that James is at all involved. The emails don't suggest it all.

       Why not look into more concrete things like the names of the children in the hot tub email etc. ? There's plenty of better things on the clinton email server.

       It's weird art for sure. And I believe that the guy owns the restaurant. But, it's hard to believe that anything will come of "investigation" of this, expect for some fun LARPing.

       Also after my grandmother died I found an old French ad displaying a kid peeing on a wall, in her house. Does that mean my grandmother was a toddler piss fetishist?

       Fun Fact: the website
       <a href="http://www.nalu-diner.de">
        www.nalu-diner.de
       </a>
       does not comply with german law. 
In the "Telemediengesetz", basically a law that regulates websites and other stuff, is a section which means that each website needs to easily show who is the one responsible for the content.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why every german website usually has a "Impressum" where a real person or a company must be named as responsible for the content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the Source of the law:
       <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__5.html">
        https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__5.html
       </a>
       <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressum">
        https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressum
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if someone wants to piss off the guys from the diner, a german lawyer can send a so called "Abmahnung". If the website does not comply theres a fine of up to 50.000€

       Well, I think prosecutors would say that 90% of those evidence are not actually evidence , but just hints. Evidence maybe just those things tying Hillary to Laura Silsby and Haiti. Everything else, well, is at least diguisting and/or strange things, if not more.

       Here's a screenshot of the twitter page, depicting what appears to be sexualised artwork involving infants, to which James Alefantis (aka Jimmy Comet etc) responds "Nice".
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8CE3j-X0AUaW1F.jpg">

      <p>
       This is further confirmation of Jimmy Comet's well documented penchant for paedophiliac artwork, but it's amazing how many people (even in this sub!) try to argue this is somehow healthy and normal, and "doesn't mean anything."
      </p>
      <p>
       The conversation in that exchange also shows Alefantis implying that
       <strong>
        he owns Nalu Diner in Berlin
       </strong>
       . This is something that hasn't had much coverage before.
