<p>Personally, I think our yearning for ever moving upward and onward is proof we hold greater purpose than purely being dancing space dust. I think you have to end up at &#39;the only thing i know is that I do not know&#39;, and if this is all just what it is, then i&#39;d rather create fantasy for myself that brings me joy rather than uphold some reality that will ultimately end and erase me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just an FYI. Also listen to the &quot;Hour of the Time&quot; a radio show Cooper did in the 90&#39;s. Its especially interesting listening where he talks about the NWO and Bill Clinton even back then. At some points I had to take a step back to remember that this wasn&#39;t a broadcast from today.</p>

<p>Also for those that need a jumping off point: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve listened to the entirety of Mystery Babylon and enjoyed the listen. What the pre-dynastic Egyptians knew IMO is the hidden knowledge that is kept close to the vest by the few that have controlled the narrative since tge dawn of modern civilization. Zeitgeist and secrets in plain site IMO are good companions to this. Listening to Manley P Hall lectures gives more insight to the mindset of these folks and serves as a good companion as well. I am currently watching the  Magical Egypt series by John Anthony West, and it is very compelling considering the reverence paid to the ancients by  the Romans, Greeks and all western societies moving forward. I mean, we have a freaking obolisk in our nations capitol.. for Christ&#39;s sake. The symbology is blatently displayed right before our very eyes, yet almost nobody notices nor makes the connection. That&#39;s the modern day herd class for you.</p>

<p>I have come to a conclusion from all that I have read and listened to over the years.. good and bad are very subjective terms. If the wolf kills the sheep, it is good for the wolf and bad for the sheep. If the sheep escapes, it is good for the sheep and bad for the wolf. The natual world does not hold the same preconceived notions that we hold near and dear to our heart. Being as I also subscribe to bits and pieces of eastern philosophy, I still seek the good and cannot deviate from what feels real in my heart, but it is interesting to step out of my own skin and think about our condition from a third party, unbiased POV. I do however still believe that the &quot;few&quot; who hold this forbidden knowledge are of sinister intent deep down inside. Greed and ego are wired into us as humans, and very few can trancend this condition..</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but the wolf will try to eat the sheep for its own good, and the sheep will always try to escape for its own good. People are the one case in nature where that kind of instinct often is subdued for broader or more abstract good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but combine the forbidden knowledge about the natural world along with thought/reality manifestation via memeatics that prey on the humans inherent emotional flaws and you end up with the few that control the many. </p>

<p>Just the way a car salesman lures the unsuspecting Sunday afternoon tire kicker into leaving with a new car, I believe that we are sold a false narrative through and through. The attack vectors for the masses as mentioned above prey on our emotional weaknesses (love/compassion/goodness/connectiveness), which has been programmed into us literally since birth. They lead you to believe in goodness/evil, but I believe that our pressing existence (7.6b?) Is very threatening to them (georgia guidestones). A lot of people have lived/died believing and fought/died for this greater, more abstract good. Its just that I think that we (the masses) are playing under a different set of rules, understandings and beliefs than them.</p>

<p>What did the ancients know that allowed them such great understand of the percessions, human body/mind, nature of reality? The craftsmanship cannot be fully explained considering they were, as told to us, dynastic in the bronze age some 3000-5000 years ago. There are just so many unanswered questions. Cooper surely touches the bases in  implying that there is some sort of lost knowledge in antiquity, but jones I think is more of a rabble rouser who triggers emotion more so than inquisitive thought.</p>
