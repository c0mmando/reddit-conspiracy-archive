       Same reason why people still use social media after knowing it's basically bought and paid for by the government... FOMO, we'd all rather be sheep "in the loop" than go without knowing what our favorite people are talking about.  They'll keep dumbing products on us like this until one sticks and we'll never hear of a meaningful competitor after. They're just really banking on it being Amazon because of their established user base.

       just wait until sesame credit is implemented in the west together with conditional basic income. Get an Alexa and amazon look in order to increase your sesame credit, if you don't get them, your credit is lowered. If your sesame credit falls below X bx 2040, your basic income is shortened by 20%. This is what the future holds.

       I used my camera, not made by Amazon, to figure out which roommate was stealing from me. Cameras are the reason break and enters actually get solved now. I have four on the perimeter of my house and two inside. If you leave the original password and don't change it you kind of have to take part of the blame if perverts start watching you. I can see every IP address that viewed my cam. Can I say for sure that the NSA or KGB couldn't view it? No, but I doubt I am on their radar, no one cares what I am doing. The benefits to me outweigh what seems like paranoia.
