    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been attempting to &quot;maintain the sanity of this sub&quot; for the past several months, and it&#39;s getting pretty fucking exhausting and frustrating. A community like this just becomes extremely toxic as soon as most people start seeing those who disagree with them as &quot;paid shills&quot; by default. And that&#39;s what this place has become.</p>

<p>I think pizzagate, and the Trump supporters in general, have fucked over this community and made it more vitriolic and paranoid than ever before. Those of us here who are still highly skeptical of all the weak &quot;evidence&quot; surrounding the pizzagate theory are just accused of being pedophile defenders/sympathizers or shills, and there are multiple threads every single day that reach the front page accusing us of being &quot;outsiders trying to brigade this subreddit.&quot; As if the pizzagate believers just can&#39;t accept the fact for a moment that maybe a reasonable, intelligent, skeptical person could POSSIBLY not see the same shit that they see when looking at the same evidence.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t mind debating the theory with polite and intelligent people who just saw things differently from me. But instead, the overwhelming majority of people I&#39;ve debated on this sub about pizzagate just can&#39;t help but feel disgusted by those who disagree with them. And perhaps that&#39;s because they&#39;re used to only participating within communities where everyone agrees with each other all the time, and the minority opinions just get buried and/or banned for having a different perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence for an illegal international human, sex, child, drug, and arms trafficking cabal is abundant and it&#39;s been known by the regulars of this sub for years. Pizzagate was simply 4chan following a trail of bread crumbs, later to be widely censored, giving the impression that it&#39;s legit. There are too many facts that were found to rationally conclude that there&#39;s &quot;nothing to pizzagate&quot;. The amount of censorship alone is pretty damning. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to antagonize Pizzagate. Not everything that&#39;s come from the investigation is 100% true and credible, but it&#39;s clear that it has a lot of truth to it. </p>

<p>As far as shills, it&#39;s proven that there are paid douchebags to argue on the Internet. I agree that it&#39;s not good to just accuse people of being a shill because that&#39;s not productive. However, their presence cannot be denied, and specific topics do seem to trigger shills. Pizzagate is one, and bringing up the mysteries surrounding Assange and wikileaks. </p>

<p>Reddit is a big limited hangout. They are trying to turn this sub into one too. Only specific topics are allowed and if you dare bring up wikileaks file dates all changing to 1984, you may as well be a flat earther. </p>

<p>The term &quot;fake news&quot; literally sprung out of Pizzagate, and they even had to produce a small false flag to cover it up with the gunman. It&#39;s obvious. So I beg you to take another look at the facts. Watch some of George Webb&#39;s videos, he&#39;s not directly tied to Pizzagate, but he does the most in depth investigation into the CIA and Clinton foundations illegal activities i could ever imagine. </p>

<p>I understand your frustration. Believe me. But don&#39;t close your mind to the possibility that this would be happening. The child abduction rate in Virginia is literally 9x the national average per capita. 7x the #2 spot Florida. And simply the fact that communities of pedophiles are condoned on the Internet, and hackers find more shit than the FBI. Twitter had thousands of child porn accounts that were exposed, only to ban the user who exposed it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to argue Pizzagate with you, but I think it would be good for you to take a look at the facts again with an open mind. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve been accused of shilling for providing another perspective, but that&#39;s because this topic really is shilled heavily. Take a look at the facts. At the end, facts hold the truth. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at the facts with an open mind and came to the conclusion that there were no <em>facts</em> - just a whole lot of speculation and forced interpretation.</p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s not new, it&#39;s how discussion works. Though posts come in many shapes &amp; sizes, a common form is:</p>

<p>POST: makes a point.</p>

<p>COMMENT #1: Best counter point.</p>

<p>If the top comment was always in agreement with the post, couldn&#39;t one suspect foul play there as well?  &quot;The top comments are always in agreement with OP, must be b-b-b-b-bots!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d think that would be even more suspect that what you&#39;re alleging. So you think &quot;shills&quot; get posts voted up, but don&#39;t have the shillpower to get their desired comment to the top spot? Or is it the other way--shill don&#39;t have the votes to downvote something, but they do have the votes to get the top comment in place? Or maybe you think it&#39;s a 360 psyop where shills get popular topics voted up just so they can debunk that topic with a counter point in the top comment? I very much doubt anyone cares enough to plan let alone implement something like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! And yeah I understand it&#39;s a hard message to get across because it can be contradictory. But I think that people who are in a balanced mindset will know what I&#39;m trying to say. Blanket accusations and assumptions are bad. Facts and open minded conclusions based on facts are good. And it&#39;s good to preach that message of open mindedness and fact based logical reasoning because it can force people to take a look at themselves.</p>

<p>I just see too often people not <em>thinking</em>. They are too attached to their own emotions and opinions and get butthurt when what they thought doesn&#39;t turn out to be as black and white as they were told. </p>

<p>In reality, everything isn&#39;t in black and white. The gray area appears to be getting larger and larger, and people need to start realizing that there&#39;s nothing BUT gray area. And that&#39;s why it&#39;s sometimes difficult for me to convey a message. Because I don&#39;t want to divide, but that&#39;s inherently what a message does in the first place. </p>

<p>We are all trapped in this third dimension dominated by duality. Conflict. War. The illusion of progress. In order to <em>truly</em> make progress as a society, each individual must have an open mind and be unattached to their perceived &quot;self&quot;. That&#39;s extremely difficult, and preaching that message can even be detrimental to the message itself. </p>

<p>Awareness is the only way out. Consciousness. You are not your body. You are not your mind. Im saying it&#39;s time to set aside our bullshit pseudo differences, and come together as one fact and logic based community. Truth is absolute. There is no duality to a  legitimate logic based factual analysis. That&#39;s because you are taught to always acknowledge that there is another side, and to <em>qualify</em> the opposing opinion. </p>

<p>Sorry but shit gets really complicated and I appreciate you commenting on how murky the argument is because it really can get contradictory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly. It happens every couple of years. Awhile ago a whole bunch of guys left for some active angelfire thread. Few years back a lot of 4chan&#39;s conspiracy sub had a falling out, came over here. Year or two later, bunch of guys went over to some reddit wanabe that fell apart. Most recent one was a lot of the PizzaGaters going over to Voat</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What i was trying to get across is that that&#39;s not a good solution. If it served a separate purpose, like Pizzagate, it&#39;s got cause. However, simply because a sub is &quot;overrun&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it should be abandoned. Especially when it&#39;s the last place with even a shred of free speech left.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the last place. Reddit is openly censoring. Reddit used to be great for free speech, but it&#39;s been sold out from under us. It&#39;s not the same reddit of a few years ago. It&#39;s OK to leave. Everything is temporary. There are better places for us to discuss conspiracies, and I think voat is at least one of the decent places. I don&#39;t know many others though, so if anyone else does would you mind sharing with us where else is good? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed - to an extent. Preachers rarely get the full message across to an audience, and sometimes speeches can be boring to listen to.</p>

<p>If you give yourself entirely to logic and reason, you&#39;ll betray against your soul. If you give yourself entirely to emotion and cheeky remarks, you&#39;ll betray against your mind. Moderation is the key to victory!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about normal people giving dissenting opinions and immediately being called shills?  You will look at my comment history, see I haven&#39;t posted much, &quot;how strange you decide to post now, your facts mean nothing because I disagree with you and you don&#39;t have a mile long post history in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.&quot;  It feels like self implosion.  For a community that is supposedly open to dissenting opinions, a lot of folks in here will attack anyone that they don&#39;t agree with.  Anyways, back to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed on my last post the manipulation of the up-votes. It would get to a certain # then got down voted by 3-5 votes. It continued that way for a few days. It just finally hit a 100 in up votes today. I wrote the post on Sunday. It was on Aaron Hernandez&#39;s weird suicide. Had lots of complements on it. It wavered at 97 up votes for 3 days. Each time upvoted then down voted by 5. It was very methodical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Dan, hope you don&#39;t mind me bringing this up again because I think I found an outline of what is in the insurance files here: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-17/dhs-insider-warns-its-spy-versus-spy">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-17/dhs-insider-warns-its-spy-versus-spy</a></p>

<p>It lines up with the hint that I saw in an archived blockchain thread that &quot;the main issue documented in the files is how foreign governments are controlling the actions of NATO governments.&quot; </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t feel like clicking that link here is the most notable quote: </p>

<p>&quot;Q. So an ex-CIA senior agent named Robert Steele is on record saying Epstein’s island was a honey trap to lure our most powerful politicians into a extortion scheme?</p>

<p>A. Yes. There are videos of some of the most powerful players in the most humiliating positions.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah man it all ties together. And if you think about it, if you were a globalist elite psychopath, I doubt they had the best cyber security. The best Hillary&#39;s team could do had to resort to asking Reddit (stonetear). So imagine the perfect time when the elite&#39;s shit was at it&#39;s most vulnerable, and there were hackers smart enough and with the proper equipment capable of hacking the elites. I&#39;d imagine there was a significant time period where that was the case. And I&#39;d imagine that certain individuals said holy shit and either got silenced or were too afraid to tell anyone. And when wikileaks was organic and proper, they attracted all of that information. And I just have a feeling that Assange just knew it all. You need to be properly balanced emotionally and have a proper state of mind in order to cope with being trapped in two rooms of a building for over 4 years. </p>

<p>It all connects to pizzagate, and to past leaks and hints. It&#39;s insane that people keep dismissing the topic.</p>
