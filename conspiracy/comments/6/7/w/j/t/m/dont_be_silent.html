       I've been seeing a ton of highly upvoted threads where the top comment is dismissive and contradictory to the message of the post. I think we've all seen this, and it's not new.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking the regular users who understand the old conspiracy mindset to speak up. Keep everyone open minded. Don't allow shills and egotistic douchebags ruin the sub by driving wedges in the community. Preach a logic and reason based open minded thought process. Blanket assumptions and cheeky remarks are not cohesive to productive thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say something when you see a user leave facts unacknowledged. Say something when you see a comment or a post meant to distract and divide.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need your voices to maintain the sanity of the sub.

       I've been attempting to "maintain the sanity of this sub" for the past several months, and it's getting pretty fucking exhausting and frustrating. A community like this just becomes extremely toxic as soon as most people start seeing those who disagree with them as "paid shills" by default. And that's what this place has become.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think pizzagate, and the Trump supporters in general, have fucked over this community and made it more vitriolic and paranoid than ever before. Those of us here who are still highly skeptical of all the weak "evidence" surrounding the pizzagate theory are just accused of being pedophile defenders/sympathizers or shills, and there are multiple threads every single day that reach the front page accusing us of being "outsiders trying to brigade this subreddit." As if the pizzagate believers just can't accept the fact for a moment that maybe a reasonable, intelligent, skeptical person could POSSIBLY not see the same shit that they see when looking at the same evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't mind debating the theory with polite and intelligent people who just saw things differently from me. But instead, the overwhelming majority of people I've debated on this sub about pizzagate just can't help but feel disgusted by those who disagree with them. And perhaps that's because they're used to only participating within communities where everyone agrees with each other all the time, and the minority opinions just get buried and/or banned for having a different perspective.

       The evidence for an illegal international human, sex, child, drug, and arms trafficking cabal is abundant and it's been known by the regulars of this sub for years. Pizzagate was simply 4chan following a trail of bread crumbs, later to be widely censored, giving the impression that it's legit. There are too many facts that were found to rationally conclude that there's "nothing to pizzagate". The amount of censorship alone is pretty damning.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't think it's good to antagonize Pizzagate. Not everything that's come from the investigation is 100% true and credible, but it's clear that it has a lot of truth to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as shills, it's proven that there are paid douchebags to argue on the Internet. I agree that it's not good to just accuse people of being a shill because that's not productive. However, their presence cannot be denied, and specific topics do seem to trigger shills. Pizzagate is one, and bringing up the mysteries surrounding Assange and wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is a big limited hangout. They are trying to turn this sub into one too. Only specific topics are allowed and if you dare bring up wikileaks file dates all changing to 1984, you may as well be a flat earther.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "fake news" literally sprung out of Pizzagate, and they even had to produce a small false flag to cover it up with the gunman. It's obvious. So I beg you to take another look at the facts. Watch some of George Webb's videos, he's not directly tied to Pizzagate, but he does the most in depth investigation into the CIA and Clinton foundations illegal activities i could ever imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand your frustration. Believe me. But don't close your mind to the possibility that this would be happening. The child abduction rate in Virginia is literally 9x the national average per capita. 7x the #2 spot Florida. And simply the fact that communities of pedophiles are condoned on the Internet, and hackers find more shit than the FBI. Twitter had thousands of child porn accounts that were exposed, only to ban the user who exposed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not here to argue Pizzagate with you, but I think it would be good for you to take a look at the facts again with an open mind. I'm sorry you've been accused of shilling for providing another perspective, but that's because this topic really is shilled heavily. Take a look at the facts. At the end, facts hold the truth.

       You don't think that the correlation between fake news and Pizzagate isn't relevant? You don't think that the gunman who supposedly fired a shot thru a closed door, hitting a computer isn't fishy? Or why the street cameras were moved to not show the intersection at comet the day that happened? Have you watched all of George Webb's videos? He makes all of the connections very clearly. This has been going on far before Donald trump said he would run.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think the adamant censorship of the topic and the Dyncorp censorship frenzy on voat were significant?

       Whether you like it or not, all of this shit is going on every day in plain sight. That's how they like to operate. But they were exposed this time and very quickly tried covering it up.

       I think it's a neutral term used by lots of people for various ends. Some use it to discredit lies, some use it to discredit truths. Words aren't biased in themselves. It's all in who is saying it in what context.

       I think it's obvious this guy doesn't want to have an "open discussion" and would prefer to instead refer to himself as a victim of "shill name calling" and echo talking points.

        I've been seeing a ton of highly upvoted threads where the top comment is dismissive and contradictory to the message of the post. I think we've all seen this, and it's not new.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course it's not new, it's how discussion works. Though posts come in many shapes &amp; sizes, a common form is:
      </p>
      <p>
       POST: makes a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       COMMENT #1: Best counter point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the top comment was always in agreement with the post, couldn't one suspect foul play there as well?  "The top comments are always in agreement with OP, must be b-b-b-b-bots!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd think that would be even more suspect that what you're alleging. So you think "shills" get posts voted up, but don't have the shillpower to get their desired comment to the top spot? Or is it the other way--shill don't have the votes to downvote something, but they do have the votes to get the top comment in place? Or maybe you think it's a 360 psyop where shills get popular topics voted up just so they can debunk that topic with a counter point in the top comment? I very much doubt anyone cares enough to plan let alone implement something like that.

       However, I think being a bit confrontational is essential to "calling people out." Your post seemed to simultaneously call for a kumbaya moment as well as a culling of the uninformed or willfully ignorant. That seems contradictory.

       Thanks! And yeah I understand it's a hard message to get across because it can be contradictory. But I think that people who are in a balanced mindset will know what I'm trying to say. Blanket accusations and assumptions are bad. Facts and open minded conclusions based on facts are good. And it's good to preach that message of open mindedness and fact based logical reasoning because it can force people to take a look at themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just see too often people not
       <em>
        thinking
       </em>
       . They are too attached to their own emotions and opinions and get butthurt when what they thought doesn't turn out to be as black and white as they were told.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, everything isn't in black and white. The gray area appears to be getting larger and larger, and people need to start realizing that there's nothing BUT gray area. And that's why it's sometimes difficult for me to convey a message. Because I don't want to divide, but that's inherently what a message does in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all trapped in this third dimension dominated by duality. Conflict. War. The illusion of progress. In order to
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       make progress as a society, each individual must have an open mind and be unattached to their perceived "self". That's extremely difficult, and preaching that message can even be detrimental to the message itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Awareness is the only way out. Consciousness. You are not your body. You are not your mind. Im saying it's time to set aside our bullshit pseudo differences, and come together as one fact and logic based community. Truth is absolute. There is no duality to a  legitimate logic based factual analysis. That's because you are taught to always acknowledge that there is another side, and to
       <em>
        qualify
       </em>
       the opposing opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry but shit gets really complicated and I appreciate you commenting on how murky the argument is because it really can get contradictory.

       I think it's unrealistic for us to expect r/conspiracy to stay the same over time. There's a reason that people bug out. Eventually we just to accept this sub has been overrun, take all the good evidence with us, and bug out to a new sub

       Possibly. It happens every couple of years. Awhile ago a whole bunch of guys left for some active angelfire thread. Few years back a lot of 4chan's conspiracy sub had a falling out, came over here. Year or two later, bunch of guys went over to some reddit wanabe that fell apart. Most recent one was a lot of the PizzaGaters going over to Voat

       What i was trying to get across is that that's not a good solution. If it served a separate purpose, like Pizzagate, it's got cause. However, simply because a sub is "overrun" doesn't mean it should be abandoned. Especially when it's the last place with even a shred of free speech left.

       It's not the last place. Reddit is openly censoring. Reddit used to be great for free speech, but it's been sold out from under us. It's not the same reddit of a few years ago. It's OK to leave. Everything is temporary. There are better places for us to discuss conspiracies, and I think voat is at least one of the decent places. I don't know many others though, so if anyone else does would you mind sharing with us where else is good?

       How about normal people giving dissenting opinions and immediately being called shills?  You will look at my comment history, see I haven't posted much, "how strange you decide to post now, your facts mean nothing because I disagree with you and you don't have a mile long post history in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       I noticed on my last post the manipulation of the up-votes. It would get to a certain # then got down voted by 3-5 votes. It continued that way for a few days. It just finally hit a 100 in up votes today. I wrote the post on Sunday. It was on Aaron Hernandez's weird suicide. Had lots of complements on it. It wavered at 97 up votes for 3 days. Each time upvoted then down voted by 5. It was very methodical.

       It lines up with the hint that I saw in an archived blockchain thread that "the main issue documented in the files is how foreign governments are controlling the actions of NATO governments."

The best Hillary's team could do had to resort to asking Reddit (stonetear). So imagine the perfect time when the elite's shit was at it's most vulnerable, and there were hackers smart enough and with the proper equipment capable of hacking the elites. I'd imagine there was a significant time period where that was the case. And I'd imagine that certain individuals said holy shit and either got silenced or were too afraid to tell anyone. And when wikileaks was organic and proper, they attracted all of that information. And I just have a feeling that Assange just knew it all. You need to be properly balanced emotionally and have a proper state of mind in order to cope with being trapped in two rooms of a building for over 4 years.

       It all connects to pizzagate, and to past leaks and hints. It's insane that people keep dismissing the topic.
