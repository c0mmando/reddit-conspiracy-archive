        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The gradual brainwashing by the &quot;experts&quot; in various fields like politics, economy is mesmerizing if you rewind back a few years and see that this whole concept is relatively very new. </p>

<p>Now instead of saying that people who fear a global world order are conspiracy nuts, the globalists readily admit that they want a global world order and anybody who opposes them is a xenophobe or racist or whatever </p>

<p>They have even gone further to demonize the very idea of nationalism. Connecting it via hyperbole to ultra-nationalism. </p>

<p>I know this is a rant, but as a matter of discussion, what further steps will the globalists like Soros, Rothschilds and their puppets take to create acceptance for a full fledged NWO?   </p>

<p>Devil Advocate  - Justify why a full fledged NWO will be a good thing for humanity</p>

<p>Bonus Devil Advocate challenge- Justify why the globalist Soros is actually a good person. </p>

<p>Edit: My motivation for asking this is curiosity.  While discussing politics on Reddit and outside during the year, I have seen an exponential increase in support of globalism (and hatred for nationalism in contrast)  to my surprise. How did it become the &quot;in&quot; thing? Is it naturally or by design?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That it is the beauty of their strategies. They are always 10 steps ahead.  One of the major problems facing NWO is the resources population mismatch. No matter how they twist the economy, they cannot create actual resources out of thin air. This was already showing with the dwindling economies in europe. </p>

<p>How to deal with the problem? If you cannot increase the resources, decrease the population. Solution- an &quot;anti globalist&quot; starts a World war. </p>

<p>They get their population reduction, and they get to demonize any further real opposition for decades. </p>

<p>Problem isn&#39;t in globalism, but in easy brainwashable people, greedy people and people that want to be in power. Only because of these reasons globalism is dangerous - because people will be easier to control. If we were better as humans, globalism would be a very good idea. Globalism is good.

No reasonable person actually <em>wants</em> a big government, but because businesses love exploiting workers, they feel the only way to get better working conditions is if the government enforces it because even though employers should, they just don&#39;t.</p>

<p>The MSM, instead of admitting the conspiracy theorists were right, have suddenly and without warning started behaving as if the approaching NWO has always been expected and it&#39;s no big deal. So if you have a problem with it, there is something wrong with you...this is how the MSM creates reality. In America, the <strong>TV</strong> trained brain dead masses take the word of the MSM as if it were the Gospel. And they definitely don&#39;t want to be perceived as being outside the consensus. They have been told how to think...and they will think it and behave accordingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;The TV trained masses&#39; - never heard that before but I&#39;m saving it! A short while back, I was, well, not watching, but blazed enough to sit through, Eastenders with a couple of friends and noticed a few characters on the show interviewing people to find a new room mate. Every actor they interviewed appeared a normal person but there was one they interviewed with a huge, ginger afro and massive eyes, who went on to say that the government spy on you through the TV and other things. They laughed him out of the room and called him crazy. The funny thing is this was on tv days after it was made public that the government has been spying on everyone through their TV and other things. They make &#39;conspiracy theorers&#39; seem crazy on TV, its just one of the many ways they control peoples thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider the illogic of federal dairy policies. They jack up milk prices for millions of families at the same time that other programs, such as food stamps, aim to reduce food costs. And although federal law generally prohibits cartels, a federal dairy cartel enforces high milk prices. If Coke and Pepsi got together and agreed to hike prices, they would be prosecuted. But with milk, raising prices is government policy.</p>

While the reduced rates proposed apply to businesses large and small, there&#39;s even less in way of keeping the large from smothering the small further out of existence.

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m not sure i understand. </p>

<p>globalism has been opposed from the beginning by labor and true leftists going all the way back to marx because it has always been a ruse to find ever cheaper, more exploitable labor without the burden of import tariffs so restricting importation of the cheap priducts into the richer home labor market.  this is why it has always been sold on the &quot;free market, job creating, rising tides lift all boats&quot; argument. this is were libertarians go terribly wrong, and the only serious breach the have with their fellow anti-statist brethren, anarchists.</p>

<p>the one world govt argument of NWO theorists has always been besides the point in the globalist/labor debate, because a universal govt isn&#39;t necessary for globalism, all you need are multilateral trade agreements. </p>

<p>i think it is more accurate to equate the one world govt argument with the neoliberal desire to do away with public govts all together and replace them with private govts -- a global board of directors if you will, where each seat is held by a representative from each major multinational business and finance sector, accountable to none but their shareholders. the provision in the TPP allowing corporations to sue govts whose laws and courts negatively impact their profits was the first foray into this. </p>

<p>the true global NWO is the creation of a sort of neo-feudalism, where instead of having citizen-serfs who lack all political agency and who are governed by individual governments, you have wage-slave-consumers, who lack all rights, managed by private industry--a super-corporation, if you will.</p>

<p>the neoliberal &quot;project&quot; has to demonize nationalism, patriotism, soverientism, populism, economic equality, and eventually democracy, in order to destroy the idea of governments and citizenship. identity politics is the 6,000 year old tool of the oligarchs to establish and maintain power. because it is indesputable that racism etc exist, it is quite easy to use them as a sword. the neoliberal NWO is globalist, but not for the reason most attribute, they don&#39;t want to be ceasar, the want to be a 21st century british east india company open to a joint venture of many companies.</p>

<p>the BEIC coined the phrase the NWO and during their time they were the most powerful entity on earth, with their own army and navy, and complete countrol of the britush parliment.</p>

<p>people in hollywood hear this talk at dinner parties and davos. i don&#39;t think it is a coincidence that entertainment depicting the dystopian rule of corporations has started popping up. we even had a tv show about the evil BEIC. hollywood may or may not take the talk seriously...either way it amounts to predictive programming.</p>

<p>ps: corporatocracy is not anti-statist in the anarchist/libertarian view. it doesn&#39;t believe in nation-states, but it does believe in controlling the lives of the hoi poli, and denying the self-determination and dignity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good answer</p>

<p>I think my view point of the timeline maybe different as I was not involved in the conspiracy realm since the last few years. For an example when 9/11 happened I totally believed that it was a terrorist attack and not an inside job.  </p>

<p>But the recent events have validated what the conspiracy theorists said again and again. </p>

<p>Maybe that is why it seems so sudden, &quot;They&quot; know that they can no longer hide behind the curtain, so they have now gone into the offensive, hence the acceleration of the acceptance of NWO</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is the correct answer, &quot;Globalism&quot; is not the result of a small group of liberals who want to destroy American values, or whatever, it&#39;s an effect of capitalism constantly having to find cheaper labor to exploit and new markets to sell to. Capitalism requires unending growth and our politics (ie neoliberal politics) simply reflect that. Globalism, or Globalization, facilitates profits. </p>

<p>Leftist politics that only focus on multiculturalism  and tolerance(which are good things), and ignore class and global capitalist exploitation (bad), are only helping neoliberalism. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t some conspiracy here. George Soros isn&#39;t behind it all. It&#39;s just the logic of capitalism reflected in both the right and the left. It&#39;s ideology. It&#39;s time to give up the conspiracy NWO fantasy, and actually read Marx. </p>

<p>I think the reason &quot;normies&quot; will dismiss this stuff when the comedian of the moment makes a good dismissive joke about it is because they don&#39;t want to accept the fact that they really don&#39;t care or, even if they did, they can&#39;t do anything about it. They&#39;ve also been conditioned to not care over decades of merely accepting &quot;realities&quot; like politicians are always bad, the parties don&#39;t care about us, profit must come at the expense of another and capitalism needs profit so..., etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a big house of cards most of us are comfy in. So it&#39;s almost a survival technique to dismiss us conspiratards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Globalism has been gaining traction since the end of WW2.  It&#39;s just really come to a boiling point in the last few years as left wing European leaders are taking unprecedented steps to welcome migrants from the Middle East (predominantly Muslims).  And the subsequent actions of  these immigrants are getting a lot of press.  Obama was also much more of a liberal and pushed a globalization effort that far surpassed GW. </p>

<p>Realism was fairly dominant in America throughout the 80&#39;s, especially post Vietnam when their was a resurgence in American exceptionalism with Ronald Reagan wanting to overcome the loss of Nam and the struggling economy of the 70s.  The Soviet Union was an interesting adversary because on the one hand the very existence of the USSR caused groups like NATO to form, but it also underscored the ideals of realism (meaning that every country was out for themselves.). </p>

<p>Throughout the 90s and 2000s globalism made a resurgence (largely due to the fall of the USSR) and due to Trumps world view the US is currently seeing another resurgence in nationalism much like we did in the 80s.</p>

<p>Overall, the push to globalize is going to be tough to resist.  Most classical liberals (in the foreign policy sense) feel that international cooperation is the best way to prevent something like WW2 from happening.  However, critics such as Trump and Le Pen rightfully point out that the UN and NATO have been unsuccessful in stopping violence in the Ukraine, Syria and Africa.</p>

<p>My thought - globalism and cooperation sound great, until you realize that every country is exploiting the system (AKA being realists) to benefit themselves. </p>

<p>At the end of the day ask yourself - do people (or countries) care more themselves, or their communities?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for your first question. India. Also just because the west is more of a melting pot than the rest of the world doesn&#39;t mean its a bad thing? Where are you going with this? Are you insinuating that being a melting pot means that civilization cannot exist for an extended period of time? </p>

<p>Large cities make up the majority of the population of the United States. Maybe some communities are monolithic but not most. Not by a long shot. &quot;faux refugees thrown on them.&quot; You have never been a refuge from a war torn country yet you put them down and disregard them so easily. So much hate.. this is extremely inconsiderate and close minded. &quot;illegals bussed in to work in factories.&quot; This isn&#39;t Dubai this is the modern day United States. Not only do factories have rules and regulations, but the illegal immigrants that do manage to find work must find their own way to get to there. Just because they are illegal, does that make you better than them? Are you a better, more privileged human being because of where you were born?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t I have the &quot;faintest clue as to the dynamics of the negotiation of one&#39;s identity?&quot; Explain to me please. I&#39;m curious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, importing millions of &quot;refugees&quot; of various ethnic groups into host countries, who don&#39;t actually assimilate into that host country&#39;s culture is a great idea? When you talk multiculturalism, do you mean improving the lot of one ethnicity at the expense of another? Because that&#39;s exactly what western multiculturalism policy is doing in Europe. And you want to talk about not infringing, repressing, or suppressing groups of people? </p>

<p>You look at any nation with different ethnicities and the common theme is a formation of ethnic enclaves. The U.S. is a good example of that, with segments of cities referring to entire ethnicities like Chinatown or Little Italy. People WANT to stick with their kind. That&#39;s not a bad thing. What is a bad thing, is forcing one group of people to take in another group of people with a completely different set of culture and customs, at their expense. If that&#39;s not a destruction of identity, I don&#39;t know what is. </p>

<li><p>&quot;Also your assumption that nationalism is racist. It sounds like you have received to much programming honestly.&quot; This is called an ad hominem.

    <div class="md"><p>Question for you that is a little different vs what we have been discussing: you are clearly for open borders...how do you feel about countries in the Arab world not accepting migrants (with a few exceptions) from the Arab world. For instance: Saudi Arabia has a huge network of tents set up for humanitarian migrant situations but refuse to use them. So the west has to pick up the slack and that seems like it&#39;s causing a lot of turmoil...not just because of terrorism but because of multiculturalism and total lack of assimilation. I think I would be in favor of &quot;Regionalism&quot; instead of globalism. The west doesn&#39;t have to pick up the bill for these legitimate migrants and non legitimate ones when countries in the same region, who have a much more compatible existing culture could and should shoulder a larger burden. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe much of the middle east is a backwards and barbaric place. Saudi Arabia especially. Until they change the way they govern I wouldn&#39;t expect them to help at all. However.. Religion plays a large role in this and a vast majority of the refugees are Sunni since all rebel occupied territories were Sunni. Even though its widely assumed that Assad is secular, maybe even an atheist, his family are Alawite Shia whereas the majority of his country are Sunni. Since the vast majority of refugees from Syria are Sunni, you would expect Saudi Arabia to lend a helping hand right? Well the thing is.. ISIS are Sunni, Saudi Arabia is Sunni country with an extreme amount of religious power. This is all speculation but, Saudi Arabia is trying very hard to make it look like they aren&#39;t affiliated with ISIS whatsoever and they believe aiding the refugee&#39;s would not help them in this regard.</p>

<p>To be honest.. We don&#39;t even know whats really going on over there. What should we believe about Assad? Is he a monster that needs to be ousted or is he being framed that way to make the world see him as such? Why would he be fighting so hard and destroying his own country? He is a very smart and well educated person so his reasoning is probably well calculated whether evil or good. It&#39;s all a shit show and we need to be careful about the authenticity of any information we get about anything going on over there.</p>

And wtf do we do with Assad? I like that he&#39;s secular. He doesn&#39;t seem to persecute christians which i do like. I fear he may just be a target of our evil CIA and honestly I&#39;ve never seen more propaganda for a war than the one in Syria. It&#39;s really unbelievable. Imagine the people in charge who have to make the choices for real. I&#39;m almost relieved that North Korea has stepped up to be a legit threat( not happy about it but we know what they represent and I think Trump and the United States has bipartisan support for this as most recognize what a threat he poses to two key Asian allies in Japan and SK. And maybe even Hawaii but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s quite capable of delivery the payload despite having warheads and ICBMs. I&#39;m confindent we can destroy any kind of attack on our fleets or against Hawaii.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve noticed this as an m.o. of the social engineers across the board: They deny, deny, deny. Then, after they implement their goal, they suddenly act like what they&#39;d previously denied had always been admitted (and if you disagree you&#39;re a racist, etc.). They did this with campaigns to promote racial integration. At the time, they denied that the goal was to promote race-mixing. (&quot;Only racists think that that&#39;s our objective!&quot; they claimed. Martin Luther King addressed the charge, saying, &quot;I want to be the White Man&#39;s brother, not his brother-in-law.&quot;)</p>

<p>Fast-forward a few decades and 3/4ths of the commercials on TV showcases a mixed-race couple, and promotes it as an absolute good. A desirable trait.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not interested in &quot;racial purity&quot; as a concept. (That&#39;s beside the point.) What I <em>am</em> interested is the larger phenomenon of them denying that &quot;racial mixture&quot; was a component of their social engineering initiatives (and attacking people who suggested as much). Now they promote it out in the open (proving their initial critics right), and they pretend as if it&#39;s always been this way.</p>

<p>&quot;3/4ths of all commercials have ALWAYS been racially-mixed couples, and if you&#39;re not with the agenda, you&#39;re a bad person. Oh, any by the way, whites are the cancer of the world and must be bred out.&quot;</p>

<p>Had they been honest about their agenda in the first place, they would have been run out of town on a handrail. But they did it incrementally; and, once they felt safe enough, they admitted to everything that their early critics accused them of. </p>

<p>Same thing with gay marriage. </p>

<p>When critics said that it would lead to a slippery slope, people like Bill Maher scoffed, &quot;Always with the slippery slope! The slippery slope doesn&#39;t exist! Anyone who says it does is a bigot.&quot;</p>

<p>Imagine my amusement a year ago when Maher said, &quot;Of course we should allow incest couples to marry. Gay people get to!&quot;</p>

<p>So what happened to the &quot;slippery slope&quot; being a myth, Bill?</p>

<p>And now we&#39;re watching polygamy normalizaton with TV shows like &quot;Big Love&quot; and &quot;Sister Wives&quot;. Just as Salon.com and the Huffington Post are normalizing pedophilia.</p>

<p>(But they <em>assured</em> us the slippery slope didn&#39;t exist.)</p>

<p>Now when you point it out, they sneer and are like, &quot;Too late! You believed us? Dumb ass!&quot;</p>

<p>You see the same thing with global government now. All the same cultural Marxists who were obsessed with demographically changing the West, and normalizing homosexuality and transgenderism are the same Cultural Marxists who want non-representative government with unelected bureaucrats running things from thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>And true to form: They lie initially. They attack and slander the people outing them. &quot;They&#39;re just crazy conspiracy theorists!&quot;</p>

<p>Then once the initiatives are enacted and they feel that they&#39;ve safely consolidated their power, then (and only then) do they finally concede that the whistleblowers were telling the truth all alone. (They did this with State surveillance, too. The whistleblowers were all portrayed as liars and crazies. Now it&#39;s conceded to as a self-evident fact.)</p>

<p>Wikipedia&#39;s article on bilderberg attendees goes back to the 70&#39;s and includes citations in the NYT, which regularly ran articles.  It was a secret meeting of millionaires, people wanted to read about it.  But everybody knew about it, and knew who attended.</p>

<p>&quot;Globalism and a NWO&quot; was never a conspiracy thing, George Bush senior <em>openly lauded a new world order in a publicly broadcast speech</em>.  He said that the &quot;rule of law&quot; would supercede the &quot;law of the jungle&quot;.</p>

<p>Sure, network of cronyism, self-enrichment, and control, but the degree to which they are selfish is the center of the &quot;crazy conspiracy&quot; rhetoric, and anybody who thinks things were different before simply hasn&#39;t educated themselves.</p>

<p>What do you mean by nwo? If it&#39;s a single government I would think that&#39;s inherently the best option. </p>

<p>All borders do is divide people. The only difference Ide see in a hypothetical one government world is that that government wouldn&#39;t have anyone to go to war with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO: the reason this is being pushed now is because the world economy is over-leveraged to the point that it will collapse unless major changes occur. TPTB think that removing borders and changing the demographics ( moving younger third world populations into developed countries with aging populations) will allow the economy to grow enough to prevent immediate collapse. Economic collapse would be chaotic and the outcome would be uncertain. This type of change has been in the plan for a long time but the need for it to happen sooner rather than later has changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe in humanity, especially for the elites. If one government would establish in the future how can you trust your government running by them while you can&#39;t get satisfied by current ones. You can see many results of that you&#39;ve got all failed socialism experiences . How do you expect the top elites act in circumstance of one global government. There has been a lot of confrontation between opposite groups that we&#39;ve been facing which come from each stakes , but it&#39;s rather normal because this effectively takes role of stabilizer to protect each risks and benefits.  If there&#39;s only one purpose or one benefit from us that they will get for, it means will be exploited by them forever with no chance to take back.</p>

<p>How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!(Isaiah 14:12)</p>

<p>&quot;I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.&quot; (Revelations 22:16)  </p>

<p>To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations--that one &#39;will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like pottery&#39; --just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give that one the morning star. (Revelations 2:26-28) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lucifer was a fallen angel.  He covets man.  People worship a Lucifer Fallen Angel.  This is fact.  </p>

<p>Jesus Christ is The Morning Star in Revelations.  He promises to give the Morning Star.  The Morning Star is a Title or Function in heaven or The Church.  </p>

<p>Jesus Christ is The Man.  (1 Timothy 2:5)  The Man like &quot;The Man&quot; Aloe Blacc which is a stong about The Kingdom of God?  The Man like &quot;When The Man Comes Around&quot; Johnny Cash.   The Man like Hulk Hogan who went NWO and liked to say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_itzww0XTo">&quot;I&#39;m The Man Brother!!!?&quot;</a>  Hulk Hogan says he has Eyes to See and Ears to Hear which is a major theme in the Bible among Prophets.  Do you have eyes to see and ears to hear?  </p>

<p>When I first heard the song &quot;No Good&quot; by Kaleo, I soon posted it on my Facebook as something for God.  I was going for more of a &quot;When The Man Comes Around.&quot;  I later discovered an HBO series called &quot;Lucifer&quot; and that was the theme song.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Globalism and NWO aren&#39;t necessarily related.  </p>

<p>The concept of globalism is that each nation can benefit through free trade more so than they would with trade restrictions.  Free trade allows us to gain maximum benefit from the concept of comparative advantage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp</a></p>

<p>Free trade in all countries would result in more overall wealth creation and a more efficient economy.</p>

<p>How that wealth is distributed will be based on rules put in place by the government.  Here&#39;s where we could get into the topic of an NWO controlling the flow of all wealth.</p>

<p>The two topics are not necessarily related.  Would you like it if you had to pay extra taxes when bringing goods to and from a state/province? Or if companies in other states couldn&#39;t effectively sell to you because of your states import taxes?  Then why are you against free trade on a larger scale?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree on Globalism, but I don&#39;t believe immigration is a problem and I don&#39;t nationalism is a good thing. Nationalism teaches false pride, hatred and is basically what got Europe into both, WWI and WWII, and it for sure might get all of us into WWIII. Patriotism to me is stupid and another cultural programming and I tell this to everyone no matter where they&#39;re from. You are born in this life to be you, not a flag or a robot to a country or culture. Immigration I also don&#39;t see as a bad thing.</p>

<p>The problem with today&#39;s immigration is that we are in the War on Drugs and the War on Terror, which is only causing cartels, terrorists, and other bandits to be worse and stronger in their game. This is what&#39;s causing people to run away from their country and into yours. Also, the Rothschild Central Banks (Federal Reserve, ECB, etc.) are the ones who are stealing your jobs, dreams, and money. It&#39;s not Pablo from El Salvador or Mahmoud from Afghanistan. They&#39;re just running away to be safe from the big bandits who run their countriesz</p>

I keep telling the kids not to give away their freedom to anybody. Keep it as local as possible. That&#39;s common sense. I&#39;m so sorry too see it come down to this. We are shocked how out in the open it all is now. It really does look like it&#39;s good vs. evil at this point. I mean, these elite people are fricken devil worshippers, for Pete&#39;s sake! Could they pick anything more surreal than that?! The stuff with the pedophilia--that made up my mind for me. Hubby and I are shocked sometimes at how quickly things in this society have changed. And especially how brainwashed--or maybe it&#39;s braindead--some kids appear to be. I don&#39;t care how old I get, though, I&#39;m not going down without a fight. You&#39;d be surprised at the older ladies I know who are preparing themselves for that contingency. We aren&#39;t deaf or blind, and we talk about it--often. We&#39;ve lived good lives here. We&#39;re not about to see some assholes come in and take that opportunity away from our kids and grandkids. Some things are worth dying for, and their freedom is one of those things. Gonna be some surprised assholes if they try to come in shut up their Gramma&#39;s one day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll hop on the Devils Advocate side here, strictly for the purpose of sparking a debate and using a paradigm shift to examine a path toward a Utopian society.</p>

<p>In theory, if we are all citizens of the same country, the cost of war is much much lower. If there is a cost at all.</p>

<p>Once the cost of fighting is removed, this leaves huge amounts of room in the budget for human services, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Infrastructure like roads, rails, electric, plumbing, recycling, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Human Services such as Hospitals, Schools, Museums, Parks, etc</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Global Currency would even out the playing field for poorer sections.  No currency what so ever, would be the most ideal.  Goods and services can be traded for personal credits (based on merit, work and civil service) </p>

<p>Rare earth materials would no longer be the cause of wars, they would now become available to all, making the next big leap forward in technology easier and on a grander scale; helping to reduce pollution and pushing humans deeper into space and further toward our next step in evolution.</p>

<p>Or, the current forces like Soros, pushing for NWO win and create a desolate slave planet, that will slowly choke the life away from the earth to enable the strip mining of all resources on the planet (especially gold dust), to be shipped back to the home planet. Just like they did to Mars.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had to choose between globalism or nationalism, I&#39;d choose globalism any day. Sure, nationalism as a concept, and in an environment in which people are exposed to other nations, is fine. However, it&#39;s one of the slipperiest aspects of society. Wishing the best for your country very quickly turns into wishing the worst for others. World War 1, all terrible crimes against humanity committed by Japan in World War 2, all the deeds committed in the name of Colonialism, every foreign civilian massacre and every violent pogrom, all have fervent nationalism at their root. Globalism is inevitable, it&#39;s simply part of human nature. Humans expand tribally, and as those tribes meet they attempt to conquer. After the war has been waged, they eventually merge. We&#39;re simply seeing this on a greater scale than ever before. Globalism doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the surrender of life to a cabal of invisible men, it can actually lead to the pooling of civilian recourses on an even greater scale. There always appears to be a looming power within the State, threatening to destroy all civilian rights, and it&#39;s healthy to maintain a critical awareness of it, no matter what you believe. However, I think the more you repel the characteristics of Globalism, the more you&#39;ll simply fall out of touch with the evolution of society. I don&#39;t believe in the left or the right, or the anarchists or the fascists, or the nationalists or the globalists, I simply react to what I&#39;ve seen in history and what I see before me. The technological climate has made globalism inevitable, but it isn&#39;t the enemy. Anything in moderation can be harmless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>India????@/ $#@ bahahaha.  You are so ignorant. Pakistan exists ONLY because Muslims couldn&#39;t live alongside other Indians, Sikh, Hindu, Jannist, or otherwise. Hell, research why Sikhs are a warrior culture. Hint...it&#39;s because of Muslims, genius.</p>

<p>You have to be a naive teenager. Please read some history. Your positions are all emotion driven a historical horseshit. Hate to break it to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By &quot;oppressed groups&quot; do you mean people who are institutionally attacked for their beliefs? Say, slandered in the media for their faith, or the victims of lobbying attempts to get them fired?</p>

<p>Because the only &quot;oppressed group&quot; I can think of are straight Christians who want nuclear families (and want to be left alone).</p>

<p>They want to be free (in their own country) to live the life they want to live, without state intrusion and bullying.</p>

<p>I seem to remember a baker sued for $200,000 for not wanting to participate in a religious rite for a gay person.</p>

<p>Can you give me an example of Christians getting together to sue a gay baker for not espousing New Testament beliefs?</p>

<p>I seem to remember a CEO who &quot;dared&quot; to contribute money to a traditional marriage fund (when ever Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton said that they were anti-gay marriage). So fifteen years ago, the CEO donated to a cause he believed in: The nuclear family. And he had to be punished and driven from his job.</p>

<p>Give me the full list of heterosexual Christians who persecuted a CEO who donated to gay normalization political activist groups, and demanded he be fired.</p>

<p>The reality is: No one is &quot;oppressing&quot; these people.</p>

<p>The irony is: They&#39;re oppressing others.</p>

<p>They&#39;re extorting people to give them validation. Or else.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t accept several of premises (that you&#39;re passively repeating from some gender studies professor).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t accept that 1) 97% of the population are &quot;oppressors,&quot; that 2) I don&#39;t accept that propaganda campaigns stopped with gay marriage, and that they&#39;re not now trying to normalization a whole raft of new &quot;lifestyle choices,&quot; 3) I don&#39;t accept the premise that pedophiles aren&#39;t evil that they &quot;they were born that way and can&#39;t help it&quot; [a talking-point coined for the gay rights movement, and now being applied to pedophiles, cannibals, etc.], 4) I don&#39;t accept that it &quot;doesn&#39;t affect people,&quot; as Christian bakers are being sued into bankruptcy, and as Bill Nye is promoting transgenderism to my kinds on TV.</p>

<p>That shit affects people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <em>designed</em> to affect people.</p>

<p>Propaganda campaigns are funded by very wealthy and very powerful people with the express intention of changing minds and altering behavioral patterns.</p>

<p>The only way it <em>couldn&#39;t</em> affect people is if they kept it to themselves. If they maintained a sense of privacy and decorum.</p>

<p>But they don&#39;t want privacy and decorum.</p>

<p>They want to arrogate the authority to shape the young minds of other people&#39;s four year-olds.</p>

<p>(Sorry, but I don&#39;t grant you the right to brainwash my four year-old.)</p>
