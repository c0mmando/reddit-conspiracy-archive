    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve come to the realization that it doesn&#39;t matter whether you understand what&#39;s really going on or not. You are still compelled by the system we all live under to conform to a basic set of laws and customs, whether you like it or not, whether you agree with them or not.</p>

<p>How many people actually stop paying their income taxes? Only a handful, and those people get huge fines, and if they don&#39;t pay those fines, they go to prison. What does it matter if you believe that you are a Sovereign Citizen, when the state you don&#39;t believe in will send you to prison if you disagree with them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with this. Sovereign merely means, one who abides by Common Law (not admiralty law), which is what we have in the US. The problem is, that Admiralty Law has been implemented on top of Common Law.</p>

<p>This can be changed through educating we the people the difference between those types of law. The District of Columbia (UNITED STATES OF AMERICA - all caps) is a foreign corporation controlling the Republic of the united States of America. They technically have no jurisdiction over the Republic. It&#39;s allowed to, because  only about ~1-2% of people actually know this fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a little pessimistic. Knowledge of power structures and the struggles between them is excellent practice for those who spend time thinking about investing either in local businesses or in the stock market as a whole.</p>

<p>As long as you are thinking about, hypothesizing and testing theories of power, you are providing for yourself a framework that most people will ignore when it comes to investing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you are trying to say. For me I feel an inner sense of peace; I&#39;m also discovering my purpose in life. At one point, I felt really lost. I kept falling victim to societal agendas. Dealt with one misfortune after another, alcohol, jail. Eventually I hit rock bottom. I knew I had to break the cycle. I didn&#39;t blame the higher being, instead I began to pray. Came across a docuseries that opened my eyes. That was just the beginning for me. I&#39;m grateful that my life has changed for the better. It&#39;s hard to meet people that understand or carry a similar mindset. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grew up with a Christian father who strongly believed he had a relationship with jesus, and a drug addict mother who eventually went to prison and got deported. I grew up in a Christian church but never really had any faith, but was grounded in the faith. After the first time I smoked pot, a day didn&#39;t go by where I didn&#39;t have some. Started looking into shit they didn&#39;t teach in schools and began not to care about what they were teaching me but still graduated with a decent gpa. After I graduated I continued smoking and met some friends who did and sold cocaine but I got free weed by chilling with them so why not. For some reason I&#39;ve always liked lsd so after the first couple times I tried it I had to figure out why it made me feel the way I did. After reading a bunch of shit and tying into my life I realized everything that takes you out of reality is an evil entity. I realized everyone gets what they deserve from our creator and when you do a drug like lsd/shrooms you&#39;re basically just speeding up what you deserve in life. I got to this conclusion from the fact that everyone talked about getting &quot;bad trips&quot; and I once heard a story about a person peeling their skin thinking they were an orange. People who were addicted to cocaine always had something against doing lsd, because they were turned on to the evil they deserved. After I realized, I&#39;m now 20 years old and can tell you that once you know that every action you or another person does is a projection of evil or good. You can&#39;t go back once you know. everyone that is ridiculously successful is inherently evil and the proof is all there. The secret knowledge everyone wants to know but can&#39;t handle is that evil exists and there&#39;s no way to escape it without jesus. Even with jesus, it never gets easy. These are the front lines. You can choose to lose on the evil side or fight on the good side. But being a person who doesn&#39;t believe makes you a person of no value to either side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no idea. The CIA honest to God tried to murder me. It&#39;s the kind of thing you can&#39;t go to anyone about for help, and if you talk about it, you&#39;re instantly put into the kook trash can.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t really any &quot;higher knowledge&quot;, it&#39;s more like you just realize everyone in charge is stupid, more blunders happen than flawless masterplans, but the Deep State doesn&#39;t care, they just keep ploughing onwards while growing exponentially bigger.</p>
