       Hi, I'm Emmanuel Macron . I met my wife when I was 15 years old and she was 39. She was my teacher. We don't have children together but her oldest son is 2 years older than me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am now 39 and she is 63, and she has 7 grandchildren.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm your friendly neighbour investment banker, and am friends with Francois Enron. Enron, in turn, is the best friend and main partner of David de Rothschild and in 2008 I was hired by the Rothschild’s &amp; Co Banque where I made quick career and in four years only I grew from analyst to partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who can blame me , after all she is a millionaire , and I was groomed to be a president extraordinaire !

       The Jesuits are kind of a super Illuminati. In the 16th and 17th century they controlled almost every university in Europe. They created the Gregorian calendar and then rewrote history through the university system. They were also responsible for creating the inquisition and ramming their religion down people's throats. They also created a secret society called Los Alumbrados  (Latin for the enlightened brotherhood).
      </p>
      <p>
       In America they also founded most of our universities as well before and after the revolution. Because they were part of the founding of Yale the Jusuits control the order of Skull and Bones from behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through the university system they trained many lawyers who used their legal speak to take away our rights. They were responsible for ending "common law" in America and turning citizens into legalized "strawmen" with no rights. Most people blame Jewish lawyers for ruining common law but it was really the Jesuits.

       They are a Catholic order, like the Franciscans or Dominucans. Catholic orders are kinda weird and confusing, but are essentially just subgroups of the Catholic Church which were founded by charismatic or influencial individuals and got sanction from the Pope to engage in a specific task. Jesuits are an Evangelical order founded during the 1500s primarily to aggressively convert all the foreign cultures that were being discovered at the time and to found schools where doctrinally sound theology would be taught.

       Sneaks for Catholicism with a penchant for infiltrating education and media and putting out propaganda with a strategy of 'putting learning against learning'.  Also, fomenting regime changes in various countries by getting the People to support the cause of 'revolutions' which would supposedly benefit them.  They're responsible for the French, Russian, Spanish, U.S. revolutions among many others, and it's this group's symbolism which 'Anonymous' uses to incite the People to 'revolution' against 'the powermongering Western oligarchies'.  Jesuits will also consolidate control over the institutions of higher learning until only its 'approved' version of history, economics, etc. appear socially 'normal' and therefore credible, and thus they can dictate what 'everybody knows'.

       CBS, Paramount and Viacom are owned by 'National Amusements', which is owned 80% by a Jesuit and 20% by his Jesuit daughter.  Most if not all of their franchises serve the NWO agendas in some way, which at this point is demonstrably treason and RICO applies here.  Things will get interesting once we manage to restore the courts of law in the U.S..

       They may or may not be professing Jews, but he comes out of the quintessentially Jesuit Georgetown University.  Not only do they miseducate there as I'd described, they also recruit and organize for the post-college professional arena.

       There ends up being very little distinction between globalist Jews (as distinct from the average, normal, workaday Jews) and Rome because each of those is part of the same organization.  It started back in Babylon when the mystery-priests would hold proprietary scientific and technological knowledge close to their chest and use it to claim divine affiliations to the peasants, using elaborate strategies.  The peasants usually accepted it naively.  This power structure hopped like a flea from the Babylonian Empire, through the overt governments of the Medo-Persian Empire, the Greek, the Roman Empire, and of course Rome as it repackaged itself as a superficially Christian church (still keeping a the Babylonian occult symbology of course) to contend with the upsurge of Christianity in the Middle East in the wake of Jesus' followers.  By Jesus' day this Babylonian-originated power structure had already thoroughly infiltrated and subverted the orthodox Jewish religious structure, and it was the resulting hypocrisy amidst the synagogue officials that He encountered there.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, Rome fronts and could only front for the Babylonian-originated regime, using politics, media, education, religion and economics to gain control of the world's establishments and bind them together in what's called 'The New World Order' (presumably because the Babylonian occultists are extremely Will-centric and like to present their ambitions in the context of inevitability and Manifest Destiny).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to all this, learning the old Babylonian occult symbols helps decode their influence enormously and should you do so you'll be able to spot their presence almost everywhere from news reporting to corporate trademarks and so on.  And amid the various 'New Age' symbols found in crop circle formations, a large proportion of them are Babylonian in origin.  It can't be that daunting for some government agency to upload a .GIF or .JPEG to a man-made satellite and have it beam that pattern onto crops with some kind of classified we-don't-know-what ray.  The Babylonian mystery priests have been working, again using advanced proprietary technologies, to eventually simulate the presence of extraterrestrials and use that to start the modern iteration of the 'Tower of Babel', with mystery-priests consolidating and befuddling the People using sophisticated methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       To start learning Babylonian occult symbolism and how Rome has juxtaposed itself with it, you may want to start with Alexander Hislop's

       I should also add that the Jesuits are additionally tasked with bringing Christian denominations which have schismed from Rome 'back into the fold' slowly and gradually over generations, by influencing officials within those sects through bribery or extortion - or by simply emplacing themselves
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       sect officials - and eroding their teachings, values and official policies until they close the gap between the denomination and Rome so much that they're effectively indistinguishable in practice and led by the same organization.  Sometimes but not always the eventual result is that the denomination will officially 'make peace' with Rome though formal agreements, with the offending sect apologizing for ever having left.  In fact this is happening again this year on October 31st, the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, as errant Lutheran officials 'make peace' with the Vatican, apologize for ever having the Reformation, and adopt some extremely Catholic core beliefs.  Walter Veith examines this situation and who is actually doing what

       , and opening it in a new tab should play the video at the right cue point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the 1900s the Jesuits have also used their influence in education and the publishing industry to 'revise' the modern Bibles, now even removing entire crucial verses or altering their meaning to be consistent with their various agendas.  If you open

       in a new tab it should begin at just the right cue point to show you the direct results of that effort, and the whole video shows how they accomplished it.

       Wow, a 24 year age gap! Funnily enough, that's exactly the age gap between Trump and Melania. Trump has a bunch of grandkids where Melania doesn't, too! Interesting to see this being considered noteworthy, "gross", warranting mockery all of a sudden.

       For it to be a "whataboutism" I would need to be defending this relationship, which I'm not. Age gaps like this are creepy and unhealthy, unfortunately they're largely treated as normal as long as it's a man who is old enough to the parent.

       I'm so disappointed with these elections. The French had a chance to exit this EU dictatorship the way the UK did, by voting for Asselineau. He did 1%, and a majority voted for the representative of the oligarchy (Macron) and LePen. And, exactly like what happened before in the past, from now on until the 2nd round of elections, all the MSM will keep repeating that if LePen is elected, the nazis are back in power and the apocalypse will follow. People who vote for LePen haven't understood after all this time that LePen's party is a creation of the system, and will never ever win.
      </p>
      <p>
       The French are asleep. I guess their financial situation is not bad enough yet. Sorry to say, but we have to acknowledge that the Brits are smarter than the French. They understood what's going on.

       While thought provoking, I don't see anything concrete. Are you saying mass Muslim immigration isn't a problem? We will never be allowed to elect a true outsider, so we have to vote for the best of what is available.

       I am saying that Muslims immigration is not the problem. Muslims, buddhists, Christians, whatever labels you put on people's face is not the problem. For the most part, Muslims want the same thing you or I want : get a job that pays enough money to put food on the table and pay the bills, have a fridge, a television, a car, a house, raise good kids etc... they don't all plot on blowing themselves up everyday of the week. If that's what you think all Muslims are planning all day long, well, congrats, the MSM brainwashing has worked well on you. I'm saying that as a white Christian. Now, if you're taking about mass migration, whatever religion it is, yes that is a problem, an entirely different problem. And staying in the EU means no country leader (or shall I say country admin assistant, since the power is held at Brussels) will do anything about.

      <p>
       Mass Muslim immigration is the same as mass immigration. So when you spew a whole paragraph of nonsense regarding Muslim immigration, you are deflecting from the point that any massive immigration is a problem...which even you acknowledged at the end of your drivel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes Brits voted for Brexit, which they got. They also have Theresa May who will most likely sabotage said Brexit and future trade deals.

       Go ahead and vote for the candidate you think is the Messiah. Unfortunately we live in the real world where 99% of people are fucking idiots who are easily manipulated by propaganda whether it is in the MSM/Social Media/Educational Systems etc...

       No, it's not. Mass immigration can come from anywhere. They are not synonymous. You can potentially have mass immigration from China, India, wherever. Mass immigration is very likely to happen shall water levels rise. Some sources state that in some parts of the world such as Bangladesh and India, millions of people would have to move and relocate if water levels rise, as a consequence of global warming. Whichever country these people would move to, that would create massive problems in the host country, because : no country has the infrastructures ready to welcome millions of foreigners overnight; the sudden mix of 2 people of very different cultures mean great social conflicts, regardless of religions. This happened before when Europeans migrated massively to the North American continent, when Europeans  migrated massively to Australia, when Chinese migrated massively to Malaysia, to quote a few examples. None of all those migrants were Muslims.

       Sorry to contradict you, but the Brits have officially triggered the Brexit, applying article 50 of the EU adhesion treaties. Theresa May is going to lead a sovereign country as a consequence, and together with the parliament will be able to take full ownership of decisions that matter for Britain. She is likely to do what means Britain's economy grows. BTW, since Brexit has been voted, the British pound lost a good part of its value, which means it's become more interesting financially for more companies worldwide to invest in Britain. And that's what is happening now : foreign companies are investing in Britain, regardless of Theresa May's policies. Unemployment is also going down as a consequence. Besides, I suggest you have a look at how well the economies of Switzerland, Iceland and Norway are doing. You know what those 4 countries have in common ? They don't use the Euro currency, and they are not part of the EU.

       Like I said, even in the very unlikely case LePen was elected, she wouldn't do shit, for that simple reason that she won't initiate for France to exit the EU. And as long as France, or whichever country remains in the EU, the elected leader of the country will have no choice but follow the orders that come from unelected folks at Brussels.

       So what percentage of the immigration into Europe over the last few years is of the Muslim persuasion? Considering Christianity is still the most prolific religion around the world we should expect less than 50%....

       I'm not sure where you're getting at. You seem to truly have something against the Muslims. I'm saying mass immigration, wherever this mass population comes from, and regardless of their religion/skin colour/whatever, is a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       LePen is trying to create an horizontal conflict, dividing the population between the muslims vs non-muslims (so the oligarchy can keep going with their business, and their robbing of the population and all). If it was not the muslims the culprits for everything that is not going right, it would be the blacks, or the Asian, or the Eastern Europeans. 
There is enough evidence that this flood of migrants is not a self initiative. It's been organized by a 3rd party. There is also enough evidence who organized that. These millions of migrants didn't all gather one day in Syria, or wherever, to plot an attack against the European people, to then walk all together all across the Middle East and swim across the Mediterranean sea. That's not how things happened. All these migrants are the victims as much as the European people are. If you want to stop this flood of migrants, you have to attack the root of this problem. If LePen targets the migrants themselves, it's going nowhere. She knows it. She knows the bigger picture. But she leads a populist party. For the avg person who feeds on the French version of CNN/Foxnews, the Muslims are the problem. Blaming these migrants, or calling them names, or going out after them with baseball bats is certainly not going to solve the problem. BTW, the countries these migrants most likely come from (Syria, Libya, Afghanistan) once were wonderful, peaceful, prosperous countries, before they were destroyed. I remember, back in the days, brochures from tour operators promoting trips to these countries.

       I agree this mass Muslim migration has been orchestrated behind the scenes by many different groups with differing goals and ideologies. That doesn't change the fact that Muslim culture, and Islam in general is extremely toxic and incompatible with modern western society.

       You have to pick your battles. National sovereignty and immigration control is crucial right now. If we don't stop the globalists now, we never will.

       The ruling class is not losing control of the media. Never was. Whoever is ruling, will be always the ruling class. This means, the elite itself cannot be seen as one entity. They all have different opinions and there are multiple parties. For once, I would like to see a poor person who makes like 20-30k $ or € per year at the top of the goverment. But this will never happen, because once this poor person tries to reach it, he will immediately become part of the elite and ruling class.

       You have not answered my question yet. The financial capitalist elite are so deeply interwined in our system, who do you believe started to stir up the nationalist streams ? Why is it happening now concurrently everywhere in the world ? Because the "good guys" finally win ?

       'Cuz French. Age of consent is 15.
      </p>
      <p>
       The age of consent in France is 15, as specified by Article 227-25 of the Penal Code, which reads: "The fact of the commission without violence, constraint, threat or surprise of a sexual offence by an adult on the person of a minor under fifteen years of age is punished by five years' imprisonment and a fine of €75,000."[31]
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 227-22 prohibits the "organisation by an adult of meetings involving indecent exposure or sexual relations knowing that minors are present or participating". (Minors refers to under 18s; the text of the article can be subject to interpretation).[32]
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 227-22-1 prohibits the "soliciting of a minor under the age of fifteen, or a person pretending to be such minor, for sexual purposes through the use of a computer system".[33]
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Article 227-27 prohibits sexual relations with minors over age 15 (aged 15, 16 or 17) "1° where they are committed by an ascendant or by any other person having a legal or factual authority over the victim; 2° where they are committed by a person abusing the authority conferred by his functions."[34]

       Le Pen unfortunately carries baggage as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her father denied the holocaust. While she has renounced him, she still has similar politics and I understand french people's reluctance to vote for her.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, this dude Macron seems like an absolute corporate sell out creep. Impossible to imagine him having a satisfying personal life. Full of BS and is just the candidate for people to hold their noses and continue the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hilary had way more baggage though and came very close to winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Macron's results today skyrocketed his odds of winning the election. Polls have him running 20+ points ahead with 2 weeks to go against le pen. Will take close to a miracle for macron to lose now.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I'd like to see Le pen win and just cause a FUBAR situation, I don't see it happening.
