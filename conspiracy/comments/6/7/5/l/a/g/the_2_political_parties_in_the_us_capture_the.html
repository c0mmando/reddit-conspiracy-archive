        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Democrats are the party of the emotional thinkers. &quot;Can&#39;t you see group X is suffering, therefore Y must be done?&quot; Any policy can be pushed through if it properly aligns with the virtue-signalling system that is put forward by the party. Conducting &quot;humanitarian&quot; wars, inviting corporate globalism that has decimated the middle class, and pushing a rigid top-down authoritarian system for the &quot;betterment of mankind&quot;. </p>

<p>The Republican party is for the people who deny the importance of feelings, either because they never appreciated it in the first place or they were burned in the past by being misled by emotional appeals, and instead have to make the &quot;cold, hard, fact-based decisions&quot; about what to do. So all the &quot;uncomfortable&quot; policies and discussions are pushed through using the Republican party. Warmongering, making cuts to public funding, anti-immigration policies, strong in-group bias, etc. </p>

<p>By promoting politics as a tribalistic activity, the good team (our team) vs their bad team, then we will forever be biased. People find one of these two approaches attractive, and may adorn the clothes of that ideology, negative baggage and all (which they must now pretend doesn&#39;t exist, or downplay it).</p>

<p>So if we can see the middleground, that emotions <em>and</em> rhetoric both have their place, then we can see both parties have serious, serious flaws. And there are many ideas that aren&#39;t represented by <em>either</em> party, like anti-war policies, or a movement toward co-ops and democractically-owned workplaces and away from monopolies. Corporations have taken over both parties and the US is an oligarchy according to a Princeton study. So while there may be choices over social matters, there are no options when it comes to the things that might affect the profits of the corporations that have hijacked the government. </p>

<p>It&#39;s time for the two-party voting system to end because it has become a system of abuse and ownership, rather than freedom and choice. It needs to be replaced with a true multi-party voting system like Ranked Choice so that we can have true options that can compete on an even playing field. </p>

<p>Several states have already switched to multi-party voting systems, like Vermont. If enough states switch, it will also switch on the federal level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been saying this for a while.</p>

<p>Democrats think with their heart. They are obsessed with doing the right thing based on their feelings, but not measurable fact. They focus more on groups that are discriminated against, but often in ways that aren&#39;t supported by science or reality.</p>

<p>Republicans think with their gut. They go with what feels right. This leads them to go against things that aren&#39;t really harmful, like marijuana.</p>

<p>What we need is a political party that thinks with their brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting take, I like it. </p>

<p>A party that thinks with their brain <em>and</em> heart might hurt the profits of the military-industrial complex. They don&#39;t want that. That&#39;s not allowed, unless we bypass what they want and do what we want at a local level and push it upwards through state resolutions (38 state resolutions = new constitutional amendment) or passing laws in states like Vermont that has Ranked Choice </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the following strongly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s time for the two-party voting system to end because it has become a system of abuse and ownership, rather than freedom and choice. It needs to be replaced with a true multi-party voting system like Ranked Choice so that we can have true options that can compete on an even playing field. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, your analysis of pop-psychology and party politics is deeply ahistorical. </p>

<p>Was not the first Gulf war started because emotional appeals about babies in incubators? Bush SR, a republican administration.</p>

<p>Was not the invasion of Panama done by a Republican administration to you know protect human rights, and stop drug trafficking?</p>

<p>Was it not the Republicans who invaded Afghanistan on the emotional manipulation? </p>

<p>To assess the Democratic counterparts, it was Clinton who passed NAFTA, deregulated the Banks, cut welfare spending, and passed a slew of tough on crime legislation which swelled our prison population.  It was under the Clinton administration that Liberation of Iraq act was passed:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Liberation_Act">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Liberation_Act</a></p>

<p>This is the foreign-policy background, but think about the large percentage of Christian evangelicals who have been the backbone of the Republican party, they are not prone to denying the importance of feelings or pondering cold hard facts. </p>

<p>Conversely there is a whole slew of liberal interventionists virtually identical to the no-conservative movement who is all about long term Geo-strategic interest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could argue the opposite. Democrats are lead by logic and rational (liberal comes from the French for libre (free or book or freedom) think liberty and library. Freedom can only come to a mind that reads and understands things and is in this way empowered. </p>

<p>Republicans are lead by their selfish emotions, their lizard brains concerned with their well being and rise to the top of the social ladder. (Republicans all think that they will one day be rich and rise higher in status) also religion plays a big part into appealing to emotion, and that&#39;s a whole other way to influence the masses right of center. </p>
