        Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness; only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that.

       THE power of 1984 lies in its raw abstraction of what the state ultimately is.  No one, yet, seems to take the point very well.  Other than us.

       Back to the topic, there are certain things that are can never be under national control. And those are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Offensive Military (defensive and offensive are totally separate).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Espionage Organizations (by their nature, they are intended to subvert the elective process)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         World Economics (Economics is a series of agreements between nations)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pharmaceuticals and Health (One nation can not tolerate another possessing ownership over life and death)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Multinational Corporations (A nation can not own a corporation that is inherently stateless)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Religious Institutions (the primary concept of religion is that it supersedes all outside allegiance)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Patents and Technology (one nation can not bare to suffer knowing of a better solution, by enforcing another nations patents)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Forms of Political Unity (one nation can not separate and excel without causing unrest with its primitive neighbors)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         News (one nation can not allow indecent information to reach it's populace, which it is attempting to censor)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There is essentially one exception to this, and that is Switzerland. They operate under a completely unique, and vastly superior government, with enormously higher standards of living, without inciting unrest with it's neighbors. Likewise, they contribute nothing to the world military, while setting the standards for world economics, pharmacuetical patents, espionage, news, corporate secrecy, and are the guardians of the Vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the same, offensive military is just a population tax. True conquest is done through improving organization, bettering the minds, and bettering the living conditions. The military stick is only there to 'genocide' conceptions of rebellion. The nations that are least able to defend themselves pay the cost of the military, but the bomb, tank, and weapons dealers are international in nature. No one nation would allow another to become the sole possessor of nuclear power, not for long, and never will a Tank win the hearts and minds of a people, or turn them into profitable subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't go too far off on a tangent here, but just realize no one nation would EVER, be allowed the sole right to assassinate, sabotage, or bomb a nation. If you suspect 'cave dwelling Muslims' are even the smallest bit of the problem, imagine what an organization as powerful as the EU could do to the US, if assassination and sabotage was permitted internationally on an ad hoc basis?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, no. All these issues are decided internationally, along with deciding which nations will pay for them, and how much. Does the US not agree with contributing $4 Trillion toward a international bombing campaign against the Iraqis? How about we kill all your bankers, steal the banking industry, and blow up a couple towers... would you pay then, or like another reminder or your true role in the world of politics?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about we kill your President? Would you pay our tax then?

       I would hope they did listen but know that's not apart of the current democracy where lobbying for economic growth is the biggest leverage. Just like the news about this potential Saudi nuclear deal, the money it brings in will outweigh the risk of adding more nuclear options to this region. I would hope that deal is fake as it may eventually create a war no one wants to see.

       It has been a long time since I read the document entitled, "A World Effectively Controlled By The United Nations," but to my mempry, it seems that the UN was needed until such a time as it can be reformed and radically redesigned, resulting in the appearance of something more or less, a global tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we are witnessing now, is the way in which countries will increase their own power by uniting their people against external threats. What's different is that, while people certainly ARE becoming Nationalistic, the enemy riled against is the same for everyone- Terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the world seems to be drifting apart, but each part is heading in the same direction. I foresee another Great War, looming on the horizon. What form the world takes after the fact, is not immediately obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, as Lincoln P Bloomfield suggested in 1961, a war or brink of war,-like scenario could be envisioned, to push reforms that would tighten control over time. Disarmament comes in three phases. We are in the second phase. I believe a fear of a global war will push people to accept the third phase of disarmament, and if that happens, the people behind the EU will have won.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a world controlled by a central authority, nations will be able to retain their own identity. They won't be any less slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UN wants to chip the entire planet with biometric computer chips. Somehow I doubt they would just let everyone go now that they have them right where they want them.

       No power vs. Little power are two different things, especially when the UN Charter can and has been radically redesigned, to apportion more power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UN is 75 percent funded by the USA and it's constitution was penned by 13 US Senators in San Francisco in 1963. It seems fair to presume that the UN is just an extention of the will of the United States, which itself is an extention of the will of European elites who run the EU.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is a lot of power there, if you aren't willing to ignore the rest of the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point is that A) It's power may make a quantum leap soon, or
      </p>
      <p>
       B) The USA may do away with the UN as it is no longer useful as a means t the end which is global domination.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is this nonsense?

       because western military industrial and banking establishment is clearly the enemy of the entire world, most clearly it's own citizens. look at the economic policies and pointless wars they have involved the west in for profit, not to mention supporting nazism back in the day which was basically funded by East Coast industiralists and bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       the UN is irrelevant because it is in some ways an extension of western establishment power but has no military power.

       It seems to me that the UN is more key than you think. It may be this or that, but one thing it is not, is irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's vision is the reason for the world going the direction it goes. Incrementally implimenting the UN's policies, is well underway, and led to developments such as the African Union, which started out with 75000 troops trained over ten years prior, by none other than the USA. Coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       The powers behind the UN are very relevant, and their ambition is clear- global domination.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have resources to make this happen, and are well into the progress of their plans.

       they are only anglo. the entire EU disaster and UN disaster were design by the Wilsonian Idealist morons in the US and UK. as is the whole IMF disaster and all the financial capitalist bullshit.

       there have been many articles written on the death of US military and political dominance and hegemony. the whole "american century" bullshit thing was just propaganda written by cheney among others.

       I agree that the last century is behind us, and a new century, with new potential lay ahead. China is certainly becoming a big deal. Russia too, but they could both be history depending on how the tides turn. America hasn't really lost military hegemony. In fact, they have made astounsing gains and anticipate (it seems), making further gains. We will really just have to wait and see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still unclear why you think everyone behind the EU is Anglo. Can you name some names?

       It seems to me that anyone from that area, by now would be Anglo-Saxon, if not a mix with other types. I have a hard time believing anyone on earth is only Anglo.

       Haha you have missed my point entirely! My point is that, at some point in history, the Anglo and the Saxon tribes mixed so much, that people began to call them Anglo-Saxons. This is actually, extremely relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no such thing anymore, as an Anglo person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now obviously this is splitting hairs, but it is so funny how you are defending this point to the death, even though you don't have to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want you to call them Anglo-Saxons. Is that so terrible?

       Wilsonian Idealism is an interesting topic, sure, but how will looking it up help me? Why can't you just write a couple more sentances expoinding upon your point? Why do you just say two words and then run away? Like I said, if you don't have the time just say so, but I would prefer to have an actual conversation, rather than to have some rude person tell me what I do and don't know.

       Anglo is a culture. It more or less refers to the English speaking world. and yes there absolutely is.

       Neither of those things are true. I love facts, actually, which is why I would make a pedantic argument!

       you don't even acknowledge cultural differences exist, therefore you are incapable of understanding what wilsonian idealism (the anglo establishment plan for the world) and what the UN stands for-and what it is opposed to ie real world cultural diversity.

       I did some reading about Wilsonian Idealism yesterday, and I already admitted that i find it interesting, so how can you go ahead and say what you just said? It seems as if you are actively trying your hardest, to not have a conversation.

       But you are twisting my words. I didn't mean to say that anglo culture doesn't exist. I pointed out that the Wiki cites Anglo culture to be either Anglo-American or aome part of the Eastern UK. So if you use the word, at least use it properly and not as a general term for all white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I meant that Anglo is an old word, and modern times doesn't see a lot of Anglo-only culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even just reading the wiki, makes it clear that Wilson would be considered an Anglo-American, which is not the same as calling him Anglo.

       Was it truly, not fair for me to say, the EU is a Liberal Pipedream? It surely is Liberal in nature. Yes people who pretend to be Conservatives advocate for the NWO, but the EU and the NWO are not the same thing. They do seem to have similar goals, but I'm not sure why you've made a direct connection.

       Comparing shit to shit. We aren't in full engagement with ground troops. We don't have as many American soldiers dying as under Bush. Arguably, we have to do something about ISIS. Unfortunately, were in more military engagements than ever before. Supposedly we run more precision operations all over the world. But the troops are safer and we spent less money... 😐

       It's almost like you didn't include our ground troops in Afghanistan.  Obama had  chance to wind that one down...especially after we caught "Bin Laden" but he decided to commit us for another 20 yrs.  Obama is part of the same problem, and your partisanship will never solve it.

       I'm pragmatic with politicians. You get idealistic during the primaries and pick what you want. But when it comes to the final election I compare policies and likelihood of getting what I can need. There is no partisanship here. I vote for what I think is best for this country and for me. If a Republican/Democrat most likely represents what I need in a botched system of pick 2 then I pick the better option. I don't vote just for platitudes but actual plans and direction.

       I have this feeling that whoever is elected president, no matter what you promise on the campaign trail – blah, blah, blah – when you win, you go into this smoke-filled room with the twelve industrialist capitalist scum-fucks who got you in there. And you're in this smoky room, and this little film screen comes down … and a big guy with a cigar goes, "Roll the film." And it's a shot of the Kennedy assassination from an angle you've never seen before … that looks suspiciously like it's from the grassy knoll. And then the screen goes up and the lights come up, and they go to the new president, "Any questions?" "Er, just what my agenda is." "First we bomb Muslims." "You got it ."

       for most of us in this sub the obviousness of this quote makes the attribution quite unnecessary. this specific quote is arguably the most conspiracy relevant comedian quote of all time outside of the equally obvious George Carlin material.

      <p>
       inserting a
       <strong>
        painfully
       </strong>
       obvious quote into the rare situation where if fits perfectly into an unrelated comment thread is a kind of inside joke on reddit.... using a Bill Hicks quote (
       <strong>
        especially that one
       </strong>
       ) in this sub is obviously a joke to anyone who has spent any time around conspiracy material, or comedy, or music, or popular culture ffs. can you understand how attribution kind of ruins the inside joke? anyone who is unseasoned enough to have not yet encountered the original bill hick's routine (or the hundreds of times it has been sampled into songs, memes, etc) will get in on the joke when they eventually do.

       Barack Hussein Obama is a crypto Muslim, he had to cut deals with the jews to be President, like they all do; but as a Muslim, his price to pay must have been unfathomably great.  He visibly chaffed under the commands of Netanyahu sometimes, you can tell he's not okay with it, but he is the epitome of a self obsessed person who HAD to have his name in history books, no matter the cost
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald "one term Trump" on the other hand, has been making deals with jews his entire life.  It's second nature to him.  He was the rigged election winner from the start.  Hillary was paid to be the patsy

       I don't even know what to think about him anymore. At first I was all for the "4d chess" and thought "hmm maybe he is playing them and then he will pull a trick out of his sleeve". Now every day, more and more, I slowly doubt that. Im not giving up hope just yet, but im also not too optimistic of any significant change.

       Here is a source I found but I heard him say that the generals know what they are doing and are he would just slow them down. When he was eating that chocolate cake with the president of China, he found out that the military launched those 69 missile at Syria.

       How did this election prove it ? We're you
       <em>
        that

       naive to think the American public had
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       control whatsoever over the military 😂 the party system is an illusion . You have no choice , you're all slaves .
Also I don't actually see how Trump has suddenly changed your mind on this.. What war is the US fighting ? There were some bombs dropped on an insignificant Syrian air base , which was most likely agreed upon in advance, certainly Russia knew.
Either way the gen pop had no control over it.

       The question that arises is that if the electorate thru the WH and thru both houses of congress cannot change US military policy, who, exactly, is directing the US military? Who is in charge of what the US military and the rest of the infrastructure, ie the CIA?
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is the global leader and a massive resource in terms of money (taxes), troops, armaments, etc. Large enough to dominate the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the US people do not control it. What is preventing this massive military capability from being turned onto itself?

       That's your biggest takeaway?  What about how in the era with the easiest access to information Americans are still so ignorant that they thought a fear mongering narcissistic demagogue who can barely string a thought together, would care about them.

       But yeah, it doesn't matter what the electorate does. Americans do not control their govt and their govt does not control their military resources.

       I truly think this is just a ratings grab. Trumps been seen as insensitive and conscious-less. The narrative is that Assad murdered innocent children with gas. If he goes on the offensive to protect innocent children, he's seen as having a conscious by the left which will certainly boost his record low ratings. At the same time, he's rallying up the right by doing what he said and "going after ISIS." Now he's trying to have us all rally around the flag in order to boost his ratings to try and secure a second term. He had nothing to lose in fear of impeachment.
