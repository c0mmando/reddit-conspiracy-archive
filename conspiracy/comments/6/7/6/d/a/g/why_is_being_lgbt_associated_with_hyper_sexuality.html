    <div class="md"><p>No offense but you don&#39;t seem well versed on LGBT people. Gender dysphoria is a mental illness and it has a medical treatment (transitioning genders) it is no where near as harmful as schizophrenia, many transgender people can function and live a normal life, even before transition.

<p>No, you seem not to be and are projecting that ignorance on me. As for what you said about schizophrenia, just goes to show how ignorant you are of them. Plenty of them live a fully functional life and are no threat to themselves or others. </p>

<p>Transgenders on the other  hand are highly likely to commit suicide post-transformation. Why you may ask? Because they are not getting the help to get to the root of the cause, they are merely addressing a symptom. Here, listen to a &quot;former&quot; transgender who got the surgery to be a woman lived the life and is now a male (and an anti-transgender activist): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7NYWd7p-zE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7NYWd7p-zE</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re associating the treatment for gender dysphoria, with a disease that is commonly associated with people who are unsafe to be around and cant normally function. You&#39;re associating gender, with a disease that can cause hallucinations and cognitive dysfunction, and then you call me ignorant. I am aware there are those with the disease who can function when medicated. Stop trying to claim some moral high ground, its disgusting. </p>

<p>Do you have a source for transgender people committing suicide at the same rate post transition that they did pre transition? I&#39;d like to also point out, you showing me one person who transitioned, then realized they made the wrong choice is not evidence that transitioning does not solve the problem, infect its only evidence that this one person did not make the right call.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing another thing that I said, which is Dissociative identity disorder. Also, my guess is that you did not watch the video link I linked, discussing this topic coming from an actual &quot;transgender&quot; person, himself and how once he got the mental help, he realized it was mental thing and the surgery was of no help. It&#39;s a mental thing that needs to be addressed, and it cannot be addressed by mutilating your body. Hence, why Johns Hopkins stop performing it. It goes against the Hippocratic oath. It does more harm than good...</p>

I said it was a mental illness several times, It didn&#39;t work for one person, that&#39;s terrible, he made the wrong choice in a confused part of his life. What are we even arguing for then? It seems we both agree it is a mental illness, there is a treatment for it, it works for some, but not for all.

<p>Proof it does? This is no different than encouraging a schizophrenic to embrace their alter personality fully. Sure, it could work, but it&#39;s not very helpful to that person, in the long run. All it would take is one trigger and that person can be sent off the deep end...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The source you sent me seems biased. Descrimination isn&#39;t a fair argument because they&#39;re mentally ill, all mental illnesses are not equal as I will keep saying. It&#39;s a very broad term, just because you&#39;re mentally ill doesn&#39;t mean discrimination isn&#39;t a factor in suicide...... 
Then they claim that another reason the suicide because discrimination is false because other groups experience discrimination, and that black suicide rate should be higher than whites because they perceive discrimination to be higher than whites, even though white suicide rate is higher. </p>

<p>severity of discrimination are what matter, from who and why, and not perceived discrimination but actual discrimination. For example it would be much more emotionally toiling to have your own father or mother treat you badly because you&#39;re transgender, then to perceive a cop is biased towards you because you&#39;re black. I think white male suicide rate is so high because in the west we live in a culture of white guilt and self loathing, from my experience at least. </p>

And then comparing Transitioning to schizophrenia and then even pedophilia, I do not think you care at all for trans people but just want an excuse to stop people from transitioning while cloaking yourself in moral superiority by claiming you want to help them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The striking thing is that many gay leaders in the 1970s predicted that the sexual revolution spurred by the Stonewall uprising might lead to a world where gay men interacted solely based on their sexual interest and thus forfeit any opportunity for meaningful connections. Leaders within the gay community, such as Craig Rodwell, understood the need to establish alternative spaces, beyond bars and bathhouses, for gay men to congregate. As Rodwell once explained, “Sex is damned important to everyone, hetero, or Gay. But the question we should be asking is, do we overemphasize the sexual part of our being Gay males at the expense of developing social, cultural and group contacts between us?”&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you raise a very interesting question, and I agree the evidence supports this very much. </p>

<p>My initial theory would be, &quot;because that&#39;s how most Americans were introduced to the gay community in the 70&#39;s &amp; 80&#39;s&quot;. Explanation:</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the vast majority of homosexuals in prior eras were closeted, many of them in heterosexual marriages. But once the early protests and &quot;out&quot; communities like SF &amp; NY were covered by camera crews, that&#39;s who Americans saw. That &quot;Village People&quot; culture became an over-generalized identifier probably. Therefore, present day: it&#39;s easier for media (and their ratings) to give exposure to stereotypical parades and reality shows that highlight what viewers identify with. </p>

<p>My anecdotal evidence doesn&#39;t support the stereotype though. In college when straight people like me lived for the chase it seemed, I never really saw that in gay friends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has always been the case, though married heterosexuals generally test as the most sexually active folks. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a bisexual female and I really don&#39;t verbalize it much. I certainly don&#39;t online date. I get shitty requests for threesomes or gross fetishes. I&#39;ve had one partner in the last 3+ years and been abstinent for 7 months. My queer friends and I were just making jokes about the &quot;gay agenda&quot; and when we should expect our stipend checks... </p>

<p>I think hyper-sexual allegations help to push the &quot;perversion&quot; or &quot;mental illness&quot; angle. Personally, this culture is way too obsessed with sex in general and there&#39;s a dehumanizing trend that sexual activity is a measure of success or happiness. Tinder terrifies me. Craigslist and OkCupid were when I decided to stop looking to the internet for dates. I did meet a very amazing guy on Yahoo Chat in the early 2000s, but now people wanna do this weird combination of voyeurism and like, ordering a mate like a  pizza delivery... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The choice of sex act or the matter of their sexual organs is the very reason that they&#39;re seen as different at all.  It&#39;s &#39;about&#39; sex so therefore that&#39;s the thing which is going to be in mind at some level whenever LGBT is mentioned anywhere.  Non-gay clubs, although filled with people wanting to fuck, are not overtly <strong>about</strong> sexuality, whereas the very reason a gay club exists as &#39;separate&#39; is because it&#39;s for people of a certain sexaulity to do their thing. I think that provides the illusion that they&#39;re all &#39;overly sexual&#39; in that context - because sexuality is the theme of the venue to an extent.  Loads of gay folks will just be in there for a drink and a chat somewhere that they feel comfortable of course, just like hetrosexual friends all gather for non-sexual reasons at places but because of the very theme I think it gives the idea that their overly sexual or something.   I&#39;m not explaining this well am I? Does anybody understand what I mean and can explain better?
Personally I think there might also be a hangover from old values in that the very fact that it&#39;s not &#39;the norm&#39; kind of makes people view it as some kind of a superflous extra need.  Almost as if a gay man is subconciously perceived as some sex obsessed hetro who&#39;s so sexual and needs are so uncontrolable that they&#39;ll even sleep with men.  I could be talking shit though of course.  </p>
