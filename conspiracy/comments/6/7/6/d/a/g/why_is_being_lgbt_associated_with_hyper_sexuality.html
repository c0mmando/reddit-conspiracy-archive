       From what I have noticed, more and more being LGBT is becoming associated with hyper sexuality, usually through Hollywood, pop culture, media or far left ideology. My question is, why? It doesn't do anything good for LGBT people, and just makes them look like hypersexualized freaks. Maybe I am looking into this to much, but I can't see how anyone benefits.

       From my experience I haven't really met many LGBT people who are perverted, they were normal people but they were just attracted to the same sex or had gender dysphoria and sought treatment for it. Kind of why I asked the question because it doesn't make sense to me to associate hyper sexualization with being LGBT.

       It is a perversion/sexual preference. Having "gender dysphoria" is a mental illness on par with Dissociative personality disorder or schizophrenia.

       No offense but you don't seem well versed on LGBT people. Gender dysphoria is a mental illness and it has a medical treatment (transitioning genders) it is no where near as harmful as schizophrenia, many transgender people can function and live a normal life, even before transition. They are certainly not a threat to other people, as can be the case with schizophrenia.

       No, you seem not to be and are projecting that ignorance on me. As for what you said about schizophrenia, just goes to show how ignorant you are of them. Plenty of them live a fully functional life and are no threat to themselves or others.

       Transgenders on the other  hand are highly likely to commit suicide post-transformation. Why you may ask? Because they are not getting the help to get to the root of the cause, they are merely addressing a symptom. Here, listen to a "former" transgender who got the surgery to be a woman lived the life and is now a male (and an anti-transgender activist):

       You're associating the treatment for gender dysphoria, with a disease that is commonly associated with people who are unsafe to be around and cant normally function. You're associating gender, with a disease that can cause hallucinations and cognitive dysfunction, and then you call me ignorant. I am aware there are those with the disease who can function when medicated. Stop trying to claim some moral high ground, its disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have a source for transgender people committing suicide at the same rate post transition that they did pre transition? I'd like to also point out, you showing me one person who transitioned, then realized they made the wrong choice is not evidence that transitioning does not solve the problem, infect its only evidence that this one person did not make the right call.

       Fair enough, I shouldn't of assumed you were ignorant on the subject, that was wrong of me. But I do not think it is a fair comparison to associate transitioning or gender dysphoria with schizophrenia.

       You're missing another thing that I said, which is Dissociative identity disorder. Also, my guess is that you did not watch the video link I linked, discussing this topic coming from an actual "transgender" person, himself and how once he got the mental help, he realized it was mental thing and the surgery was of no help. It's a mental thing that needs to be addressed, and it cannot be addressed by mutilating your body. Hence, why Johns Hopkins stop performing it. It goes against the Hippocratic oath. It does more harm than good...

       Sigh, you didn't read my comment then, it didn't work for one person, but it has worked for a lot of people. Why do you conveniently leave out the people it does work for, and use this one case that suits your narrative and then generalize it over all transgender people?

       Are you intentionally being daft? Sure, it could work for some but that does not negate the fact that they have a mental disorder/illness. It's like saying SSRI's help some and the others off themselves. Schizos can and do live normal lives, with treatment, that does not negate the fact that they still have a mental illness. Who the fuck is not reading comments? Me or you?

       Its a mental illness, yes, the treatment a treatment that works for the mental illness is transitioning your gender. I said it was a mental illness several times, It didn't work for one person, that's terrible, he made the wrong choice in a confused part of his life. What are we even arguing for then? It seems we both agree it is a mental illness, there is a treatment for it, it works for some, but not for all. Not all mental illnesses are equal, which is why I got on your case for comparing it to schizophrenia.

       Why do you keep focusing on Schizophrenia? And no, in most cases the surgery does not work, mental therapy on the other hand does work, hence why Johns Hopkins stopped performing the surgeries. Are you even reading my comments?

       Proof it does? This is no different than encouraging a schizophrenic to embrace their alter personality fully. Sure, it could work, but it's not very helpful to that person, in the long run. All it would take is one trigger and that person can be sent off the deep end...

       You're claiming it doesn't, I'm operating under the assumption transition does work because it is the most used treatment. You're claiming it doesn't work so you should provide proof. Once again you keep comparing changing your gender......with schizophrenia. That's a fallacy.

       You're saying it does without any proof, I'm saying it doesn't based on statistics of transgender suicide rates. Who is providing the fallacy here? The stats are openly available... Methinks, you need to research the stats (ie. facts). Come talk to me, once you have. I would also encourage you to not self project on ME. It will not work.

       I'm operating under an appeal to authority, saying it must be true because it is widely accepted to be a effective treatment, hence why it majority of the time. You're telling me it doesn't work, and saying the post transition suicide rate is greater or higher than pre transition, and then you don't provide proof when asked, and then you ask me to provide proof? You keep bringing up self projection, several times now, are you sure that isn't you?

       The source you sent me seems biased. Descrimination isn't a fair argument because they're mentally ill, all mental illnesses are not equal as I will keep saying. It's a very broad term, just because you're mentally ill doesn't mean discrimination isn't a factor in suicide...... 
Then they claim that another reason the suicide because discrimination is false because other groups experience discrimination, and that black suicide rate should be higher than whites because they perceive discrimination to be higher than whites, even though white suicide rate is higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       severity of discrimination are what matter, from who and why, and not perceived discrimination but actual discrimination. For example it would be much more emotionally toiling to have your own father or mother treat you badly because you're transgender, then to perceive a cop is biased towards you because you're black. I think white male suicide rate is so high because in the west we live in a culture of white guilt and self loathing, from my experience at least.

       We can agree to disagree I suppose, I also want people to be helped. I'm completely okay with us looking over why people commit suicide for being transgender, and that if it doesn't work for all or even almost all people, then we should find other ways to help them, but to those that it does help, we should help them with transition. I think we can both agree on that?

       There are probably other hospitals that don't as well. 
The demand is low, this is a tiny population. I looked  up that Johns Hopkins claim they do provide hormone therapy support and recommend surgeons.

       Why are you so stressed about it? It has been around for decades. That tennis player way back in the 50ss was our first transgender in a nation that was socially more conservative and there was less hysteria. Christine Jorgensen.

       Because I care about people? Like serious? These people need help, not to be shunned nor encouraged, but to be helped. I have empathy, people who encourage them do not. They have false empathy, but in the long run do more damage than good. Typical "progressive" mentality. Would you encourage a pedophile? Would you tell them it was "normal" just so their "fee fees" were not hurt? If you say: "Yes". Well, you're the problem and you will reap what you sow...

       No, not really. I would like an open and honest discussion, and not a nefarious echo chamber. They are crying out for help, and no one wants to help/listen to them. I sympathize with them. Because I was in a similar place, albeit a bit different. Enabling is the wrong approach.

       After reviewing your discussion with GoddessWins and our own discussion and how you wouldn't answer the question, asking if you were okay with people transitioning who it worked for, and finding other methods to help those it did not. And then comparing Transitioning to schizophrenia and then even pedophilia, I do not think you care at all for trans people but just want an excuse to stop people from transitioning while cloaking yourself in moral superiority by claiming you want to help them.

       "who are you"
I mean your the one comparing people to those who on average end up raping little kids and scarring them for life who the fuck do you think you are comparing people you want to 'help' to people like that ya little bitch people that act like you really need to take their own advice, and look in a fucking mirror so I'd like you go to ask yourself that go ask yourself 10 times in a mirror "Did I just compare people who have a mental issue that doesn't let them feel right with looking at themselves, to people that on average rape innocent children, and then say I wanted to help them. Damn I'm such a good person for wanting to help." If you can say that last bit without feeling like a fucking asshole then I know two things you've never met a transgender person in your life, and you bud have some major issues that you should probably go talk to someone about hf thinking about that one to yourself.

       "The striking thing is that many gay leaders in the 1970s predicted that the sexual revolution spurred by the Stonewall uprising might lead to a world where gay men interacted solely based on their sexual interest and thus forfeit any opportunity for meaningful connections. Leaders within the gay community, such as Craig Rodwell, understood the need to establish alternative spaces, beyond bars and bathhouses, for gay men to congregate. As Rodwell once explained, “Sex is damned important to everyone, hetero, or Gay. But the question we should be asking is, do we overemphasize the sexual part of our being Gay males at the expense of developing social, cultural and group contacts between us?”"

       I think you raise a very interesting question, and I agree the evidence supports this very much.
      </p>
      <p>
       My initial theory would be, "because that's how most Americans were introduced to the gay community in the 70's &amp; 80's". Explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       Undoubtedly the vast majority of homosexuals in prior eras were closeted, many of them in heterosexual marriages. But once the early protests and "out" communities like SF &amp; NY were covered by camera crews, that's who Americans saw. That "Village People" culture became an over-generalized identifier probably. Therefore, present day: it's easier for media (and their ratings) to give exposure to stereotypical parades and reality shows that highlight what viewers identify with.
      </p>
      <p>
       My anecdotal evidence doesn't support the stereotype though. In college when straight people like me lived for the chase it seemed, I never really saw that in gay friends.

       This has always been the case, though married heterosexuals generally test as the most sexually active folks.

       I'm a bisexual female and I really don't verbalize it much. I certainly don't online date. I get shitty requests for threesomes or gross fetishes. I've had one partner in the last 3+ years and been abstinent for 7 months. My queer friends and I were just making jokes about the "gay agenda" and when we should expect our stipend checks...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think hyper-sexual allegations help to push the "perversion" or "mental illness" angle. Personally, this culture is way too obsessed with sex in general and there's a dehumanizing trend that sexual activity is a measure of success or happiness. Tinder terrifies me. Craigslist and OkCupid were when I decided to stop looking to the internet for dates. I did meet a very amazing guy on Yahoo Chat in the early 2000s, but now people wanna do this weird combination of voyeurism and like, ordering a mate like a  pizza delivery...

       I'm a bisexual woman so I can see both sides of things (hetero and gay) and honestly ALL culture is way too hypersexualized. Everything encourages promiscuity from an early age. Look at rap culture and how sexualized it is.

       my question is what's wrong with hypersexuality? humans are sexual creatures. It feels pretty natural to me to want sex in whatever ways that you want it. Idk. I think we place too much importance on actual sexuality and gender and all that, better there's nothing wrong with being hypersexual.

       When your sexuality is repressed by society from most of your life, it feels liberating to go a bit overboard when you're finally out.

       The choice of sex act or the matter of their sexual organs is the very reason that they're seen as different at all.  It's 'about' sex so therefore that's the thing which is going to be in mind at some level whenever LGBT is mentioned anywhere.  Non-gay clubs, although filled with people wanting to fuck, are not overtly
       <strong>
        about
       </strong>
       sexuality, whereas the very reason a gay club exists as 'separate' is because it's for people of a certain sexaulity to do their thing. I think that provides the illusion that they're all 'overly sexual' in that context - because sexuality is the theme of the venue to an extent.  Loads of gay folks will just be in there for a drink and a chat somewhere that they feel comfortable of course, just like hetrosexual friends all gather for non-sexual reasons at places but because of the very theme I think it gives the idea that their overly sexual or something.   I'm not explaining this well am I? Does anybody understand what I mean and can explain better?
Personally I think there might also be a hangover from old values in that the very fact that it's not 'the norm' kind of makes people view it as some kind of a superflous extra need.  Almost as if a gay man is subconciously perceived as some sex obsessed hetro who's so sexual and needs are so uncontrolable that they'll even sleep with men.  I could be talking shit though of course.

       There are probably other hospitals that don't as well. 
The demand is low, this is a tiny population. I looked  up that Johns Hopkins claim they do provide hormone therapy support and recommend surgeons.

       Why are you so stressed about it? It has been around for decades. That tennis player way back in the 50ss was our first transgender in a nation that was socially more conservative and there was less hysteria. Christine Jorgensen.

       No, not really. I would like an open and honest discussion, and not a nefarious echo chamber. They are crying out for help, and no one wants to help/listen to them. I sympathize with them. Because I was in a similar place, albeit a bit different. Enabling is the wrong approach.
