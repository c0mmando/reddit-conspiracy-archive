What&#39;s going to happen once we deal with these 3rd world nations who have been on &quot;the list&quot; for awhile?  Who will be the new enemy?  What does it mean for the global chess game once nations like korea (a united Korea?) and Syria are western backed.  Who&#39;s left?  Iran Russia or China (would we ever really go to war with them?).  Since Terrorism is currently the enemy still im sure we&#39;ll be fighting them for awhile but </p>

<p>whats next after we deal with third world nations  who may soon be on our side?</p>

<p>just seems kinda new world ordery.</p>

<p>That would require resources beyond my grasp. I just hope that my current location is at a &#39;ground zero&#39; spot (ie right under the explosion point of a nuclear blast). In that case prepping won&#39;t be necessary. But, no, I haven&#39;t. </p>

Absolutely, but they are elites and I would propose, low level. Who are the real bankers? You say &quot;Jews&quot;, you do not know history. Modern banking came from Venice (ie. Romans). All roads lead to Rome. Israel exists, because Rome wants it to, now, the question is... Why? Methinks this dates back to what the &quot;Jew&quot; stole from the Pharaoh of Egypt (old priest class), and what did the Templars find?.. Truth is stranger than fiction....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I think it&#39;s a coordinated effort to drown out what I talk about. I can talk about Jews all I want (and get upvoted), as soon as I bring up the Holy Roman Empire, I get brigaded (and downvoted to hell - tides are changing, though - because I&#39;m persistent as fuck). Why? Things that make you go hmmm... </p>

<p>Certain &quot;Jews&quot; are working with Rome, to hide this. It&#39;s mutual interest. The Vatican hides in plain sight, while many blame the &quot;Jews&quot;. This is on purpose, imo. Smoke and mirrors. I believe the Templars are not &quot;hated&quot; by the Vatican nor have they ever been, but work together and smoke screened the world into thinking they were at odds. They are not, imo... There is a reason Switzerland was Created by Templars, and why the Pope has a Swiss guard... People need to dig deeper...</p>

<p>Absolutely. Most modern religions believe in a messiah figure coming to take the world and humanity into a process of rebirth or change, and most believe the time of return/arrival is near...and some even actively try to trigger that return/arrival...regardless of what they have to do. Mix that with plenty of history of human sacrifice to appease the gods and having many of these types of people in positions of authority, and things can look pretty grim.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically speaking, neither Syria or North Korea is a &quot;Third World&quot; nation.</p>

<p>That term refers to the &quot;Three Worlds&quot; that existed in the Cold War era - The &quot;First World&quot; was comprised of the nations allied to the US. The &quot;Second World&quot; was comprised of the nations allied to the USSR, and the &quot;Third World&quot; was comprised of the remaining &quot;unaligned&quot; nations.</p>

<p>Both Syria and North Korea were and (at least in the case of Syria) are allied to Russia.</p>

<p>Starting a war with Syria is all but guaranteed to result in a war against Russia. North Korea may be a different matter. Russia may be willing to sit out a war against North Korea this time around.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe not.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also being very silly to assume the US can actually defeat Syria or North Korea - especially North Korea.</p>

<p>The US had trouble in Iraq, and has all but lost in Afghanistan - they really haven&#39;t got a hope in North Korea, where the entire population has been essentially training for a war against the US.</p>

<p>An invasion of North Korea might be the stupidest thing the US has done since Vietnam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They hammer on the narrative, Trump does missile strike, all goes silent, then Tillerson says a few things that make it sound like a longer process, then up comes the Russians again. Then Tillerson and Mattis both come out hard on Iran, then it goes quiet. That kinda nudging.</p>
