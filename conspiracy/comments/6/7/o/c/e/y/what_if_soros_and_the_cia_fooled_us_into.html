       Project Gotham is a 3 week long nationwide drill(April 18th to May 5th)
      </p>
      <p>
       On April 18th thru May 5th, 2017, state, local, and federal organizations alike are planning for Operation Gotham Shield 2017 — a major nuclear detonation drill in the New York-New Jersey area, along with the U.S.-Canadian border. During this exercise, 4 nuclear devices, 2 of which are rendered “safe” during the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Vital Archer Exercise, and one successful 10kt detonation in the NYC/NJ area, along with one smaller detonation on the U.S./Canadian border are to take place.
Among the organizations involved are:
– U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
– U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)
– U.S. Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)
– U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
– U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
– U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM)
– State of New Jersey Office of Emergency Management
– State of New York Office of Emergency Management
– City of New York Office of Emergency Management

       You'd think people would care about the president and his huge SJW personality. Crying about SNL, saying Pence needed a safe space, crying about the war on christmas, crying about people not standing for the pledge, crying about the media quoting him, being a hypocrite and doing everything he said was bad about Obama like golfing more and spending more on travel.

       Do you believe anything's going to happen? If so, who convinced you? If nothing happens, stop paying attention to those people.

       That's how reputation and credibility works and the conspiracy community needs to exercise it more often, imo.

       OP is over-estimating the Cabal's threat level assessment of the conspiracy research crowd. More than likely this is further preparation for an event that is yet to happen, a recognition of fact - that the Executive is fully incompetent and unable to provide leadership in a time of crisis. Even government agencies realize they are on their own out here, so they are acting accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least, that's the best case outcome of all the movements and events today.

       I will never understand how people will go out and say that "the Executive is fully incompetent and unable to provide leadership in a time of crisis". What exactly about the current Executive makes him so much more incompetent than say, Obama? If anything the Executive has had way more leadership experience in a time of crisis, at least from a business standpoint, than a "community organizer" and "freshman senator" from Chicago. I mean at the very least, the current Executive had navigated his business through at least two real estate bubbles popping and the dotcom crash. You can't be serious if you use the "he doesn't talk Presidential enough"

       The current executive would have objectively made more money had he simply earned interest on the lump sum. Fact.

      <p>
       More importantly, you immediately took my statement to mean TRUMP, when what I said was THE EXECUTIVE. As in, the branch of government.

       As in, The Executive holds no actual power and is a PR branch meant to distract the electorate/tax base from the actual machinations of the Deep State.

       Claiming that he could have made more money investing his inheritance is moot here, since i was talking about leadership in a time of crisis, that argument literally means nothing in this context. But I will take your last sentence as what you actually meant, however I don't fully buy that line of thinking.

       No you brought up an argument about his wealth, which has nothing to do with him (mostly) successfully navigating his real estate business through two real estate bubbles and the dotcom boom. Therefore, my point is, he is not as incompetent in a time of crisis as someone who had limited life experience compared to his. I'm not the biggest fan of the guy, I can get behind some of his policy ideas better than those of Obama but he isn't the savior. The memes are great though.

       You'd think people would care about the president and his huge SJW personality. Crying about SNL, saying Pence needed a safe space, crying about the war on christmas, crying about people not standing for the pledge, crying about the media quoting him, being a hypocrite and doing everything he said was bad about Obama like golfing more and spending more on travel.
