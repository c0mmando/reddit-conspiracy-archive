        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Albert Pike, the Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891, is one of the most honored and influential Freemasons of all time. The Supreme Council exalts Pike by saying:</p>

<p>&quot;Albert Pike remains today an inspiration for Masons everywhere. His great book Morals and Dogma endures as the most complete exposition of Scottish Rite philosophy. He will always be remembered and revered as the Master Builder of the Scottish Rite.&quot; (The House of the Temple of the Supreme Council, 1988) </p>

<p>Pike&#39;s book &#39;Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry&quot; is one of the most authoritative works on Freemasonry.</p>

<p>In Morals and Dogma, Pike admits that the source of Freemasonry&#39;s doctrines ultimately goes back to the Kabbalah, a Jewish book of occult knowledge:</p>

<p><em>&quot;All truly dogmatic religions have issued from the Kabalah and return to it; everything scientific and grand in the religious dreams of all the Illuminati, Jacob Boeheme, Swedenborg, Saint Martin, and others, is borrowed from the Kabalah: all Masonic associations owe to it their Secrets and their Symbols.&quot;</em> (Morals and Dogma, p 744)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was researching a bit of freemasonry the other day due to some strange pizzagate findings, when I found these occult brotherhoods and &quot;the Illuminati&quot; on Wikipedia (I also realize Wikipedia has &quot;editors&quot; rather than being truly open source, but this is interesting nonetheless):</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternitas_Saturni">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternitas_Saturni</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminates_of_Thanateros">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminates_of_Thanateros</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4</a></p>

<p>A∴A∴ and U∴D∴ (what are these?)</p>

<p>I found a lot of symbolism in the pizzagate stuff. It makes sense because:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Modern Freemasons use the tools, traditions and terminology of those earlier stonemasons as allegories for building temples in the hearts of men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And wrote I this bit of speculation:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/67bjg2/we_all_know_that_james_alefantis_equates_to_jaime/dgpe6k9/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/67bjg2/we_all_know_that_james_alefantis_equates_to_jaime/dgpe6k9/</a></p>

<p>Some of those Wikipedia links also mention the Qabala / Kabbalah.</p>

<p>Fun fact:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A cabal is a secret plot, or a small group of people who create such a plot. Some conspiracy theories are based on the idea that governments worldwide are in the hands of a powerful cabal. <strong>Cabal comes from the word cabbala (also spelled kabbala), which refers to a Jewish tradition of interpreting texts</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Saturni are freemasons, as are the Illuminati. Different orders within freemasonry I guess. And at the very core of this stuff is Austrian/German &quot;magic&quot; and occult rituals. Hitler wanted these guys out, the Nazis didn&#39;t like them. I think it&#39;s all intertwined; we&#39;ve been in a holy war for centuries. Check out this tidbit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nazis claimed that high-degree Masons were willing members of the Jewish conspiracy and that Freemasonry was one of the causes of Germany&#39;s defeat in World War I.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should also know that Justice Antonin Scalia was in an order too, Order of St. Hubertus which began at the Bohemian Club.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freemasonry and the Illuminati are tied at the hip.  When you boil it all down, both are essentially SATANIC cults.  Albert Pike also admitted that the secret god of Freemasonry is Lucifer.  Both of these secret societies (and many other related ones) are working to advance the &quot;New World Order&quot; (globalist) agenda.</p>

<p>And they were created and are being led by ethnic jews, and based in the doctrines of Judaism.  And the religion of Judaism is Satanism, as the Messiah himself said many times -- calling them &quot;of their father the devil&quot; (John 8:44), &quot;children of hell&quot; (Matthew 23:15), and a &quot;synagogue of Satan&quot; (Revelation 2:9).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah check out the speculation thread I linked!</p>

<p>The creepiest thing I found was the photo @mypizzabrain posted on their Instagram, which looked like a painting of a monster eating a slice of pizza. Turns out the original artwork is the god Saturn, eating his child. Saturn is aka Kronos in Greek mythology. Also depicted in artwork eating his child.</p>

<p>So we have one pizza place alluding to twisted Roman mythology in more than one photo.</p>

<p>We have another pizza place alluding to twisted Greek mythology in more than one photo.</p>

<p>But what is the common denominator? Pizza. Freemasonry?</p>

<p>Another correlation I found was with FBI anon&#39;s mention of &quot;cards&quot; as a clue. Some took this to mean a painting &quot;The Card Players&quot; which Qatar purchased for $250,000,000.</p>

<p>But as I&#39;ve been reading about freemasonry I think &quot;cards&quot; is a reference to the &quot;dues cards&quot; that freemasons pass around:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Historically, Freemasons used various signs (hand gestures), grips or &quot;tokens&quot; (handshakes), and passwords to identify legitimate Masonic visitors from non-Masons who might wish to gain admission to meetings. These signs, grips, and passwords have been exposed multiple times; today Freemasons use dues cards and other forms of written identification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the John Podesta email:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In top front pouch of my backpack there are a stack of cards
Pull out two Sotheby&#39;s cards. 4 free admissions to Whitney</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/28894">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/28894</a></p>

<p>What&#39;s he doing with a <em>stack</em> of cards with freebies hmmm? Sounds like dues cards.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take this a bit further. In another Podesta email I remember someone saying he left a handkerchief that looks pizza related (white w/ black):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you&#39;re busy, so feel free not to respond if it&#39;s not yours or you don&#39;t want it.</p>

<p>I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island.
Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795</a></p>

<p>Some took this as &quot;handkerchief code&quot; from the gay community, which symbolizes their sexual preferences. I also thought that was plausible. However, I have come to realize white with black checker is also freemason symbol:</p>

<p><a href="http://img.webme.com/pic/a/agendaglobal/35.jpg">http://img.webme.com/pic/a/agendaglobal/35.jpg</a></p>

<p>John Podesta was taking favors from freemasons. He is one. He attended the spirit cooking dinner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The A∴A∴ is an acronym for Astron Argon, or alternately the Argentium Astrum, the Greek and Latin translations of the true name of the Order, it&#39;s inner (third and highest-tier) order to be precise: the Order of the Silver Star. It is an order founded by Aleister Crowley based upon the foundation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and his founding of the syncretic esoteric religion of Thelema, among other currents and lineages, one of the numerous orders occasionally referred to as &#39;Illuminati&#39;, which openly practices a form of Illuminism no less, and one I am quite familiar with having studied a good portion of its curriculum in depth over the years.</p>

<p>By U∴D∴ I presume you mean G∴D∴, representing the Golden Dawn, the name of the second order within the A∴A∴, named after its predecessor and chief influence, the original Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. There are various other Golden Dawn orders currently in existence, most of them impostors, with the exception of a handful of esoteric or &#39;hidden&#39; Golden Dawn orders which are still active. </p>

<p>To elaborate on the esoteric lineage of the original Golden Dawn and its relation to Hermetic Qabalah, as well a Frankist-Sabbatean influence, among others, I will quote myself from <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/comments/5y7htj/the_sabbatian_qabalah_and_its_relation_to_the/">another thread</a> (you will likely find of interest):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for the Golden Dawn, it&#39;s also worth noting it was and remains a syncretic amalgamation of various practices originating from a variety of currents and lineages of esotericism, not solely or perhaps even primarily that of Sabbatean or Lurianic Kabbalah, which would be but one among many that have contributed to its ritual and curriculum, in addition to the following: </p>

<p>Rosicrucianism, Hermeticism, Hermetic Qabalah, Alchemy, Freemasonry, Kemetic / Egyptian Mysteries, Greek Mysteries, Neoplatonism, Theurgy, the Tarot and Enochian magic, among others.</p>

<p>The source of the Sabbatean current would have arisen from one of its concurrent and direct predecessors, the  L’Aurore Naissante (or “Nascent Dawn”), a Rosicrucian lodge descended from the Fratres Lucis (in turn descended from the Gold und Rosenkreutz Orden), which was one of the few lodges at the time to allow Jewish initiates, who by nature of joining such a lodge would have been drawn toward mysticism in general, and due to their heritage would have explored the Kabbalah. Some of those deeply involved with the L’Aurore Naissante lodge were also known to have Sabbatean leanings, hence the influence of that current on the subsequent Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.</p>

<p>A basic overview of the Golden Dawn&#39;s lineage(s):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fratres Rosae Crucis of German (ca. 1450) -&gt; the Fraternitate Rosæ et Aureæ Crucis (R. et A.C.) (1580 or 1517) -&gt; Orden des Gülden und Rosen-Creutzes (1710) -&gt; Gold und Rosenkreutz Orden (1757, 1767 &amp; 1777) -&gt; Asiatic Brethren / Fratres Lucis (“Brotherhood of Light” or “Illuminati”) (1780) -&gt;  L’Aurore Naissante (or “the Nascent Dawn”) / Loge zur aufgehenden Morgenrothe (“Lodge of the Rising Dawn”) (1807) -&gt; Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (1888) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fratres Rosae Crucis of Germany (ca. 1450) -&gt;  the Fraternitate Rosæ et Aureæ Crucis (R. et A.C.) (1580 or 1517) -&gt; Orden des Gülden und Rosen-Creutzes (1710) -&gt; Gold und Rosenkreutz Orden (1757, 1767 &amp; 1777) -&gt; S.R.I.A / Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (1865) -&gt; Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (1888) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The original Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn&#39;s founding members and grade structure were largely derived from the S.R.I.A., while the bulk of their ritual and curriculum was derived from the enigmatic &#39;Cypher Manuscripts&#39; and eventually &#39;Flying Roll&#39; documents of the R.R. et A.C., presumably originating from the &#39;Secret Chiefs&#39; of the L’Aurore Naissante, if not another more secretive order.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the Fraternitas Saturni, that would be a Luciferian secret society and initiatory order based in Germany, also based in part on Thelema and Rosicrucianism, incorporated with vague elements of Freemasonry (primarily in its degree structure), similar in some ways to the A∴A∴ and its counterpart the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis), however with an emphasis on Saturn as a metaphor for Lucifer and Illumination, as well an emphasis on the astrological aspects of Saturn over Hermetic Qabalah, which would be more prevalent in the aforementioned orders. </p>

<p>The relation that these orders have to Freemasonry is tenuous, at best. To elucidate on that point, I will again reiterate another prior comment of mine from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/comments/64w6ap/aleister_crowley_my_relations_with_freemasonry/">another related thread</a>, regarding Aleister Crowley and his involvement with Freemasonry:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would like to point out the hypocrisy of some Masons who claim he (Crowley) was never a Freemason. It is true he was primarily involved with pan-masonic fraternities and related esoteric orders, more occult-oriented than conventional Masony, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Ordo Templi Orientis for example. That being as it may he was no less &#39;raised&#39; or initiated into various irregular Masonic lodges in his time, one of which later officially recognized by a conventional Masonic grand lodge. He was in some ways moreso deeply involved in a clandestine form of Masonry, one more esoteric and occult-oriented than regular Masonry as well, the Egyptian Rite, or Rite of Memphis-Misraim, with at the time around 97 degrees. As his memoir points out he was however largely unsatisfied with the result of his Masonic experience, and while embracing certain elements of Masonry, many of which already found in the other orders he was actively working with, had largely distanced himself from conventional Masonic activity by the end of his life.</p>

<p>To clarify further:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before proceeding, we need to take an aside into the arcane nomenclature of Masonic usage. Three terms that need to be defined are “irregular,” “clandestine,” and “unrecognized.” These terms are often used interchangeably in Masonic parlance, but in fact have different if sometimes overlapping meanings. “Irregular” is a term that applies to Lodges working degrees without maintaining obedience to the so-called ancient or antient Landmarks. These vary slightly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in some particulars, but there are essentials that, if departed from, will cause derecognition by many other Grand Lodges and their dependent jurisdictions. Chief among these are the acknowledgement of faith in a Supreme Being, the placement upon the altar and the taking of oaths upon a Sacred Law (usually the Bible, but now almost any text the initiate affirms as sacred to himself), and the prohibition against making women Masons. Two of these points were at the heart of Masonry’s problems with Ordo Templi Orientis in the early part of the 20th century and led Crowley to his Oasis revisions now in use, that removed most overt Masonic symbolism from the first three degrees of O.T.O. The second term is “unrecognized,” and as can be seen from the previous definition irregularity can lead to derecognition and hence the terms are often confused. Each Grand Lodge and its jurisdictions recognizes various other Grand Lodges and their dependent bodies throughout the world, for the purposes of visitation and also transfer of standing when a Mason moves from one jurisdiction to another. This and the process by which it is determined are enshrined in a jurisdictions Masonic code; it varies from time to time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and as we will see is at the heart of the question of the regularity of Aleister Crowley’s initiation and membership in Freemasonry. The third term is “clandestine” and refers to Masons working without proper charter from the presiding Grand Lodge of their jurisdiction. This can be a relative matter, but essentially refers to irregular bodies working across jurisdictions and initiating those who would not normally be initiated into a regular Blue Lodge. CoMasons often fall under this classification, Prince Hall Masons were until recently and in some jurisdictions still are considered such, Universal Masonry as practiced by McBlain Thomson is the historically infamous example and as we shall see relevant to our tale of Crowley’s status.</p>

<p>Crowley had already been initiated into an irregular from of Scottish Rite Masonry in Mexico City in 1900 and this ultimately led to contact with Yarker and his plethora of high degree systems. This included both the systems of Memphis and Mizraim and the Antient and Primitive Rites. Details of this can be found in Crowley’s own //Confessions// and in Martin Starr’s aforementioned article. This is turn led to his contact with Theodore Reuss and the O.T.O. which, as history has shown, had a profound affect and was among the most important moves in Crowley’s life. Reuss was associated with the degree monger McBlain Thomson, which led Crowley to contact with Spenser Lewis of AMORC among others. Crowley eventually distanced himself from Thomson and purged O.T.O. to a great degree of its infringements on regular Masonry, but the stigma was attached and the charges rightly and wrongly of his activities as a clandestine Mason still haunt his memory.</p>

<p>During World War I the condition changed drastically with regard to U.S. Grand Lodges’ recognition of Freemasonry in France. In a flurry of patriotic fervor many U.S. Grand Lodges recognized, either fully or for the purposes of visitation one or both of the aforementioned principal Grand Lodges of France. Because Masons in the United States did not want to be put into the position of working clandestinely in France and also wanted the benefit of visitation for American troops fighting in France, 23 U.S. Grand Lodges recognized the Grand Lodge du France for the duration of the War, and many for greater of lesser periods long after the conflict was over. Some fewer number also recognized the Grand Orient of France.</p>

<p>When this recognition occurred Crowley’s previous initiation would have become official and fully recognized by any U.S. Grand Lodge that recognized the Grand Lodge du France, its dependent bodies and membership. Some question this retroactive recognition, but it is well established in Masonic Code, for the simple reason that without it a Grand Lodge would be in the absurd position of recognizing Masonic bodies without recognizing any of their members. The precedence is fully established in gradual recognition of Prince Hall Masonry in various jurisdictions in the U.S. Further Crowley’s membership and standing as Freemason would have also been recognized so long as he maintained his membership in his mother lodge. Since this recognition extended into the late 1950s and early 1960s in the various U.S. jurisdictions that recognized the Grand Lodge du France during WWI, Aleister Crowley’s initiation would have been considered regular far past his death in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana , Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. These states represented and still represent the vast majority of Freemasons in the United States.</p>

<p>In 1947 another Grand Lodge was chartered in France under the instigation and guidance of U.G.L.E. It is called the Grand National Lodge of France.9 This Grand Lodge was formed to rectify the recognition and regularity problems that existed with the Grand Orient and Grand Lodge du France. In 1958 a committee of Grand Lodges in the U.S. began meeting to study the recognition problem regarding French Grand Lodges. Their report was read in Grand Sessions of U.S. Grand Lodges in 1964. It recommended that the U.S. Grand Lodges that had recognized the two main Grand Lodges in France, derecognize them and recognize only U.G.L.E.’s surrogate the Grand National Lodge of France. Most did so, but a few like Oregon quietly let their recognition of the Grand Lodge du France quietly lapse, listing only the Grand National Lodge of France but taking no formal action against the Grand Lodge du France. This was to avoid the problem of retroactively making clandestine and irregular work that may have been performed in France during WWI. Interestingly though, Anglo Saxon was among the Lodges that became affiliated with the new Grand National Lodge of France, now as Anglo Saxon #103. All U.S. jurisdictions now recognize the Grand National Lodge, its dependent bodies including Anglo Saxon #103 and thus ipso facto recognize Aleister Crowley’s initiation and membership in Freemasonry.</p>

<p>The United Grand Lodge of England, on the other hand, has a committee that judges whether a person was ever a Freemason whenever there is a question of legitimacy. They have deemed Aleister Crowley not to be a Mason based on their judgement of his “character” in spite of the fact that they now recognize the Lodge into which he was initiated, whereas they recognize Mozart as a Freemason even though the Strict Observance to which Mozart belonged has at no time ever been considered regular by U.G.L.E. Luckily in the U.S. such matters are determined by Masonic code and such problems never arise. If a Grand Lodge is considered regular, the work of its subordinate bodies is considered regular. American Freemason’s can feel confident that with the recognition of the Grand National Lodge of France and its dependent body Anglo Saxon #103, Aleister Crowley’s mother lodge, Crowley’s initiation, passing and raising as Freemason was fully regularized and is technically recognized by Masonic code in every U.S. jurisdictions. Even in Crowley’s time, the vast majority of Freemasons in the U.S. would have considered his initiation regular with the recognition of the Grand Lodge du France, unrecognized until WWI but certainly at no time either clandestine or irregular. Aleister Crowley was for a great part of his life a regular Freemason and his life and work reflect the great lessons taught in Freemasonry. His magick, his work in the Golden Dawn, A∴A∴ and O.T.O., including the Book of the Law reflect Masonic ideas and ideals and his work cannot really be fully understood without the context of Freemasonry.</p>

<p>The Kaballah is just another iteration of a system of mystery religions with very common themes. Oaths to protect the secrets, initiation, use of double-meaning symbols, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that it has nothing to do with Judaism (which forbids idolatry), and that anti-Semitism (attacks on ethnic and religious Jews) are usually pushed by mystery religion followers like Hitler. It&#39;s actually a reversal and corruption of Judaism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people who study this line of thought and actually take it seriously (as it should be) are Christians.  Under this assumption, I remind you of Jesus&#39; words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[<strong>Mark 3:23-26</strong>] And he called them [unto him], and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?<sup>23</sup>  And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.<sup>24</sup>  And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.<sup>25</sup>  And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.<sup>26</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This topic of research does indeed lead back to the root cause of all the things this subreddit searches out.  When you carry all the secret societies back to their occult roots, and those occult groups back to their mystery religion schools, and the mystery schools back to their foundations, you end up discovering the sex-rituals and child sacrifice of the early Canaanite culture, which itself comes from the Babylonian mysteries established by Nimrod and Semiramis.  Then you realize the Bible is the best intel source available on the subject.</p>

<p>Those deep into the Jewish occult side -- Kaballah itself -- claim their beginnings are represented in Scripture, at the base of Mount Sinai when Moses returned from the summit to discover the people worshiping a golden calf [<strong>Gen 32</strong>].</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  At the very root, the NWO agenda is SATANIC.   Satanic doctrines have manifested all down through history -- eg, in Nimrod and Semiramis and Babylonian occultism, etc.  The jews are currently leading the Satanic conspiracy, having picked up Babylonian occultism into their religion -- eg, the Babylonian Talmud.  This is the &quot;Mystery Babylon&quot; of the book of Revelation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100%.  Always good to see a fellow watchman.  God bless you, brother.</p>

<p>It&#39;s often frustrating when I see people get so close to the truth, yet miss the mark altogether.  Like when they can draw the connection between &quot;aliens,&quot; secret societies, and the global elite -- yet completely overlook the demonic nature of each which binds them all together.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with Aleister Crowley&#39;s portrait of Lam?  And of the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/magickal-stories-lam">successive contact with that entity</a>?  My question is: how can anyone come to any other conclusion than the fact that &quot;aliens&quot; are nothing more than demons?</p>

<p>But therein lies the rub, and one powerful indicator that we&#39;re truly in the last days:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>[2 Thes. 2]</strong> <sup>3</sup> Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,<sup>4</sup> who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.<sup>5</sup>  Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?<sup>6</sup>  And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time.<sup>7</sup>  For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way.<sup>8</sup>  And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming.<sup>9</sup>  The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders,<sup>10</sup>  and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.<sup>11</sup>  <strong><em>Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false,<sup>12</sup>  in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I pray this verse alone may be seen by at least one person, and be as a seed planted in their mind.  And that seed may in time, by the pursuit of the Holy Spirit, grow by faith into the salvation of their soul.  It&#39;s all there -- black text on white paper -- the answers to all the questions people here ask on a regular basis.  Time is short, the strong delusion is being sent, and its full manifestation in our generation is inevitable.</p>

<p>Again, God bless you, brother.  Keep up the good work, stay strong in the Spirit, take courage as a watchman on the wall, and may our Lord&#39;s patience be such that all who will come to Him be saved in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your message, brother.  I have seen the info on Crowley and Lam.  And I&#39;m in 100% agreement with you that the &quot;alien&quot; phenomenon is the manifestation of demons or fallen angels.</p>

<p>Just based on our short interaction, I think I am probably in agreement with you on 98-99% of the major issues out there -- ie, NWO agenda, the true nature of the jews, etc.  You have probably done thousands of hours of research on these issues, just as I have. </p>

<p>But I must mention on EXTREMELY important issue that I think we disagree on.   And I don&#39;t cite this to be &quot;argumentative&quot; with you, but only because I see it as my duty to share the truth with you.</p>

<p>Saul of Tarsus (aka &quot;Paul&quot;) is a false prophet and a fake apostle.  There were only 12 true apostles.  Saul was a jewish Pharisee who first overtly persecuted the followers of the Messiah, and then switched tactics to infiltration and subversion from within. </p>

<p>Many of the things he says in his letters are true, but he is a snake who deceives us on many key issues, including the MOST CRITICAL -- which is that we must obey the commandments in order to be saved.  The following is a website I created, with an article going over the main evidence proving this.  I urge you to read it.  And again, this is out of love for a brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, brother -- you clearly seek the Truth with diligence, desire to follow God&#39;s will for you, and love Yeshua Hamashiach as Messiah.  You and I will undoubtedly have time to discuss this on the other side of eternity!  While I do agree that the question of Paul&#39;s authority is quite important to the question of one&#39;s established theology, I do not believe it to be (<em>necessarily</em> and <em>of itself</em>) a question of one&#39;s salvation and personal reconciliation to God the Father.  Salvation comes as a gift of grace by the shed blood of Christ, offered to everyone and accepted by few.  While Paul&#39;s writings certainly influence the interpretation of how one receives, accepts, and retains that gift of salvation, they by no means represent the only instruction on the matter.</p>

<p>While most Christians are likely ill-prepared to discuss this subject, I&#39;ve been fortunate to be a regular listener of <a href="https://www.nowyouseetv.org/">Now You See TV</a> (NYSTV), have become acquainted with the Hebraic Roots movement, and been introduced to the theology of those who follow Torah.  While I do not personally subscribe to the exact same views, I see nothing wrong with it so long as it does not deny the deity, humanity, and sacrifice of Jesus Christ as Messiah, and does not teach 100% faith or 100% works.  And from what I&#39;ve seen, the Hebrew Roots movement doesn&#39;t do any of those things.</p>

<p>I absolutely and graciously appreciate your reply, your blog, and your service in Christ.  As I mentioned, you clearly desire Truth, and like the Bereans, study the scriptures with diligence to determine if what you&#39;ve heard is true or not.  I respect you for that, and respect anyone who has honest questions / concerns with mainline Christian beliefs and follows through with careful study of God&#39;s Word.  And you then don&#39;t keep it to yourself, but you show your service (your actions, deeds, works) to Messiah by reaching out, in love, to correct a bother you perceive to be off the narrow path.  Thank you, my friend -- I wish we had more of this within the Body of Christ.  More accountability, more correction, more truth spoken in love.</p>

<p>All that said, please allow me to respond to your points.  Not in hostile contradiction, but out of my own concern for you (and others who do subscribe to this view), rooted in my strong belief that the whole of God&#39;s Word is inspired by the Holy Spirit, and that in partial rejection lies the danger of partial rejection of God&#39;s Truth.  Please note that I do <em>not</em> claim that my view must be 100% correct, or that yours must be 100% wrong.  In fact, I&#39;ve honestly wondered about this topic myself, before I ever heard of anyone else with the same doubts about Paul.  And indeed, if I&#39;m going to be completely honest with myself, I&#39;m not 100% decided on the matter.  But I do have counterpoints to share:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Saul/Paul taught against keeping the commandments of YHWH, saying that &quot;the law has been abolished&quot; (Ephesians 2:15),</em></p>

<p>Nowhere in his letters or epistles does Paul make the claim that the laws of the covenant have been abolished.  Your reference to <strong>Ephesians 2:15</strong> is not Paul insisting that the law has been abolished:</p>

<p><strong>[Eph 2]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><sup>14</sup> For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility
<sup>15</sup> by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace,
<sup>16</sup> and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Paul says, <em>&quot;by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances,&quot;</em> he is speaking of the power of the <em>ceremonial</em> law -- that &quot;law&quot; which is comprised of the restrictions and limitations imposed by the hypocritical pharisees in how <em>they</em> presume the Laws of The Lord -- as written in the Torah -- are to be followed.  He&#39;s speaking about the arduous burdens that Jesus condemns in <strong>Matthew 23</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>[Mat 23]</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><sup>1</sup> Then Yeshua spoke to the multitudes and to his talmidim,
<sup>2</sup> saying, &quot;The Sofrim and the Perushim sat on Moshe&#39;s seat.
<sup>3</sup> All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but don&#39;t do their works; for they say, and don&#39;t do.
<sup>4</sup> For <strong><em>they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on men&#39;s shoulders;</em></strong> but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the contrary, Paul himself clearly believed in keeping the Laws of the Torah;</p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>* &gt;**[Acts 24:14]** But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the Elohim of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets.
* &gt;**[Acts 25:8]** while he answered for himself, &quot;Neither against the Law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended in anything at all.&quot;
* &gt;**[Acts 18:21]** but took leave of them, saying, &quot;I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, Yahweh willing.&quot; And he sailed from Ephesus.
* &gt;**[Rom 7:25]** I thank Yahweh - through Yahushua the Messiah our Master! So then, with the mind I myself serve the Law of Yahweh, but with the flesh the Law of sin.

that those who sin under the Law will still be judged;

* &gt;**[Rom 2:12-13]** For as many as have sinned without Law will also perish without Law, and as many as have sinned in the Law will be judged by the Law, for not the hearers of the Law are just in the sight of Yahweh, but the ***doers of the Law will be justified;***

that the Law is **not** void through faith in God&#39;s grace in Christ, but rather it becomes possible to *truly* keep;

* &gt;**[Rom 3:31]** Do we then make void the Law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the Law.
* &gt;**[Rom 6:15]** What then? Shall we sin because we are not under Law but under grace? Certainly not! Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one&#39;s slaves whom you obey, whether of sin unto to death, or of obedience unto to righteousness?

and that the continued observance of the Law is good.

* &gt;**[Rom 7:12]** Therefore the Law [is] holy, and the commandment holy and just and good. 
* &gt;**[Rom 7:22]** For I delight in the Law of Yahweh according to the inward man. 

It is abundantly clear to me that not only is it incorrect to state that Paul taught that the law was abolished, but that the exact opposite is true: he affirmed the necessity of the continued observance of it!
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Paul was not one of the true 12 Apostles chosen by the Messiah. Mathias was the replacement for Judas. Yet Paul constantly (falsely) claims to be an “Apostle”...</em></p>

<p>I agree that he wasn&#39;t one of the original 12.  But then again, neither was Mathias -- his &quot;selection&quot; was based on casting lots.  Literally rolling the dice.  If we can take a game of chance as authoritative, then certainly we can believe that Paul was set apart by Yeshua on the road to Damascus?  Regardless, the word &quot;apostle&quot; in the Greek means &quot;messenger.&quot;  Paul always called himself &quot;a messenger of Christ.&quot;</p>

<p>However, in researching my reply to this point, I came across a very concerning point.  In <strong>Rev 2:2</strong>, Christ address the church at Ephesus, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles {ἀπόστολος - <em>apostolos</em>} and are not, and found them to be false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Paul opens his letter to the Ephesians with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paul, an apostle {ἀπόστολος - <em>apostolos</em>} of Jesus Christ by the will of God, To the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point made was that Christ is referring specifically about Paul, and if this is true, then Messiah is calling Paul a liar and not His messenger.  I cannot tell with certainty if this is the case, or if Christ is speaking about others.  We do know that Paul&#39;s letter does attempt to correct the theology of the Ephesians after a number of other &quot;false teachers&quot; had been heard.  I don&#39;t know -- this point requires further research on my part.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose I should halt at this point.  I&#39;ve spent the better part of my day on researching your points.  It&#39;s intriguing!  And has shown me information I&#39;d not previously known.  I still hold to the authority of all scripture; however, I&#39;m now -- as a Berean -- digging deeper, and testing Pauline theology against the books of the Laws, Prophets, and Gospels.  Thank you for your concern for me, brother.  And thank you for challenging me to be diligent in my own study!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your thoughtful and respectful response.  As I indicated in the blog article, the issue of Saul/Paul was something I wrestled with for many years.  I am now 100% confident that he is a false prophet, after hundreds of hours of study and consideration.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to provide a lengthy reply to your points on the scriptures provided.  But I will just say (as I said initially), that Paul says many things that are doctrinally true.  But Paul engages in double speak, or speaking out of both sides of his mouth.  There are places where he says to follow the law, and then places where he says/indicates to NOT follow the law.  </p>

<p>In this world of mass deception, in order to advance in our knowledge of the truth, we all have to be open minded enough to question even our most deeply held beliefs.  That takes humility.  I can see that you have this.</p>

I&#39;ll continue digging, and greatly appreciate your pointing this out.  I&#39;m also happy to receive any further insight or reference you send my way on the topic.</p>

<p>God bless you, brother.  Keep up the good work and diligent study.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are most welcome.  I can sympathize with the fact that it is a difficult subject to wrestle with -- especially because when you are new to it, you wonder &quot;how is it that Christians could be wrong for so long?&quot; and &quot;how is it no one else see this?&quot;.  Granted, it&#39;s a minority of  Christians who question and reject Paul, but it is a significant and growing minority.</p>

<p>If you have any questions in the course of your study, feel free to contact me.  For further good material on the subject, I have some of the best articles I&#39;ve found on the internet linked on my blog (that I sent you yesterday).</p>

<p>Here is one very compelling article that I would highly recommend to you.  It&#39;s short (only ~5 minutes to read), but very powerful, as it just cites the scriptures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, brother.  This topic is indeed incredibly important.  A vast majority of theology in the Church today is based on the Pauline epistles, and Paul&#39;s personal interpretation and presentation of the Gospel.  So far, the evidence I&#39;ve seen dictates there be an open discussion about this <em>in the very least</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve taken the liberty of aggregating all the individual PDFs for that book you linked me too.  The PDF of chapter 12 seems to be missing, so I did my best to format the HTML version to fit the other PDFs.  It&#39;s not perfect, but <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B809EM2jwBNxcFRIaE9zRVAwRms">here&#39;s my best attempt</a>.  Take it, re-host it, share it, etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t really true. The origins of Freemasonry symbolism stem from the Bible, largely the Old Testament. The Kabbalah is based on the Torah. Satanic imagery has its roots in the Bible as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Kaballah is Satanic.  It is a book of occult knowledge and witchcraft.  It only takes bits and pieces from the Old Testament and PERVERTS them.  Same as the Babylonian Talmud.  Judaism is a perversion and corruption of the Old Testament with occultism.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not as simple as that, but yes there is a great deal of Qabalastic and Hermetic influence in these secret societies (among other currents), the majority not being Satanic I would like to point out, though some are certainly Luciferian in nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Three points:</p>

<ol>
<li>There&#39;s absolutely nothing &quot;satanic&quot; about the above. The fact that you throw that word in your subject to prejudice the reader is extremely telling.</li>
<li>What you quoted from M&amp;D is Pike opinion. Many very well-read and well-respected Freemasons disagree with him. Many agree. Some (I might include myself as well) would say that the Kabbalah is just one in the family of introspective and mystical traditions of self-realization. In that you free that Freemasonry is also such a tradition (and many would disagree with even that), you can say that they are related endeavours, but Pike&#39;s bald assertion that they were directly related is entirely without basis, and no more or less &quot;right&quot; than my assertion that Freemasonry derives from the intellectual traditions of the monastic orders of the early to central middle ages.</li>
<li>&quot;Pike&#39;s book &#39;Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry&quot; is one of the most authoritative works on Freemasonry.&quot; -- I would agree with this on principle, but you can easily read that to mean that from M&amp;D an understanding of Freemasonry can be derived, and I think that&#39;s not true. M&amp;D is a lens through which to see Freemasonry, and it&#39;s an exquisite and well-crafted lens, but it&#39;s also very difficult to use and trivial to misinterpret, so I don&#39;t see it as being authoritative in the way that a dictionary is authoritative on English vocabulary.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>100%.  Always good to see a fellow watchman.  God bless you, brother.</p>

<p>It&#39;s often frustrating when I see people get so close to the truth, yet miss the mark altogether.  Like when they can draw the connection between &quot;aliens,&quot; secret societies, and the global elite -- yet completely overlook the demonic nature of each which binds them all together.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with Aleister Crowley&#39;s portrait of Lam?  And of the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/magickal-stories-lam">successive contact with that entity</a>?  My question is: how can anyone come to any other conclusion than the fact that &quot;aliens&quot; are nothing more than demons?</p>

<p>But therein lies the rub, and one powerful indicator that we&#39;re truly in the last days:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>[2 Thes. 2]</strong> <sup>3</sup> Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,<sup>4</sup> who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.<sup>5</sup>  Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?<sup>6</sup>  And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time.<sup>7</sup>  For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way.<sup>8</sup>  And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming.<sup>9</sup>  The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders,<sup>10</sup>  and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.<sup>11</sup>  <strong><em>Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false,<sup>12</sup>  in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I pray this verse alone may be seen by at least one person, and be as a seed planted in their mind.  And that seed may in time, by the pursuit of the Holy Spirit, grow by faith into the salvation of their soul.  It&#39;s all there -- black text on white paper -- the answers to all the questions people here ask on a regular basis.  Time is short, the strong delusion is being sent, and its full manifestation in our generation is inevitable.</p>

<p>Again, God bless you, brother.  Keep up the good work, stay strong in the Spirit, take courage as a watchman on the wall, and may our Lord&#39;s patience be such that all who will come to Him be saved in time.</p>
