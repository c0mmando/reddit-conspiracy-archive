    <div class="md"><p>me and some buddies were camping out between the edge of a corn field and woods. everyone was twirling glowsticks tied to strings except for 2 friends. the 2 friends began freaking out at the same time and called us over talking about a green light moving through the woods and then disappearing straight up. we were laughing at them and telling them that they were retarded and right then a huge round ship rolled up, hovered silently over us, and turned on 2 independently moving spotlights. they checked us out and moved on, again near silently. on one side of the ship was one red light and on the other side was one green light. just like a us aircraft. we were about 40 miles south of dover airforce base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A ufo that looked like a top hovering, not in the sky but more like above a house, I was about 5 or 6 when I looked out the window (usually hear weird animal noises, lived next to a farm that ran along side the town) saw that, didn&#39;t watch for long. I also didn&#39;t know what I was seeing but it stuck with me, then I realized it must if been a ufo. Still skeptical about most claims and can&#39;t explain what I saw, always wanted to debunk it but really can&#39;t. What I saw shows up in common ufo descriptions lists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Classic sleep paralysis.  I was awake, standing next to my bed.  I could see a bright light outside my window.  I sensed some kind of evil presence outside.  I couldn&#39;t move.  I began to be <em>pulled</em> towards the wall, <em>through my bed</em>.  At that point, I woke up.  Realized I had fallen asleep with my pillow contorted in a weird position, with my head tilted back, and I probably couldn&#39;t breathe.  So, technically, probably a near-death experience.  Or maybe I was drugged.  Or maybe it was aliens.  But probably not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was on a mission trip in South america as a teenager. We were in a hotel, in an area known for some demonic / voodoo practices. At night our tv and lights kept switching on. As a teenager, rooming with teenagers. I thought for sure one of my roomies was doing it. I was determined to catch him. When teh TV turned on I saw him lurking near the TV. When I said &quot;Got ya, Mike (not real name). Mike sat up in his bed confused, and the shape of the person faded away like someone swiping their hand through a cloud of smoke... I sincerely believe I saw a demon, or something that day. 
To be clear, I am a Christian, but tend to be skeptical of Mystical type things... But this was too wierd</p>

<p>We prayed over the room and it didnt happen again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in a hotel room once and the phone kept ringing and the tv would only show static no matter what channel. So I turned off the tv and disconnected the phone from the wall jack. 5 minutes later the phone rang again and the tv turned on. This time I disconnected the tv and put the phone on the balcony and went for a walk. The hotel had no available rooms for me to switch to.  So I walked outside until dawn. That spooked me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was using a ouija board in a private graveyard at 3am. We talked to some woman that had been murdered by her husband with a hatchet in the early 1900&#39;s. We googled her name and her story matched up with her death records. That was spooky. When we put the ouija board up, we placed the planchette <em>under</em> the board in the box and had a guitar lying next to the box in the back seat of the car. As we started to leave, the guitar started playing itself, plucking one string at a time and letting each note ring out. We panicked and parked the car, went to the backseat and opened the ouija box up and the planchette was <em>on top</em> of the board- with the glass over the word &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>So we decided to test our misfortune and drove to a funeral home and used the ouija board on the steps leading up to the front door. The moment we placed the planchette on the board, it shot down to 10 and started rapidly counting backwards 9-8-7-6 and we moved the planchette down to &quot;goodbye&quot; and packed it back up. After that, horrible things started happening. My friend called me while I was on my way home and he said that every step he took leading up to his house, he heard a loud bang on the metal garage door. Step, <strong>bang</strong> step, <strong>bang</strong>. He was losing it on the phone with me so I told him I&#39;d stay on the phone with him till he got to his room. When he got up there, both his dogs were sitting at the top of the stairs and whining their balls off, which was weird because the dogs couldn&#39;t get upstairs. There was a gate at the bottom preventing them from doing so.</p>

<p>So he goes into his room with his dogs and he&#39;s like &quot;dude I don&#39;t know what to do, should I light an incense or something? Isn&#39;t that supposed to ward off bad things or whatever?&quot; I told him why not, it couldn&#39;t hurt. So we&#39;re still on the phone and he picks up a match and strikes it, holds it near the incense and we both hear &quot;<em>Are you sure you want to do that?</em>&quot; in his <em>dad&#39;s voice</em>. His dad did not live there and was not in the house. My friend screamed and dropped the phone, his dogs freaked the fuck out, and I spent the rest of the night trying to calm him down. </p>

<p>That was the end of our ouija board escapades. Just one crazy story out of many with that stupid thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was doing military service in Ireland in the 2004, in the Wicklow mountains south of Dublin, and I was guard duty one night in the camp. The camp is pretty rural and surrounded by farms. Anyway, it was one hour walking around the guard hut 3 hours off type of work. </p>

<p>So at about 3.30 am I noticed that all the local dogs in the area were going crazy barking, thought maybe there were some foxes around. Then as I&#39;m staring off into the distance I notice what I thought at the time was a really bright star just begin to move very slowly without noise. Obviously I was just transfixed for a few moments watching it move east at a slow pace. It was hard to judge its distance not know my what it was. So, I called one of the guys who&#39;d wasn&#39;t sleeping out and he witnessed
It too. He was a lot younger than I and didn&#39;t really know what to say. </p>

<p>It just continued to love of into the distance until it was indistinguishable in the night sky. Then the dogs in the area just stopped barking. I&#39;d say all this happened in the space of two minutes. The younger guy didn&#39;t know what to make of it, neither did I to be honest. I knew that if I reported it that I would just be laughed at. Nonetheless, I reported it, everyone had a great laugh for a few days and that was the end of it. It really pestered my thoughts for a long time. Obviously it was a UFO (literally an unidentified flying object). Aliens popped into my mind but I laughed it off. For years I maintained that it was the British army spying on us. It wasn&#39;t until many years later that drones became a thing and then it all clicked together, kinda. I believe it was a drone but operated by who, I&#39;ll never know. That was the strangest thing that happened to me, which plagued and piques my curiosity for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>UFO sightings are pretty cool. I was hunting about 4 years ago and I had just got done gutting the deer I had just killed so by this time it was pretty dark. A bright light caught the corner of my eye, but when I looked, nothing was there. I told my brother-in-law who came to help me lift the deer into my truck that I saw that and he just laughed it off. So as we are driving down the gravel road in the direction that I saw the light, it slowly appeared again. It was a big, bright yellowish light. My brother-in-law looked at me dumbfounded because it looked like it was literally 100 feet above us. All of the sudden 4 more appeared, 2 on each side and it made a v shape. I pulled over and we got out of the truck and watched it for about a minute wondering wtf they were. Crazy thing was as soon as he took out his phone to record, they all disappeared at once. No one believes us because of that, but it was real and we talk about it to this day. That was by far the craziest thing I have ever seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we had issues over the Euphrates River with them setting up advanced Russian AA.</p>

<p>I got sick and tired of getting shot at, so before we took off base intel coordinated with an f-16 attack squadron and they hooked our comms up.  </p>

<p>We had two f-16s flanking the plane with a third off the tail.  </p>

<p>I took my post and started looking for the AA, and it didn&#39;t take more than 25 minutes for the first one to fire.</p>

<p>Over the comms we heard one of the f-16 pilots call sign dog breath request to leave the formation and engage the target.  </p>

<p>We could hear him setting everything up for the kill.  He got permission to fire, then he dropped everything he had.  </p>

<p>I watched an entire town go perma dark.  </p>

<p>For the next two years we never had another issue.  If anything small popped up they would toss an F-16 off our wing and clean it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like with everybody, I experience things that seem to have no explanation, but only one truly stands out- not because it&#39;s the most bizarre but because it defies simple explanation. </p>

<p>One night my alarm went off at 3 am because I work 5 am shifts once a week and I forgot to reset it. Immediately as I stand up to turn it off (it&#39;s across the room, so I wake up for sure), a bright light like daylight illuminated my room. Like day light. I have veils on my windows so light from outside lights my room. </p>

<p>I panicked. This light lasted for five to ten seconds and then went out. I did not look out of the window because I was spooked. I didn&#39;t go back to sleep and I told my family when they woke up. </p>

<p>I live in a wooded suburban town with a fenced backyard, so the only possible thing I can imagine is that someone set up huge lights outside my windows then ran off with them. </p>

<p>I simply don&#39;t believe that it was a dream, and I don&#39;t believe it was anything like an alien or something, but I cannot for the life of my figure out what it may have been. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was about 8 years ago my friends and I were in early highschool and went camping for a weekend at a lake in upstate New York. One night we were sitting around the fire shooting the shit when one of my buddies pointed out a shooting star flying over head (it was very high up, like the cruising altitude of an airliner so it was just a tiny speck of white light in the sky). We watched it streak across the night sky in a pretty normal fashion until it was about 3/4 of the way past us and just stopped in the sky. Not like it slowed down and began to hover...it was shooting across the sky and then just halted. It flashed a reddish color and immediately shot off back in the direction it had come from. The ability to stop and reaccelerate to top speed in the opposite direction like that really convinced us we either saw some super secret government aircraft, or something not from this world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s scary shit. Look up Loon Lake cemetery in MN. My sister and her friends went there and they swear one of the guys with them got possessed. He started speaking in a deep voice in different languages. I&#39;m skeptical, but the cemetery does have some history with a witch being buried there.</p>
