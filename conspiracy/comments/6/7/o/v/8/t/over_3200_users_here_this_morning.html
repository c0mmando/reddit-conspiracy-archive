       Wow. 3200 users. Let's make sure we keep a nonpartisan attitude and maintain a logical and reason based state of mind with whatever happens today. I think it's unlikely that absolutely nothing will occur within the next week. Don't get distracted by things designed to distract. Stay aware. Stay safe. Society isn't going to collapse. We will all maintain civilization. Don't let the fear mongering put you into a fear state of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a reminder to keep it cool!

       You want Marshall law? You want the grocery stores to run out of food? I'm young man, I haven't had enough time to prepare to be self sustaining in the event of total societal collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I just don't see it happening. Tv shows and movies that depict apocalyptic society is very skewed from reality imo. I think people would work together. Form small communities. At least outside of the major cities. Major cities will probably start eating each other. But I think that communities would form, people would protect each other and feed each other.

       it's hilarious to me that people think big cities have no community. if anywhere, cities are where people will come together and help each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       people holed up on their farms in the country with their 8 kids and 30 guns are the ones who are going to be killing each other for food.  they already think the government is after them so they're already the most paranoid.

       Lots of people were injured. A girl wearing a red "Make Bitcoin Great Again" cap was pepper sprayed by some asshole in a black hoodie with a black mask while being interviewed.

       The Berkely riots have been organized by public school teachers. You don't think the kids who those teachers have taught to riot and fuck shit up, wouldn't fuck shit up if all of the power went out and everything? The woman who organized a lot of it said that Milo was a bunch of -isms including homophobic. Flamboyantly gay Milo. But he has some conservative positions on policy, so he must be a Nazi, and we have to protect our freedom of speech from people like him.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the kind of people we're dealing with. They're idiots. And they have a lot of public influence. That's not good in my opinion, and I believe that if they were give the opportunity, they would begin "cleansing" California of "Nazis" and literally murder anyone who doesn't bend the knee to their delusion. Funded by Soros.

       If disaster did strike.  There is a good chance major roads and highways would be blocked or clogged beyond usability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if people dont think some of these back wood folks wouldnt just block roads or destroy bridges to keep the vast amount of insiders out.  It is something to be heavily considered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically everybody's plan b of running to the woods and mountains during a disaster is not very viable.  Either you are already there beforehand or you are likely shit out of luck.

       Having been born and lived mostly in the country I'll say that I completely disagree with you.  I've waved and attempted to at least be cordial and get acquainted with neighbors on both sides of my house in the city.  After a year neither waves back, looks at me when I'm outside, and frankly I've given up, fuck them.  Now whenever I head out to visit around my Dads house, everyone waves at everyone and he always has a story about any number of the neighbors stopping by just to shoot the shit and see how each other are doing.  I bought a house in the city for dirt cheap but I'm hoping to get my house sold in a few years and buy a tract of land from my family just to escape the assholes.  Cities will eat themselves in days.

       Well of course they are, the goal is to entertain! Would Walking Dead be very good if they lived their lives in peace once they get to Alexandria? Or The Governor worked

       probably would depend on what happens and during what time of year, because in more northen places, like Canada or the Mid west in the US food would become scarce quickly in the winter if there are no major food storages.
Walking dead like apocholapse would not likly be much of a problem as the zombies would run out of food pretty quick, and the military would set up safe zones and bomb any area that was to infested into oblivion.

       Who says I'm not enjoying life? I'm not paranoid, just more observant. If the idea of what I said triggers you, I'd argue that you're the paranoid one. I'm just chilling and being open my mind to the possibilities. We are extremely vulnerable to an EMP. Get comfortable with that fact.

       I'm not even saying anything will happen, I even said I doubt anything will happen. I don't think society will collapse. I don't think we will get hit by an EMP. But I'm saying that it is 100% a possibility and the amount of military movement is significant.

       Trump signed an executive order to put power back to the states in education. In other words, remove Common Core. Then he left to go meet the Senators.

       It is never good when the count gets over 2500. I hope it is just a lot of concerned spectators from other wings of reddit, who just know they can come here for less filtered information. I know those people exist, who would never admit to being interested in conspiracies, but whose spidey senses just tingle too hard to stay away.

       Right on. And you know we discuss all of these subjects as if they are real. I will speak for myself here, but I imagine other veterans of places like this are much the same way. I will entertain anything as true and real for the purpose of exploring the idea. But, this is an intellectual exercise, and not an indication of actual beliefs. To get the most out of places like this, suspending disbelief is required.

       I think the misunderstanding of that by outsiders is what gets us characterized as crazy. Don't get me wrong, I believe what would be considered some weird ass shit too I'm sure. But in general, the stereotype of tinfoil hat wearing ultra-paranoid bunker dwellers isn't accurate at all.

       I believe a huge % of the recent influx is from people who usually post over at The_Donald (myself included).  Trump is (obviously) starting to betray his supporters. Many of them have been banned from The_Donald (myself included) for merely expressing concern and opposition to Trump going against what he said in the campaign and showing himself to be doing the bidding of the Establishment.

       I am not a fan, but I kinda feel bad for Trump. That upside down flag Spicer wore won't leave my mind. I didn't expect Trump to meet the unrealistic expectations of his most ardent worshippers, but this complete reversal on a lot of things, and even the relegation of Bannon to the back of the bus, all tell me something fucking awful probably happened in the backfield.

       That said, I think T_D was subverted sometime about a month before the election. The people were really cool, but within leadership lurked something ugly, and we are seeing that play out now I think.

       There's been speculation that something was going to happen today. Look up Project Gotham Shield. Photos of military hardware moving all over the country increased worries. I think I saw someone link to an article off-site talking about the speculation here on this sub. There's a chance we've gotten swept up in nothing, but there are some legitimately strange factors here, like all the military equipment that was witnessed being moved.

       Absolutely. I found this sub a long time ago looking for alien forums and haven't left since lol. It really is an awesome community and pretty fascinating watching topics get picked apart and analyzed. It's nice to see people diverting their energy into this because we all want the truth.
