       Is it like the globalist neocons and other establishment politicians? And what does that have to do with Trump? I thought his cabinet was full of outsiders.

       It would be beneficial to yourself and the community. Maybe you'll bring the new perspective to the table that we needed to see things we didn't know before. I understand and agree with asking questions, but yours is way too broad.

       But just because he launched missiles at Syria doesn't necessarily mean he's the new Obama. He's in office for 100 days, surely you can't jump to conclusions just yet

       It's not really one set of people that are clearly defined. It is a combination of career bureaucrats that are funneled between think tanks and appointed positions but never leave D.C. Think council on foreign relations, council on national policy, trilateral commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       These, combined with intelligence officials that are not elected, are the people that don't have to worry about elections and are able influence policy regardless of whether the blue team or the red team holds power.

       It's not in and of itself as sinister as it sounds. The term refers to people within the government whose careers span more than one administration, either because their positions aren't political enough to merit re-appointment by each incoming president, or because they do a good enough job that the individuals have bipartisan support.

       The CIA is a huge part of the deep state. After watching by this series, you'll know plenty about it.

       I'm not sure there is an established definition. How I have come to understand the deep state is that it is a somewhat large group of people who are NOT elected officials, and therefore are not accountable to the public. I agree that most politicians are not held accountable, but we know who they are and with enough pressure it is possible to put one out of office. By contrast, the deep state is unknown and untouchable. To put simply the deep state is the people who manage and operate the systems of money in politics from behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who are part of the deep state are there to coerce the government into doing things that benefit themselves or their respective organizations.  Lower level people are simply trying to hold on to their government funded (often high paying) jobs while higher level people are actively playing a role in the government policy making.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other people might like to define the deep state as a few people calling all the shots and running the puppet show in front (i.e. The 7th Floor Group). If these people exist they are certainly part of the deep state; however, this idea is difficult to prove with absolute certainty. Which leaves an easy avenue for people to deny it's existence. On the other hand, the definition I laid out would encompass these few people plus the unelected influencers who certainly exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone care to critique this definition?

       Neocons/Neoliberal/CIA.

       The first two serve the interests of the CIA though, either through blackmail or bribery (or better yet, bribery turned into blackmail.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA has factions within it that serve many disparate interests, but above all they serve and protect their agency, even above the interests of the country. They have been playing a REALLY long game of proxy war with Russia over the middle east, and despite how history is frames, the cold war NEVER ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pentagon is not the same as the deep state though, in spite of how they are frequently bundled together with the term "military industrial complex". The pentagon is more often than not the victims of misinformation by the CIA and private intelligence contractors who use them as a cudgel, most often to further the interests of the CIA many clandestine wars and to beef up spending for military contractors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deep state also runs the media in the majority of western countries and uses them to shape the public's perception about policy both domestic and international. They also use this tool to ruin people who work against their interest.
