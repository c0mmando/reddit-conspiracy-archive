       IF 4/26 is nothing, but a breezy day then do not claim insanity. The last thing we should do is discredit a well organized reaction to the worst case scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many users demonstrated critical observation, and problem solving skills. Seldom were the intense over reactions of a triggered community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frustration for the salad of shit we are fed daily from the news etc is to be expected, but honestly the sub reddit should pat its self on the back.

       I consider it a great communal victory for people in this subreddit for bringing attention to this date and the planned actions/drills surrounding it. It may have forced mainstream media's hand to have to actually communicate stories on the exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
       The absolute best thing for all of us is if nothing occurs and everyone lives. Maybe we made someone in a smokey cigar room (either foreign or domestic) last night shrug their shoulders and give the order to hold off on any real harmful event that was planned.

       To be honest, I wouldn't mind if people analyzed every day this way (in advance). We could have a calendar of incoming events, like controversial legislation votes in the relevant big countries (i.e. France, Germany, UK, Russia, China), elections, political meetings etc.

       I was just thinking that. I was reading through the 'news' thread where folks are chiming in with goings-on that are a little sketchy. It would be great to have that everyday, sort of as a roll-call for parts of the country.

       The second mainstream media (TV or online articles) uses the terms "conspiracy theorists" or "getting a lot of attention on online conspiracy forums", the job's been done. Shills may have spotted something and reported that some pieces were being put together quickly. Not patting myself on the back for posting thoughts online, but communally, I can definitely say the research and analysis is commendable.

       The users coming through and making fun of us for discussing this subject are the worst kind of gaslighting shill. They want to make you second guess your sanity the next time a highly suspicious even comes up. It plays on the native human instinc to not want to be fooled or look foolish.

       Being prudent and curious is

       How many people did a sanity check yesterday and at least thought about a disaster plan? If something did happen, chances for mitigating disaster would have been mitigated a great deal. I refuse to feel bad for that.

       My new favorite subtle thing that these shitheads do is when there is a comment like yours with something like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        WE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER!! All of us! No hate!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They just come back with "who is we?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Like fuck anyone that even tries to make common cause with like minded individuals. It is disgusting.

       Doesn't that incur the risk of you never being able to predict anything, yet unable to see it because by random chance, one in every infinity predictions will be correct?

       The mistake here is thinking that we have to be right, or that we believe any of this here either. This is a speculative sub, so we speculate. If you don't have an imagination and the ability to suspend disbelief, you are going to have a bad and confusing time here.

       I saw a post like 4hrs ago by a known toxic user saying exactly this, that if it didn't happen then this sub was going to take credit for preventing it. This is just not a thing. This is the kind of fictitious meta stuff that trolls do around here that get turned around on us like we originated it.

       Indeed.  Even the link cited in this post, as eye opening and thought provoking as it was, only had 3500 upvotes.  In the grand scheme of things we're an almost trivially smal community, but the fact that we gain the attention of MSM and that TPTB feel the need to infiltrate this sub with shills really says a lot.  We're ruffling feathers, stirring the pot, and opening eyes, making it harder to run these schemes and cons on the world.

       I intend to declare victory if nothing happens. There was more than enough evidence to prove that something REAL was going to happen on 4/16. Our vigilance spooked them and forced them to call it off. This was very similar to what happened during the 2012 London Olympics when there was a real plot to nuke the games. The cat was out of the bag so they had to call it off. It was a job well done.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of conspiracy theory is to be proactive and cut the conspirators off before they even have a chance to act. This is a far more effective tactic than reacting after the fact as was in the case of 9/11 or JFK. This is a war for the fate of planet and our very lives. Those who take preemptive action will have the advantage in this war. The people are waking up which is forcing them to cancel their plans. There will never be another 9/11 as long as conspiracy theorists maintain their vigil. Which means the New World order is toast if they can't create anymore false flags.

       And the day still isn't even remotely over, something very well could still happen. But I absolutely agree with OP and the other posts here. Either way we proved we could come together, properly analyse, inform, and prepare using only the internet. A victory either way! (Not that I helped at all, I just kept up with the reports)

       Completely agree.  Regardless of what does or doesn't go down, there was certainly enough coinciding events and relevant pieces of information that more than justify a raised eyebrow and vigilance.

       Look at it this way, about the fact that people who aren't usually on the sub that are coming here to talk shit and make fun. At least they paid attention to things going on today this far to see if something would happen. Whether anything happens today or not at least it made a difference, at least in people's awareness of events going on around them they wouldn't usually pay attention to.

       Something I've been thinking as well - we may be preventing any attacks.
      </p>

       Sure, it seems scary to reach out for family/friends safety. It may take some time away from 'entertainment' to research and spread this stuff. But, unlike in days past we have the interwebs to help quickly spread information and I'm hoping we're helping to spot things before they happen.

       Had millions of people known about the coincidences involved in 9/11 ahead of time - or on that morning - I have to think the plans would have either been foiled, or if completed successfully would have been IMMEDIATELY questioned by the people.

       im glad we were all able to keep an eye on things without too much political squabbling.  it genuinely gives me renewed hope.  thank you to all who participated or lurked.  way to be vigilant even if nothing happened.

       These date predictions always end in nothing, they desperately need to stop if anything on this sub is to ever be taken seriously. Slowly but surely it's been destroyed, STUPID predictions do nothing but fear monger.

       The mistake here is thinking that we have to be right, or that we believe any of this here either. This is a speculative sub, so we speculate. If you don't have an imagination and the ability to suspend disbelief, you are going to have a bad and confusing time here.
