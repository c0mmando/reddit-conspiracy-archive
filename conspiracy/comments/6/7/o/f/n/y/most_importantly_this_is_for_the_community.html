    <div class="md"><p>Indeed.  Even the link cited in this post, as eye opening and thought provoking as it was, only had 3500 upvotes.  In the grand scheme of things we&#39;re an almost trivially smal community, but the fact that we gain the attention of MSM and that TPTB feel the need to infiltrate this sub with shills really says a lot.  We&#39;re ruffling feathers, stirring the pot, and opening eyes, making it harder to run these schemes and cons on the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I intend to declare victory if nothing happens. There was more than enough evidence to prove that something REAL was going to happen on 4/16. Our vigilance spooked them and forced them to call it off. This was very similar to what happened during the 2012 London Olympics when there was a real plot to nuke the games. The cat was out of the bag so they had to call it off. It was a job well done.</p>

<p>The point of conspiracy theory is to be proactive and cut the conspirators off before they even have a chance to act. This is a far more effective tactic than reacting after the fact as was in the case of 9/11 or JFK. This is a war for the fate of planet and our very lives. Those who take preemptive action will have the advantage in this war. The people are waking up which is forcing them to cancel their plans. There will never be another 9/11 as long as conspiracy theorists maintain their vigil. Which means the New World order is toast if they can&#39;t create anymore false flags.</p>

Either way we proved we could come together, properly analyse, inform, and prepare using only the internet. A victory either way! (Not that I helped at all, I just kept up with the reports)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at it this way, about the fact that people who aren&#39;t usually on the sub that are coming here to talk shit and make fun. At least they paid attention to things going on today this far to see if something would happen.

    <div class="md"><p>Something I&#39;ve been thinking as well - we may be preventing any attacks. </p>

<p>Sure, it seems scary to reach out for family/friends safety. It may take some time away from &#39;entertainment&#39; to research and spread this stuff. But, unlike in days past we have the interwebs to help quickly spread information and I&#39;m hoping we&#39;re helping to spot things before they happen. </p>

<p>Had millions of people known about the coincidences involved in 9/11 ahead of time - or on that morning - I have to think the plans would have either been foiled, or if completed successfully would have been IMMEDIATELY questioned by the people. </p>
