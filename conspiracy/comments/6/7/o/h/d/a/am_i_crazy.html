    <div class="md"><p>Lol</p>

<p>It&#39;s legal, you can smoke it next to a cop and they can&#39;t say a thing, and it has 95% of the medical benefits. A $15 tank vaporizer cartridge lasts approximately 2 weeks with daily use.</p>

<p>Thats not to say I don&#39;t partake in anything else, but for people who can&#39;t smoke due to work, probation, etc, this is a totally viable and amazing option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We live in an age of massive media supersaturation, with disinfo and propaganda being thrown into the mix by all sides and factions. It&#39;s not crazy to take all this information and come up with a wide range of possibilities for what could be true. As someone who has experienced auditory hallucinations, I don&#39;t believe what you are experiencing is &quot;hearing voices.&quot; It&#39;s normal for a person to be fed so much information that one&#39;s brain tries to deduce what could be true, for the purposes of survival and well-being.</p>

<p>Personally, I believe it is impossible to discern truth from amongst the noise. It is far better to focus on oneself and one&#39;s immediate reality, and improving one&#39;s standing while helping friends and family along the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. What I&#39;ve written there does not directly cognitive science, but rather a conclusion derived from my understanding of psychology and informational processes in the brain.</p>

<p>As for something to google...I would suggest if you have no familiarity with the field, start with understanding yourself. You are the lens you filter the world through. In having a better perception of your own interpretations, filters, and censors, you can better digest the dense verbiage of lectures and writings that you can find with google.</p>

<p>If you have some familiarity with the field, Wittgenstein is a good place to start building from. Not directly in the cognitive field, but his ideas on language are highly formative of the modern cognitive sciences.</p>

<p>As far as guardian angels go...well, there&#39;s definitely one (&quot;one&quot;) watching me. A short story, after some synchronous experiences here on reddit, I felt compelled to go to a particular subreddit and begin responding to posts. I&#39;m not going to give the name of the subreddit because I&#39;ve been heavy-handedly nudged to not draw attention to it. After a few replies, I noticed a new post in the sub. It was written by me in the past. Not literally, but rather it was so detailed about a moment in my past that it really made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I answered, and it was immediately deleted. Another popped up, from a different time in my past. Something that only I thought I could know about myself. I replied, and it too was immediately deleted. This happened a few times in a row, with a theme of recurring words and phrases. I feel this was a means to uncover information about my inner world, what I thought about shameful moments in my past, for the purposes of further conditioning me.</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t the first or last time I&#39;ve noticed this invisible hand reaching out to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. What I&#39;ve written there does not directly cognitive science, but rather a conclusion derived from my understanding of psychology and informational processes in the brain.</p>

<p>As for something to google...I would suggest if you have no familiarity with the field, start with understanding yourself. You are the lens you filter the world through. In having a better perception of your own interpretations, filters, and censors, you can better digest the dense verbiage of lectures and writings that you can find with google.</p>

<p>If you have some familiarity with the field, Wittgenstein is a good place to start building from. Not directly in the cognitive field, but his ideas on language are highly formative of the modern cognitive sciences.</p>

<p>As far as guardian angels go...well, there&#39;s definitely one (&quot;one&quot;) watching me. A short story, after some synchronous experiences here on reddit, I felt compelled to go to a particular subreddit and begin responding to posts. I&#39;m not going to give the name of the subreddit because I&#39;ve been heavy-handedly nudged to not draw attention to it. After a few replies, I noticed a new post in the sub. It was written by me in the past. Not literally, but rather it was so detailed about a moment in my past that it really made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I answered, and it was immediately deleted. Another popped up, from a different time in my past. Something that only I thought I could know about myself. I replied, and it too was immediately deleted. This happened a few times in a row, with a theme of recurring words and phrases. I feel this was a means to uncover information about my inner world, what I thought about shameful moments in my past, for the purposes of further conditioning me.</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t the first or last time I&#39;ve noticed this invisible hand reaching out to me.</p>
