       Just like everyone. A sniff of fame and "power/influence" can drive even a sane person crazy. We are not biologically capable of avoiding folding our morals when you get so much bullshit/groupie fanfare. He's just spineless. Always has always will be. I've said it before. Fuck Bill Nye, you're not even a real scientist.

       Don't think most people over maybe age twelve think he is. It's likely the fault of his writers and producers pushing this new angle, and Nye is just complacent with it, or maybe some of things you mentioned.

       He sold out a few years ago, he was criticizing Monsanto and GMOs before they invited him into their research centers for a private tour. After that, he started being more vocal at spouting some of their PR lines and genuinely changed his tone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figure it's because he was on the fence about some of their negative consequences and just doesn't see those anymore. Evil doesn't know it's evil, and all that.

       His new show on Netflix with their dire tion in pushing moral issues into it's programming, combined with viral marketing and nyes's image created a platform for a very broad viewership.

       Naturally, the audience has noticed overall themes lately, and are collectively picking a side early in a big fight that's been going on for a while with progressive agenda's, i'm not surprised by the backlash.

       It's a bigger debate unfolding, bill bye just has such a broad appeal that it became a platform watched by all. Hence why we are skirting around the bigger debate of what format is correct for pushing ideologies, and what ideologies are off limits.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very interesting seeing this happen and frankly, I hope the debate evolves past bill nye, he's just a face. Some chatter has surged on the topic, and more so recently, but I haven't seen it enter the mainstream yet.
      </p>

       Hopefully something useful comes out of it instead of us tearing ourselves apart. Who knows. Already had it on reddit quite a few times, first with fatpeoplehate. Quite interesting times.

       Somewhat relevant quote that I think turns me off from Bill Nye and Neil Tyson.

      <p>
       Seems like they insult anyone who offers a spiritual explanation for anything. That usually wouldn't be an issue, but the more I research the more I find out that science doesn't really have an explanation for 99% of this world and experience.

       5 years ago this co-opting of popular media figures went into high gear. MSM saw that their own august, respected teleprompter readers were losing eyeballs to kids with a youtube channel and investigative journalists working out their bedrooms. And wen those talking heads at the networks were exposed as being just parrots paid to sell and say whatever they were told, having the top social media
       <em>
        influencers
       </em>
       ready became a priority. So we saw many getting book deals, meetups with the Washington chosen, hawking advertising and social awareness campaigns. Seems it has gone that well and now Youtube is bowing to advertisers' pressure to censor them. Whether it's due their challenge to mass media due their massive audience numbers or because of their unwillingness or failure spreading the
       <em>
        intended messages
       </em>
       is not clear yet.
      </p>

       Same with Nye and others. It's pathetic to watch this actor with an engineering degree become, along with DeGrasse, part of the Science Priesthood, ready to debunk uncomfortable questions and defend corporate products &amp; practices. And smear non-aligned opinions as those of tinfoil losers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does he do it? Money. Also ego, I guess. And that show with the blatant agenda pushing is sure to cause a shitstorm amid both conservative and liberal alike. Which of course is what his handlers expect.
