        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Girl scouts were originally a covert paramilitary group created in 1911 to help the english government move across enemy borders and to carryout covert task and assassinations without being seen or questioned. Once these groups (Boy and girl scouts) proved their usefulness Lieutenant General Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell or Lord Powell was exempt from all combat during WW1 as his unit proved more effective than any 1 soldier.</p>

<p>Now the question is why hide this history? The reason they hide this history because some troop units are still covert military cells. This military group is by world powers to push the their agenda. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t it seem odd that the turnover form boy and girl scouts to the armed forces is as higher than any youth extra curricular and the training the scouts have is similar to ranger basic training.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t really see anything resembling what you&#39;re claiming in either article.</p>

<p>Closest thing from the Girl Scout Article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Wing Scout program was a Senior Girl Scout program for girls interested in flying and wanting to serve their country that started in 1941 and ended in the 1970s. In July 1942, 29 troop leaders from 15 states met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to take Wing Scout leadership training. They returned to their councils and began setting up Wing Scout troops. In 1959, the Girl Scout council in North San Mateo County, California, was presented with an offer from United Airlines San Francisco Management Club President J. L. Burnside to start an aviation program for Senior Girl Scouts. One of the highlights of the Wing Scout program was the courtesy flight provided to Senior Girl Scouts using United Airlines&#39; jets. For many of the girls, this was the first time they had flown in a plane. Senior Girl Scouts who had been in the program for three years were given the opportunity to take over the controls during flight in a small aircraft. The program was discontinued after United Airlines experienced financial setbacks in the 1970s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Closest from Baden-Powell:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On his return from Africa in 1903, Baden-Powell found that his military training manual, Aids to Scouting, had become a best-seller, and was being used by teachers and youth organisations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither of those sounds like a hidden group of youth assassins. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the outbreak of World War I in 1914, at the age of fifty-seven, Baden-Powell put himself at the disposal of the War Office. No command was given to him. It has been claimed[dubious – discuss] that Lord Kitchener said: &quot;he could lay his hand on several competent divisional generals but could find no one who could carry on the invaluable work of the Boy Scouts.&quot;[33] It was rumoured that Baden-Powell was engaged in spying and Baden-Powell claimed[dubious – discuss] that intelligence officers spread this myth.[34]</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;According to Michael Rosenthal in The Character Factory, this gave Baden-Powell &quot;the vision of a British society made strong by legions of well-disciplined, morally upright, patriotic youth who found their satisfaction in defending the interests of the empire and following the orders of their superiors.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-07-08/features/8602180396_1_boy-scouts-character-factory-lord-robert-baden-powell">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-07-08/features/8602180396_1_boy-scouts-character-factory-lord-robert-baden-powell</a></p>

<p>Scouting, in Baden-Powell<code>s words, was to be a</code><code>character factory</code>` that would take the raw offspring of the disenfranchised working class and manufacture them into obedient placeholders at the bottom of the social scale. Baden-Powell was building an organization that would instill in the underclass the spirit of empire and the discipline to fight its wars.</p>
