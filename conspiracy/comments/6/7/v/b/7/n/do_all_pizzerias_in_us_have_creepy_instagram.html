    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of üçïgate, no restaurant that I&#39;ve ever been to knowingly has had an Instagram account with little naked children posted on it. It&#39;s strange, you cannot defend that. If you serve families food, you shouldn&#39;t be posting questionable things. </p>

<p>Just think back to a time when any politician or celebrity needed to be taken down a peg. Their social media gets poked and prodded until something innocent can be twisted into a malicious attack. How is something that barely qualifies as acceptable when a dumb Tumblr girl tries to explain her affinity‚Äã of eating actual pizza, okay to post when you&#39;re trying to be an aspect of your community. Isn&#39;t that just good business sense? Just blows my mind people don&#39;t question their actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The severed hand one is dope, lol, and definitely isn&#39;t important compare to other imagery. The thing is, (an I&#39;m all for looking into any of the threads to the child sex trafficking sweater) sometimes creepy is just creepy, and nothing more. Sometimes people just have odd brains. That&#39;s why there&#39;s a fine line between art, and torture porn. Or art, and podestas fucked up collection. </p>

<p>I mean, my art in highschool and a bit after was really fucked up of you took it that way, (never involved hoards of children half naked) but I&#39;m also here on Reddit standing up for the children who are potentially being harmed. I think that says a lot about art always being included in these details. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that statement. Sadly some people don&#39;t understand what the world of art is like now. People could only paint religious figures and mountains for so long. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does a &quot;family friendly&quot; restaurant post porn on their Instagram?
Because there&#39;s literally no reason for them not to? The only person they&#39;re hurting, one assumes, is their own bottom line (if people don&#39;t want to eat/spend their money at a place that posts stupid stuff online). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I appreciate your link and sourcing the claim above, but none of this proves anything about pedophilia or any of the Pizzagate claims. It shows that Comet Pizza had an employee who posted (what I consider to be) stupid pictures on Instagram. </p>

<p>It was an example of code words being used in a place of business about food. Your use of random capitalization of letters doesn&#39;t negate that valid point. Code words are very common among people that are doing things they want to keep secret is my point, doesn&#39;t matter what example I give, there are millions out there. Either dispute that point, or agree. </p>

<p>Miss you Herb. </p>

<p>Happy Holidays and see you in 2016.</p>

<p>On Thursday, December 24, 2015, Sandler, Herbert &lt;<a href="mailto:hms@sandlerfoundation.org">hms@sandlerfoundation.org</a>&gt; wrote:</p>

<p>Mary and John</p>

<p>I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been
long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape &gt; of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the &gt; square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it 
was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the
return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that
we can demolish them.
 Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well. 
 I miss you both 
Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

<p>Ps. Do you think I‚Äôll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta? </p>

<p>The Satanists, pedos and/or creeps in Hollywood are cheering us on for their successful engineering of our corrupt culture and rising sexualization of minors on TV. They must be fucking <em>ecstatic</em> we&#39;ve come this far. I can hear them reveling.</p>

<p>As for determining age of a person(not gonna assume their gender affiliation) just by looking at a overly pixeled is not always accurate. </p>

<p>Unless the instagram user got that person to ride a piece of pizza, it was probably a model, and while appearing young, those usually require releases and waivers, especially if explicit.  And I doubt with that much jpeg, it was done by the instagram user, and probably something they found online, judging by the variety of the other 900+ photos they have posted.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all Satanic.  &quot;Saturn&quot; is just another name for Satan.</p>

<p>An &quot;alien&quot; is defined as &quot;non-human intelligent life&quot;.  That is what the fallen angels and demons are.  The alien phenomenon is the manifestation of these entities.</p>

<p>And the Illuminati is essentially a Satanic cult of elites dedicated to achieving the Satanic agenda for the world -- ie, totalitarian one world government, as prophesied in the Bible.  </p>

The internet (brought to you by CERN) is a means to the end goal of creating a global brain, or &quot;collective consciousness&quot; where we are all &quot;one&quot; with machines and one another via this one huge network. It&#39;s ancient occult stuff cloaked in modern technology and new age terminology. Facebook is working hard on this brain-uploading technology as we speak. Revelations is unfolding, time to get right with the Big man upstairs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saturn was the Roman name for a god noted for having eaten children. Roman and Greek writers stated that Saturn was equivalent to the Greek god Chronos and Phoenician god Moloch, who also ate children.</p>

<p>That was also the source of the Biblical mention of the horrific Canaanite practice of burning children to Moloch, which appears to have consisted of setting a fire inside a large statue of Moloch and throwing infants in.</p>

<p>Remains of child sacrifices to Moloch have been found by archaeologists in the ruins of the Phoenician colony of Carthage.</p>

<p>Use of Saturn/Chronos/Moloch symbolism is found all over the place in pedophile materials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The statue where the fake human sacrifice is performed at Bohemian Grove is an owl.</p>

<p>The symbol of the owl and its relation to child sacrifice is different that the Saturn/Chronos/Moloch bull symbology.</p>

<p>Can expand if people are interested.</p>

<p>Clues for people who want to do their own research:</p>

<p>Roman Minerva=
Greek   Athena~
Egypt   Neith=
Phoenician Tanit~
Indian Lakshmi= </p>

<p>The city state of Athens did take its name from Athena, and the name of the city&#39;s chief temple, Parthenon, is taken from the the sacrifice of a virgin girl (parthena) at the site.</p>

<p>Athena&#39;s animal symbol was the owl, and Athens&#39;s chief coin had an image of Athena on one size and an owl on the other.</p>

<p>In mythology both Athena and Lakshmi rode owls on occasion.</p>

<p>Also, look into the ritual sacrifices of owls to Lakshmi that have been going on for thousands of years in India, and still do to this day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you not understand the concept of a delusional mind? That&#39;s what I don&#39;t get. Just because it&#39;s not really the case, doesn&#39;t mean that it wasn&#39;t true <em>in his mind</em>. In his world, it did drive him past the point of no return. It did cause him to get insitutionalized help. But the commercial in <em>our</em> world, did none of those things. That&#39;s my point. </p>

<p>What I <strong>really</strong> don&#39;t get is why you&#39;re so seemingly offended of someone talking down on the noid. üòò </p>

<p>I was making a bad joke about pizza, duder. But again, delusional minds obviously engage in their delusions, which creates a reality. I was only talking about his reality. Because a delusional mind doesn&#39;t match the reality of most &quot;typical&quot; minds? I don&#39;t even know what the fuck we&#39;re going back and forth about. </p>

<p>Lemme try this:
Sorry I took you too seriously and butted heads. We&#39;re wasting our effort instead of just enjoying ourselves. And that&#39;s silly. </p>

<p>Reddit can do that to you; reading emotionless, toneless text can cause ridiculous gut reactions you don&#39;t realize til you&#39;ve burned a hole in your keyboard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I wrote about the Saturn eating his child thing the other day. Why would someone use a cannibal allegory for their pizza shop? Podestas collect cannibal art and attend mock human cannibalism / ritual sacrifices (spirit cooking).</p>

<p>MyPizzaBrain has another picture on their Instagram of a pizza that looks like the planet Saturn with rings. What&#39;s with these guys and Saturn? I believe it has strong occult significance for these people, and I have seen this similar theme with the Comet Ping Pong findings.</p>

<p>(Brotherhood of Saturn)</p>

<p>Pizza is a front for these groups, who I think are freemasons. They operate through symbolism and allegory, right out in the open, right in public. Perhaps the satanic pizza places are different fraternities or orders of freemasonry.</p>

<p>Look at this freemason symbolism I found in the Instagram connected to MyPizzaBrain:</p>

<p><a href="https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/8jISEWY0p.png">https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/8jISEWY0p.png</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a summary of my initial findings for MyPizzaBrain Instagram:</p>

<p>There&#39;s something there. A twisted owner, or something far more troubling.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing some research on this freemason occult stuff across several different threads, so here are a few more:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see a lot of those being dark or immature humor, and that doesn&#39;t surprise me. The one with the naked kid riding a slice though- it doesn&#39;t make any sense on a humor level. If it were an artfully nude woman (or even grown man- hey ladies and gay guys enjoy cheesecake pin ups too) in that pose riding a slice you&#39;d say, okay, they&#39;re using sexuality to sell pizza in an ironic/humorous way, big deal. Weird for a family place but so did Hardee&#39;s, whatever. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s a kid. It sure looks like a kid. So I&#39;d love to hear why they&#39;d be specializing him straddling a slice. At best it&#39;s a very young, like, just turned 18 today twink of a guy- but I&#39;m 99% certain that&#39;s a kid. So what are they trying to &#39;say&#39; there? </p>

<p>Fucking naive people, that kind of people remind me so much of my mother when I was young.</p>

<p>She was so naive and gave everything a pass, she loved going to a little local store, I remember telling her about the drug deal that little store had and she always called me crazy and dumb, because the guys was a really nice guy lmao... until some day he got busted.</p>

<p>That dude was the go-to-guy of many local junkies, RIP store guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like the amount of influence people get from social media now it&#39;s too easy for anyone to push a certain idea/image to be trendy and edgy. I mean people fucking love it. I remember a few years ago (from the UK not sure elsewhere) but almost every item of clothing in mainstream high street shops started putting fucking Anti-Christ cross on all the clothes?? People started actually making anti Christ a part of their fashion statement because they saw it on instagram or in the shops... It&#39;s just madness and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s done because some fashion dude thought it looked good. Pizza is in fashion/looks SO much, I&#39;ve got friends who have pizza bedding and pillows and shit... So weird, I love pizza, who doesn&#39;t? but I don&#39;t know why people like it THAT much</p>

And maybe if you go do some of those things to children irl you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s a great difference between movies that often try to get a point across and creepy shit like this irl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes because they are Trump-financed fronts for the distribution of prostitute urine beverages and you&#39;ve all inadvertently drunk deep from that particular chalice but, rest assured, one day somebody will find your corpses amongst the shit-clogged hoarders&#39; decorated trailers you live in, remove the microchips from your frontal lobes, run diagnostics on aforementioned microchips and confirm all those problems that plague your lives - well, they&#39;re all of your own motherfucking making. LOL!</p>

<p>Now, hurry up and blame Obama.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like people don&#39;t understand Pizza is primarily teenager/ young adult food and usually staffed by young adults/ teenagers. They find these what are called &quot;memes&quot; to be funny. </p>

<p>Just look at the fucking ex-owner and tell me that those don&#39;t seem like something he would post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that. Shirley Temple trips me out a bit too.</p>

<p>The Satanists, pedos and/or creeps in Hollywood are cheering us on for their successful engineering of our corrupt culture and rising sexualization of minors on TV. They must be fucking <em>ecstatic</em> we&#39;ve come this far. I can hear them reveling.</p>

<p>But if you look back on history, it was even worse. Much of Ancient Greece was a pederast society and that was &quot;normal&quot; back then. It seems there may still be practitioners of this ancient culture, what with the ritualisms and orgies and symbolic meals and whatever the hell else Pizzagate has exposed.</p>
