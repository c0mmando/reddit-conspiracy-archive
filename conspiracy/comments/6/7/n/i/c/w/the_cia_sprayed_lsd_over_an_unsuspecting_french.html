        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">2562</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-04-26 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/WhereIsFiber.html">WhereIsFiber</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The CIA is a menace to democracy.  They&#39;re like Denace the Menace only they have machine guns.</p>

<p>John Potash writes in his acclaimed book &quot;Drugs as Weapons Against Us&quot; that the CIA&#39;s Project SPAN involved &quot;the 1951 aerosol spraying of LSD on the town of Pont-St. Esprit, France, which resulted in several deaths and many injuries.&quot;</p>

<p>The CIA also tested anthrax-like spores in various American cities, and may have used actual anthrax during the Korean War.  Maybe I&#39;ll write about this later, or someone else will I hope.</p>

<p>Anyone else suddenly seeing military helicopters flying overhead for the first time?  I remember in 1990 in the buildup to Papa Bush&#39;s Desert Storm incursion into Kuwait to fight Iraqi troops (remember Papa Bush never did invade Iraq, just entered Kuwait) that I&#39;d see day after day lots of military truck traffic on South Kingshighway as I would drive to Forest Park and Washington University&#39;s library.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived in the same house for 25 years, and I&#39;ve never once seen military helicopters flying around.  Maybe once every 2 to 6 months, I&#39;ll hear and see fast-moving military jets and planes high above, but never helicopters.  On Monday and Tuesday of this week, I suddenly saw low-flying copters for the very first time.  On Monday, a big copter was flying south-southwest, possibly flying directly over my house or pretty close.  Then Tuesday, I heard and saw a military helicopter a few minutes before 11 AM flying in the exact opposite direction (north-northeast).  I don&#39;t recall the color of Monday&#39;s copter but Tuesday&#39;s had a brown bottom.  Never seen copters in this suburb of St. Louis prior to this week.  I wonder what&#39;s up.  </p>

<p>I hope the Deep State hasn&#39;t blackmailed or forced Trump into invading Syria.  I haven&#39;t had a reason in months to drive on South Kingshighway, so I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s lots of military truck movements there again like in 1990.  </p>

<p>I hope them copters ain&#39;t spraying cancer chemicals over my house. Lol.  Just kidding.  But again, the CIA, in an experiment, did spray LSD over an unsuspecting French town in the 1950s to see what would happen.  And a few people actually died.  I&#39;m sure the U.S. Junta got permission from the French Junta to use the town in the experiment.  After all, the CIA helped install the secret French Junta in the 1950s and they nearly brought down French Premiere Charles DeGaulle in 1962 or so.  DeGaulle went on the radio urging French citizens to come out onto the streets in massive demonstations to resist the combined CIA and French Junta overthrow of his government (I read that years ago in William Blum&#39;s book, &quot;The CIA: A Forgotten History&quot;).  Similarly, we saw just last year Turkey&#39;s elected leader implore Turkish citizens to come out and demonstrate against the CIA-supported Turkish military coup that tried to overthrow the Turkish government in a coup last summer.  And Turkey has always been a U.S. ally.</p>

<p>Man, the CIA has too much time and money on its hands.  Time to close them down.  Congress should grow a spine and de-fund these anti-democratic CIA fascists before they cause even more harm to our country and the world.</p>

In fact, LSD is not detectable in your blood drug tests even before the effects end. It can&#39;t be traced 8 hours after ingestion because it&#39;s so small portion of it, and most of it metabolises, and then goes out of your body within 2-3 days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys, the fact LSD lasts 4 hours is not true, but its noticeable mental effects at microdosing ranges can actually last this long. The residue body stimulation will definetly last longer,  but the mental aspect of it actually can last shorter durations.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, that&#39;s definitely possible and my information is only as good as the people I receive it from - you truly never know what you&#39;re getting. On the other hand, I&#39;ve done enough L to know what&#39;s needlepoint, what hasn&#39;t been fully synthesized, what&#39;s dirty and what feels very clean.  If someone wants to correct me, L isn&#39;t clean if your taste buds sense something metallic or bitter within 5 minutes. To me, good L brings a very pleasant warm sensation where your mind is somewhat isolated from your surroundings in a bubble yet your body melts into a profound connection to everything around you. Granted, it&#39;s been almost a year since my last experience but there was a good 4-month stretch where I did liquid drops several times a week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out Max Spiers on Youtube. Dude awakened and was eventually murdered for speaking the truth. He goes on to say, in one video, that LSD can either open your 3rd eye and allow you to glimpse into the truth of who you really are and what reality <em>really</em> is, or it can go the other route and cause massive, often long-lasting turmoil. </p>

<p>Spiers insists that we exist in a more &#39;magical&#39; reality than we can imagine. He states that Earth has been over run by a sort of vampiric consciousness, which has no ability to create in the 3d realm, and in order to make what they want, they must leech humans&#39; energy. They do this by keeping us in fear. When we are in fear, we release fearful energy. This shit, according to Spiers, can be harvested. Can you imagine the amount of powerful, fear-induced energy an entire town would give off if it suddenly, and without warning, fell into a state of LSD-induced inebriation? People must have lost their damn minds. Little did they know, their fear was being harvested and certain sick &#39;beings&#39; were likely laughing at their suffering. </p>

<p>I cannot prove that Spiers is wrong. But almost everything he says seems so true. He has opened my eyes to the world we <em>actually</em> live in, and he has convinced me to make more of an effort to let go of all suffering, all fear, and to enjoy this moment. Peace, love, and compassion over all else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We may in fact be beating around the same bush my friend. There are some things that exist within this universe that are intangible, such as your mind and body being connected through as of yet still inexplicable means. You can break down emotions into biochemical reactions and synergistic effects of the bodies myriad systems, but you still can&#39;t explain or provide evidence of the mind itself. The interface between the mind and body is something intangible and as of yet there is no tangible evidence of anything in regards to that. It&#39;s simply a given that we exist, but it&#39;s simply to tough a case for science to crack, as of yet. And I don&#39;t much like your analogy to be honest, it&#39;s quite random and beside the point I&#39;m attempting to make here. Subjective experiences are still real experiences. In fact, on a very real level, they are the only types of experience you will ever have, hence qualia. You realize that explaining/defining qualia through the scientific method would be one of the paramount achievements in all of scientific history, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you disagree that we live, collectively, in a state of amnesia? Do you disagree that the majority of humanity believes it is its own thoughts? Do you disagree that believing we are our own thoughts has prevented us from becoming who we really are? That&#39;s what I believe, or, rather, know. I know that we are living in amnesia, generally speaking, and I discovered that before I discovered Max Spiers.</p>

<p>Max Spiers was the first person I heard suggest that the world was being run, in large part, by child rapists. Then we discovered the pizzagate tunnel. More importantly, he&#39;s the first in my experience to say that the collective is living with amnesia, in that we have no idea who we are, which is preventing us from discovering what&#39;s really going on in the world. </p>

<p>The mind has grown fond of finding joy through things, believing concepts, getting caught in certain thought prisons. These thought structures are keeping us in a world of separation, rather than a world of oneness in which we see, experientially, that everything is you. I know this. Not because I am better than, but because my particular experience lead me down a certain journey where I absolutely had to go within to discover who I am, before I made the ill-advised decision to take my own life.</p>

<p>I have also said, a few times now, that I cannot prove anything Max says. Everything related to ego death is something, as you must know, is something one has to experience in one&#39;s own reality. All one can receive from another, in that regard, is guidance. Nothing else. </p>

<p>But in knowing that he, too, recognizes the state of amnesia which clouds the minds of almost all of humanity, I was open to hearing his beliefs. Hearing that he&#39;d been MK-ultra&#39;d and somehow survived provided me with the belief that he might have &#39;secretive&#39; knowledge from the deep interior of tptb. And in knowing that the story <em>always</em> goes deeper, I was hugely intrigued by his story. But, again, I never said I could prove any of it, and you continue asking for definitive, explicit proof. I can help you see that you do not exist the way you think you do, which might open up your mind to the idea that reality is being controlled by things we have trouble fathoming, or it might not. Ultimately, the entire thing is just entertainment. </p>

<p>The claims I make are outrageous to you, to the collective. But to me, they are intimate and true. I do my best to explain that which cannot be explained, and I like to think I do a decent job. But, in truth, I cannot prove <em>anything</em>. </p>

<p>we live in many states of amnesia, foremost of which is that people have forgotten who they are: nothing more than pounds of flesh whose instinctual tendencies are oftentimes in conflict with the civilizations in which they live.  i&#39;m certainly not buying that people have just forgotten that they&#39;re...&quot;not thoughts,&quot; or whatever it is that you&#39;re proposing.  when you can provide no evidence - not even a clear explanation of your belief - why would i?</p>

<p>they&#39;re not true, unfortunately that&#39;s not how truth works.  the pure subjectivity of your experience is not a reason to believe that truth, but rather a reason to second-guess it.  if i were you, not being able to &quot;prove <em>anything</em>&quot; would raise up major red flags in my train of thought: &quot;oh, i can&#39;t prove any of this?  hm, maybe i&#39;m not on the right track...&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s the best you can hope for, when you discuss such secret programs.</p>

<p>By design, they even use strategies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability">&quot;withholding of information from senior officials in order to protect them from repercussions in the event that illegal or unpopular activities by the CIA became public knowledge&quot;</a> --- meaning that upper management in the CIA won&#39;t even know the truth.</p>

<p>What did I say that suggests that I think I am profound? It really does scare me how deeply people project their own selves onto others. </p>

<p>The message I am ultimately spreading is of oneness, of love. My message is of forgetting the ego, forgetting the &#39;me&#39;, forgetting separation. And you go on to desperately make jokes that make no sense, only because you are, likely, insecure and enjoy, too much, getting high fives from other insecure teammates. </p>

<p>I said I&#39;d done drugs, not that I&#39;d done them regularly. You make assumptions, project insecurities, and make claims about things you don&#39;t even know. Reading this, you&#39;ll probably realize you were wrong and will probably make some troll-like joke to dissipate the impending sense of guilt. Unless you have no compassion, in which case you are hopeless. </p>

<p>Regardless, I know you are smart, somewhere deep in there. You should just focus your time on forgetting your beliefs of your self. That&#39;ll open your mind and reality to existing with less judgments and nonsensical assumptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. You sound like me when I was 18-19 (Except for your delusion of a monster king).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tripped a considerable amount, with high quality acid, with plenty of doses above 800 mics.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no such thing as tripping for the &quot;right reasons.&quot; I&#39;ve used it in congruence of other drugs, I&#39;ve used it for introspection, I&#39;ve used it to party, and I&#39;ve used for &quot;fuck it, I&#39;m not doing anything tonight.&quot;</p>

<p>You probably think people who have scary trips are just feeble minded and you feel superior to people who don&#39;t do drugs, even though they don&#39;t even have a second thought about you.</p>

<p>You probably think you&#39;ve unlocked the secrets of the universe and have a hard on for Alan Watts, (Though, admittedly, he is fucking awesome) and you probably spout pseudo Tao and Soto Zen Buddhist teachings without having actually ever read any of the old manuscripts.</p>

<p>You remind me of when I was younger and a lot of people I knew, but, surprise! We grew out of it. We trip every once in a while and laugh at how silly we were. The ones who didn&#39;t grow up are just wasting away and being a burden to those around them.</p>

<p>Hopefully, when you get a little bit older, you&#39;ll realize the same.</p>

<p>Either that, or you&#39;re schizophrenic, which in that case, you probably shouldn&#39;t be taking LSD (Usually).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The freedom comes when you start asking the right questions: <em>who</em> doesn&#39;t know? What is it that you are, <em>actually</em>? Question that honestly, and you might find that you don&#39;t actually exist and that you developed a &#39;you&#39;, or a center in consciousness/awareness, through memories of being told who you are, or memories where you felt great joy and which led you to think that you must be the person who did the thing that brought the joy. Right? Nah. You do not exist as a thought. The mind cannot know you, fundamentally. Thoughts developed by observing the world, the words we were given, the things others tell us are important, and so on. That creates a center through which we perceive all things. That thing gets triggered, feels suffering, holds beliefs, maintains pride in and of itself, and so on. But none of it is real. What&#39;s real is what lies beneath that. The thing in which all of your thoughts is happening is you. But, unfortunately, that&#39;s hard to conclude because the mind, particularly nowadays, chatters incessantly and we end up being swooped away by our thoughts, leaving us incapable of recognizing the truth that silently sits behind all thoughts, observing your entire lifetime. That thing is you, and it is God, or consciousness, or every thing. Sorry, this can be really hard to explain, so I apologize if I drove you nuts. Just trying to help guide to what I know is true within you. </p>

<p>God does exist, and it is you, me, and all things. You can experience that too, once you recognize that you are not your thoughts. Once that is known, you might experience a life of perpetual peace and awe. </p>

<p>A little tip: you know that feeling you get when you see a gorgeous sunset? Why do you feel that awe? You feel that awe because the mind, the judger within you, dissipates into nothingness. You forget yourself and you become this moment, which is what you really are. No longer are you comparing that moment to any other moment, because thought takes a break. Well, there&#39;s a way of becoming the moment perpetually, which is ironically also the process of becoming <em>who you really are</em>. </p>

<p>The freedom comes when you start asking the right questions: who doesn&#39;t know? What is it that you are, actually? Question that honestly, and you might find that you don&#39;t actually exist and that you developed a &#39;you&#39;, or a center in consciousness/awareness, through memories of being told who you are, or memories where you felt great joy and which led you to think that you must be the person who did the thing that brought the joy. Right? Nah. You do not exist as a thought. The mind cannot know you, fundamentally. Thoughts developed by observing the world, the words we were given, the things others tell us are important, and so on. That creates a center through which we perceive all things. That thing gets triggered, feels suffering, holds beliefs, maintains pride in and of itself, and so on. But none of it is real. What&#39;s real is what lies beneath that. The thing in which all of your thoughts is happening is you. But, unfortunately, that&#39;s hard to conclude because the mind, particularly nowadays, chatters incessantly and we end up being swooped away by our thoughts, leaving us incapable of recognizing the truth that silently sits behind all thoughts, observing your entire lifetime. That thing is you, and it is God, or consciousness, or every thing. Sorry, this can be really hard to explain, so I apologize if I drove you nuts. Just trying to help guide to what I know is true within you.</p>

<p>God does exist, and it is you, me, and all things. You can experience that too, once you recognize that you are not your thoughts. Once that is known, you might experience a life of perpetual peace and awe.</p>

<p>A little tip: you know that feeling you get when you see a gorgeous sunset? Why do you feel that awe? You feel that awe because the mind, the judger within you, dissipates into nothingness. You forget yourself and you become this moment, which is what you really are. No longer are you comparing that moment to any other moment, because thought takes a break. Well, there&#39;s a way of becoming the moment perpetually, which is ironically also the process of becoming who you really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; is not a good thing to believe.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, no beliefs are, ultimately, useful. I took drugs because I had the sober realization, while incredibly depressed, that my entire depression came from a belief. I believed that I was a hopeless person. Yet, deep down, I knew that I was a promising, loving individual who could survive just fine and add value to this world. </p>

<p>But, how could I know I am one thing (a depressed &#39;me&#39;), while attempting to become the &#39;me&#39; that I know I <em>really</em> am? That lead to an existential crisis, and the drugs aided me in opening my mind to truly understand what the hell my mind was realizing.</p>

<p>The thing that &#39;thinks&#39; it exists isn&#39;t actually you. What you are lies beyond thought. Thought happens within your awareness of it; have you ever noticed? What each of us <em>truly</em> is is awareness. That awareness, or consciousness, is God. It is all things, but it is also nothing. No thing. Our ego thinks, therefore our ego is. But that isn&#39;t <em>actually</em> you. There is more. Just as the rabbit hole goes deeper out in the world, so too does it go deeper with you. As above, so below. </p>

<p>There is a God, and it is you, and me, and the universe. There is no separation. That separation is an illusion, which manifests when you believe you are your thoughts. Believing you are your thoughts creates the ego, through which we then see all of life. It&#39;s why we suffer, it&#39;s why we hate, it&#39;s why we fight, and it&#39;s what prevents us from making this world the thing we really want it to be. That&#39;s just my take, though. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny to me that, here we are, sitting on the edge of our seats because we all believe in a deep state that pulls the strings behind our reality, and which will kill millions of innocent people for its own gain. But if one suggests the rabbit hole might go deeper, one is mocked. Lol. But it goes deeper. You&#39;ll see that once you recognize the illusion you&#39;re living as (ego/thought). Oh, and I&#39;m not &#39;the other guy&#39;. As a matter of fact, there is no &#39;other than&#39; you. I am you, and you are me :) good luck on the journey</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, man. You&#39;re smart to do it for certain reasons and to not just throw the acid on your tongue with a &#39;fuck it&#39; mentality. </p>

<p>I suggest getting into meditation, if you haven&#39;t already, in order to develop mindfulness. By becoming mindful, you can enter into a very peaceful state. And it&#39;s in that state, where you feel a sort of &#39;oneness&#39; with everything, that the mind or consciousness will really start gifting you with certain intuitive realizations.  </p>

<p>The first time I ever took LSD, I listened to a podcast by Alan Watts. For the first time, I could understand everything he was saying in a genuine fashion. I attribute my ability to accurately <em>feel</em> what he was saying to the LSD, because it opened my mind, meaning my ego dissipated and I no longer listened to anything as a &#39;me&#39; (a &#39;me&#39; is really just a remembered set of beliefs). </p>

<p>In other words, if you meditate enough and are able to enter into that state of -- I know it sounds weird to put it this way -- not having a &#39;me&#39;, or not being interrupted by your impulsive and incessant thoughts (which disagree, or close your mind when you think something doesn&#39;t run true to what you&#39;ve been told in the past), and pair it with LSD, it can honestly warp your world into something more real than you can ever imagine. </p>

<p>Deep within us all is a child. Eventually, once this game we play outside ourselves comes to an end, there will be massive suffering. That suffering will cause all of humanity to look within. Looking within, we will discover that, for our entire lives, we have believed we are our thoughts. We have believed in separation. We have believed we come into the universe, rather than coming <em>out of</em> the universe. And this realization is where massive, unfathomable change will come. Total oneness. That&#39;s the answer, man. Good luck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I don&#39;t believe any of that, I just come here for the LOLs.  The problem with your theory is that it&#39;s too outlandish.  Pretty much everything you&#39;ve talked about here can more reliably be explained by the general laziness of the human population.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more interesting theories to explore that have some basis in scientific facts.  For example, have you ever heard about the holographic universe theory?  Basically the idea is that we&#39;re not actually three-dimensional, but rather we are holographic projections on the &#39;walls&#39; of the universe.  If this is true, then imagine what kind of power true three-dimensional beings would have over you... :-)</p>

<p>If you really want to go on an acid trip, try imagining the universe pushed down a couple dimensions.  You&#39;re in a large round room.  On the walls are lines tracing the existence of simple 3D beings where you can easily see their beginning and end.  Looking out across the room you see protrusions like gravity maps defining all of the galaxies or perhaps other universes, and floating in the air around everything are creatures of even higher dimensions.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s not exactly how reality looks, but it&#39;s a good starting point for you... :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, my friend, a great response! I have plenty to add  but am on a treadmill. I know my suggested theory sounds nuts. That&#39;s my theory for what&#39;s going on <em>outside</em> my own self. But if I speak to you about my journey within, I think you&#39;ll appreciate what I have to say. Everything is, in a sense, a hologram. But more importantly, everything is One. Literally. And that can be experienced. Oneness can and will be experienced, eventually, once the suffering reaches a certain point in the world outside us. It&#39;s going to drive people inward for answers. I&#39;ll send more your way later -- with info that seems less outlandish. </p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Said I&#39;d leave you more info, and I just left this for another person and it&#39;s related to what we discussed, so you might get a kick out of reading my &#39;beliefs&#39;. Appreciated what you had to say, and it also gave me a kick-ass sober trip considering what you suggested. Be well!</h2>

<p>The freedom comes when you start asking the right questions: who doesn&#39;t know? What is it that you are, actually? Question that honestly, and you might find that you don&#39;t actually exist and that you developed a &#39;you&#39;, or a center in consciousness/awareness, through memories of being told who you are, or memories where you felt great joy and which led you to think that you must be the person who did the thing that brought the joy. Right? Nah. You do not exist as a thought. The mind cannot know you, fundamentally. Thoughts developed by observing the world, the words we were given, the things others tell us are important, and so on. That creates a center through which we perceive all things. That thing gets triggered, feels suffering, holds beliefs, maintains pride in and of itself, and so on. But none of it is real. What&#39;s real is what lies beneath that. The thing in which all of your thoughts is happening is you. But, unfortunately, that&#39;s hard to conclude because the mind, particularly nowadays, chatters incessantly and we end up being swooped away by our thoughts, leaving us incapable of recognizing the truth that silently sits behind all thoughts, observing your entire lifetime. That thing is you, and it is God, or consciousness, or every thing. Sorry, this can be really hard to explain, so I apologize if I drove you nuts. Just trying to help guide to what I know is true within you.</p>

<p>God does exist, and it is you, me, and all things. You can experience that too, once you recognize that you are not your thoughts. Once that is known, you might experience a life of perpetual peace and awe.</p>

<p>A little tip: you know that feeling you get when you see a gorgeous sunset? Why do you feel that awe? You feel that awe because the mind, the judger within you, dissipates into nothingness. You forget yourself and you become this moment, which is what you really are. No longer are you comparing that moment to any other moment, because thought takes a break. Well, there&#39;s a way of becoming the moment perpetually, which is ironically also the process of becoming who you really are.</p>

I know a lot about what makes people tick and I see how a large number of functions in our brains interact to create the complex results that we observe in everyday behavior.  I&#39;ve also considered the nature of my existence, as I&#39;m sure most people have, but my conclusions are grim.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing I can do prove the latter. I apologize for seeming condescending, although I have no clue where you gathered that belief. I do not know the personalities of each person to whom I write. Don&#39;t know who is sensitive, who is not. I am just being honest; speaking from heart.</p>

<p>Until one recognizes the <em>fact</em> that none of us exist as our thoughts, as our &#39;me&#39;, it is very, very challenging to convince one that the world might be a game, right now, for otherworldly beings. I mean, a year ago, I would have laughed at and mocked myself. But, after the experiences I&#39;ve had with ego death, which has opened my eyes to the state of amnesia almost all of humanity exists in, I couldn&#39;t help but be drawn to Max Spiers and his truth. And if you actually give him a listen, you might find your own self very intrigued. </p>

<p>I can understand why someone wouldn&#39;t believe me. I can also understand why someone wouldn&#39;t want to believe me. It sounds absurd, sure. But all of this shit sounds absurd. We are living in a world where WW3 might actually happen and where we sit on conspiracy boards praying tptb do not inhumanely drop a nuke on we innocent people. </p>

<p>I have no facts, only videos for you to watch. But spend time focusing on your ego and what &#39;you&#39; really are, and you might begin craving deeper truth from the world outside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the implication that your understanding of reality is miles beyond another plebian&#39;s is inherently condescending.  i certainly take no offense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if you actually give him a listen, you might find your own self very intrigued. </p>

<p>if you can&#39;t compel me to give this concept a shred of clout, i&#39;m not sure how someone else can.</p>

<p>you&#39;re equating two completely different things, which i already outlined earlier: one involves (or is at least easily explainable involving only) real people, one does not.  absurdity is not a valid defense in the same way that it is not a valid criticism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But spend time focusing on your ego and what &#39;you&#39; really are, and you might begin craving deeper truth from the world outside. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>what makes your claims so incredibly ridiculous to me is that i <em>have</em> spent a good amount of time taking psychadelic drugs, and have even experienced a loss of self.  i have come to understandings of the world and my place in it as a result of these experiences.  the difference is that my conclusions are ones that i could have made just as well without the use of drugs.  they also don&#39;t involve wild, untestable claims.</p>

<p>See. We live in the era of ego. Consciousness has been inverted, creating a &#39;me&#39; which can get depressed. I was deeply depressed for years, which is what ultimately sparked my journey towards inner and outer truth. And I&#39;ve discovered that humanity believes it is its thoughts, which is to believe in an illusion and which has fueled thousands of years of separation. Nothing to be depressed about, man. I completely feel you. Your daughter will be fine, I know it in my heart. I suggest letting go of every belief in how things <em>should</em> be and to accept them, genuinely and completely, as they are. <em>That</em> is when man begins discovering who he is and what reality might actually be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much hate, judgment. Holier than thou? I make a blatant effort to acknowledge that I am, by no means, better than anyone, in any way, because becoming &quot;enlightened&quot; really just means becoming the true state in which no beliefs exist. I&#39;m not better than anyone. The way I speak via text might&#39;ve made you think that. </p>

<p>When attempting to guide <em>anyone</em> to the root of truth, it often becomes necessary for one to speak with a sort of certainty, an exaggerated certainty, in order to make sense of what I am trying to say. I speak with emotion, from heart, and through experience. If you spoke to me in person, you wouldn&#39;t gather the &quot;You&#39;re a cocky ass hole&quot; sense that it seems you developed.</p>

<p>Also, what does me being in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, on reddit, on a massive internet thread, have anything to do with being less legitimate than if I were in an ashram? Why is one thing more important, or more &#39;serious&#39; than another? I am speaking truth, trying to help those who are curious. The only people who call me out as being &#39;conceited&#39; are people who see my words as personality, and not my words as words. In other words, they read into my emotion, because I write with emotion, and assume I&#39;m an ass hole, when in truth, I&#39;m not being an ass hole and the person isn&#39;t <em>actually</em> reading the words I&#39;m writing. </p>

<p>And, in all honesty, the fact that you took the time to call me out as pretentious based on <em>how</em> I write, rather than the point I&#39;m actually making, screams that you are projecting your own reality, your own beliefs, your own way of reading, onto what I was saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what the Gnostics were trying to tell people over 2,000 years ago.  They call these parasitic beings the Archons, and they feed off of low consciousness vibratory energy - fear, anger, resentment, sadness, pain.  They are extremely deceptive and sometimes masquerade as archangels or &#39;benevolent&#39; beings when they are really of a false Light that is self-serving.  They seek to deceive the souls that incarnate on this planet and make them forget their greater connection to Source reality (what the Gnostics called the Divine Spark).  In this illusion of separation they have supported people and causes throughout history that have turned this into a prison planet.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m barely scratching the surface with my explanation and I encourage everyone to look into the Gnostic creation mythos and the concept of the Archons.  David Icke and John Lamb Lash have spoken extensively on the subject.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>cut and paste from a previous post of mine:</p>

<p>This story is completely true in every detail to the best of my recollection; nothing is dramatized or exaggerated in any way. It happened to me about a quarter of a century ago. I told my wife what happened at that time, and she can verify that the landlord told her the same thing he told me.</p>

<p><strong>It came in the middle of the day.</strong></p>

<p>I was sitting upright in bad, on top of the covers, wide awake, eyes open, simply reading a book. I felt a sense of doom; it was as if the air pressure changed, the atmosphere was pressing down on me; I became suddenly and dreadfully afraid. The nature of my reality changed; in that moment I was propelled into hyper-reality; I sensed everything in overwhelming detail. I have never had an experience more real, before or after this moment, in my entire life.</p>

<p>I looked up from my book to see a dark being, a void filled with stars materialize at the bedroom doorway; it had a humanoid form. I sensed intelligence; it cocked it&#39;s head as it approached, as if to better evaluate my response. It&#39;s approach was swift and calculated; it entered quickly and approached the bed directly in the manner of an invader who has done this many times and expects no resistance.</p>

<p>In an instant it was upon me, pinning me to the bed; it held me down with the cold weight of the universe, so fast there was no chance to respond except to gasp and then it leaned in and kissed me, sealing my mouth tightly. As I breathed out, it breathed in, stealing my breath out of my body. I couldn&#39;t catch my breath; every time I breathed in, I inhaled the exhalation of the demon, but there was no oxygen just the frosty emptiness of space. I knew that it had come to feed on my fear.</p>

<p>I responded by digging deep down and tapping knowledge I didn&#39;t know I had; in that moment all of my ancestors were with me. I generated confidence, strength, and overwhelming power, and then I did something very strange: I laughed.</p>

<p>The demon shook it&#39;s head as if it tasted something bitter, reared back and regarded me closely; it seemed to realize something, there was a moment of recognition: I was not the person it had expected to find. In an instant, it was gone.</p>

<p>I sat up to catch my breath. I examined the moment carefully, my thoughts racing. I understood the phenomenon of sleep paralysis, but I had not woken up; I was never asleep, there was no question about that. I had not consumed any drugs; I wasn&#39;t ill or compromised in any way. This was something new; I had no way to explain this experience.</p>

<p>The next day I came home to find the landlords daughter playing at the bottom of the stairs. As I came down, she approached me; she was very young and I had trouble understanding her child talk. &quot;Did you know that somebody died in your bed?&quot; she asked, innocently. I looked at her; my first thought was that there was something mentally wrong with her, for such a small child to speak like this out of the blue. I changed the topic and she went back to playing with her dolls.</p>

<p>Later that night I asked my landlord about it. He took me aside into his office, closed the door and explained carefully that the previous tenant had been addicted to drugs, and had overdosed and died in that very bed. As he described the details of her life and her last weeks, I understood fully the nature of the beast. This being from another dimension was a feeder of negative emotions; it&#39;s simple proximity generated feelings of overwhelming fear, which it could eat. It had found this poor girl in a moment of weakness and stalked her, she became constantly afraid without knowing why. Her life became a constant struggle, in her downward spiral she turned to drugs. The demon encouraged her fall and fed on her fear. When it came that night, it was expecting her, but she had died and I was there instead.</p>

<p>An educated man or doctor would say that I had experienced a moment of sleep paralysis. It&#39;s quite common, they would say. The experience of hyper-reality is commonly reported, and it can happen when you are awake.
I am not a superstitious man. I don&#39;t believe in demons, ghosts or spirits. I find myself split; there is a part of me that understands the reality of what I experienced that night; it knows that there are beings who roam everywhere, feeding on the fear of men; they are lovers of conflict. war and misery. I know that they will never go hungry. I know that simply by explaining this reality to you, I have opened a door in your mind, and for that I am truly sorry. The demons can find you now, and they will come for you. I&#39;m sorry. It is better that you know the truth; you have a defense, where before you had none. There is no turning back; no escape. You must know thyself, build and live a life that is true to yourself and believe in yourself without reservation. Nothing else matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, man. Keep going. It&#39;s wild. Obviously you can think for yourself, but if I can offer advice (and this advice is something I heard from an enlightened guru, and it ironically ended up being said by Spiers in one of his videos): only keep the information that speaks to your heart, your soul. All of this stuff is encoded, I believe, in our DNA. Have you ever read something and it just <em>felt</em> true? I think you might have similar experiences reading about or listening to Max Spiers. Good luck on your journey.</p>

<p>And yes, I know that Yippie activist Abbie Hoffman was hit over the head with a guitar by Pete Townsend during The Who&#39;s set at Woodstock.

    <div class="md"><p>LSD would not affect the crops like that. It would actually probably never make it to harvest as sunlight would destroy it before it can. Also one of the big problems ergot causes when it&#39;s eaten is it fucks with the cardiovascular system to a ridiculous amount. Interestingly, LSD doesn&#39;t do that near as much. In fact this is one of the reasons it preferable to so many truly comparable psychedelics (LSA, NBOMEs, etc.) Which can cause circulation issue in your extremities that in ergotism gets so bad as to be dangerous. </p>

<p>It is much more plausible that if suddenly an entire village starts having visual distortions and seeing everything melting before their eyes with no apparent cause, people will start behaving in a panicked way that will lead to deaths.

&#39;&#39;Feinman Todd says she folded and gave Woodward what she calls “the pearl”: She told Woodward about a meeting she sat in on with Hillary Clinton, Mary Catherine Bateson, and the New Age author Jean Houston in the White House Solarium, where Houston guided Clinton through an exercise of imagining she was talking to Eleanor Roosevelt, then inhabiting Roosevelt’s persona and reversing the conversation. Clinton also “spoke” to Mahatma Gandhi during the exercise.</p>

<p>Feinman Todd says she revealed this under the condition Woodward didn’t use it, but after returning to the US after traveling in Europe, she found herself strangely frozen out by Hillary Clinton and uncredited in the book, a minor Clinton scandal that became known as “Thankyougate.” &#39;&#39;  <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/02/06/barbara-feinman-todd-bob-woodward-burned-hillary-clinton/">https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/02/06/barbara-feinman-todd-bob-woodward-burned-hillary-clinton/</a><br/>
Jean Houston was one of the most prolific LSD and psilocybin researchers in history, who now runs a power elite new age cult for the wealthy.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s incorrect. It would be very difficult to overdose on LSD, but it certainly is possible.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t seem to find the link now, but I remember reading that one of the only recorded deaths from LSD overdose was a man who intravenously injected over 150mg of LSD, believing it to be amphetamines, resulting in his death. To put that in perspective, the average dose of LSD is approximately 100 micrograms. </p>

<p>So overdosing on LSD is possible, just highly expensive and impractical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know the exact process, but it is highly difficult and requires an advanced understanding of chemistry and sophisticated equipment typically only used in legitimate laboratories; hence why a vast majority of LSD is produced by legitimate chemists in labs and is very rarely produced by amateurs. </p>

<p><a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/lsd2.htm">This</a> gives a fairly decent rundown:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Making LSD requires a strong working knowledge of organic chemistry, a complete laboratory setup (including the ability to sterilize equipment as well as access to a darkroom), and several chemicals that are currently either sales restricted or have their sales closely monitored by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Unlike the chemicals used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, they can&#39;t be found in fairly ordinary household items.</p>

<p>Yes. One can only assume you are ignorant on the subject. I can give you a place to start if you are interested in learning about the subject. Two books: &quot;Acid Dreams&quot; and &quot;Storming Heaven&quot; goes into great detail of the CIA&#39;s long term promotion of LSD.</p>

<p>I would really not agree with the fact that depression can be cured by being healthy and exercising. It&#39;s your brain, it&#39;s not your body, who suffers. By being healthy, your body is healthy. If you have something wrong in your brain, no being healthy and exercising will heal that. It will help it, I agree, but you can&#39;t heal it fully with these things. </p>

<p>LSD is good for anxiety and depression because it shows you another point of view, not the depressing / anxious one you&#39;re used to. I wouldn&#39;t call him drug dependent, he just has to discover the fact that HE is healing himself and is using LSD just as a medium, not that the drug is healing him.

<p>Um, your brain is part of your body. Exercise and diet has a significant effect on your brain, which is, after all, just a physical organ in your body. You may be thinking of the &quot;mind&quot; - which is a religious notion. There is no &quot;mind&quot; there is only your brain.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve taken LSD more than once. It&#39;s not a miracle drug, it&#39;s not &quot;enlightening&quot; - it&#39;s just a drug. It can be really fun but once you stop taking it for a while you realize there is no &quot;there&quot; there. It&#39;s just a drug.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, you got this all wrong. LSD is any different because it&#39;s used for its psychoactive effects (the high), unlike other anti-anxiety drugs, and anti-depressants. I don&#39;t think LSD enlightens you, it gives you the option of another point of view. I completely agree with your stance on the pot heads, even though I am a pot head too. </p>

<p>Why would you need to be religious to know that your mind affects your everyday life, and everything you do is thought out by mind, not the body? I never said mind is like a soul. I probably should not have said mind, but consciousness and self-awareness.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t ever said LSD is a miracle drug, but I am pretty sure LSD is enlightening in its way, and it can sure affect your thinking long-term. The afterglow and the change of opinion is not the same, but both can happen from taking LSD. The afterglow definetly goes away, but the change of opinion based on your expierence might not go away.</p>

<p>What I would say is that LSD changes your way of thinking which can change your opinions on things. You, however, need to contribute to that changes. You need to be the change, not the LSD. Next time, probably concentrate on the thinking part, not on the visual one :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, if you want to go to the detail, then the fact that these two act completely differently on completely different receptors in your brain makes the highs very different. Alcohol makes you not give a fuck, LSD does not. LSD elevates your state of consciousness, alcohol does not. Alcohol is neurotoxic and damages your brain, LSD does not. I haven&#39;t seen a single fucking thing from you that made any sense, neither anything that would even signalize that you used LSD. </p>

<p>Get your head out of your ass and probably listen to someone who actually knows what he&#39;s talking about. I am done with talking to someone who&#39;s denying the facts that have been proven by thousands of people, and by many scientists.</p>

<p>Do you think people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates openly lie about the facts that LSD changed them positively? Do you think they would talk about it, or praise it, if it had not made a single change in their thinking or creativity processes? </p>

<p>LSD elevates your state of consciousness, alcohol does not. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bzzt - there you go again. LSD does not &quot;elevate your state of consciousness&quot; - that phrase has no objective meaning, at all. Consciousness does not &quot;elevate.&quot; What is that even supposed to MEAN?</p>

<p>What LSD actually does is distort thought processes and perceptions due to mimicking certain neurotransmitters and disrupting serotonin levels. There&#39;s nothing &quot;elevating&quot; about it, nor &quot;boundary breaking&quot; about it. It is just making your brain malfunction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad to look at those books and I appreciate the direction. I&#39;m not ignorant of the CIA having been involved early on, I just have come to find that LSD has transcended any CIA involvement. LSD also preceded the CIA involvement. You must remember that Albert Hoffman was the chemist that introduced the drug to humanity. He, I imagine. had a different vision for its use than the CIA did. I find that vision more in line with how I use the drug.</p>

<p>So sure, my knowledge is limited on the CIA involvement in it. I&#39;m more concerned with the failed drug policies that pervade our society and the drug propaganda that brainwashes people into thinking like you do. You wrongly judge me based on my drug use. </p>

<p>As far as having a drug dependence, you are quite wrong, by about 6 months and a different drug. I have been an Iv drug user since I was 17, 11 years ago. At 14 I first tried heroin, methamphetamines, mdma, etc... most people aren&#39;t faced with the choice of using hard drugs or not at 14. I was given the choice and I paid the price of that choice. I have had 2 of my best friends die. I have been incarcerated 17 times including prison. I&#39;ve been homeless, and near the end I attempted suicide by jumping off a 80ft. Gorge. I know the perils and pain associated with drug dependence in a world of drug prohibition. What I do now pales in comparison to what one could consider dependence. I use nothing but the occasional psychedelic and a lil marijuana And it funking works.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s best not to advise people over the internet on what they should do. I just get tired of people chiming in on there hatred of my existence as a drug user. I&#39;m not sorry that I use drugs and I&#39;m proud of who I am. Give me some support bro, I haven&#39;t used heroin in 6 months. That&#39;s a goddamn miracle considering the statistics. Give credit where credits due. I&#39;d be struggling just that much more without LSD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool bro, let&#39;s just put random unsuspecting people under it.</p>

<p>Even if people were fine with it: LSD, like all drugs, is an escape. </p>

<p>It lets you peer into a world you would otherwise have access to if you didn&#39;t live in society that robs you of your innate gifts and abilities-- a society that forces you be and act a certain way in order to survive in it (for the most part). It also mitigates your anxiety because it takes you out of those feelings, just like opiates take you out of pain; they transport you emotionally to the plane you should be at if you hadn&#39;t been damaged as a child/by society.</p>

<p>All drugs are like this</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>•Alcohol unlocks your natural inclination to socialise and have fun (it actually slows your brain so it cannot process away your existing emotions and your natural emotions then come out unfiltered e.g. an angry person gets angry and breaks stuff, a sociable person parties, and a shy scared person gets nervous and sick or cries. Sadly, alcohol is the worst of all drugs because it&#39;s so common and allows you to more easily maintain a cycle of denying your emotions (usually to work a shitty job) and then unlock them with alcohol (partying in the weekend or drinking with mates) without ever actually changing your life for the better.</p>

<p>•Caffeine unlockes your natural energy and drive. This is the drive you naturally have unlimited access to if you were doing something you enjoyed in the first place. If you remember, as a kid, especially when playing sports: you had unlimited access to this energy. This easily gets destroyed by forcing yourself to have drive for things you don&#39;t really want like money or success, or even competition with one another.
•MDMA unlocks your natural love and joy. Few will remember experiencing this feeling without drugs because it is something you would have likely only felt at birth. It is the connection with God, yourself or your soulmate and often turns sexual because the feeling is meant to normally be felt in a union with your soulmate, not at festivals with random people you don&#39;t know nor have any connection to. Few will remember having actually experienced it without drugs because it is one of the first to go when you are born. This is because society and your parents expect you to behave in such a wildly different way to the way you were made to be that it must go unless you fight against the feelings given to you which is very difficult when you are very young and everyone around you is very large. Other people still experience the feelings of other drugs without them because they are more easily accepted in society i.e. drive to pursue something, or creativity, or socializing: there are many people who can seem like the are drunk, on caffeine, or on weed without actually ever being on those drugs because they are accessing those emotions. </p>

<p>•Weed unlocks mostly creative energies. I find it depends on the strain, but nothing that can&#39;t also be unlocked by doing an art you love and immerse yourself in. It also relaxes, clears your mind to help you connect with ideas, and helps you connect with sexual energies as many drugs do.
•Opiates put you on a higher plane that takes you out of your internal pain and relaxes you (neurotransmitters are just a function, not a cause of this). All drugs do this, but opiates seem to only do this. You will find this feeling to some degree with most drugs--a sense of extacy is actually how you&#39;re normally supposed to feel: completely devoid of internal pain.
That&#39;s why you will notice, coming down, you can feel how you actually feel all the time--which is often quite painful (because of held on emotions that cause stress within the body).
•LSD, I find, helps me unlock a childish energy or a more natural personality of myself. It allows me to connect with the world if I were still a child and find a Matilda like fun and view of everything. 
•Ayahuasca helps me connect with more medium energies: I have definitely connected to spirits on it.</p>

<p>Many also unlock your natural sexual energy because all of these energies are to some degree sexual. Connection with God and your soulmate is a sexual connection: this just means a pure connection that gives and takes simultaneously: it is a sharing of feelings and as drugs heighten your ability to give and accept emotion the sexuality obviously increases.</p>

<p>Ultimately, while you may love drugs, you actually just love the natural feelings and emotions in-built into your soul. Unfortunately we live in a world devoid of love, passion, and creativity--largely in place of success and achievement. In fact, many people&#39;s happiness is simply founded on how others perceive them, rather than anything they&#39;ve actually ever done in their life. You need only turn on reality TV to see this. I am not saying I am better than you as I too used to use drugs a lot. But I am now aware that the feelings they allow me to access are innate. I&#39;ve started writing again, something I did as a child, and it has allowed me to unlock higher levels of creativity than many of the drugs I once took did.</p>

<p>What&#39;s even worse about all of this is the likelihood that the people in control of society are intentionally forcing society to maintain this unloving behavior to keep people in slavery so they are forced to use drugs and ignore their soul for the gratification of the evil spirits manipulating them. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also not saying drugs are bad: drugs have helped me open up to my natural emotions and allowed me insight. However, simply crying, experiencing your natural emotions, and forming a relationship with God allows you to do this more sustainably all whilst actually removing your negative emotions that cause you to need drugs in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wanted to throw out that DMT seems to be quite a wonderful and therapeutic drug for me personally. One use of it can elevate my consciousness far past the initial experience. I&#39;m not quite sure emotional therapy is capable of changing things on any large level without incorporating drugs into it, especially for those that have an innate attraction to drugs.  Many members of our society really could use a kick in the ass that is Dmt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Emotional clearing is just like DMT: until you&#39;ve done it and experienced it for yourself you will never know what is really capable of doing to you. I could go on and on about the transcendental experiences I&#39;ve had as a result of simply crying, but instead I will leave this resource that helped me:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/WizardShak">https://www.youtube.com/user/WizardShak</a></p>

<p>I will state though that when they talk about soulmates I did have an emotional experience that did lead me to find my soulmate as well as passions God gave me. </p>

<p>The truth is that any drug that can give you anything can be done through emotional clearing. Even DMT--you can visit those dimensions through advanced lucid dreaming.</p>

<p>I also just want to quickly say that you, as a drug user--especially DMT, must know it isn&#39;t the drug that does anything. It just transports you to somewhere that actually exists. There is nothing in the drug itself, it just interacts with your brain in a certain way to either detune from your body or to open up certain internal emotions. With emotional therapy you can remove a lot of the reasons that you aren&#39;t just connected with these feelings 24/7.</p>

<p>Also, an innate attraction for drugs is a desire for change. If you didn&#39;t want change why would you take the drug? If you were experiencing pure bliss, why would you take ecstacy? You&#39;re already there right? So attraction to drugs is a sign you are unhappy or looking for something more. Emotional therapy is perfect for these people because at least they are on the verge of looking at a real change in their life. The problem with drugs is it allows people to experience what actual change is like without ever doing it. This is why drugs are so addictive, and why people get so addicted for so long: it allows them to basically stagnate. It gives them the illussion of going one way while they continue to go another. The unemployed dope fiend can still feel like he&#39;s on top of the world when he&#39;s being crushed beneath it.</p>

<p>It takes serious science to make fentanyl. Either somebody sold it to the dealers who are cutting it into their horse supply or the supply was sabotaged. Drug dealers aren&#39;t moral by any means but they are good businessmen and adulterating a product is a good way to lose clientele.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m naive but ever since the story popped up it&#39;s felt wrong, and it seems to me that it&#39;s a bit convenient that stronger opioids ended up in heroin all the sudden. It swooped in like a hero and killed thousands of lowest-caste Americans. Somebody won here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems sort of oblique but I can see the rationalization.</p>

<p>What bothers me with border control isn&#39;t the people coming in as much as the contraband. I&#39;m all for 100% legal drugs (all drugs), but that comes with the caveat of it being made in the USA. For me this matters because American cannabis is some of the best anymore where it&#39;s been legalized. I&#39;d bet some of the work coming out of legal states is as well grown as Amsterdam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If heroin was legalized, it could be sold in exact doses, premixed and sterile, with syringes and needles and iso wipes as part of the deal. It would be pure and unadulterated.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been of the mentality that we can already see the negatives of these drugs. Most people want to avoid the negative consequences (hell, there are people who don&#39;t smoke pot or drink simply because they don&#39;t want it in their life). The people who we want around will be smart enough to either a) not use, or b) use responsibly. I know alcohol is a very prime example of this not working but I have another spiel about alcohol that&#39;s too long for this post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be the story.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I believe it though. That seems like a whole lot of work. If you&#39;re already selling heroin, why would you boost the heroin with fentanyl? I can understand cutting fentanyl and selling it as heroin but that would be obvious based upon the appearance of the cutting agent. But adding more drugs to your existing drugs to make them sell better seems like a lot more work than the return would suggest. I suppose it could be cut under the assumption that the base heroin sucks and the fentanyl makes up for lack of purity or something but on a massive scale you&#39;d probably make more doing a purification than cutting in synthetics.</p>

Carfentanil is anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 times stronger than morphine and yet is nearly just as easy to synthesize. There is a very clear-cut reason for why people will buy carfentanil, an opioid analgesic exactly like heroin and morphine but tens of thousands o times more potent, to cut into fillers and sell as heroin. Carfentanil is currently being sold for about $3,700 per kilo (2.2 POUNDS) while heroin is imported from pakistan for around $2,600 per kilo. But remember, carfentanil does the exact same thin, costs only 1.5x as much, but is tens of thousands of times more potent which means it can be cut and sold for prices magnitudes higher than heroin/morphine are being sold for currently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re really underestimating how easy it is to manipulate chemical structures and produce analogs that bind well-near irreversibly to μ opioid receptors. Carfentanil was synthesized by a team of chemists in Belgium who were looking for a potent opioid analgesic to tranquilize very large animals like elephants and hippos. And I do agree that for the average dope cutter, chopping up carfentanil will not end well for him. However, There are many heroin dealers that know how to use nitrile gloves and organic respirators. If you have any evidence of government agencies ordering or using carfentanil against &quot;undesirables&quot; please send it my way through either a comment or a PM.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not hard to connect a and b... As I said, the nigga in the hood slanging dope doesn&#39;t want to kill off his client base... Sure they may have fucked up once ordering carfent to cut his dope once... But there&#39;s been numerous waves of Carfentanyl now... Niggas are down to do 10years fed time for heroin, no one wants to do a life sentence.. The Fed&#39;s and state people give dealers murder charges now if they can prove their dope killed someone... Also notice that no one has been arrested for, carfentanyl?there&#39;s been busts for fentanyl and analogues like furylfentanyl but no one has been busted for carfent which is what is killing so many people...  Fentanyl and furylfentnyl are super easy to volumetrically dilute... Carfent is literally the tip of a needle to OD off of nearly making it impossible to use to cut... </p>

<p>Not to mention it is schedule II... Meaning highly regulated and you cannot import it like you can with the grey area fentanyl analogues that really aren&#39;t scheduled thus aren&#39;t totally illegal (yeah they could charge you under the analogue act but that is unlikely)... Which means that whoever is actually bringing the carfentany in to cut the dope has legal standing (IE a DEA license to obtain/import it)</p>

<p>The issue is measuring it correctly before cutting. A gram of fentanyl is equivalent to 10,000 doses at 100ug. It seems like a fundamental discount of what the drug is, what it does, how dangerous it is, and the equipment required to cut correctly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a drive in the 90&#39;s to add pain as the 5th vital sign. It was based on misinformation about risks of addiction. It was minimized. The Joint Commission which gives hospitals accreditation still takes the stance that if patients must report adequate pain management and hospitals still do the pain scale with each set of vitals. On top of this compensation of hospitals  from Medicare is directly linked through a survey which gives you an HCAHPS survey.  If you get a lower score you get less money. One of the items on the survey is the question: Is your pain controlled well? </p>

<p>So doctors have financial incentive to game the scores.  But, most of it is actually hospital driven not doctor driven.</p>

<p>AMA recommended abandoning assessing for pain with each set of vitals. </p>

I don&#39;t believe the profit incentive can be fully cut out of the equation (ultimately) in regards to healthcare, or that it&#39;s inherently bad, yet it can very easily without strict oversight produce problems like the opiate epidemic. For those with severe pain, it really is a pain in the ass and beyond stressful trying to get medicine, having doctors doubt you or say you&#39;re lying, I really empathize with those people but at the same time those doctors, hospitals, and pharma companies and possibly the CIA/DEA played a role in this epidemic.

<p>There is a real dilemma. Pain was being severely under treated in emergency departments.  But, now for example, if your vitals are done you get asked for a pain score 1-10.  The goal is 0. So if you say your pain is a 3 you get your pain treated.  In a hospital unit where your vitals are taken every 4 hours that would mean you get a pain pill every 4 hours.  There is a general opinion that we should move away from this type of pain management goal and instead develop tools that help us assess whether or not pain gets in the way of activities of daily life or life satisfaction etc. Balance has to be restored to the judgment of healthcare providers a little bit. The algorithmic approach of - you say pain level is 8 while laughing and you receive 2 pills of Percocet is not working. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All good on the beginning. I&#39;ve just never heard of China (or any Asian nation) selling opiates to the west on the open market at all. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carfentanil#Importation_from_China_and_increase_in_illicit_use">Wikipedia</a> China has no regulatory controls on the drug. I doubt there is a contract between a US and Chinese corporation importing it but you can sure as hell get Chinese carfentanyl over the internet.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would you say the inability to sell other medicines like Canadian only helps pharma companies or is there some benefit to the consumer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a benefit to big pharma companies though the laws were first implemented years ago for purity reasons. This does not prevent foreign drug companies from operating in America. It only restricts certain controlled drugs. Today there is a huge prescription mail order drug market between Canada and a handful of European nations, and America. It would be legal but for the fact that it is illegal to fill the prescription you got in New York in Scotland and have them mail it back to you.  One apparent benefit of Bush fleecing the postal service is that they no longer care about searching packages so much. Of course the media hype of Granny illegally buying her Tylenol 3&#39;s online from Canada died out years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t just spray LSD over France they also sprayed chemicals and micro-oganisms over much of Great Britain and at least 239 locations in the U.S.A.</p>

<p>When wondering about the chemtrail-phenomenon and what possible purposes it may serve (releasing substances on the public, changing the climate, altering the atmospheric stability or maybe all of those and more together) it seems a bit unlikely that TPTB would poison the air they and their children have to breath themselves. </p>

<p>Apparently it is no secret though and has already been reported more than 20 years ago, that the air above the U.S. and GB has been poisoned for decades in secret military trials. According to the Guardian and the New York Times millions of Americans and Britons have been used as human guinea pigs, to test certain chemicals, micro organisms and fungi.</p>

<p>The information that has partially been made available due to the freedom of information act (for the U.S. data) only describes the military activity until 1979, but why would they just stop their experiments there, what did they actually find out in their trials and how did they continue after 1979? </p>

<p>This is only the information that has been made available for the public, it is quite possible that they have sprayed more substances over more locations. </p>

<p>Millions of people being sprayed with chemicals and micro-organisms, all of this reported by the MSM, why has this not become a big scandal? </p>

<p>Maybe because the reports are referencing to trials, that had been conducted  several decades before the articles appeared. To long ago to be relevant? Or maybe the MSM just didn&#39;t repeat the story often enough. If the MSM want a story to gain traction, they usually are echoing it again and again and again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/21/uk.medicalscience">http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/21/uk.medicalscience</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Much of Britain was exposed to bacteria sprayed in secret trials</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public.</p>

<p>A government report just released provides for the first time a comprehensive official history of Britain&#39;s biological weapons trials between 1940 and 1979.</p>

<p>Many of these tests involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Army released an organism called Aspergillus fumigatus at the Norfolk Naval Supply Center because most workers were black; for some reason, the testers imagined an enemy might target the blacks at military bases. &quot;Since Negroes are more susceptible to coccidioides than are whites,&quot; a report said, &quot;this fungus disease was simulated by using Aspergillus fumigatus.&quot; Aspergillus, further, was known to cause lethal infections.</p>

<p>In 1949, and for 20 years afterward, the Army released bacteria among millions of unsuspecting people. At hearings in 1977, Pentagon witnesses acknowledged that bacteria and chemical particles were sprayed over San Francisco, St. Louis, Minneapolis and 236 other populated locations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if H1N1 and those other diseases were intentionally released to test the spread of highly infectious disease. It was like they couldn&#39;t stop touting the numbers, which had to be coming from somewhere (CDC). H1N1 also had an advantage in that it was both aggressive, long-term, and very obvious with it&#39;s symptoms. It also killed a lot of people, which for the flu is pretty impressive. To me it was a test of what percentage of the population might survive something much more severe.</p>

<p>I personally think the typical chemtrail theory (that many or most contrails are secretly chemtrails)  is disinformation that was intentionally spread to discredit real reports of chemtrails. By pushing so many false accusations of chemtrailing, the real ones get lost in the noise. </p>

<p>We weren&#39;t even supposed to know that this terrible program took place but whistleblowers who came before us allowed this to be known. The CIA is the biggest purveyor of violence and terrorism in the world. MLK Jr. said it himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not this specific incident but incidents of this magnitude and even worse were disclosed by those documents. My point was that the CIA has perpetrated far worse acts than what happened in France. This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. You are supposed to be open minded. We&#39;ll probably never find out if the CIA actually perpetrated this experiment on the town, but it isn&#39;t outside of their scope of terrible actions. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pro-America.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m anti-CIA. </p>

<p>I suppose a Russian citizen who is pro-Russia would be anti-KGB / anti-FSB.</p>

<p>For those who don&#39;t yet realize how bad the CIA is for our country, the CIA is robbing and destroying America like the KGB is robbing and destroying Russia.  In retirement, President Truman understood this about the CIA and regretted signing the law that created the agency.  He even called for the &quot;Operations&quot; Directorate of the CIA to be shut down about a month after President John Kennedy was assassinated.</p>

<p>As I understand it, while president, Truman was very reluctant to sign the law creating the CIA because he didn&#39;t think we needed an &quot;operations&quot; agency like that during peacetime, when the country was not at war.  Texas Republican Ron Paul has said the CIA has taken over the country.</p>

<p>Anyone else suddenly seeing military helicopters flying overhead for the first time?  I remember in 1990 in the buildup to Papa Bush&#39;s Desert Storm incursion into Kuwait to fight Iraqi troops (remember Papa Bush never did invade Iraq, just entered Kuwait) that I&#39;d see day after day lots of military truck traffic on South Kingshighway as I would drive to Forest Park and Washington University&#39;s library.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I&#39;m not going to bother with the rest--because who has time--but this is factually incorrect. Operation Desert Storm, which was the operational name for the invasion of Iraq in the first Gulf War, took place 17 January – 28 February 1991. George HW Bush was president from January 20, 1989 – January 20, 1993.</p>

<p>Look it up.</p>

We see &amp; hear weird stuff all the time but last week we woke up at 4:05 a.m. to the loudest rumbling noise we&#39;ve ever heard/felt. The ground was vibrating. The windows were shaking. Sometimes there are low flying usaf planes/helicopters but this was different. We actually had a conversation quickly about north korea wondering if the shit hit the fan. The sky was clear. No clouds. No thunder. No lightening. We didn&#39;t see any blinking lights from planes/jet/helicopters. The rumbling stopped after about 5 minutes. We laid back down and it started again about 4:40. Last about 7 minutes. Other people in our small town who live 15 miles from us also heard/felt the noise/rumbling. Needless to say we are all a little unsettled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish OP had brought up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra</a> to back up this post. Instead people are casting this off as another <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> post with no evidence. The CIA has done FAR WORSE than what happened to this town. A lot of it was done during Project MKUltra. They were attempting to mind control people with this. It&#39;s not fantasy, it&#39;s fucking facts. This happened and nothing has occurred since then that would cause the CIA to change their ways. The amount of people coming onto this sub to defend this organization is sickening. Disgusting. </p>

<p>We wouldn&#39;t even know about this terrible Project if it weren&#39;t for a whistleblower who decided not to follow the CIA Director&#39;s orders to destroy all of the files associated with Project MKUltra. 30,000 files are all we have on this completely illegal and immoral Project. </p>

<p>This is easily explained via confirmation bias.  I live near an airport.  I also have a neighbor who is a pilot.  We can be outside talking with a few people and a plane or helicopter will fly over and we&#39;ll be the only people to take notice of it.  Another example is people who live near train tracks that never notice the train unless you point it out to them.</p>

<p>Besides, LSD in an aerosol form doesn&#39;t do that much. Just ask Aum Shinrikyo. They pumped the stuff out of their cars without so much as an incident before they decided on Sarin. </p>

<p>The Gulf War (2 August 1990 – 28 February 1991), codenamed Operation Desert Shield (2 August 1990 – 17 January 1991) for operations leading to the buildup of troops and defense of Saudi Arabia and Operation Desert Storm (17 January 1991 – 28 February 1991) in its combat phase, was a war waged by coalition forces from 35 nations led by the United States against Iraq in response to Iraq&#39;s invasion and annexation of Kuwait.</p>

Also one of the big problems ergot causes when it&#39;s eaten is it fucks with the cardiovascular system to a ridiculous amount. Interestingly, LSD doesn&#39;t do that near as much. In fact this is one of the reasons it preferable to so many truly comparable psychedelics (LSA, NBOMEs, etc.) Which can cause circulation issue in your extremities that in ergotism gets so bad as to be dangerous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would just be such an uneven dosing to various people, there would be no way to gain any insight if you don&#39;t know how much more the farmer in the field got than the teacher in the school house. I know the government gave it to unknowing people in more controlled situations, but just misting a town does not make much sense. So yeah, I am very skeptical also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No! The truth is absolutely, unequivocally ineffable. Words can guide one to the truth of being, but it cannot be explained. </p>

<p>Alan Watts -- “There is no such thing as ‘the truth’ that can be stated. In other words, ask the question: ‘What is the true position of the stars in the Big Dipper?’ Well it depends on where you’re looking at them from.” </p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave it there. To each his own. </p>
