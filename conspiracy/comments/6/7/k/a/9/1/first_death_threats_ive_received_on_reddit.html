<p>Did I just get &quot;lucky&quot; pissing off a troll, or is there more to it?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some background reading on 911 being a nuclear attack included in the appendix of this article:</p>

<p>Nah. I just told him the truth, that anyone who threatens me becomes a target of remote neural sensing technologies. That&#39;s how the spooks really deal with dissidents. If they can&#39;t use remote sensing to get the target to kill themselves (aaron schwartz), discredit themselves (michael hastings before car accident), then they use the technology to create stalkers for the target. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how they keep the celebrities under wraps too. Mind control stalkers (think john lennon killer) so they have to get security (handlers) or are too distracted or afraid to get into politics which requires public appearances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. The joke is everyone is exposed to T.A.M.I, I just drew his attention to it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secret #2. But more profoundly, he discovered that he could influence brain waves if precisely timed with a return training signal. He had no idea that at this moment in history, he had accidentally destroyed democracy as we envision it to be. The military and surveillance community immediately picked up on the patent and within two years had reprogrammed their communications and surveillance satellites and terrestrial phased arrays with the new concepts. The rapid deployment of this technology occurred because it only required software changes in already existing radar, imaging, and communications’ terrestrial dishes and satellites. Many additional spy satellites have been launched since to bolster the system. So in 1976, on the bicentennial of this great nation, a system called TAMI was born. TAMI is an acronym for “Thought Amplifier and Mind Interface”. A more invasive “Big Brother” technology came about before George Orwell’s prediction of 1984.</p>

<p>The global system, TAMI, can hone in on a compatible mind and instantly be able to manipulate it to some varying degree dependent upon many factors. The offense practices their trade by influencing people near a targeted individual to convey information only pertinent to them, for spy games. These people are everyday citizens unfamiliar with this high technology. The effects are so subtle without lots of training to detect, nobody would be the wiser. </p>

<p>My response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A death threat is a threat, often made anonymously, by one person or a group of people to kill another person or group of people. These threats are often designed to intimidate victims in order to manipulate their behavior, and <strong>thus a death threat can be a form of coercion.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am certain that everything of value in this world is compromised.  As such, if blue-pillers realize that we&#39;ve been misled about 9/11 all this time, they&#39;ll flip shit, and will lead to the discovery they they&#39;re living in the fucking Truman Show.  I often think about the ramifications of what would happen if the general public realized this.  Then I immediately understand why those in power are willing to lie steal and even kill to protect the illusions they&#39;ve created.  We live in a world where were slaves, minions if you will, to those in the secret club.  Tavistock probably conceived 9/11.  Speaking of which, funny how terms like deep state and false flag are now accepted in mainstream vocabulary, out of nowhere, yet no one knows about Tavistock, the fucking puppet masters behind those terms.  I&#39;m so tilted at humanity these days...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t open these links at the moment because I am at work, but I have a couple of questions if you are able to answer them at all. Is this similar to how a person would section their mind off to remove certain emotions, or be able to act a certain way? I have been playing around with ideas like this lately in my own life, running my own little social experiments on myself. I tell you right now, feels almost impossible to secrete part of yourself away and essentially split into two people sharing a body. To be able to switch between those at will would be another great feat. I do not think it possible alone though, or at least not in a timely fashion.
I have come to the realisation that I enjoy exactly who I am, my individuality and expression, to add or take away from that feels like a huge crime to me. If you don&#39;t know exactly who you are, how can you be confident in the decisions you make?</p>

<p>Also, say I look into this massive manipulation and agree that certain minds can be targeted, would you have any tips on how to avoid not being aware of this?</p>

<p>No. I&#39;m talking about 50ft potholes that according to the official narrative, were left thousands of years ago by glaciers. Look at the pics </p>

<p>To be honest I&#39;ve talked about nuclear 911 for a year without death threats. I just wondered if maybe its more sensitive topic if Gotham Shield is cover for a upcoming nuclear attack.</p>
