He&#39;s making literally all of it up, with the exception of his explanations of other people&#39;s concepts, many of which he barely seems to understand. None of what you generously describe as &#39;his theories&#39; is based in actual observation or on the mathematical implications thereof and it&#39;s not our fault that you lack the scientific literacy to see that none of his original ideas hold any more scientific significance than the song &#39;what if god was one of us&#39; by joan osborne.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no problem with the kid feeling all those big, weird oceanic philosophical feelings we all get when we ponder that kind of silly, trite nonsense for the first time, but <em>he really is trying to say he&#39;s found the key</em>. He&#39;s exploring nothing but the insides of his own mind, which is fine. Adding the pretense that he&#39;s a genius or that he has anything of value to add to any scientific conversation at this point in his life is simply unhealthy for him.</p>

<p>Calling him a genius for the dumb youtube videos he makes will ruin him. To allow him to think he&#39;s actually on to something when he hasn&#39;t even begun to build the theoretical foundations that could allow him to someday make a meaningful contribution to physics robs him of any opportunity he might have to be a real scientist one day.</p>

<p>And, once again, the kid <em>doesn&#39;t have any scientific theories</em>. A theory in science is a consistent testable paradigm that can make actual predictions about the world around us. This kid has at best the equivalent of a bunch of Harry Potter fan-theories about the world. They may blow the minds of the scientifically illiterate, but they are a complete dead end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this very comment you&#39;re demonstrating that you don&#39;t have the scientific background to judge whether I know what I&#39;m talking about. There&#39;s a special window of ignorance where people know just enough that their magic bubble of confidence protects them from learning any more. You&#39;re sitting in that bubble and it looks pretty dim in there from the outside.</p>

<p>If you think his &quot;free energy device&quot; (it&#39;s a simple radio receiver) could power the world you need to take remedial middle school physics. It receives energy from radio transmitters. Therefore, it can never receive as much energy as is put into the broadcast.</p>

<p>Sure, he gives a rudimentary explanation of the concept of orders of infinity in the course of the video. That&#39;s real math with real potential applications. He didn&#39;t contribute a single thought to that field, though. That&#39;s not his own work. He&#39;s just very poorly explaining some really basic shit about it that he saw in a vsauce video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you can dress up your comment anyway you like, but you&#39;re wrong.
Also nobody said his invention WOULD power the world, its an idea. a springboard for other more sustainable ideas. that was your fault for not understanding the point i was making. 
all you provided was- 1. a personal attack. 2. a misunderstood (on your part) concept. and a begrudged agreement, followed by an explanation on what it was that made him form his own theory on the topic in the first place.</p>

<p>you&#39;re shitting on the kid for no reason. you can talk shit to me and attack me but you&#39;re still wrong.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t BS me. The words &#39;free energy device that could potentially power the whole world for free&#39; literally appear in your last comment. If you understood the physics behind it, you&#39;d know that it can&#39;t be a springboard for more sustainable ideas. It&#39;s a dead end.</p>

<p>Once again, <em>he didn&#39;t form any theory</em>. He&#39;s read about other people&#39;s theories and he&#39;s made up some shit about being cosmically transported to another dimension when the old one blew up. That&#39;s not a theory. It&#39;s not even a hypothesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>uh yeah- it did... because i was quoting the article. hahaha
and he never said &quot;blew up&quot; he  theorized that the energy transfered. E=mc2.  you clearly dont grasp whats going on here. im good on you. hahaha bye.</p>
