       Before I begin this is not meant to be some hit piece or anti Muslim piece but an actual question regarding Islamic dogma. I hold no ill will to individual Muslims but I do disagree heavily with the religion and I do think it is a very negative force on this world. Now that my views are out of the way I would like to bring something to everyone's attention. Some one in a YouTube video brought up very interesting point regarding Islamic dogma where there are four types of lies allowed to be given to non Muslims about Islam.

       Comment Begins
      </p>
      <p>
       1)Taqiyya - Taqiyya allows Muslims to lie or conceal their true faith, feelings, thoughts, plans, and character, for the purpose of protecting themselves. It is fully based on Quran and is agreed to and practiced by all major sects of Islam.
“When it is possible to achieve an aim by lying but not by telling the truth, it is permissible to lie if attaining the goal is permissible, and lying is obligatory if the goal is obligatory."
      </p>
      <p>
       2)Tawriya - Tawriya allows Muslims to “creatively lie” by being purposely ambiguous about the real meaning of what they are saying. 
Example "You are getting it wrong/ You are taking it out of context/ Ohh it's not the real meaning of that verse."
You wouldn't search context in case of a wife beating husband? would you? But there's verse in Quran for this too, a man can legally beat any of his wives from whom he senses arrogance or disobedience. 
Here's the verse,
       <a href="https://quran.com/4/34">
        https://quran.com/4/34
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Kitman - Kitman is a term that means Muslims are permitted to tell half-truths, or partial truths, while concealing the greater whole truth. Discussion of “jihad” as being only an “inner” or “spiritual” struggle is an example of Kitman, as technically it is true that jihad refers to spiritual struggle, but conceals the very real physical aspect that is also encompassed by jihad. When the whole world becomes muslim, then jihad will only mean spiritual struggle, but since it's not, physical struggle is encouraged in Quran, the few muslims who chose the path of physical jihad are called "martyrs" and will be granted access to heaven in consideration, physical struggle is allowed to get disbelievers on the right path i.e Islam !
      </p>
      <p>
       Muruna - Muruna is perhaps the biggest deception practiced by Muslims, as it allows them to be “flexible” regarding the commands of their faith in order to properly blend in with the society around them. Muruna permits Muslims to shave their beards, wear Western clothing, listen to Western music, and even drink alcohol. All of these deceptions go against specific commandments, as well as the overarching commandment against lying itself, that are found in the Quran. But they are allowed so long as their use contributes to a greater goal or serves a greater commandment within the Quran, like spreading Islam among the disbelievers.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Note - Not all western muslims know about Muruna or Kitman, especially the younger generation in this case, but the older generation and especially the islamic preachers &amp; debaters very well know about all 4 deceptions and accordingly use it to their advantage.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - I am reporting comments which are unnecessarily accusing me of islamophobia, I don't hate individual followers of any religion. I am specifically talking about ideology or system of ideas here, and ideas by their very nature are debatable. If you have any doubts you can google search all these 4 deceptions, no need to take me word for word !
      </p>
      <p>
       Some peaceful verses from the official &amp; secure site of Quran, now not all followers may believe it, but it doesn't help the fact these are the words of all knowing perfect being !
       <a href="https://quran.com/8/12-14">
        https://quran.com/8/12-14
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Comment Ends
      </p>
      <p>
       So after reading that there are four types of deception allowed by Muslims from the Quran to use on non Muslims. When it comes to debates about the effects Islam may or may not have on countries it occupies, on people, on culture, or even on Muslims who say they don't support these things, can we trust them? I personally do not think so on the topic of Islam. If I am wrong about believing this theory please debate and tell me why.

       I wouldn't trust any human being to not lie about their beliefs if they saw it as a means to an end. Doesn't matter if they're Muslim or not. Sure, their book says they can lie to non-muslims, but do you really think they don't lie to each other too? That Christians wouldn't lie about their faith if they felt the means justified their ends? People are people, and they tend to be open to bending/misrepresenting their beliefs when it will benefit them.

       Of course some people lie about X for a means to an end if they feel the ends justify the means. I think its particularly alarming you're sanctioned by your holy book to lie however. For example those Christians are lying but it is not advocated for by their religion, so despite it. But in the same situation Muslims would be lying, and likely at much higher rate, due to it being religiously sanctioned (many people do take their religion this seriously), to lie about it to further its reach.

       Nah, not buying that, sorry. The book saying it's okay to lie doesn't make me think they're more likely to lie. The Bible says lots of things are okay, that people still don't do.  I think you're reaching pretty far because you don't like Muslims. "Muslims lie at a higher rate" is a laughable statement and not something that could be proven. It's clear from your post history you'll disagree with me regardless of what I say though. Just felt like I needed to reality check your shitty argument.

       So you're telling me people won't be more likely to do an action, especially if they want the ends that action provides, if their book sanctions it?. Christianity has gone through huge reformation, Islam hasn't. They're apples and oranges at this point.

       Yeah, I'm telling you that just because their holy book says you can lie, doesn't make them more likely to do it. The Bible, according to some interpretations, says you can stone gays. I'm an atheist, and I don't think my friends are more likely to stone a gay person, just because their book sanctions it. Again, you made an awful argument and it's clear you're just reaching to justify it. I didn't say Islam wasn't without problems, but your argument was "Muslims are more likely to lie". Which is bullshit and something you couldn't ever prove.

       Why would you not be more likely to lie, if your religion says you can lie, and you want the ends those lies provide? You're sacrificing no morality and you're not tainting your religion, you're also spreading your religion, so you're doing the right thing in the process. So why exactly would some one who follows said religion, not do what their religion preaches, especially if it is the right thing in their mind?

       I've made my argument, and again, it's not like we'll be changing each other's mind. You asked for thoughts on your argument, I told you I think it's a shitty one. There are plenty of reasons to not be a fan of Islam in today's world, this isn't one of them.

       I asked for a debate, you're not free from counter criticism of your counter points or argument. The objective of a debate is to, debate, critically discuss the points at hand. You're just spouting things and refusing to answer my counter arguments.

       I'm not just spouting things any more than you are. I gave you my counterpoints. Chiefly, just because a book says it's okay, doesn't mean everyone will act on it. I'm not obligated to respond to every point you make. I told you I disagree, and why. You told me you disagree with my views, and why. The point of a debate is to discuss, but I'm not obligated to continue if I don't think it's fruitful. Neither of us will change each other's mind, ergo, I'm done with the conversation. There's no winning, you'll never say "you know you're right, they're not more likely to lie". Why would I waste more of my night arguing with someone who really just wants to spout shitty theories on why you can't trust Muslims? Answer, I don't anymore.

       You are spouting things, and I will explain why. You make a statement, IE, they will not lie anymore than anyone else, I make a counter statement, that they will lie more than other groups because it is sanctioned and in the best interests of their faith, and people take their faith seriously. And then you just retort back to your same point, you think they will not lie anymore than anyone else. You didn't address the point I made, you just repeated yourself, that isn't good debate, the objective is to discuss and critically access the situation. I think it is very logical to assume that if your faith calls for something, and you believe in your faith, you will do it. You have yet to tell me why that would not apply to this faith, and to people who are faithful, when they do other things that their faith commands. You just repeat your first point. You didn't come to debate, you came to make a statement and want it validated.

       Bullshit. Problem with your example. YOU made the first statement. I responded with a counter statement. Your statement is "you can't trust Muslims, they're more likely to lie to you than others". I refuted it. It is on you to back your statement up, you're the one who made a claim. What proof do you have? besides assuming every follower of Islam is a robot, following their holy book to a T. You claim I just make the same statement, but that's all you've done. Literally the only point you've made is "their book says it's okay, so they are more likely to lie." You don't get to shift the burden of proof onto me like that. Your only proof is "the book says". Which completely ignores human realities about how devout someone may or may not be. Fuck you, and your attempt at mental gymnastics.

       You made your counter point, I made my counter point by using deductive reasoning because the subject of people lying, cannot be measure with statistics or inductive reasoning, by the vary nature of lying. How are you supposed to prove when some one is delibretly lieing or not with statistics, you can't. That is why you use deductive reasoning. Example of this.

       Nah, I'm done with your bullshit and mental gymnastics. Fact is, you made a claim "Muslims lie more than others" and you've not nothing to back it up other than "their book says so". It's a gross oversimplification of issues pertaining to faith, piousness and morals. The burden of proof is on the person making the original argument/claim, and yours is weak. You just admitted you can't prove it. So fuck off with your hateful claim you have no real way to prove.

       My argument. The religion advocates for lying to spread the religion, spreading the religion is seen as a very good thing in said religion, because of this they are likely to lie to spread their religion, especially if they have convictions. They also have no major force acting against this, no cultural pressure, nothing, only thing they have is to benefit, there for it is logical to conclude they will lie.

       Oh just fuck off. You don't get to accuse me of "saying the same thing over and over" and then say "I will repeat my argument". I told you, I don't think it makes them more likely, issues of piousness and morals aren't that simple. As if every Muslim followed the same doctrine in the same manner. There is too much you can't prove about this blanket claim "Muslims are more likely to lie". You do not get to make an argument, and then shift all the burden of proof to those who object. It's bullshit and you seem intelligent enough (although kind of hateful) to know that. I don't have to prove they aren't more likely to lie. All you have is "their book says". I've told you why I disagree. You're free to disagree with me. You're not free to use bullshit argumentative tactics and edited comments to try and shift the burden of proof onto me. For that, I say FUCK YOU.

       I will repeat my argument until you answer it. You don't answer some ones argument by saying, "its bad argument" You answer it by going through the argument and dismantling it. I didn't just make a claim, I provided a reason for my claim. You're being disingenuous if you sit there and say it isn't valid to claim something, then provide evidence and reasoning for your claim. I made an argument, to counter your argument saying they are not more likely to lie because anyone can lie. Your rebuttals for it are either your first point, or insults and personal attacks, and being disingenuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're saying I can't edit my comment literally seconds after, to improve grammar and refine a point I was making, that doesn't seem fair at all. A literal minute of refining grammar and your argument isn't disingenuous.

       I have answered it, several times. I told you I don't think the issue is simple enough to make that statement. I'm done with you, it's a fruitless discussion at this point. You made a shitty generalization "Muslims are more likely to lie". It's not my job to prove it wrong, just because you can't prove it is right. Honestly though, it's more sinister than that. This is what hateful assholes like you do, you obfuscate the real discussion by claiming your opponents argument has the holes yours does. By forcing the burden of proof for proving/disproving your hateful claim onto others. You have zero proof a Muslim is more likely to lie, you've admitted such proof likely couldn't be generated. In the absence of proof, your "inductive reasoning" is just a blanket statement about a large, diverse group of people. There's nothing you can say to prove it, but you attempt to legitimize your hatred by making it part of an actual discussion. Peace out, I've made my points plenty clear, although I'm sure you'll contest that point.

       Dude, people lie everyday, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Atheists. They lie about all kinds of things. I had a friend who told a girl his Vette was in the shop, and he worked the night shift at a casino, but he really worked at the gas station and drive a broke down trailblazer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if, Donald Trump, was like:
      </p>
      <p>
       "hey guys, so we're gonna make Muslims register to put them in a database because they're such a huge threat to everyone, you know, more than the US government who is responsible for many millions of innocent deaths , yeah well they're worse, so we're gonna make them register, then we're throwing them in camps, and we're gonna makeup them pay for the camps too, you'll see. It'll be great."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then yeah, I wouldn't blame a Muslim for lying about their faith. Read the talmud if you really want your head to spin, or the actual Quran to understand better so you're not living in ignorance/fear instead of some fear mongering shit on the internet. Buy an actual Quran book, and sit down and read it, not on the computer. Then maybe you won't be so afraid of the big bad Muslims. I swear, the media has done a stellar job, they got to you. You're sitting here worried about the guy making your chicken shawarma instead of the shit they're spraying in the air every sunny morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a Muslim, and I'm certain, 99.9% of Muslims would never deny that they're Muslim because they are proud of it, and not ashamed at all. That's why women wearing hijab will wear them in the heart of the most racist states, they are not afraid, they are proud. Muslims very rarely waiver in their faith, because they have a solid foundation to stand upon.

       You're ignoring the reason some one like Trump has the justification to put Muslims in a data base to begin with. But I don't want authorative measures like that, so lets just not put ourselves in a situation where we need that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're Muslim, I know this sounds rude but given the evidence in my post, since you're allowed to lie to non believers about your religion, how can anyone trust your intentions about Islam?

       I'd also like to point out, if you have to lie about your faith in the western world, which is extremely liberal socially, then your faith is the one with the problem, lol.

       You're not being rude at all, but Muslims having to constantly explain themselves for absolutely no reason at all other than the MSM telling you we're the boogeyman is quite tiring, no offense.

       First allow me to explain your question of taqqiyah, the sect that used it historically are Shia Muslims, which is what I am. They didn't use it against "non believers," but against the Sunni Muslims who were literally crucifying Shia Muslims. You'd have to be a dummy to willingly die when it can be avoided by lying to an oppressive regime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, no one is lying in the western world about being a Muslim, on the contrary, Muslim women are wearing their headscarves and are getting attacked by cowards on a regular basis in this "extremely liberal" western society; our faith is not the problem at all...
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm tired of having to defend my religion because of the demonization done by Jewish owned media to dehumanize us and make killing us no big deal for that dirty dollar. If you want to know more about Islam, go to the root of Islam itself and read the Quran as part of your research.

       Did you know the Koran is not published in chronological order? The chapters are printed in order of length. This is for outsiders..
      </p>
      <p>
       Muhammad started off preaching his religion and got few followers, he left Mecca for Medina and invented jihad and became a warlord and taught the destruction of non-Islamic civilisations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Koran things are not clear, which allows for Dualism. Oh that is said? But so is this! Violence? But look, peace!
      </p>
      <p>
       The only trouble is the Doctrine of Abrogation, Muhammad taught that things he made up as he went along override prior teachings, that the later verse is better than the earlier verse if they are in conflict. Once the story of Muhammad is put in order, things make sense, and it becomes clear that ISIS and others are simply following Muhammad's teachings more closely than someone who isn't trying to destroy non-Islamic civilisation and kill non-Muslims in violent jihad.

       Islamic scripture is actually

       and not just the Koran.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seek out the works of Dr Bill Warner, books, lectures, twitter, statistical analysis of texts, the lot. He is very clear. He also did a great course with an ex-Muslim, also on YouTube and a site of its own, called The Islamic Dilemma.

       HAHA, not an argument. Are you saying English speaking Muslims are not Muslims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Muhammad is Allah's "divine human prototype" and perfect Muslim. Islam means to emulate Muhammad. What he did is Islamic what he didn't do is forbidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can if you are curious, which I know for sure you're not, learn the life of Muhammad. That's how you become a 100% Muslim, emulating Muhammad 100%. Most Muslims (thankfully) do not emulate him in the violent ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go and learn the life of Muhammad, Allah's perfect man, and you will see the Islamic pattern of life described, in the life of Muhammad.

       ..........there is no original text for one thing. A more original scripture was found after a while of Islam being established and it was burned so as not to cause problems. The original language is a highly obscure dialect and is translated into the Arabic version you speak of also. So the question for the Arabic speakers is do you speak the original dialect, and the answer is no. It is the life of Muhammad that is key. His is the perfect pattern of life, and the example of the prophet is what is taught by the imams.

       The story of Muhammad's perfect life is what defines Islamic. You can understand the deeds and actions of a man, probably better than the illiterate Muslims in the world (about 98% of women in Afghanistan cannot read for example).
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not need to be able to read an ancient dialect that all modern korans are translations of to be able to follow the example of Muhammad. Go and learn the story of Muhammad's life rather than ask me questions about it. Muhammad is the only and final source on what is Islamic, what he did is Islamic what he didn't do is forbidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are even instructed to splash water in your underpants after urination so you may convince yourself any droplets felt are water and not urine. Why, because of.. you guessed it. Muhammad's actions.

       No, you are wrong. Sorry you keep digging yourself deeper and becoming more petty while ignoring more and more simple facts. Why does believing in the God of Muhammad or not make you more able to understand the life of the prophet Muhammad the perfect man?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you able to learn about the life of Hitler without being yourself a nazi? the answer is yes. Go and study some history my boy. Muhammad's life. Go and look into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you say he WASN'T a warlord who committed genocide and owned sex slave markets and crucified people and burned them alive and beheaded people and ordered murders of satirical poets and ordered chopping off of hands and feet and melting hot iron into people's eye sockets and conquering lands with his military troops? Are you saying he was a good man?
      </p>
      <p>
       No. You are saying nothing because you don't know anything about Muhammad. So you are ignorant of the life of the prophet of a major world religion and political movement. I am replying to you for others to see my answers. If this was a private message I would consider you beyond hope and not waste my time. Go learn about Muhammad. This is my message to you and to everybody.

       Within Islam, yes. It was not a later Muslim, it was invented by the man himself. And jihad is unlike anything else, it is total subversion tactics, jihad by the pen, money, mouth, and sword. To wipe out non-Islamic civilisation.

       The Muslim Brotherhood in America has in their 1991 strategic goals meeting documents an interesting quote:

       Here is a graph of jihad content in Islamic scripture. You can see he invented jihad and Islamic political warfare after he left Mecca, and the Meccan Koran and medinan Koran are very different (earlier, later):

       I will repeat my argument until you answer it. You don't answer some ones argument by saying, "its bad argument" You answer it by going through the argument and dismantling it. I didn't just make a claim, I provided a reason for my claim. You're being disingenuous if you sit there and say it isn't valid to claim something, then provide evidence and reasoning for your claim. I made an argument, to counter your argument saying they are not more likely to lie because anyone can lie. Your rebuttals for it are either your first point, or insults and personal attacks, and being disingenuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're saying I can't edit my comment literally seconds after, to improve grammar and refine a point I was making, that doesn't seem fair at all. A literal minute of refining grammar and your argument isn't disingenuous.
