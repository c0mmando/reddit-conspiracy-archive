        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before I begin this is not meant to be some hit piece or anti Muslim piece but an actual question regarding Islamic dogma. I hold no ill will to individual Muslims but I do disagree heavily with the religion and I do think it is a very negative force on this world. Now that my views are out of the way I would like to bring something to everyone&#39;s attention. Some one in a YouTube video brought up very interesting point regarding Islamic dogma where there are four types of lies allowed to be given to non Muslims about Islam.</p>

<p>The video with the comment by user Robert Oppenheimer1</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nEGdKeT4B0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nEGdKeT4B0</a></p>

<p>Comment Begins</p>

<p>1)Taqiyya - Taqiyya allows Muslims to lie or conceal their true faith, feelings, thoughts, plans, and character, for the purpose of protecting themselves. It is fully based on Quran and is agreed to and practiced by all major sects of Islam.
“When it is possible to achieve an aim by lying but not by telling the truth, it is permissible to lie if attaining the goal is permissible, and lying is obligatory if the goal is obligatory.&quot;</p>

<p>2)Tawriya - Tawriya allows Muslims to “creatively lie” by being purposely ambiguous about the real meaning of what they are saying. 
Example &quot;You are getting it wrong/ You are taking it out of context/ Ohh it&#39;s not the real meaning of that verse.&quot;
You wouldn&#39;t search context in case of a wife beating husband? would you? But there&#39;s verse in Quran for this too, a man can legally beat any of his wives from whom he senses arrogance or disobedience. 
Here&#39;s the verse, <a href="https://quran.com/4/34">https://quran.com/4/34</a></p>

<p>Kitman - Kitman is a term that means Muslims are permitted to tell half-truths, or partial truths, while concealing the greater whole truth. Discussion of “jihad” as being only an “inner” or “spiritual” struggle is an example of Kitman, as technically it is true that jihad refers to spiritual struggle, but conceals the very real physical aspect that is also encompassed by jihad. When the whole world becomes muslim, then jihad will only mean spiritual struggle, but since it&#39;s not, physical struggle is encouraged in Quran, the few muslims who chose the path of physical jihad are called &quot;martyrs&quot; and will be granted access to heaven in consideration, physical struggle is allowed to get disbelievers on the right path i.e Islam !</p>

<p>Muruna - Muruna is perhaps the biggest deception practiced by Muslims, as it allows them to be “flexible” regarding the commands of their faith in order to properly blend in with the society around them. Muruna permits Muslims to shave their beards, wear Western clothing, listen to Western music, and even drink alcohol. All of these deceptions go against specific commandments, as well as the overarching commandment against lying itself, that are found in the Quran. But they are allowed so long as their use contributes to a greater goal or serves a greater commandment within the Quran, like spreading Islam among the disbelievers.</p>

<p>(Note - Not all western muslims know about Muruna or Kitman, especially the younger generation in this case, but the older generation and especially the islamic preachers &amp; debaters very well know about all 4 deceptions and accordingly use it to their advantage.)</p>

<p>Edit - I am reporting comments which are unnecessarily accusing me of islamophobia, I don&#39;t hate individual followers of any religion. I am specifically talking about ideology or system of ideas here, and ideas by their very nature are debatable. If you have any doubts you can google search all these 4 deceptions, no need to take me word for word !</p>

<p>Some peaceful verses from the official &amp; secure site of Quran, now not all followers may believe it, but it doesn&#39;t help the fact these are the words of all knowing perfect being ! <a href="https://quran.com/8/12-14">https://quran.com/8/12-14</a></p>

<p>Comment Ends</p>

<p>So after reading that there are four types of deception allowed by Muslims from the Quran to use on non Muslims. When it comes to debates about the effects Islam may or may not have on countries it occupies, on people, on culture, or even on Muslims who say they don&#39;t support these things, can we trust them? I personally do not think so on the topic of Islam. If I am wrong about believing this theory please debate and tell me why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t trust any human being to not lie about their beliefs if they saw it as a means to an end. Doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re Muslim or not. Sure, their book says they can lie to non-muslims, but do you really think they don&#39;t lie to each other too? That Christians wouldn&#39;t lie about their faith if they felt the means justified their ends? People are people, and they tend to be open to bending/misrepresenting their beliefs when it will benefit them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course some people lie about X for a means to an end if they feel the ends justify the means. I think its particularly alarming you&#39;re sanctioned by your holy book to lie however. For example those Christians are lying but it is not advocated for by their religion, so despite it. But in the same situation Muslims would be lying, and likely at much higher rate, due to it being religiously sanctioned (many people do take their religion this seriously), to lie about it to further its reach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, not buying that, sorry. The book saying it&#39;s okay to lie doesn&#39;t make me think they&#39;re more likely to lie. The Bible says lots of things are okay, that people still don&#39;t do.  I think you&#39;re reaching pretty far because you don&#39;t like Muslims. &quot;Muslims lie at a higher rate&quot; is a laughable statement and not something that could be proven. It&#39;s clear from your post history you&#39;ll disagree with me regardless of what I say though. Just felt like I needed to reality check your shitty argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re telling me people won&#39;t be more likely to do an action, especially if they want the ends that action provides, if their book sanctions it?. Christianity has gone through huge reformation, Islam hasn&#39;t. They&#39;re apples and oranges at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m telling you that just because their holy book says you can lie, doesn&#39;t make them more likely to do it. The Bible, according to some interpretations, says you can stone gays. I&#39;m an atheist, and I don&#39;t think my friends are more likely to stone a gay person, just because their book sanctions it. Again, you made an awful argument and it&#39;s clear you&#39;re just reaching to justify it. I didn&#39;t say Islam wasn&#39;t without problems, but your argument was &quot;Muslims are more likely to lie&quot;. Which is bullshit and something you couldn&#39;t ever prove. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you not be more likely to lie, if your religion says you can lie, and you want the ends those lies provide? You&#39;re sacrificing no morality and you&#39;re not tainting your religion, you&#39;re also spreading your religion, so you&#39;re doing the right thing in the process. So why exactly would some one who follows said religion, not do what their religion preaches, especially if it is the right thing in their mind? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are spouting things, and I will explain why. You make a statement, IE, they will not lie anymore than anyone else, I make a counter statement, that they will lie more than other groups because it is sanctioned and in the best interests of their faith, and people take their faith seriously. And then you just retort back to your same point, you think they will not lie anymore than anyone else. You didn&#39;t address the point I made, you just repeated yourself, that isn&#39;t good debate, the objective is to discuss and critically access the situation. I think it is very logical to assume that if your faith calls for something, and you believe in your faith, you will do it. You have yet to tell me why that would not apply to this faith, and to people who are faithful, when they do other things that their faith commands. You just repeat your first point.

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit. Problem with your example. YOU made the first statement. I responded with a counter statement. Your statement is &quot;you can&#39;t trust Muslims, they&#39;re more likely to lie to you than others&quot;. I refuted it. It is on you to back your statement up, you&#39;re the one who made a claim. What proof do you have? besides assuming every follower of Islam is a robot, following their holy book to a T. You claim I just make the same statement, but that&#39;s all you&#39;ve done. Literally the only point you&#39;ve made is &quot;their book says it&#39;s okay, so they are more likely to lie.&quot; You don&#39;t get to shift the burden of proof onto me like that. Your only proof is &quot;the book says&quot;. Which completely ignores human realities about how devout someone may or may not be. Fuck you, and your attempt at mental gymnastics.

<p>My argument. The religion advocates for lying to spread the religion, spreading the religion is seen as a very good thing in said religion, because of this they are likely to lie to spread their religion, especially if they have convictions. They also have no major force acting against this, no cultural pressure, nothing, only thing they have is to benefit, there for it is logical to conclude they will lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, people lie everyday, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Atheists. They lie about all kinds of things. I had a friend who told a girl his Vette was in the shop, and he worked the night shift at a casino, but he really worked at the gas station and drive a broke down trailblazer. </p>

<p>Imagine if, Donald Trump, was like:</p>

<p>&quot;hey guys, so we&#39;re gonna make Muslims register to put them in a database because they&#39;re such a huge threat to everyone, you know, more than the US government who is responsible for many millions of innocent deaths , yeah well they&#39;re worse, so we&#39;re gonna make them register, then we&#39;re throwing them in camps, and we&#39;re gonna makeup them pay for the camps too, you&#39;ll see. It&#39;ll be great.&quot;</p>

<p>Then yeah, I wouldn&#39;t blame a Muslim for lying about their faith. Read the talmud if you really want your head to spin, or the actual Quran to understand better so you&#39;re not living in ignorance/fear instead of some fear mongering shit on the internet. Buy an actual Quran book, and sit down and read it, not on the computer. Then maybe you won&#39;t be so afraid of the big bad Muslims. I swear, the media has done a stellar job, they got to you. You&#39;re sitting here worried about the guy making your chicken shawarma instead of the shit they&#39;re spraying in the air every sunny morning. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a Muslim, and I&#39;m certain, 99.9% of Muslims would never deny that they&#39;re Muslim because they are proud of it, and not ashamed at all. That&#39;s why women wearing hijab will wear them in the heart of the most racist states, they are not afraid, they are proud. Muslims very rarely waiver in their faith, because they have a solid foundation to stand upon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re ignoring the reason some one like Trump has the justification to put Muslims in a data base to begin with. But I don&#39;t want authorative measures like that, so lets just not put ourselves in a situation where we need that.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re Muslim, I know this sounds rude but given the evidence in my post, since you&#39;re allowed to lie to non believers about your religion, how can anyone trust your intentions about Islam? </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to point out, if you have to lie about your faith in the western world, which is extremely liberal socially, then your faith is the one with the problem, lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know the Koran is not published in chronological order? The chapters are printed in order of length. This is for outsiders..</p>

<p>Muhammad started off preaching his religion and got few followers, he left Mecca for Medina and invented jihad and became a warlord and taught the destruction of non-Islamic civilisations.</p>

<p>In the Koran things are not clear, which allows for Dualism. Oh that is said? But so is this! Violence? But look, peace!</p>

<p>The only trouble is the Doctrine of Abrogation, Muhammad taught that things he made up as he went along override prior teachings, that the later verse is better than the earlier verse if they are in conflict. Once the story of Muhammad is put in order, things make sense, and it becomes clear that ISIS and others are simply following Muhammad&#39;s teachings more closely than someone who isn&#39;t trying to destroy non-Islamic civilisation and kill non-Muslims in violent jihad.</p>

<p>Islamic scripture is actually <a href="http://i.imgur.com/L7KuHMT.jpg">huge</a> and not just the Koran.</p>

<p>Seek out the works of Dr Bill Warner, books, lectures, twitter, statistical analysis of texts, the lot. He is very clear. He also did a great course with an ex-Muslim, also on YouTube and a site of its own, called The Islamic Dilemma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAHA, not an argument. Are you saying English speaking Muslims are not Muslims?</p>

<p>Muhammad is Allah&#39;s &quot;divine human prototype&quot; and perfect Muslim. Islam means to emulate Muhammad. What he did is Islamic what he didn&#39;t do is forbidden.</p>

<p>You can if you are curious, which I know for sure you&#39;re not, learn the life of Muhammad. That&#39;s how you become a 100% Muslim, emulating Muhammad 100%. Most Muslims (thankfully) do not emulate him in the violent ways.</p>

<p>Go and learn the life of Muhammad, Allah&#39;s perfect man, and you will see the Islamic pattern of life described, in the life of Muhammad.</p>

<p>Good try though.</p>

<p>The story of Muhammad&#39;s perfect life is what defines Islamic. You can understand the deeds and actions of a man, probably better than the illiterate Muslims in the world (about 98% of women in Afghanistan cannot read for example).</p>

<p>You do not need to be able to read an ancient dialect that all modern korans are translations of to be able to follow the example of Muhammad. Go and learn the story of Muhammad&#39;s life rather than ask me questions about it. Muhammad is the only and final source on what is Islamic, what he did is Islamic what he didn&#39;t do is forbidden.</p>

<p>You are even instructed to splash water in your underpants after urination so you may convince yourself any droplets felt are water and not urine. Why, because of.. you guessed it. Muhammad&#39;s actions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you are wrong. Sorry you keep digging yourself deeper and becoming more petty while ignoring more and more simple facts. Why does believing in the God of Muhammad or not make you more able to understand the life of the prophet Muhammad the perfect man? </p>

<p>Are you able to learn about the life of Hitler without being yourself a nazi? the answer is yes. Go and study some history my boy. Muhammad&#39;s life. Go and look into it.</p>

<p>Do you say he WASN&#39;T a warlord who committed genocide and owned sex slave markets and crucified people and burned them alive and beheaded people and ordered murders of satirical poets and ordered chopping off of hands and feet and melting hot iron into people&#39;s eye sockets and conquering lands with his military troops? Are you saying he was a good man?</p>

<p>No. You are saying nothing because you don&#39;t know anything about Muhammad. So you are ignorant of the life of the prophet of a major world religion and political movement. I am replying to you for others to see my answers. If this was a private message I would consider you beyond hope and not waste my time. Go learn about Muhammad.
