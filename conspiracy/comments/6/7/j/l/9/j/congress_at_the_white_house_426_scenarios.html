<p>There have been rumors of a building set of NK military brass that are sick of the nonsense and willing to wrest power from the Kims. If the rumors are true and they&#39;ve been in contact with Washington, they might be making the move finally.</p>

<p>If this is the case, however, it wont be WW3. Exactly everybody on Earth will be happy to see the Kims go except KJU himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I actually did some research on this rather than speculate out my ass.</p>

<p>I think this all has to do with the national debt. North Korea could be a real concern, but I think it&#39;s more theater than anything.</p>

<p>According to an excellent answer on Quora by Stacy Tidwell, a military coup is possible but unlikely. The United States is in an economic power struggle between politicians, populists and corporatists. When the money runs out shit hits the fan until the debt ceiling is raised and these guys can spend more money and give more handouts.</p>

<p>The US isn&#39;t so much concerned about ICBMs as it is about money running dry because that is how great empires fall in the end. It happened with Rome and Spain. Here we are right now up to our eye balls in debt with threats and rumors of a government shut down looming.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-a-military-coup-possible-in-the-United-States-of-America">https://www.quora.com/Is-a-military-coup-possible-in-the-United-States-of-America</a></p>

<p>She also makes points about how we need to stop taking welfare from the government because it compounds the debt. Which then brings me to this article and a statement published today:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/25/erick-erickson-mr-trump-shut-down-government-please.html">http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/25/erick-erickson-mr-trump-shut-down-government-please.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have reached a point where polling shows more Americans than ever want a giant, robust government doing all sorts of things. That is a terrible position to be in as we sail past $20 trillion in national debt. Americans need to be reminded that the world will not end if the government shuts down. They need to be reminded to take care of themselves instead of relying on Uncle Sam’s teet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there you have it. They want to shut down the government and force an end to the welfare state.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ALL ABOUT THE MONEY.</p>

<p>Stacy nailed it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such a bunch of crap and I&#39;m really tired of hearing it. How about we eliminate corporate welfare- <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2013/09/30/calculating-the-real-cost-of-corporate-welfare/">http://thefederalist.com/2013/09/30/calculating-the-real-cost-of-corporate-welfare/</a>. Then we can demand corporations and the top 10% pay their share of federal income taxes instead of the new tax break Republicans want next, and maybe actually go after offshore accounts. The middle class is already bearing the brunt of government spending and rather than expect the uber wealthy to pay their fair share someone wants to squeeze the least fortunate in the country, which includes children and the elderly. It&#39;s a bait and switch philosophy they&#39;ve been trying to sell since fucking &quot;trickle down&quot; economics in the 80&#39;s.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s a push and pull. I don&#39;t think cutting off welfare is a good thing to do. She was mostly saying the economic struggle is inevitable with democracy, and debt brings about the end of great nations.</p>
