       Does anyone think this could be one of the following scenarios?
      </p>
      <p>
       1: Getting all the senators in one place to take out a large majority of the government. Think 9/11 Pentagon where they got rid of the investigators looking to to the missing trillions. (Trump isn't supposed to be at the WH for this meeting)
      </p>
      <p>
       2: Getting all the senators in one place to keep them safe from a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       3: Getting all the senators in one place to green light WWIII.

       There have been rumors of a building set of NK military brass that are sick of the nonsense and willing to wrest power from the Kims. If the rumors are true and they've been in contact with Washington, they might be making the move finally.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is the case, however, it wont be WW3. Exactly everybody on Earth will be happy to see the Kims go except KJU himself.

       So I actually did some research on this rather than speculate out my ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this all has to do with the national debt. North Korea could be a real concern, but I think it's more theater than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to an excellent answer on Quora by Stacy Tidwell, a military coup is possible but unlikely. The United States is in an economic power struggle between politicians, populists and corporatists. When the money runs out shit hits the fan until the debt ceiling is raised and these guys can spend more money and give more handouts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US isn't so much concerned about ICBMs as it is about money running dry because that is how great empires fall in the end. It happened with Rome and Spain. Here we are right now up to our eye balls in debt with threats and rumors of a government shut down looming.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-a-military-coup-possible-in-the-United-States-of-America">
        https://www.quora.com/Is-a-military-coup-possible-in-the-United-States-of-America
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       She also makes points about how we need to stop taking welfare from the government because it compounds the debt. Which then brings me to this article and a statement published today:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/25/erick-erickson-mr-trump-shut-down-government-please.html">
        http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/04/25/erick-erickson-mr-trump-shut-down-government-please.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We have reached a point where polling shows more Americans than ever want a giant, robust government doing all sorts of things. That is a terrible position to be in as we sail past $20 trillion in national debt. Americans need to be reminded that the world will not end if the government shuts down. They need to be reminded to take care of themselves instead of relying on Uncle Sam’s teet.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So there you have it. They want to shut down the government and force an end to the welfare state.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ALL ABOUT THE MONEY.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stacy nailed it.

       This is such a bunch of crap and I'm really tired of hearing it. How about we eliminate corporate welfare-
       <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2013/09/30/calculating-the-real-cost-of-corporate-welfare/">
        http://thefederalist.com/2013/09/30/calculating-the-real-cost-of-corporate-welfare/
       </a>
       . Then we can demand corporations and the top 10% pay their share of federal income taxes instead of the new tax break Republicans want next, and maybe actually go after offshore accounts. The middle class is already bearing the brunt of government spending and rather than expect the uber wealthy to pay their fair share someone wants to squeeze the least fortunate in the country, which includes children and the elderly. It's a bait and switch philosophy they've been trying to sell since fucking "trickle down" economics in the 80's.

       Yeah, it's a push and pull. I don't think cutting off welfare is a good thing to do. She was mostly saying the economic struggle is inevitable with democracy, and debt brings about the end of great nations.

       Correct me if I'm wrong but the House declares war not the Senate. He wouldn't need the Senate's permission even if he didn't want to have to invoke the War Powers Act.

       How about...Trump found out that a large faction (including senators) were behind a plan to attack/destroy the White House (and kill him) on April 26th.  So he invites them all to an important briefing at the White House on April 26th. (That way they'll cancel the plan.  Get it?)

       Maybe this is just part of the drill....In the event the president is taken out, and Senate needs to take action on their own without leadership.

       4: It's the beginnings of mass arrests of the corrupt US Govt. All our favorite elites we talk about on this sub, are paraded out in public in handcuffs. A global breakout of truth presented to us by the heroes getting it done up close and personal, to the we masses commences. Everybody's nips are blown off when they start to realize we've all been brainwashed just like we think of "those poor bind controlled NKorean bastards." The worlds debt system is shut down and taken away from the central banksters, leading to a worldwide debt jubilee and we all celebrate us claiming back our birthright to be free! ;)
