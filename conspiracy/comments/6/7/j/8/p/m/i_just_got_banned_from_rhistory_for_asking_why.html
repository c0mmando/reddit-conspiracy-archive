    <div class="md"><p>Piggybacking because OP added a new source to pretend supports his claims:</p>

<p>You&#39;re not looking at a list of people. You&#39;re looking at a range of ID numbers which were issued. The very same page you&#39;re linking me to right now acknowledges that these numbers were reused, meaning when someone died or was transferred away, they just gave the old number to someone else. That right there is enough to fully invalidate your argument, not even to mention the fact that a number of people may have been executed on arrival without even receiving a number.</p>

<p>The only thing this link establishes is that there were never more than 400,000 prisoners fully &#39;booked&#39; into Auschwitz at any one time.</p>

<p>Is the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum biased?  You bet they are.  Is the New York Times biased?  Of course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, everyone is biased, but some organizations make an attempt to be less biased. The New York Times takes steps to present things with less of a spin rf an agenda. Sure the bias comes through, but there is LESS bias because they TRY to have less bias. The world is not simply full of everyone only pushing an agenda. Some organization and people try to challenge their pre conceptions with evidence, and in their communication with the world, elevate that evidence over their narrative. But exposing-the-holocaust-hoax is not one of them. A website like exposing-the-holocaust-hoax does not make attempts to challenge what it already thinks is true and therefore cannot be trusted to be anything BUT biased.</p>

<p>The site I linked is biased in favor of the TRUTH.  So, no, it&#39;s not going to present the argument of those promoting the &quot;holocaust&quot; lie.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re FYIing. All the fringe things you believe because you&#39;ve been taught to demonize the &quot;establishment&quot;? Dude, I&#39;m telling you. You&#39;re being played. Nobody likes the establishment. Of course! But that doesn&#39;t make everything the &quot;anti-establishment&quot; says true. I was part of a small religious group, not as small as yours, but still fairly insular. This whole &quot;the establishment is satanic&quot; is a tactic propagated by them so that you don&#39;t listen to ideas other than theirs. I&#39;m sure you think of your anti-establishment attitude as free thinking and edgy, but once you pop your head above the mire of hate and superstition, you&#39;ll see that the real world based on real evidence, critical thinking and challenging your most deeply held beliefs to see if they&#39;re really true, is the place where you&#39;re free to not just repeat someone else&#39;s wrong ideas. Because that is what you&#39;re doing. Your ideas are in no way new, they&#39;ve been said for centuries, and they&#39;ve been wrong the whole time. And the &quot;proof&quot; that you use to prop them up is not the kind of &quot;proof&quot; that will ever let you know what the base truth of the world is.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m sort of wasting my breath, but there&#39;s a quote I like that I can&#39;t remember specifically and can&#39;t be bothered to look up but it is something like &quot;Nobody ever leaves an argument holding EXACTLY the same position they held at the beginning.&quot; I was once a super religious semi-nutjob and I&#39;d have arguments with people and even though I know they wouldn&#39;t think they budged me and I wouldn&#39;t admit that I was budged at the time, reason can still worm its way in there. I mean eventually enough got in that I rejected all that madness entirely. Plus, I&#39;m unemployed and high at home and I like arguing and I like giving a counter to the crazy hatred in the world if only for someone else to read, so fuck it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what OP is specifically referring to, but at Auschwitz they initially claimed that &quot;4 million&quot; died there.  This was alleged and &quot;proven&quot; at the Nuremberg trials (which were a kangaroo court). </p>

<p>Then around 1990, the official Auschwitz museum revised down the claim of dead at Auschwitz to &quot;1.5 million&quot;.  I think today it&#39;s at only &quot;1.1 million&quot;.  That is still a gross exaggeration.  Red Cross records only show that around 68,000 died at Auschwitz.  </p>

<p>The article says that between 1 and 1.5 million Jews were killed <em>at Auschwitz</em>, not in the entire holocaust. Furthermore, the article specifically mentions that there is <em>no change in the number of Jews killed</em> at Auschwitz.

<p>Simply add up all of the people listed on the official Auschwitz website and the total goes to 404,481 in total. This is the largest camp and the number stated by google is a 1.3m prisoner population. You will find this across all camps, the real numbers are lower than what is understood and accepted. That is all I&#39;m trying to get across</p>

<p>you seem to be agreeing with OP  </p>

<p>or at least obfuscating the argument   </p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>Every one of them feels that he is knowledgeable and that he is an authority on history,</code> Lerman said. <code>Unfortunately, that is not the case.</code> Last week here at the camp, one elderly Polish woman said she was sure that four million people died at Auschwitz. She said she first visited the camp in 1948 and that was what she was told then, <code>when things were fresh.</code> Ken Hanau, a 26-year-old American, refused to believe that fewer than four million people had died here. Hanau, a student at Harvard Business School, said he had done a paper on the subject as an undergraduate and had read in several history books that four million was the right figure.  </p>

<p>this is what OP was addressing, the fact that people will not believe that less than 4 million people died in the camp, not the number of jews killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was never in any of OP&#39;s arguments that I read, though his justifications shifted as fast as his assertions were rebutted. His original argument was that the Auschwitz number couldn&#39;t be revised without subtracting the same amount from the 6 million.

<p>As to your point, of course people still believe what they heard from the communist regime after the war. New evidence always has an uphill battle against the prevailing common knowledge.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not looking at a list of people. You&#39;re looking at a range of ID numbers which were issued. The very same page you&#39;re linking me to right now acknowledges that these numbers were reused, meaning when someone died or was transferred away, they just gave the old number to someone else. That right there is enough to fully invalidate your argument, not even to mention the fact that  a number of people may have been executed on arrival without even receiving a number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first off the article answers your question pretty well so I don&#39;t know why you would bother asking.</p>

<p>And that article DOES NOT say that only 1 million Jews died in the holocaust as opposed to 6. It says that the original estimate of 4 million people dying AT AUSCHWITZ (and only at that specific camp) was incorrect because the Communist  government of Poland purposefully overestimated the number of POLES killed not the number of jews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The communists tried to <code>de-Judaize</code> Auschwitz to emphasize that other nationalities, particularly Poles, died at the hands of the Nazis, said Lerman, who is also a member of the International Council of the State Museum of Auschwitz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there&#39;s your answer, the number of jews killed didn&#39;t change (significantly), the number of non-jews killed AT AUSCHWITZ changed so that the communist government of Poland could demonize fascism and prop up communism as the best form of government.</p>

<p>Yeah they lowered Auschwitz numbers from 4 million to 1.5 million BUT miraculously they kept the official 6 million number. </p>

<p>That alone is 10000% proof that the numbers are all a lie. You can&#39;t be wrong about 2.5 million people dying at one camp. That literally means the numbers have to be fake.</p>

<p>6 milliom was mentioned countless times before ww2.

<p>There is holocaust laws for a reason. The laws came out around the same time that Auschwitz was lowered by 2.5 million. Do you expect any credible historian to really speak about and say the number should be lower? They could literally go to jail.</p>

<p>Everything I said was a fact. If you get offended by it then you get offended by truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it was by mistake. I&#39;ll explain what this means. It means that if you are a boring historian in academia who found out that there was an error in history perception, and you write an article about it, citing sources, and convince your peers, that&#39;s fine. However if you do the Hitler salute, talk about your desire to make Germany great again and say that the holocaust never happened and that all historians are blackmailed by the international Jewry, you will be jailed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That article later states on page 2 that the lowered Auschwitz count simply means more Jewish people were killed elsewhere and the total death toll was actually up to 7 million, but doesn&#39;t seem to cite any sources.</p>

<p>Anyone know what they&#39;re referencing? </p>

<p>If the official count of Auschwitz dropped from 4 million to 1.5 million, does that mean there a 2.5 million unaccounted for people that died elsewhere?

<p>That&#39;s a legitimate question. The answer would be in academic works. Wikipedia: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hilberg&#39;s estimate of 5.1 million, in the third edition of The Destruction of the European Jews, includes (respectively) over 800,000 Jews who died from &quot;ghettoization and general privation&quot;; 1,400,000 killed in open-air shootings; and up to 2,900,000 who perished in the camps. Hilberg estimates the death toll of Jews in Poland as up to 3,000,000.[341] His numbers are generally considered to be very conservative, as they typically include only those deaths for which records are available, avoiding statistical adjustments.[342]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. </p>

<p>So by his calculations he was already estimating lower death camp numbers overall. I&#39;m guessing the truth is likely somewhere in the middle. Some of the Auschwitz numbers may have been merely fabricated, but some of them likely died elsewhere and were attributed Auschwitz incorrectly.</p>

<p>There was of course other death camps, as well as the ghettos, starvation, and mass shootings. Many of those people could have been killed before getting to Auschwitz, and were simply calculated in the original figures inflating the number.</p>

<p>As horrible as the holocaust was, I was never taught that the USSR/Russia actually took the brunt of the civilian causalities during WW2, as many as 16 million, and lost another 10 million soldiers. Didn&#39;t discover the truth until I was an adult, as my history books liked to leave that fact out. Supposedly there were even cases of entire towns being cut off from food and water in the USSR essentially starving entire cities during the winter. The Nazi&#39;s purposely would cut off supply lines and steal the supplies for themselves to weaken their enemies so they could walk right in and take over entire cities without resistance because they had starved the population out. The Eastern front was absolutely brutal compared to the Western front, but again good luck learning about that in a Western country.</p>

<p>One of the craziest things from WW2 to me was actually after the war, during Operation Paperclip when the US let over a thousand Nazi scientists and doctors some of which ran these death camps come to the US and become US citizens and conduct further research in the US. Said research resulted in everything from the MK Ultra experiments, to potentially releasing Lyme disease from Plum island decades later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another comment mentions that the 4 million figure for Auschwitz was lowered due to the communist Polish government having lied about the number of Poles who died there. I haven&#39;t checked this but it sounds familiar.</p>

<p>There are a number of estimates out there. Depending on the source it&#39;s something like 5.7-6.3 million Jewish dead, 4.7 million have their names and biographies recorded (this was reported in the news a day or two ago).</p>

<p>These estimates look at population numbers and the like so it&#39;s not an exact science, and also why the 6 million figure is normally used. I should probably know about non-Jewish dead, but I don’t. Though to be fair to myself I don&#39;t know the figures for other genocides and until I saw that 4.7 million piece I thought the Jewish dead was 3 million - just my ignorance/memory mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Non-Jewish dead is controversial in reference to the camps from my research. The article mentioned by u/Todos1881 was 90% Jewish deaths at Auschwitz with the revised numbers, but I&#39;ve seen other sources state as high as 95%. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, I&#39;ve seen holocaust deniers suggest the numbers of non-Jewish were much greater, and the total number of Jews of killed was much lower. As the camps were also used on Gypsies, POWs, homosexuals, mentally ill, and others.</p>

<p>One of the arguments I&#39;ve come across as well is that the death camps were isolated by the end of the war and were mostly run by skeleton crews with little contact from the outside world. So many people died from starvation, firing squads, and other means. Many of these deaths are counted by historians as still being apart of the holocaust, but some argue they should be counted as POW / Civilian deaths as a result of the war, and not necessarily deaths that were purposely or intentionally contributed to genocide of the Jewish population. Then again, those people wouldn&#39;t have died had they never been put in camps and ghettos in the first place, hence the controversy and the disparity in numbers.</p>

<p>From my analysis, theres more than enough evidence that the holocaust happened, we just don&#39;t know the exact number of people killed and although the majority were Jewish many other populations were targeted as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>6 million is Jewish propaganda, as is the Holocaust as a whole. It comes form a Talmudic prophecy that 6 million Jews must vanish before the creation of Israel, which of course happened right after WWII. They had been using that number in propaganda pieces since the late 1800s. The alleged mass graves have been debunked by independent researchers as having no bodies. The crematoriums were used to burn the bodies of those who died from disease to help prevent its spread. Zyklon B was used only used to delouse clothing. People were generally taken care of and most deaths were caused by starvation and disease, especially after Allied bombings cut off supplies. Testimony at Nuremberg was achieved through extreme torture including testicle crushing, and some of the testimony received has been debunked by even mainstream Holocaust historians. There is a reason people get thrown in jail for &quot;denial&quot;. These Jews are master manipulators, liars, and propagators. The Talmud teaches them that the are the supreme race and at the gentiles are only animals. They still demand reparations for their alleged Holocaust to this day. Why don&#39;t we hear about the millions of people that the Bolsheviks killed? Hmm. They like to point the finger at others and demand sympathy for themselves. They create division and fund both sides of it to keep us fighting ourselves. They promote degeneracy through the mainstream media and Hollywood that they own almost all of.  They use the US military to do their dirty work in the Middle East. They rape babies in their religious rituals and normalize it. None of this stuff really sank in for me until I saw footage of rabbis sucking the bloody dicks of babies who&#39;d just had their genitals cut. I&#39;ve seen some fucked up shit on the internet and nothing has hit me as hard as that, I couldn&#39;t take it and I had to shut it down for a bit. You can just type in &quot;rabbi circumcision&quot; on google and find pictures. Only they could get away with this shit. &quot;Oh its just a religious ceremony. Nothing to see here goyim!&quot;  Hitler rose up against them and their debt-based money scam that they have used to enslave people and that is still used today. He lost, and became the most demonized person in history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But how would that legal system be structured? I see two possibilities for that: either a single &quot;official&quot; system established by reddit itself and run by the admins, or independent tribunals that would be specific to every subreddit.</p>

<p><strong>Official system:</strong> How would that be fair, or even work at all? There are thousands of subs, and each are run independently with their own philosophies, rules, and problems. It&#39;s extremely unlikely that an outside authority would have the knowledge, context, or time necessary to understand the nuances and make an appropriate decision. Imagine how people in this sub or some place like t_D would feel about pleading their case to some reddit authority...</p>

<p><strong>Tribunal system:</strong> How would the tribunal be selected? Because in corrupt subs (i.e. the ones that are a problem in the first place), the moderators would just stack the panel with their friends or alternate accounts. This would also make hostile takeovers of subreddits even easier, since corrupt mods could abuse the system to oust other moderators and gain control.</p>

<p>Also, some other problems I foresee with a system like that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What happens to subreddits which only have a single moderator? Who decides their fate, and what happens if they get ousted?</p></li>
<li><p>While people could abuse the system by making new accounts, moderators could do the same. If it&#39;s a &quot;3 strikes&quot; type system, they could just transfer their moderator status to a new account once they had lost a few cases, but before they lost their position.</p></li>
<li><p>What would the &quot;cost to the appealer&quot; be? Since they are already banned from the sub where they are contesting, it would have to be a site-wide consequence(s), otherwise it would be meaningless. But considering all the potential flaws I listed above, this would discourage people from using the system, even when they might have a legitimate case.</p></li>
<li><p>What would stop corrupt moderators from circumventing this entire system using tools that are already available? For example, automoderator can be programmed to immediately remove all posts from a specific user <em>without</em> actually banning them, thus giving them no recourse under your system. </p></li>

<p>Who are they? On which documents was it &quot;changed&quot;? The official number is still 5.6 - 6.3 million according to Wikipedia. </p>

<p>Sorry, but Holocaust denial is utter bullshit, basically on the same level as the flat earth &quot;theory&quot;. There are so many current, much more important conspiracies going on, but your mind is clouded with a bullshit theory that has no effect for our world now and is clearly designed to distract from things like the MIC to the schemings of Goldman Sachs and the whole international financial industry. </p>

<p>They are the winners of WW2. It was changed on the plaque outside of Auschwitz, first it was 6 million, then it was changed to four million in <a href="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.f1wYQQ9E7N9AC5JgJOoFaQEsBy&amp;amp;pid=15.1">this picture</a> and it is now at 1.5 million.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t tell me my mind is clouded when you haven&#39;t even done your research lol. I understand the evils of our financial industry and it ties in to WW2 in the holocaust which was a for-profit war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/67fa9k/why_was_the_victim_count_in_the_holocaust_lowered/">This is what OP posted in /r/history.</a></p>

<p>The actual reason given was &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/67fa9k/why_was_the_victim_count_in_the_holocaust_lowered/dgq0wyx/">the number was not lowered</a>&quot;. </p>

<p>I did some quick wikipedia-ing &amp; I don&#39;t see a single thing that says 1 million jews died in the holocaust as opposed to 6 mill. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust#Jewish_death_toll">Wikipedia has the amount of jews killed at just under 6 million.</a> The only figure I found in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp#Death_toll">1 million range was the amount of people who died specifically at Auschwitz</a>. So maybe OP was mistaken &amp; was just looking at Auschwitz numbers. Or he&#39;s been binging on some fringe websites/videos. I don&#39;t know. But he should at least back up what he&#39;s saying with some links. This is the first I&#39;m hearing of &quot;them&quot; lowering the number.</p>

<p>Whenever someone used &quot;they&quot; the implication is that it&#39;s coming from the mainstream consensus. And this is a very big change you&#39;re suggesting without any initial backup. So I went directly to wikipedia. If it&#39;s changed there or even has a section about dispute there may be an issue but it seems like you&#39;re just mildly mistaken, which happens to us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t go around saying &quot;they&quot; are changing the count from 6 to 1M because &quot;they&quot; aren&#39;t. It&#39;s a weak argument and doesn&#39;t make you look very credible. Now if Wikipedia decided to change their number from 6 to 1M (I checked as soon as I read your post) and it still says 6M.</p>

<p>I can say 2+2 = 5 but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m changing the constants of the universe. That&#39;d be pretty cool though...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you learning disabled and literally incapable of comprehending the words in the article or are you posting that article to be misleading in the hopes that people won&#39;t read past the headline?</p>

<p>The article says that between 1 and 1.5 million Jews were killed <em>at Auschwitz</em>, not in the entire holocaust. Furthermore, the article specifically mentions that there is <em>no change in the number of Jews killed</em> at Auschwitz. The article states with incredible clarity that only a dunce or a snake could &#39;miss&#39; that the number of non-Jewish Poles killed there was the only one revised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was the one posted about Auschwitz changing their numbers. Jews absolutely died. I hardly see anyone try to say less than a few hundred thousand died.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve concluded based on all available evidence that nowhere near 6 million died. But that&#39;s just my opinion.</p>
