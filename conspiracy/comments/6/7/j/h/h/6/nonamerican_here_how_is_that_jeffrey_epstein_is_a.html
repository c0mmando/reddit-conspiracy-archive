    <div class="md"><p>Well if the role covered by pedophilia at top level many now suspect, me included, is really about blackmailing and being initiated to a wider network with unique chances, handling a satanic pedo ring (which entails blood as well as rape) is probably the fastest way to rise in the ranks of the tptb hierarchy, the most clear way to affirm your capacity for psychopathy.
I never understood the connection so well before all the circumstancial evidence around pg, but now i tend to think that rather than all this powerful people having the sexual kink of children as a way to stroke their infinite ego (i can do this and be left alone im so TOP!), most of them understood the middle class of power can be swept in this direction and blackmailed if they understand the association this has with power (directly tied through blackmail and inner circles so acquired), so being an &quot;organizator pedophile&quot; would be ideal for a 100% psychopathic as a way to raise, affirm and consolidate power. So in the current context even a ruthless psycho that wouldn&#39;t ever care for kids is going to pick the subject up in the long run if he advances enough. Oh well... the only good thing in all this is that is getting too evident, the pedo sympathy movement that has blown over night recently is a reaction put out by desperation, they wouldn&#39;t move things so fast if they weren&#39;t feeling some hot air on their necks. We&#39;ll see, although i wouldn&#39;t count too much on it.</p>

<p>So lets say tptb require not just that but worse. Human sacrifice and cannibalism, why not. Maybe a litany of horrific acts so they can take their pick of kompromat. </p>

I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s weird how your country (or most western countries) act so disgusted at the thought of an adult man being with an underage girl, but will literally just sit there and watch people they look up to be friends with a pedophile who has a personal island where he rapes (and kills?) little girls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any hard evidence of those claims?  or is your evidence from the social medial court of law , because that&#39;s not going to fly with me , you see in America you are innocent until proven guilty and I have yet to see any true evidence that validate your claims , Reddit   Twitter and Facebook have no authority when it come to American law . Not talking about past convictions here, I&#39;m talking about the present and your and social medias accusations. All for conversation here but when you point the finger at us Americans , for not doing what you think is correct without the proper understanding of the American judicial system then we need to have a little talk . Thanks stay up playa </p>

*Jeff epstein convicted pedophile
*BIll Clinton flew to Pedo Island 20+ times so did Hillary and many other politicians
*Tony Podesta is good friends with Dennis Hastert flies to Japan to hang out with school girls
*Podesta emails saying &quot;Maybe its time for Dennis to disapear to an undisclosed Japanese island&quot; the day after he was caught
*Hastert was speaker of the house for George Bush
*The NSA has proof of everything (been collecting all data) and our government refuses to go after them
Our government is evil it has been for atleast 100 years the evidence is there your cognitive dissonance is just too strong to realize it and is part of the reason the West as a whole will fall.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t serve his time. He was caught red handed and had most of the charges dropped. Which is the cusp of the issue, why were his charges dropped? He most certainly did it so why was he allowed to walk free from charges that would have put him in jail for the rest of his life?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Satanic Panic era basically made most Americans discount the idea of pedophile rings. Lots of people were falsely accused during that time and and people were spinning conspiracies everywhere. I remember a church coming to my house telling my mom not to let us watch Carebears and shit because they thought it was Satanic brainwashing.</p>

<p>Also its not like the mainstream media reports this shit. You have to do digging on the internet to even find this stuff. And most of the time this kind of stuff is on conspiracy websites with flat earth bullshit and people talking about how reptilians/Jews/Satan worshipers really control the world. The average person takes one look at a site like that and thinks everything on there is the blathering of lunatics.</p>

<p>In other words, the idea that our elites hang out with convicted pedophiles is associated with lunatics like Alex Jones and the Satanic Panic era scaremongering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I practiced the occult for a long time. Carebears and shit like that have nothing to do with Satan. There might be some New Age messages involved but that means nothing unless you are going to argue that literally every belief system that isn&#39;t fundamentalist Christianity is worshiping the devil.</p>

<p>As for elites banging kids, there is no need to associate it with Satan. People can and do rape children without being Satan worshipers. They just like kids because of the way they look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s propaganda and they make it seem innocent. MLP? The ponies all gave a tramp stamp and feminine curves. Now you got furies and beastiality making a bogger presence in everyday life.</p>

<p>Steven universe there are no genders yet 99% of the time they have female sexual parts. The lgbtq is corrupting our youth. Mutilating your body and taking unnatural hormones to change your sex is every day life. 5 year olds are saying they aren&#39;t a boy because they play with dolls and so they think they weren&#39;t supposed to have a dick. Then abc covers these stories as heroic.</p>

<p>Every anime has high school or younger girls in tight mini skirts. Cartoon girls having sex is normal and legal. Lolita is normal. Pedophilia is no longer seen as evil much less bad. Instead its a &quot;sexuality&quot; that they cannot help what they are attracted to. It wont be long before they are accepted full on. With gay people they were first victimized. This happened for lik 5 years. Tho after the first one, if you were ever caught disagreeing you lost all credibility and made as a monster to tv. Fucking celebrities were praised and given breaking news stories for &quot; so and so comes out and says they believe in same sex marriage... after years of being raised blah blah blah he no realizes...&quot;</p>

<p>I know imma get a lot of hate because this is reddit and you cant go against lgbt, but im not biting my tongue.</p>

<p>Also I don&#39;t see pedophilia ever being accepted in mainstream America. Its the unforgivable crime. In some other countries its less taboo though. </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually bisexual but I hate pedos. Kids cannot consent to sex. Pedos are just sick people who want to fuck young girls because they think they are &quot;fresh&quot;. Totally gross I know but as someone who used to be a young girl and was targeted by some of these creepy old dudes that is their reasoning. </p>

<p>I hate the trans kid thing too. They are trying to push adult concepts onto kids in order for the mother (its usually the mother, but not always) to get attention from the media and write a blog. Its a form of Munchausen syndrome. A few years ago these women were claiming their kids were autistic.</p>

-What does one have to do with the other?</p>

<p>&quot;... because they think they are &#39;fresh&#39;...&quot;
-I think, at least at an &quot;elite&quot; level it has more to do with power, control, feeling above the law, able to have everything except for, etc etc. Also, remember, alot of ppl who rise to that level are sociopathic, ie need to solely please themselves, don&#39;t care how others feel/who they hurt to obtain that pleasure.</p>

<p>&quot;... push adult concepts onto kids... in order to write a blog..&quot;
Really?</p>

<p>&quot;.. it&#39;s a form of Munchausen syndrome.&quot;
So you&#39;re saying, that because a mother wants to write a blog, she&#39;s making her child transgender?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we arent associating the pedophilia with satan, THEY ARE. they are luciferians and they are performing rituals so yeah it is associated and thats not a matter of opinion, for anyone who cares to take the time. they fuck rape murder eat and whatever else u can think of little kids and they do it as part of a satanic agenda, and in worship of satan or lucifer. plain and simple, and not us associating, but them by actions. 
most television and cartoons actually are in some way satanic, bc they own the industry and want to corrupt... im sure there were bits and pieces and hints and subliminal shit to corrupt children, as there are in most if not all childrens shows...</p>

<p>your whole point or argument makes it clear you either comment with a goal in mind or simply havent bothered researching any of this and yet in your mind having practised &quot;the occult&quot; qualifies you to decide whether anything is satanic or not. youre completely wrong</p>

    <div class="md"><p>can you really not discern that the notion of what you call Satan is based on a bible i find completely lacking as a basis in any real explanation of the world aside from being a library of poetic sagas passed down by man over millennia not unlike any other world views mythology? and no, lucifer that you asssociate with &#39;satan-set-hel/loki- etc&#39;  is simply a poetic personification of either mercury or venus and is ALSO the evening star. when in orbit it precedes the rising of the sun in the east, it is the morning star. when the orbit follows the sun after sunset in our sky it is called the evening star. the poetry is then that the morning star brings light to mankind via the sun.  mercury is also called hermes in mythos, the messenger of the sun or some such. so in a sense, this correlates to Prometheus who upset the gods by giving man the knowledge of fire... and in YOUR mythology a snake gave man knowledge between good and evil, and in the very last book of your finite library, a poet associated the great deciever with this snake. so you could say there is that relation... but no, the ideal of luciferians are not those of satan worship from my perspective. very different actually as your satan wants to hinder mankind somehow, and luciferians want to advance mankind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that many here are atheists and agnostics, but this is my understanding/speculation based on a decade and a half of research:</p>

<p>God and Satan are real. The world is run by satanists who are running pedophile rings so they can perform sex rituals that intentionally conjour demons and open gateways for possession. Many important powerful families are generational satanists who are born into it. The Rothschild family and the bushes etc are all from satanic bloodlines. The shape shifting stuff is just demon possession and the fact that demons can manifest in this dimension in any form they want. But to walk the earth they have to possess a body. And that requires a human being who is willingly or unwillingly possessed. Just like with Christianity, satanist can be true believers or just be posing.  The reason these pedophile ring participants in high ranking positions are busted is because all of the most powerful people in the world are satanists. They own the media that brainwashes us to be atheists and to think Christians and conspiracy theorists are crazy. Satanic symbolism is embedded in all the major corporate branding, movies, tv show&#39;s and songs. The church people who warned your mom were right.there is heavy subliminal satanic symbolism in children&#39;s cartoons. ( hoodie satanic symbolism and Disney). Also, there are hand gestures satanists use such as Devil horns and the 666 hand gesture (also known as A OK hand gesture). You will see trump, bill Mahr, other top celebs and political figures posing with these hand gestures. It&#39;s not really meant to mean A ok or rock on when they use those gestures. You&#39;ll notice they will place their eye in the center of the hole they make with the 666 hand gesture which reinforces the satanic symbolism by adding the evil all seeing eye of lucifer symbol by highlighting one of their eyes in photo shoots and on film. It&#39;s real. That&#39;s why all of this is happening. It&#39;s a war for our souls as hard as it is to believe after decades of media brainwashing to think religion is bs. Christianity is the only true religion and Jesus is the only living God. This is what I&#39;ve come to believe. It all makes sense and comes together when you look at it from the point of. Ire if there bring a God and Satan. Why else would mankind destroy the each and eachother? We are being manipulated by a spirit world we no longer acknowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why there&#39;s a need is because God said in the Bible that the only way to Him is through Jesus. It&#39;s Jesus name that has authority over demons. That&#39;s who you have to accept as Lord and Savior to go to heaven and to be freed of demonic attacks. Christianity is the key to going to heaven and being delivered from evil. </p>

<p>Christianity is ridiculed in the media for this reason. Atheism does not lead to salvation. That&#39;s why the luciferians who run things push atheism and the worship of technology and science so demons can pose as aliens in the end times which is how the fallen angels plan to get our permission to take as many souls as they can because they are jealous of our ability to go to heaven. </p>

Father Malachi Martin talks about lucifer in the Vatican here. ](<a href="https://youtu.be/NlV7VviHuwU">https://youtu.be/NlV7VviHuwU</a>). Pope john Paul the VI said: &quot;the smoke of Satan has entered the church &quot; in 1972. There are satanic bishops performing satanic rituals under the Vatican. Thanks to Timothy Leary, Elron Hubbard and aleister Crowley, huge demonic gateways were opened in the 50s and 60s. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust any particular denomination or church. I just rely on the Bible and testimonies/experiences and what I see going on in the world. I just have to have a relationship with Jesus through prayer, fasting, doing good works and avoiding/repenting for sin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been around for a long time so I think it&#39;s nonexclusive to any OS. I used to do a lot of intricate interactive PDF creation so I stumbled across the functionality back then (~2010?) and I thought it unsettling that it could be done without the user being aware. It&#39;s done at script level on the document.

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that Epstein in particular has dirt on powerful people that protect him.</p>

<p>Trump nominated the judge that let Epstein off to be a Secretary in his Cabinet.</p>

<p>&quot;President Donald Trump&#39;s new nominee for secretary of labor, Alexander Acosta, could face a grilling in the Senate over claims that — while he was the top federal prosecutor in Miami — he cut a sweetheart plea deal in 2008 with a billionaire investor accused of having sex with dozens of underage girls.</p>

<p>As the U.S. attorney for Southern Florida, Acosta agreed not to file any federal charges against the wealthy financier, Jeffrey Epstein, if he pled guilty to state charges involving soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed 100% - The rich and powerful do not live the same lives that average americans do, it&#39;s a world of difference. It&#39;s hard to imagine but their entire life is completely different from the vast majority of americans, from their birth to their death and everything in between. Once you understand how different their lives really are (in every aspect) it makes sense, still disgusting to me though. I know that I wouldn&#39;t be the same person today if I didn&#39;t have to drudge through public school hell and below minimum wage hell etc. I&#39;ve hung out with the extremely wealthy a few times, and holy shit I can&#39;t even relate, their problems and concerns just sound so fucking juvenile to me. </p>

<p>Also, when you take someone to a fancy-fuck bar they didn&#39;t want to go to and order them a $20 shot of tequila they didn&#39;t ask for, it&#39;s customary to pay for the damn drink. /rant</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree. The only thought that stops me thinking about wanting to throw them in a tar pit and then setting said tar pit on fire is that I would likely be the  same had I grown up under similar circumstances (there but the grace of god, go I)</p>

<p>A few friends of mine, have been very well off. I couldn&#39;t stand to be around them very often, or for very long.</p>

<p>I hear you, besides, anyone trading $20 for a shot of liquor, doesn&#39;t know the value of twenty dollars. (even in an airport, I can get a shot off the top shelf for twelve - <em>with tip</em>.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually no public figures associate with him anymore except for some that are apparently being blackmailed by him like Prince Edwards. The NYC tabloids routinely feature pictures of models going in and out of his apartment in Manhattan. The elite class still associates with him because he&#39;s rich and connected, but most public figures and especially political figures won&#39;t because he&#39;s too toxic.</p>

<p>Epstein is the real &quot;Pizzagate&quot; and probably half of the Democratic party and the &quot;liberal&quot; establishment are connected to him in some way, and others like Trump. I assume that Epstein has the goods on thousands of powerful people.</p>

At some point Mia found photos of her then daughter dressed in a bathing suit but shot in an apartment in Woody&#39;s office that Woody took and was outraged. She was a teenager at the time (I&#39;m not sure her exact age but between 13-15) and this seems completely inappropriate for someone that you&#39;re dating.

You get into your car after pumping gas and notice him looking at you and he cracks that weird ass smile/smirk your direction.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How is that Jeffrey Epstein is a known pedophile and yet not only is he a free man, but all of your leaders and elite still associate with him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The elites are experts at creating the illusion that all is normal and that all the talk of pedophilia is meaningless. They carry on as if that hellish world they are connected with doesn&#39;t exist....so that to the eyes and minds of the people...it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The moment they behave as if they are guilty is the moment the elites have blinked in the eyes of the people. The guilty dominoes would start to fall the first being Epstein and then the filth that is associated with him and there is A LOT of elite filth associated with him. Epstein will die before they would ever allow that to happen.</p>

Most luciferians i know use stories from greek mythology to illustrate a concept of the importance of knowledge and the advancement of mankind.... They dont hold any favor for an evil force, set, abbadon, a devil, or as the christians call satan...

    <div class="md"><p>i mean, Dante Alighieri and  john Milton didn&#39;t write their epic poems untill the 15th and 17th centuries ... and many of their views are borrowed from catholic extrapolation with no textual foundations, not to mention dantes extensive use of roman mythology in conjunction with christian ideas.... and i believe paradise lost is more or less what set up a common narrative about The Devil being Lucifer and his fallen angels etc. and this was penned in 1667... like 56 years AFTER the KJV bible. aslo just a year late to have been a rather ominous publication year. ;] but gustav doires illustrations of both as well as those he did for the KJV Bible are pretty rad. recommend for the art alone.</p>
