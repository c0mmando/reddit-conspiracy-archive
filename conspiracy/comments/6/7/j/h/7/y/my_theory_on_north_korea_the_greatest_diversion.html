        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is my personal opinion that North Korea is a very gl dangerous threat to its regional neighbors due it is massive amount of Artillery nut not necessarily a nuclear threat. I understand that their technology to pursue intercontinental warfare is a ticking time bomb but we are able to sabotage their advances via Cyber Warfare buying us time against Nuclear Threat. </p>

<p>I believe if something big were to go down, if would be centered around Syria and preventing Russia from furthering controlling Europe&#39;s energy needs. We are seeing massive NATO encircling near the Russian borders and this is not to be taken lightly. The World is heavily focused on North Korea while all the pieces are set in place to stop Russian aggression against Europe should the US enter Syria with boots on the ground. </p>

<p>Why? The PetroDollar is the life blood of the American Economy and the pipeline originating out of Qatar through US ally territory onto Europe would be a massive setback to Russian energy control. In contrast to a pipe line proposed by Syria extending through Iraq, Iran and onto Russia which would give Russia more control over Europe&#39;s needs. Rebels started flooding into Syria when Assad shut down any notion of the Qatar proposed pipeline and suggested building his own to benefit itself, Iraq, a iran and Russia. </p>

<p>After WW2, we saw the rise of true American power as the Navy dominated the oceans and insured that America was insulated at the only global power by managing the world&#39;s shipping lanes. Fast forward to the end of the Cold War, Russia has always been severely insulted that Western European nations have ommited them from any sort of influence in the unified defense philosophy of Europe. Russia is still an impressive Power and have managed to weather the storm of sanctions put forth by the US and Europe and the tides are shifting. </p>

<p>During the 90s as American Consumerism reached Defcon Level &quot;We love things, not people,&quot; we opened trade with China which has altered the Geopolitical horizon for good. </p>

<p>China offers Russian influence a dynamic lifeline, to create a Eurasian Supercontinent that uses land routes for trade, ommiting the PetroDollar and circumventing American influence. This is happening as we speak as China quietly works towards high speed railing that will connect Europe to China. </p>

<p>I believe there will be a showdown in the future, America and allies versus Russia and China. </p>

<p>North Korea is a distraction in order to make the necessary moves in order to accomplish regime change in Syria that will either subject itself to America or be destabilized enough to prevent continued pursuit of such pipeline for the benefit of Russia. NATO continues to amass at the Russian borders, to call Putin&#39;s bluff that he is all in for Syria. </p>

<p>The series of events that will transpire after we enter Syria cannot be foretold, neither can Russia&#39;s breaking point. The US and Western Europe will continue to push the global elite agenda for the benefit of their coportations and this includes manipulating the world stage, we simply cannot predict how far Russia can be sanctioned, villafied and encircled at its borders before they decide that the West is an existential threat to is security. </p>

<p>I have no time frames, just some thoughts I&#39;ve put together reading hundreds of articles during sleepless nights. I wish I had sources but this is all information I&#39;ve gathered and retained throughout the years. </p>

<p>IMO the world has reached the point in the competition of resources that competing powers plot for sole influence, truly East vs West. </p>

<p>A little on me, I am a proud American and I stand by my country; this post was in effort to outline what seems to be the coming of turbulent times and if doomsday comes, I am an American. </p>

<p>Edit: I welcome any criticism, this helps me better understand the situation and gives me perspective on new trains of thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I totally agree here. NK is garbage. They&#39;ve been pumping themselves up for years, all talk. From a humanitarian standpoint, NK has some serious offenses that are just disgusting, but ain&#39;t a soul going to do much about it since OPEC and UN have no ties/interests in NK. </p>

<p>Like you said Syria is the fucking keystone to oil trade in the Middle East. Once Syrian Govt falls, Israel will expand its borders, ISIS will grow, and Saudis and Ergodan will have control over the oil in the Middle East. Last thing OPEC wants is Iran and Russia with a greater petro dollar than the current.</p>

<p>NK is a cover for something big happening in Syria. Moderate rebels aren&#39;t a thing. </p>
