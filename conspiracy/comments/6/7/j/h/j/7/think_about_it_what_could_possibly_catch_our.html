       The name itself screams Hollywood. It's designed to captivate our attention while subtly hinting at the backstory of  its namesake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gotham...often described as an apple, rotten to its core. Plagued by corruption, gang warfare and nefarious plots by psychotic super villains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, we know who the pychotic super villain is in this week's episode as all eyes focus on what North Korea might do.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while we wonder, Trump is calling the entire Senate to the White House on the same day "Gotham Shield" is commenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like watching a magician on stage. You know it's an illusion generated by distraction, slight of hand and rigged stage props.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some watch for the trickery while others wait to be astonished, but everyone observes the final product, the "Tah Dah" moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just like a movie script. Set the scene, develop the characters, build the suspense.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good writer knows how to build the momentum of the story. Just like a good magician. The timing is critical. If it happens too early, everything that follows is a letdown. If it happens too late it ends in an awkward tangle of loose ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       What will be the final product? What is the Tah Dah moment we are heading for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember...everything is happening right before our eyes as we watch for the trickery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spoiler alert. I want to point out something on the stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UN is calling for 2 billion dollars in aid to Yemen. And once again, the question of how to make sure that aid is delivered has become the critical factor. And it's happening right before our eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we're thinking about the super villain. We're watching the magician.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do me a favor if you want to understand the Yemen Tah-Dah" moment. Take the time to read this article.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/40200/yemens-complex-battlefield-includes-al-qaeda-links-allies/">
        https://www.justsecurity.org/40200/yemens-complex-battlefield-includes-al-qaeda-links-allies/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then go to the Wikipedia page for "Houthis".
      </p>
      <p>
       Look specifically for who the Houthis are aligned with...and who they're fighting against. It's an amazing list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then ask yourself this. How are some of the countries that are listed as their supporters assisting them?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Tah-Dah moment this time is Yemen. I guarantee it. This is just one of the magicians first tricks. It's just one of the first plot twists.

       I've got to find the references but the old 60's movie or show made it a point to show that Bruce Wayne's dad of grandfather was not only tapped for Skull &amp; Bones but he was a founding member.  Then there were coincidences with Aurora and Sandy Hook in the Nolan trilogy.  Oh yeah there was a 322 section that blew up during the football game.

       That's pretty mind boggling when  you think about it.  We have been sold characters like Batman and Superman and the rest are the good guys fighting against evil.  But all along they are they bad guys and those we perceive bad, the commoners most of the time, that take on special attributes were the good guys all along.

       It's a reference to the dark knight rises. The original 911 had a plan to blow up washington bridge and lincoln tunnel which was thwarted because some mossad agents got scared and fucked up, phoning in a false report on palestinians to the cops who then arrested the other israeli teams.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       911 also used nukes to demolish the buildings. French intel which was involved as well as israel/saudi arabia put out a book on underground nuclear reactors as a cover story for all the radiation/cancer/giant potholes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chris Nolan is definately either intel or a victim of remote sensing technology. Movies like inception aren't science fiction at all.

        Dispatcher: Jersey City police.
Caller:
        <strong>
         Yes, we have a white van, 2 or 3 guys in there, they look like Palestinians and going around a building.
        </strong>
        Caller: There's a minivan heading toward the Holland tunnel, I see the guy by Newark Airport mixing some junk and he has those sheikh uniform.

       AND a white van going suspiciously around a building would be a great ground crew to finish off the basement of the World Trade Center (like they did in 1993) should the building not fall from the planes.

       Judaism isn't a science, there's nothing that "goes against reality" other than the parent's religions. If the father is a jew but the mother is not, the child isn't a Jew. If the father is not a Jew, but the mother is, then the child is a Jew. It's that simple, so there's no such thing as being a "half-jew", other than being a term made up to further a political agenda.

       Yes, Jews are genetically different, they have the highest average IQ, then Asians, then Whites, then Blacks, then Muslims.

       I'm more interested in whether they have a genetic predisposition for psychopathy. They definately show that trait celebrating on 911.

       What parts did I miss?

      <p>
       911 was a cheap magic trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their "art" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">
        http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">
        http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the "art students":
      </p>
      <p>

       Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, "it's good for Israel".

       This is probably the best and most informative documentary on 911, so far. It goes into great detail and analysis of both sides of the argument. It is neatly indexed.

       The Corbett report has some good things on 9/11 as well, such as 9/11 a Conspiracy Theory (in 5 mins) and 9/11 Trillions: Follow the Money. We Are Change also has a good doc.

       911 was a cheap magic trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their "art" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!

        http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.

       Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:

       I know no plan the the Pentagon (likely a missile). I know the WTC towers were rigged with explosives and nano thermite. The planes that hit the WTC were replaced with stronger planes, LPas the highjacked planes that werle thought to hit the towers would have been torn apart going at those speeds and that close to the ground, where the air is a lot thicker.

       Bro you responded to my comments showing the evidence Israel did 911. Here's the evidence again:
      </p>
      <p>
       911 was a cheap magic trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:

       This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:
      </p>
      <p>

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their "art" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!

        http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:

        https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.
      </p>

       Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:

       The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:

       Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:

       Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the "art students":

       Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, "it's good for Israel".

       Israel's involvment in 911 has already been discussed in this thread. There is no rule in reddit against going off topic. Hence you don't want to talk about Israel's involvement in 911. Why is that? Why is that topic off limits to you?

       Bro I'm the one providing facts and evidence. You're the one trying to deflect. I present FBI report and you're like "pfft what do they know?" I give a video of a Pentagon employee saying she saw no plane and you're like "pentagon hires losers" I provide Mossad agents confessing they were on a mission on 911 and you're like "youtube is fake". You're account is not genuine. You're positions are not genuine. You're here with an agenda. And obviously it has something to do with Israel.

       lol how much do they pay Israeli shills? Ever wondered when the American people realise how Israel did 911 whether all the shills will have to pay it all back ... and I don't necessarily mean with cash. Read all you want into that comment.

       It's not Syria yet. Pretty sure they're going to use the "Iran is supplying the terrorist Houthis" a couple weeks into the Yemen move. Then the build up to Syria.

       Russia is listed as aligned with Houthis, as is North Korea...makes a ton of sense. (it doesn't)

       Of course they'll say this, they'll say anything to justify war. But there are thousands of groups like the Houthis. It's not clear-cut, and it never will be.

       And I kinda see what you mean with the list (North Korea? WTF) but most of that seems reasonable. I think you're suggesting a bigger implication here and it's going over my head.

       That's kinda been China's M.O. is to stay out of messy wars that aren't really any of their concern. Most of their involvement outside of their borders has been for natural resources IIRC. And that's smart of them.

       I'm honestly surprised there hasn't already been more talk of "boots on the ground" when it comes to Yemen. I do feel like there are more and more humanitarian stories in the MSM showing up from that country. Wouldn't shock me in the least if there were US troops on the ground come fall.
