        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The name itself screams Hollywood. It&#39;s designed to captivate our attention while subtly hinting at the backstory of  its namesake.</p>

<p>Gotham...often described as an apple, rotten to its core. Plagued by corruption, gang warfare and nefarious plots by psychotic super villains.</p>

<p>Well, we know who the pychotic super villain is in this week&#39;s episode as all eyes focus on what North Korea might do.</p>

<p>And while we wonder, Trump is calling the entire Senate to the White House on the same day &quot;Gotham Shield&quot; is commenced.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like watching a magician on stage. You know it&#39;s an illusion generated by distraction, slight of hand and rigged stage props. </p>

<p>Some watch for the trickery while others wait to be astonished, but everyone observes the final product, the &quot;Tah Dah&quot; moment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like a movie script. Set the scene, develop the characters, build the suspense.</p>

<p>A good writer knows how to build the momentum of the story. Just like a good magician. The timing is critical. If it happens too early, everything that follows is a letdown. If it happens too late it ends in an awkward tangle of loose ends.</p>

<p>What will be the final product? What is the Tah Dah moment we are heading for?</p>

<p>Remember...everything is happening right before our eyes as we watch for the trickery.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert. I want to point out something on the stage.</p>

<p>The UN is calling for 2 billion dollars in aid to Yemen. And once again, the question of how to make sure that aid is delivered has become the critical factor. And it&#39;s happening right before our eyes.</p>

<p>But we&#39;re thinking about the super villain. We&#39;re watching the magician.</p>

<p>Do me a favor if you want to understand the Yemen Tah-Dah&quot; moment. Take the time to read this article.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/40200/yemens-complex-battlefield-includes-al-qaeda-links-allies/">https://www.justsecurity.org/40200/yemens-complex-battlefield-includes-al-qaeda-links-allies/</a></p>

<p>Then go to the Wikipedia page for &quot;Houthis&quot;.</p>

<p>Look specifically for who the Houthis are aligned with...and who they&#39;re fighting against. It&#39;s an amazing list.</p>

<p>Then ask yourself this. How are some of the countries that are listed as their supporters assisting them? </p>

<p>The Tah-Dah moment this time is Yemen. I guarantee it. This is just one of the magicians first tricks. It&#39;s just one of the first plot twists.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty mind boggling when  you think about it.  We have been sold characters like Batman and Superman and the rest are the good guys fighting against evil.  But all along they are they bad guys and those we perceive bad, the commoners most of the time, that take on special attributes were the good guys all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a reference to the dark knight rises. The original 911 had a plan to blow up washington bridge and lincoln tunnel which was thwarted because some mossad agents got scared and fucked up, phoning in a false report on palestinians to the cops who then arrested the other israeli teams.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/10/05/911-filling-in-the-map-tracing-the-nukes/">http://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/10/05/911-filling-in-the-map-tracing-the-nukes/</a></p>

<p>911 also used nukes to demolish the buildings. French intel which was involved as well as israel/saudi arabia put out a book on underground nuclear reactors as a cover story for all the radiation/cancer/giant potholes. </p>

<p>Chris Nolan is definately either intel or a victim of remote sensing technology. Movies like inception aren&#39;t science fiction at all.</p>

<p>Oh, so the Cops said they were Palestinians first, and then the &quot;Middle Eastern Men&quot; went along with it? See, that&#39;s different from what you mentioned, like, the complete opposite. </p>

<p>AND a white van going suspiciously around a building would be a great ground crew to finish off the basement of the World Trade Center (like they did in 1993) should the building not fall from the planes. </p>

<p>Judaism isn&#39;t a science, there&#39;s nothing that &quot;goes against reality&quot; other than the parent&#39;s religions. If the father is a jew but the mother is not, the child isn&#39;t a Jew. If the father is not a Jew, but the mother is, then the child is a Jew. It&#39;s that simple, so there&#39;s no such thing as being a &quot;half-jew&quot;, other than being a term made up to further a political agenda. </p>

<p>Yes, Jews are genetically different, they have the highest average IQ, then Asians, then Whites, then Blacks, then Muslims. </p>

<p>I&#39;m more interested in whether they have a genetic predisposition for psychopathy. They definately show that trait celebrating on 911.</p>

<p>What parts did I miss?</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick.</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p><a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207</a></p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report</a></p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a></p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html</a></p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices.

<p>This is the topic, Israel did 911.</p>

<p>No. Why didn&#39;t the Government? Why did they ship the debri to be sold to China for scrap, instead of doing a thorough investigation?</p>

<p>Yes. Why is this hard to follow? Turns out what they &quot;planned for&quot; was very little like what actually happened.</p>

<p>Um ... a slightly larger (though carrying less fuel) plane hit the building at a speed less than their simulated impact. Do you even think about what you say before you write it? </p>

<p>President, yes. And?</p>

<p>You saying this guy doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about? You saying America is run by an idiot?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The WTC was mostly aluminum and glass. </p>

<p>This is very misleading statement. What is relevant is the outer skin which the alleged plane allegedly punched a hole through. It was steel THICKER THAN TANK ARMOUR. You&#39;re being very misleading. Just because a fridge is mostly air and food doesn&#39;t mean you can punch a hole through the door.</p>

<p>Yep the Transasian plane wing had inertia, the taxi had inertia, the bridge had inertia, and what do you know, aluminium was torn to shreds and the bridge undamaged.</p>

<p>You know when a bridge collapses under loads it was designed to withstand then the engineers or construction workers fucked up and they get sued. The &quot;no culpability&quot; isn&#39;t based on fact because it never went to court. It never went to court because the Government made the victims sign a document preventing them from suing Americans.</p>

<p>lol a plane hit the empire state building in the past. They designed for the situation because it was a possibility. Isn&#39;t it weird the port authority told everyone to go back to work? It&#39;s almost like they were relying on engineers assessment that a plane can&#39;t bring down the WTC. Why weren&#39;t they sued even though their decision led to deaths? Oh wait because the Government made the victims sign a document preventing them from holding Americans accountable.</p>

<p>Has that ever happened before? The Government just says &quot;we&#39;ll bail out the engineers and architects who fucked up here&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not.</p>

<p>It also had windows and beams.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the dumbest thing...</p>

<p>If the fridge door however, were made up of windows, girders and floors/walls, that would be quite a bit easier.</p>

<p>Yep. It did.</p>

<p>Not comparable though.</p>

<p>It did, not comparable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the bridge had inertia, and what do you know, aluminium was torn to shreds and the bridge undamaged.</p>

<p>That&#39;s fine, is this a comparable scenario?</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not. Might as well use a fridge rolling down a hill as a model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know when a bridge collapses under loads it was designed to withstand then the engineers or construction workers fucked up and they get sued.</p>

<p>Not if there&#39;s no negligence or culpability like if there&#39;s a huge unforseen event like an attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;no culpability&quot; isn&#39;t based on fact because it never went to court.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s a moot point that you made up.</p>

<p>See above.</p>

<p>engulfing most of the building</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nd can you give any other example of a STEEL skyscraper totally collapsing due to fire? :)</p>

<p>Can you give another example of two fully loaded jet airliners crashing at high speed into buildings?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lol a plane hit the empire state building in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was it the same kind of plane travelling at the same speed? (Answer: not even close)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isn&#39;t it weird the port authority told everyone to go back to work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Weird? No. One thing you can usually count on during chaotic situations is a lot of bad decision making.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why weren&#39;t they sued even though their decision led to deaths?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their &quot;decision&quot; didn&#39;t lead to deaths. An unusual circumstance led to deaths. Since there was no precedent anywhere for the events that unfolded, it&#39;s not reasonable to hold a decades-old assumption as concrete.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Government just says &quot;we&#39;ll bail out the engineers and architects who fucked up here&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t fuck up. That demand is unreasonable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro you responded to my comments showing the evidence Israel did 911. Here&#39;s the evidence again:</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick.</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p><a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207</a></p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report</a></p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a></p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html</a></p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>Being a smart ass doesn&#39;t destroy them or their points. Isn&#39;t it interesting how you can&#39;t &quot;destroy&quot; how Israel did 911 and Israelis danced for joy spilling American blood? I guess there&#39;s too much evidence even for you to ignore. :)</p>

<p>Actually no, I destroyed you, and you, being butthurt, resorted to copypasta and deflections.</p>

<p>Can you even read? Do you not understand how impressions work? Maybe english isn&#39;t your first language and you&#39;re confused.</p>

<p>So you can&#39;t even make a case for your points without resorting to such petty tactics?</p>

<p>Classic.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t the one deflecting every point, resorting to copypasta and petty attacks. That was all you, I can quote you on it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When did I ever say anything about this?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>And yet you keep coming back to it because you can&#39;t actually back yourself up when faced.</p>

<p>Oh so you only now understood what&#39;s going on. Is English your second language? You didn&#39;t answer the question. And again, I say &quot;Isn&#39;t it interesting how you can&#39;t &quot;destroy&quot; how Israel did 911 and Israelis danced for joy spilling American blood?&quot; and you seem to think that sentence implies that you spoke about it. Clearly you aren&#39;t a native speaker.</p>

<p>Where do you come from? Why do you refuse to discuss Israel&#39;s role in 911? What is the agenda of your newly created account which isn&#39;t genuine?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really have an opinion on it. Which is why I didn&#39;t comment on it.</p>

<p>Funny that you kept deflecting to it because you failed at substantiating all your other points.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t refused, I didn&#39;t mention it. Just like  I haven&#39;t refused to talk about the weather, or whether I prefer deep dish or thin crust.</p>

<p>lol how much do they pay Israeli shills? Ever wondered when the American people realise how Israel did 911 whether all the shills will have to pay it all back ... and I don&#39;t necessarily mean with cash. Read all you want into that comment.</p>

<p>Of course they&#39;ll say this, they&#39;ll say anything to justify war. But there are thousands of groups like the Houthis. It&#39;s not clear-cut, and it never will be. </p>
