Anti-Jew, anti-Islam, anti-this, anti-that; where did all this come from? I remember when we all rallied around the Rothschild conspiracy, or 9/11, or secret military space craft. What happened to good wholesome questioning of governments and fact? And when did it become a hate campaign against a religion or ethnic group? I&#39;m all for questioning the trends and happenings of today and the past, but it&#39;s sad to see so much aggression towards people who likely have no connection to anything suspicious. </p>

<p>What&#39;s happened to this sub is really just silly. I want my JFK conspiracy sub back, not &#39;Oswald was a JEW!!! Bad JEWS!!!&#39; (Exaggeration). I commend all the people who work hard on digging through conspiracies and getting facts and intense leads; I think what has happened to this sub is a damn shame and an insult to people who actually give a damn about conspiracies. </p>

<p>And it is completely subjective.  Is it &quot;hateful&quot; to express outrage at elite pedophiles?  Are you being hateful to them?</p>

<p>Hatred and love go hand in hand.  Everyone hates.  It matters WHAT you hate.  Hatred of those things that are evil is a GOOD thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did provide evidence, and you just confirmed it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m accurately describing those groups</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that is something that you DID do. An ad hominem is when you just attack someone&#39;s character. I&#39;m attacking your positions, positions which you agree that you hold.</p>

<p>I&#39;d encourage you to take a critical thinking or philosophy course. You are using terms like evidence and proof but I don&#39;t think you really understand their connections to valid arguments. </p>

<p>If you think about it, evidence has to pass criteria in order for us to call it valid in everyday life. I can see a glass of juice on the counter and that is very compelling evidence that there is a glass of juice on the counter. Someone can also come up to me and say, that isn&#39;t a glass of juice on the counter, it&#39;s a rhinoceros. Their speech is also evidence of a kind, but should it be as compelling to me? There have to be reasons that we admit certain evidence and not others. The thing about genetic data is that it&#39;s reproducible. If I&#39;m a geneticist, I can look at another geneticists claim that whites are the descendents of israelis and I can test that for myself in a separate test with separate samples of DNA. Then, if I find it true, it lends a lot of creedence to the idea because two different people with different ideas both found it true. One of those people may be a jewish cuck and the other might be an anglo saxon israelite, but what makes it compelling is that their opinions don&#39;t matter--the data shows the same thing no matter what. Someone writing an academic or theological paper can also be evidence or proof, because they can organize evidence in a new way we haven&#39;t seen before, and illuminate a new pattern. But when their ideas come into conflict with scientific ideas, those ones that are testable and reproducible, we can amend what we think is true about the world (aka integrating new evidence into our worldview), or we can just say that scientific data doesn&#39;t count for some reason. &quot;Because it&#39;s run by the jewish elite conspiracy,&quot; maybe. In one of these instances, we&#39;re using all the data available to LEARN what is true about the world. In the other instance, we already KNOW what is true and we&#39;re picking which evidence to admit based on whether it agrees with that or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For example, the meaning of the name &quot;Adam&quot; in Hebrew.</p>

<p>The word &quot;Adam&quot; in the Hebrew is &quot;aw-dam&#39;&quot;, which means &quot;to show blood (in the face), i.e. flush or turn rosy&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I looked this up when you posted it before and I can find one other place other than your, again, fringe religion website, that gives that definition. When I dug through all the more widely used definitions of Adam as &quot;man&quot; and &quot;human&quot;, I found one that said it means &quot;red.&quot; Okay. So Adam might mean red or rosy, and the reason for that COULD be that he was white.
Now, on the other hand, we also have millions of pieces of archaeological research and genetic research and anthropological research saying that anyone that lived in that area of the world 6k years ago they would have been darker skinned. But all that evidence doesn&#39;t count because it&#39;s corrupted by jewish elites. Only your one piece of evidence from Strong&#39;s Hebrew Lexicon counts.</p>

<p>These are the bad choices of evidence I&#39;m talking about. You have one piece of half-evidence from ancient linguistics and you&#39;re holding on to it as if it is definite confirmation of white supremacy. Let me tell you, I was a Chinese linguist in the Air Force, and I have a degree in English. The etymology of a word often has nothing to do with the word. Even if Adam meant rosy, it could be because of a million different reasons, and there&#39;s only a small chance that it&#39;s the reason you are inflating it to be. And yet you don&#39;t think that any other explanation is sufficient. That is massively myopic thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s only one piece of the evidence which supports the fact that only the white race descends from Adam and Eve.</p>

<p>This is also supported by the fact that the people primarily concerned with the &quot;traditions of Abraham&quot; over the course of modern history have almost exclusively been the white peoples (and &quot;hybrids&quot; or mongrels with significant white ancestry...eg, Arabs). </p>

<p>For thousands of years, blacks and asians were isolated in Africa and the Far East and overwhelmingly unconcerned or unaware of the traditions of Adam, Abraham, and their descendants -- with the exception of the last few hundred years when white missionaries spread Christianity among blacks and asians.  Why?  Because blacks and Asians do not descend from Adam and Eve.</p>

There is a mormon archaeologist that studied the jawbones of ancient Native americans and ancient jews and thinks that their jawbones are similar.

<p>I have seen evidence that the Israelite traders travelled (via ships) all over Europe and even to North America as early as around 1,000 BC.  But I don&#39;t believe that they ever immigrated to North American in any substantive numbers at that time.  </p>

<p>Many anthropologists believe that the white/European peoples originated in the Mid East. The term &quot;Caucasian&quot; (referring to the Caucasian mountains, just north of modern day Iraq, Turkey and Iran) supports this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all. The term &quot;caucasian&quot; was taken and applied to white people by a phrenologist, who thought Georgians were the most beautiful people on earth. Like all phrenologists, he tries to draw facts from his conclusions, and it comes out as a steaming pile of <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.969.2221&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf">bullshit.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is also supported by the fact that the people primarily concerned with the &quot;traditions of Abraham&quot; over the course of modern history have almost exclusively been the white peoples (and &quot;hybrids&quot; or mongrels with significant white ancestry...eg, Arabs). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating. Did you know Indians are the people primarily concerned with the traditions of Krishna?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For thousands of years, blacks and asians were isolated in Africa and the Far East and overwhelmingly unconcerned or unaware of the traditions of Adam, Abraham, and their descendants -- with the exception of the last few hundred years when white missionaries spread Christianity among blacks and asians. Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Genesis isn&#39;t a reliable source of history.</p>

<p>Now, I will ask you, who controls the Intelligence community/agencies? It sure as shit isn&#39;t Jewish run. The group that controls that are Jesuits. Go ahead and look that up. Either Jesuit or Jesuit trained, not Jewish. I&#39;d this is the most important sector to have control of, you know why? The ones who have the information/dirt have the power via blackmail.</p>

<p>All roads lead to Rome (The Holy Roman Empire). The US is the military wing of the Tri-Sovereign States. Khazars are mercenaries for Rome and have been for thousands of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>And it is completely subjective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, and sometimes it can be hard to tell whether something is hateful or just plain ignorant. Like when you said this, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea that all humans are &quot;family&quot; is a lie propagated by the ruling Jewish Establishment and the apostate &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; churches -- and supported by the fraudulent theory of evolution -- which serves as a basis for the &quot;multicultural&quot;, race-mixing, and &quot;one world community&quot; agenda that is designed to destroy the white race through mongrelization and absorption with the non-white races.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The black, white, and asian races -- in their pure-blooded states, absent any mixing among the races -- are of completely different lineage. They were created separately, and are essentially different species of &quot;humans.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whom, then, are the descendants of Adam and Eve? The evidence strongly indicates that it is the white race. The word &quot;Adam&quot; in the Hebrew is &quot;aw-dam&#39;&quot;, which means &quot;to show blood (in the face), i.e. flush or turn rosy&quot;. Only the white race can blush and show blood in the face.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if you believe the theory of evolution, you must believe that the white race is &quot;brothers&quot; with blacks and asians</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your case, maybe it&#39;s a little (or a lot) of both?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this comment section is evidence enough that r/nazi has come to r/conspiracy is full force. Yes, there is such a thing as hate speech, it&#39;s when you lump a whole group of people together under a single banner. Example: Jews control the world. Truth: There are people with Jewish backgrounds that have extensive reach over our political and economic system. See the difference? </p>

<p>I am in no way offended by people calling me a &quot;Jew Lover&quot; has someone was so kind to inbox me. I love all people and nationalities, and I will not try to silence you for your opinion. What I will do is tell you to move your circle jerk hate to another sub. Just because your posts have a slight conspiracy lean does not make them a conspiracy. Flat Earthers have more reason to be in this sub than nazi&#39;s wanting to bring the 3rd Reich. (Sorry Flat Earthers, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll ever win me over, but keep posting, I like the questioning and discussion.) </p>

<p>I want to ask the mods to start removing clear and obvious hate speech posts. This is a very fine line and one that I think should be tread carefully. Those types of posts belong in other subs, this sub is for real conspiracies.</p>

<p>I mean we can&#39;t be experts in every religion/cult, but it doesn&#39;t take much research to see that the Jewish faith promotes their supremecy /right to control over the common person/sheep/goy. ..same goes for many other religions but they do not have the same amount of power thus they receive much less attention.</p>

<p>It would be better to not use the word &quot;Jew&quot; unless it has to do with Biblical text, or ancient history. Just call the ones that are evil &quot;gefiltesharks&quot;. They are sharks that love to devour the bigger tasty fish; like Gentile Grouper Fish, Shiksa Snapper, and Typewriterkeh Tuna. We Jews who are the little gefiltefishes just swim around; minding our own business, while the gefiltesharks are devouring everything in sight.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, and that&#39;s okay (not really sure how that&#39;s a conspiracy though).</p>

<p>However, what I also see is (in this very post):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am convinced that due to a mixture of genetics &amp; culture, Jewish people tend to have certain characteristics, this includes: sociopathic tendencies along with a strong in-group bias.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>When a large portion of your &quot;faith&quot; revolves around world domination, it gets brought up</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hate speech&quot; is a Marxist smear buzzword used to shut down free speech. And it is completely subjective. Is it &quot;hateful&quot; to express outrage at elite pedophiles? Are you being hateful to them?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Jews are mongrels</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Hatespeech&#39; is just the rebranded propagandaterm &#39;anticommunist&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>There are no &quot;white supremacists&quot; - there are, in fact, Jew Supremacists.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible that the holocaust was something other than we&#39;re told, that framed Nazis for something they didn&#39;t do</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>So what if I am a racist? How is it wrong for whites to promote their collective interests?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<p>Now a few from some other threads in the last couple days:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The jews are children of Satan</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>It is biologically impossible for all human races to have a common ancestral origin. Only the white/European race descends from Adam and Eve.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Oy vey muh raycism.</p>

<p>Starting to feel sick looking through this, but anyway.</p>

<p>Yep, no racism here, just 100% valid criticism of the various Jewish texts!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say racism doesn&#39;t exist on this forum. Here&#39;s some quotes to get you started on why people may feel this way. </p>

<p>&quot;The Jews are called human beings, but the non-Jews are not humans. They are beasts.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Talmud: Baba mezia, 114b</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;The Akum (non-Jew) is like a dog. Yes, the scripture teaches to honor the the dog more than the non-Jew.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Ereget Raschi Erod. 22 30</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Even though God created the non-Jew they are still animals in human form. It is not becoming for a Jew to be served by an animal. Therfore he will be served by animals in human form.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Midrasch Talpioth, p. 255, Warsaw 1855</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;A pregnant non-Jew is no better than a pregnant animal.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Coschen hamischpat 405</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;The souls of non-Jews come from impure sprits and are called pigs.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Jalkut Rubeni gadol 12b</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Although the non-Jew has the same body structure as the Jew, they compare with the Jew like a monkey to a human.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Schene luchoth haberith, p. 250 b</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;If you eat with a Gentile, it is the same as eating with a dog.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Tosapoth, Jebamoth 94b</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;If a Jew has a non-Jewish servant or maid who dies, one should not express sympathy to the Jew. You should tell the Jew: &quot;God will replace &#39;your loss&#39;, just as if one of his oxen or asses had died&quot;.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Jore dea 377, 1</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Sexual intercourse between Gentiles is like intercourse between animals.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Talmud Sanhedrin 74b</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;It is permitted to take the body and the life of a Gentile.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Sepher ikkarim III c 25</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;It is the law to kill anyone who denies the Torah. The Christians belong to the denying ones of the Torah.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Coschen hamischpat 425 Hagah 425. 5</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;A heretic Gentile you may kill outright with your own hands.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Talmud, Abodah Zara, 4b</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Every Jew, who spills the blood of the godless (non-Jews), is doing the same as making a sacrifice to God.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Talmud: Bammidber raba c 21 &amp; Jalkut 772</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the day in this SJW society no matter what we term them,  kabbalists,  molochites,  zionists,  jews, whatever, they are uncriticizable and we&#39;ll all be termed anti semetic nazi white supremecists because holocaust.

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya, and expect this might be deleted though it shouldn&#39;t as these are only a few <strong>facts</strong> for the argument of using it.   </p>

<p>An Israeli state IMO is not a problem, A Zionist state is a problem. In 1948 it was proclaimed by David Ben Guerion (the head of The World Zionist movement) in the &quot;Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel&quot; that Israel is a Jewish State. This declaration is in itself is in violation of their own Torah and &quot;The Three Oaths&quot;.   </p>

<p>In 2009, Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman stated that &quot;step by step, Torah law will become the binding law in the State of Israel. This statement, the original declaration of a Jewish State and the Foundations of Law Act(which encourages judges to use Jewish law in their decisions) essentially remove any prospects of The Palestinians ever again having the opportunity to live as equals on their own land.  </p>

<p>So from all of this it&#39;s pretty clear that the Zionists will stop at nothing, not even violating their own scripture to bring about a Halachic state.   </p>

<p>I appreciate that their might be alot there to take in, maybe more than most US Jews are aware of. However a Wiki search for &quot;Israeli Declaration of Independence&quot; will give you a start. As always being educated with real facts is the only place to start from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have nothing against Jews. I have never believed much of the stuff about how the Jews are evil and whatever.</p>

<p>One thing that is important though, that I think is being lost here, is that you can criticize a system of belief without hating the people that believe in it.</p>

<p>Personally I hate Islam because I view it as anti-women&#39;s rights. You cannot look at the Quran, hadith, or the life of Mohammed and act like its this uber feminist belief system that uplifts women. Strangely, there have been tons of articles and people popping up lately that are arguing that very thing. Saying that Mohammed was a feminist (a man who married a 6 year old girl). The weird defense of Islam is something taht I am very suspicious of, considering that its against just about all the things that make up western culture. Being against it doesn&#39;t make you a nazi. </p>

<p>As for how that is related to conspiracy stuff, ask yourself why celebrities who show their tits to the world constantly defend something like Islam? That is a really, really incongruous thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really against all of the Abrahamic faiths to be honest and I think that people trying to silence those who criticize these religions are harmful to secularism. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate people who believe in those religions, but I will not hold myself back from saying that its against my rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Criticism is important. I believe democracy and freedom of speech cannot work with out criticism, it is equally important to experience new ideas though. I don&#39;t want to imply that you haven&#39;t researched and experienced Islam, but in my experience there are many reasons to accept Islam as a peaceful religion, just as Christianity. The problem with both is that there is hate in both, and really most religions, religion is a way to explain and understand the world and it must be taken with a grain of salt. </p>

<p>People who flash their tits and then preach for Islam are not mutually exclusive. You have freedoms and rights, I will protect them as I protect mine; that does not mean I cannot act as I choose. There are also many different meanings for the same words. Marriage for example, for many peoples marriage was not a choice, it was a given life for your family. Marriage today in the US is a choice and individual rights are valued over family rights. Neither is right or wrong, circumstances plays an important part in why a culture exists as it does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The OP is right. The mods need to think long and hard about if they want to continue to allow this sub to give neo-Nazis at platform to spread their hate speech, ruin this sub&#39;s reputation and possibly get banned from Reddit. I understand the fear many of you have about censorship, but there is already censorship--even this sub has some basic rules about what you can and can&#39;t post. There is already a rule about no racial slurs, so why can&#39;t we just expand/clarify that rule a bit to say hate speech is not permitted here and any posts that generalize all people of a race, ethnicity, religion, etc. in a negative way (e.g., the Jews, the Muslims, the blacks, etc.) will be removed. </p>

<p>As the OP showed in examples above it is quite simple to get your point across in a non-hateful manner. I don&#39;t think anyone is trying to ban posts about Israel or Zionism, which fall under the conspiracy banner, but we are pleading with the mods and members of this community to stop the hate speech and blaming all Jews. If you mean Zionists or religions extremists, please say that and not &quot;the Jews,&quot; otherwise it is considered hate speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize that by the end of this last election cycle, nearly everyone and their grandmother has been called a nazi. So who gets decide who is a nazi? Are we all nazis?</p>

<p>I get it, you want to treat everyone as individuals. A nice thought, and something I used to agree with. It was through reading I was convinced of the reality of race and that race is a driving force behind much of what we see in the world (one such book I would recommend is <em>Race, Evolution, and Behavior : A Life History</em>).</p>

<p>But the thing that <em>really</em> got me interested is the fierceness with which I was attacked for merely wanting to discuss these ideas. Well-intentioned folks just like yourself, all too ready to call me a nazi and end it there. That word, they treat it like it&#39;s a loaded gun. And everyone&#39;s just itching to pull the trigger.</p>

<p>We are already considered a hate sub by <a href="/r/AgainstHateSubreddits">/r/AgainstHateSubreddits</a> and by extension the entirety of the admins. This is what they want. Once we are all banned off, they will begin indoctrinating the youth who find reddit and there goes free will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wtf? &quot;Hypothetically possible&quot;? I think you don&#39;t know what the word hypothetical means, and I feel like you might not even understand what the word possible means.</p>

<p>If you say something hypothetically, it means you take it as true, even if it isn&#39;t. Therefore literally anything is hypothetically possible. It&#39;s hypothetically possible that my cock is bigger than I am. It&#39;s hypothetically possible I&#39;m sitting in my mom late right now bathing in the blood of virgins drinking some earl grey. </p>

<p>So yes, well done, everything you said is hypothetically possible. Is it possible in the real world? No. Fuck off. Ethic groups are not a fucking hive mind. Jewish people are not ants, white people are not beas. Groups don&#39;t make decisions, people do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just google &quot;hypothetically possible&quot; to see thousands of results. It is normal colloquial english. </p>

<p>To help explain - a square triangle is not hypothetically possible. It cannot exist, even hypothetically. I hope that makes sense to you.</p>

<p>Asking is it &quot;physically possible&quot; would be a similar phrasing.</p>

<p>I think this doesn&#39;t really matter though. You know what I am asking, but are nitpicking my questions because you do not want to answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible in the real world? No. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ethic groups are not a fucking hive mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ethnic groups being a hive mind is not required for them to act in their own interests. Corporations act in there own interest, countries act in their own interests, none of these things are hiveminds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jewish people are not ants, white people are not bees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this an argument?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>a square triangle is not hypothetically possible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, it is. Why not? There&#39;s a lot of useful mathematics based on things that can&#39;t exist in the real world. If I was into geometry we could have a whole discussion about this. What would a square/triangle be? Would it have 3.5 sides? What would a fractional side be? Just because you can&#39;t visualise it, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t hypotehtically possible. I&#39;m assuming you can&#39;t visualise 5+ dimensional polygons very well, but they&#39;re used every day in things like error correction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Asking is it &quot;physically possible&quot; would be a similar phrasing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it wouldn&#39;t. If you meant that, you should have said it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Corporations act in their own interest</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corporations don&#39;t act at all. The people that run corporations act. In fact they don&#39;t always make decisions in their best interest, because humans make mistakes and have bad judgement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>countries act in their own interests</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ditto.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is this an argument?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s using the English language to make a point - that ethnic groups are not hive minds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it not possible for an ethnic group to act in their own interest?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because ethnic groups don&#39;t make decisions. People do.</p>

<p>In the words of Crass in their (excellent) song &quot;Big A, Little A&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But no one ever changed the church by pulling down a steeple</p>

<p>And you&#39;ll never change the system by bombing number ten</p>

<p>Systems just aren&#39;t made of bricks they&#39;re mostly made of people</p>

<p>You may send them into hiding, but they&#39;ll be back again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a point but I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re angry with me and I really dislike being grouped together wih Alex Jones. </p>

<p>You are also wrong. </p>

<p>There are certainly power structures (you mentioned some &quot;good&quot; ones) that identify as jewish, uses jewish symbols and define most of their core values in &quot;jewish terms&quot;. </p>

<p>These power structures cannot - rationally at least - be equated to the entirety of Judaism. It is obvious that there are jews that are not part of these power structures. It is obvious that there are jews that are strongly against specific power structures.</p>

<p>I feel it is beneficial to focus on these power structures instead of blaming their actions on a poorly defined, and rather large group, such as &quot;jews&quot;.</p>

<p>I agree that there are probably very powerful groups of people who &quot;identify as jewish&quot;. However these are not &quot;the jews&quot;. It is false logic.</p>

I listened to like a 5 hour podcast about the holocaust from Those Conspiracy Guys and they brought up many arguments from people who deny it happened or question the numbers.

<p>The only counterpoint I would make is that the Holocaust itself was a conspiracy that required thousands of people to be in on it.   </p>

<p>The Nazis were keeping the existence of these camps a secret from the entire German population is my understanding.  The order to exterminate the Jews was made in secret and carried out in secret.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that all the criticisms that people generally have about conspiracies (i.e., thousands of people can&#39;t keep a secret) applies to the Holocaust itself.    </p>

<p>I know its a sensitive subject.  Just believe me when I say that any doubts I have are not rooted in antisemitism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be happy to answer questions.</p>

<p>I come from a pretty progressive family that doesn&#39;t care for Israel but few of them want to believe in the greater Israel conspiracy. They do not approve of the apartheid policies and are super anti-Netanyahu. They think that Jews need a place to live as they have been a long persecuted group but that doesn&#39;t meant they get to dominate, subjugate, and destroy to get it.</p>

<p>As for Israel&#39;s undo influence on the US through AIPAC, my family is super anti-corruption and they view moneyed interests lobbying as legalized corruption. Many of them do not see the power dynamics and think that Israel is the US&#39;s pet in the region as opposed to the other way around.</p>

<p>The holocaust is something that I see too much evidence both physical and anecdotal to deny. I understand that liberating Russian forces and survivors created some narratives that do not follow but my grandfather lost family right before his very eyes and would tear up talking about it. I understand that many would have doubts about his testimony but he started me down this conspiracy road, he taught me about Rothschilds influence, he hated the federal reserve, and spoke about the racket of war to anyone that would listen.</p>

<p>I think the narrative on that one is that it happened, but it&#39;s possible that the numbers were inflated to receive more empathy. It definitely happened though.</p>

<p>I think things like that and anti-vaxxer were possibly successful smear campaigns to simplify and demonize those opinions. Anti-Vaxxers are not truly anti-vaxxers. They just think that not all vaccines are equal and some have benefits that are outweighed by the cons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m Jewish as well. I honestly am still finding my place on the topic of Israel. I can see as a fact that it&#39;s very corrupt, but I also see sides such as the natural inclining for Christians to help Israel because it&#39;s known as the chosen people, as well as the fact that they have much lesser discriminatory standards of most of the middle East. The entire middle East is a very strange subject for me. There&#39;s problems riddled everywhere, and I can never pinpoint the blame on one individual or state. Israel is usually an outlier. Always in a strange position. I have absolutely no doubts about the Holocaust. My grandmother still lives in Israel, and I Skype with her every morning. She definitely loves the country, though old she may be she is in no way evil and if anything cropped up there I believe she would be vocal. That could also mean that the government is good at keeping their people out of the know, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, except the phrase is &quot;internation banking interestes&quot;, not &quot;US banking interests&quot;. And, most of the lists I&#39;ve seen of Jewish people are blatantly false.</p>

<p>For example that red green spreadsheet from the other day - most of it is just made up &quot;this guy is totes a jew because we think so even though there&#39;s literally no evidence for this&quot;, so I don&#39;t really buy it.</p>

<p>Also you should really remove &quot;or have jewish spouses&quot;, as that is next to meaningless.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, pllease don&#39;t just copy paste things without revealing the source - for all I know you could be pasting this from some government statistics board or from the daily stormer or some random reddit post, and there&#39;s quite a bit of difference in the reliability of those sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It goes deeper than &quot;Zionists&quot;. I am convinced that due to a mixture of genetics &amp; culture Jewish people tend to have certain characteristics, this includes: sociopathic tendencies along with a strong in-group bias.</p>

<p>People here come so close but for fear of being called racist stop before the line. </p>

<p>Where do you think Zionism came from? Why should this sort of ideology emerge from this group of people? Why can I find quotes from thousands of governments officials, war generals, businessmen - throughout time and from all across the world - all warning me again and again of this one group of people?</p>

<p>Zionism does not exist in vacuum. I don&#39;t care if it makes you feel better or seem more  &quot;tolerant&quot;. Some of are legitimately interested in the Jewish question.</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick.</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p><a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207</a></p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report</a></p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a></p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html</a></p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>It seems like ever since the election this sub has become a platform for hate speech.</p>

<p>The alt right and t_D are largely to blame for the objective uptick in hate speech.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anti-Jew, anti-Islam, anti-this, anti-that; where did all this come from? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anti-Jew and anti-Islam came from very different places. I&#39;d assert that anti-Jew is part of conspiracy theory culture and always has been; the last election has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Anti-Islam (largely) comes from western 21st century propaganda. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to add that there are valid criticisms of both that come naturally to anyone who would study the doctrines of either. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remember when we all rallied around the Rothschild conspiracy, or 9/11, or secret military space craft. What happened to good wholesome questioning of governments and fact?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Rothschild conspiracy is an anti-Jew conspiracy.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And when did it become a hate campaign against a religion or ethnic group?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hate campaign about muslims began right after 9-11. I would say the hate campaign against jews began right around 2015 or so. That largely is connected to the rise of the alt-right which is inherently anti-Jewish. </p>

<p>Now, allow me to ask you something.</p>

<p>Is it possible that the holocaust was something other that framed Nazi&#39;s for something they didn&#39;t do in a similar way that the world trade center attacks framed the Arabic world for something they didn&#39;t do? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Holocaust happened without a doubt, people came back from it which is enough proof for me. I can question the details of what happened and to what extent, it would be difficult to prove to me that it was not an enormous effort on the nazi&#39;s part. </p>

<p>I think that we let 9/11 happen, I don&#39;t think we made it happen. I mean we set up the networks and gave the skills to people who we didn&#39;t fully understand, but I haven&#39;t seen solid evidence for us planting bombs or hiring them. I think our actions in the region over the many years would be enough to stir that type of response. The narratives that have spun out of 9/11 are extreme and need to be read throughly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I often wonder if they had full knowlege that they were going to hijack the planes but that the plan was to gain the political capital fom the attempt but to end it peacefully in some way (or at least without the death of passengers) and that it was an enormous surprise when they took control of the planes but rather than fly them, crashed them into buildings.  If this was the case then you really can&#39;t claim that a &#39;911 conspiracy&#39; would be too big to hide and that somebody would have to let the cat out of the bag.  Anybody and everybody who was part of that scheme would never mention a breath outside of their co-planners to anybody ever.  Anybody who was even in the situation where they didn&#39;t know about it but in some way was responsible for letting others do it would probably keep quiet too.  If they threatened to blab then I imagine that those responsible would just say that they were actually part of it but are trying to wriggle out and blame others to save their skin.  If you thought that the American public were going to find out that you hatched a plan that went so famously and terribly wrong then you would do whatever it took to keep it from them.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with making a blanket statement that &quot;the holocaust happened&quot; is that it asserts specific details implicit in naming it so.</p>

<p>Let me put it another way. Is it unreasonable, in your mind, to think that perhaps the number was less (even if all other details are the same). </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say maybe it was 3-4 million jews killed in the holocaust. Others were displaced but maybe they weren&#39;t all killed. Is that outside of the realm of possibility? </p>

<p>Well guess what- if you believe the number was 6 million you&#39;re a holocaust denier. That&#39;s not my definition. That&#39;s not something I throwing out there because I&#39;m not the one who defined the term &quot;holocaust denier.&quot; That is literally enough to label you a holocaust denier and in many countries people have been imprisoned or worse for suggesting the number was lower.</p>

<p>When you say &quot;the holocaust happened without a doubt&quot; you are affirming specific details whether you mean to or not. As someone who <em>is</em> a holocaust denier, I&#39;m not the one who made that &quot;rule&quot; it&#39;s your own side of holocaust believers who made it so.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/02/adolf_who.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/02/adolf_who.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no single definition of Holocaust denial or &quot;revisionism,&quot; but scholars generally agree that it means claiming that the Nazis had no official policy to exterminate Jews, that the gas chambers are a myth, or that the figure of 6 million murdered Jews is a gross exaggeration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the Rothschild hate, thing is- if you go far enough down the Rothschild rabbit hole, you&#39;ll probably come to the conclusion that the Rothschild hatred is kind of inextricably tied with &quot;Jewish&quot; hatred. And it gets tricky to fully understand because &quot;Jewish&quot; can mean race; ethnicity; religion. </p>

<p>So, when they call Israel (created by the Rothschild&#39;s) the &quot;Jewish&quot; state, which are they referring to?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is sad you can&#39;t question the number, but if they have 6 million skeletons that&#39;s fairly solid evidence (idk if they do just a point). I think people can get carried away with protecting an idea, it is foolish to say it never happened, but healthy to question what we&#39;re told. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s reasonable to hate a Jew, just as you can hate a white or black or Mexican. Those are individuals. You can also hate an organization, the Clinton foundation for example, but a line has to be drawn where you make it clear that it is not an ethnicity or religion you hate, but people who have taken advantage of the greater whole.</p>

<p>Israel is a dangerous nation, it stirs a lot of hate in the region and has been in the US pocket book for some time now. A Jewish state is something I would question just as a white state or black state, what are they selling and why do they want what they want?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not fully educated on the entire history, but it seems the Khazarians (the &quot;k&quot; is silent) were holding a block of territory along the Silk Road. I think it was near (or within the borders?) of what we now call Turkey. </p>

<p>Okay, so because &quot;history is written by the victors&quot;, I won&#39;t know 100% which is true, but apparently for the Khazars to do business along the Silk Road the upper echelons of the Khazars had to convert to Judaism. (not 100% sure of this). </p>

<p>They somehow bullied their way into the Jewish people&#39;s lives, and what we have are two totally different people. The peace-loving Torah Jews, and the Khazarian-mafia Talmud (i.e. Kabbalah-Moloch-loving) Jews. </p>

<p>I go back to people like Albert Pike, and/or anyone who wishes for world domination through hegemony, to use other ethnic groups or cultures against each other, which creates strife among all people. </p>

<p>But I feel this evil that&#39;s gripped our world is starting to fade out. Good is winning. Slowly, but surely winning. I finally see a light at the end of this dark tunnel. </p>

<p>Your account is one month old, yet you know a lot about 9/11, secret military space program, and even the Rothschild (Bauer) family. So since you know that much, you should well realize the works of Albert Pike &amp; this three letters of war, right? </p>
