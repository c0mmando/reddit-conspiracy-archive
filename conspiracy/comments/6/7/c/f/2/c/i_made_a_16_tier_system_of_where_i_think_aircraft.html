        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think there&#39;s always 6 tiers: </p>

<p><strong>TIER 1</strong>
-Aircraft is declassified and still badass and fucks shit up on the reg</p>

<p>-but at one point fucked shit up from the shadows. That  is, it didn&#39;t just roll out with fanfare - operated unofficially for a while </p>

<p>-Ex: SR71, B117, B2</p>

<p><strong>TIER 2</strong>
-Aircraft/technology is classified and does black ops</p>

<p>-Or it&#39;s existence is known, but its purpose and/or capabilities are up to our imagination (x37b)</p>

<p>-It&#39;s 100% reliable and 100% finished product- just hasn&#39;t been declassified yet</p>

<p>-has been flying missions for a decade, will be declassified in another 15 years or so </p>

<p>-far more advanced than Tier 1</p>

<p>-In the future, it will descend to Tier 1 status</p>

<p>-Ex: Aurora, bin laden raid chopper, ~X-37B</p>

<p><strong>TIER 3</strong>
-Aircraft is not yet a functioning prototype. It&#39;s still in the cradle </p>

<p>-the individual components work well in test facilities: wind tunnels, engines, weaponry, radar material </p>

<p>-all components are final: &quot;we&#39;re using this engine, this laser, this stealth tech, this software, this fuel cell.&quot; That is, they have all the puzzle pieces </p>

<p>-but they have to successfully build the puzzle</p>

<p>-when they do build the first flying prototype, that will become the new Area 51 celebrity </p>

<p>-does zero missions. </p>

<p>-Won&#39;t fly its first black ops mission for another 15 years from now, bare minimum</p>

<p>-declassified another 20-25 years after that (35-40 years total from now)</p>

<p>-is perpetually being revamped</p>

<p>-However it is a go; this project isn&#39;t going to be scrapped, and the model is 90% definitive - wind tunnel analysis and/or stealth tests might change a curve here or there. </p>

<p>-Remains on US soil, heavy security/privacy. </p>

<p>-Far more advanced than Tier 2</p>

<p>-In the future, it will descend to Tier 2 status</p>

<p>-Technology is cutting edge.</p>

<p>Ex: it&#39;d a third gen X-37B, combined with aspects of all other aircraft. take off and land from runways, orbital capabilities of the X-37B, stealth = true camouflage, speed of DARPA&#39;s HTV-2 Falcon missile (Mach 20), unmanned, hover, particle beam weapons, orbital strike weapons. </p>

<p>-We do have most if not all of these technologies - the kicker here is putting them on one craft and have it work reliably </p>

<p>Note: Essentially, a fleet of these could replace the whole Air Force. Well call it the Air Force Replacer (AFR)</p>

<p><strong>TIER 4</strong>
-Technology is bleeding edge</p>

<p>-zero missions </p>

<p>-zero prototypes </p>

<p>-like, &quot;a-new-polymer-was-synthesized-in-the-in-house-lab-24-hrs-ago, -we-can-use-it&quot; bleeding edge </p>

<p>-Some thermal tiles here, avionics software there, new fuel compounds, all barely out of the lab</p>

<p>-its the apex of research from different alphabet agencies and departments.</p>

<p>-The puzzle pieces are all scattered </p>

<p>-a ton of the puzzle pieces don&#39;t even exist yet</p>

<p>-a good portion of the puzzle pieces don&#39;t exist and we don&#39;t even know that we need them. Unknown unknowns</p>

<p>-this isn&#39;t a distinct project. Hundreds or even thousands of radically different models and renderings created by supercomputers, all of which are honestly just shots in the dark. but the idea is there. There is a role to be filled: &quot;we need a craft with X speed, Y stealth, Z weapons.&quot;</p>

<p>-won&#39;t make first flight for another 50 years. Truly is bleeding edge moonshot ideas </p>

<p>-Far more advanced than Tier #3</p>

<p>-In the future, it will descend to Tier 3 status</p>

<p>-ex: too far down the line to conceive. Like WW2 engineers predicting the B2 spirit - they know aviation will continue to advance, but eventually it goes past the event horizon of their extrapolations and imaginations. They couldn&#39;t possibly foresee laser guided munitions and microprocessors. </p>

<p>-...But we can take a shot: interstellar craft, 10% light speed, perfectly safe for a human. AFR 2.0</p>

<p>-note: could be psychological warfare, intimidating Russia and China into thinking we have this. Entertain the idea of a fake moon landing in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union </p>

<p><strong>TIER 5</strong></p>

<p>-reverse engineering...</p>

<p>-Super sci-fi. That is, a craft with technology so god damn advanced that it be would viewed as sci-fi... by the people who work with what technology that  WE consider to be sci-fi. </p>

<p>-Is to Tier 4 what Tier 4 is to Tier 1</p>

<p>Ex: light speed, FTL speed, instantaneous speed (wormhole), time travel, could be parked over the Whitehouse right now and we couldn&#39;t detect any signature of any kind. We don&#39;t really know what we&#39;re doing - it might take another 50 years of our own progress before we even can tell what we&#39;re looking at </p>

<p><strong>TIER 6</strong></p>

<p>-interdimensional travel </p>

<p>-transcends physics and logic </p>

<p>-probably isn&#39;t even considered a craft so much as just a form of technology </p>

<p><strong>TIER 7</strong></p>

<p>-an ounce of cubensis mushrooms, 1,250mcg LSD, 3 hits DMT</p>
