       THINK ABOUT THIS. I mean everyone today sees god and the bible just as a fairy tale ,something fake to control us, but what if we were brainwashed into thinking that?  There are alot of proofs that people who are in power are satanists, and of course they control even  the church and make us hate it, And why we think god is not real? Well first because alot of theories came up, like big bang,theories  that we are god(alan watts), that everything is only in our mind,  aliens, and this kind of theories,  What bible says about this:
       <br/>
       -"But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed. And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep." 
   -"For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions," 
   -"For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward. Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God."
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok,now Just let me tell you this ,THE UNIVERSE IS NOT EVEN INFINITE,at least this is what I realized, who told you that?you really belive them? we were never into space in the first place, landing on the moon was a lie, how can we know the universe is infinite if we can't even go to the moon, all those pictures are fake and photoshopped, propagnda,  just go and do some investigation if you don't belive me, we don't actually know shit,  there are some who even proves that the earth is flat and that the sun ,the moon and the other plantes rotate around us and that we are the center of this "universe" and not that we are just a very very tiny part of it 
    Ok but now who promotes this kind of theories which take us away from God's teachings? For the start,  Movies, movies like inception, the matrix . And who controls movies? Exactly, the fuckin elite, the fuckin satanists which are in power,they use movies and music to brainwash us.  I don't know what to belive anymore, I just know they lie us about many things, I know that world is evil and that nowadays  everything is against God's will, like homesexuality , music which promotes sex,and other sins.  Don't be fooled into saying bible was created to manipulate us because all the teachings  in the bible are not promoted now . It's exactly the opposite of it, they push everything that is against The bible forward , music for example,look at the music that is popular nowdays
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZX4ooRsWs">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZX4ooRsWs
       </a>
       , I mean this music is definitetly not them trying to manipulate us into thinking God is real, it's exactly the oppoiste.
    I think that 98% of population  don't belive that god is real , none of my friends do, or any other person I meet daily, and for sure 99% don't do God's will that is written in the bible. Why is that? Did everyone figured it out that Bible is fake or they made us belive that , made us hate religion, which is created and controled by them btw.   ,I don't know what to belive, I think I am going crazyyy, I just feel that I was brainwashed all my life to not belive that  god is real . Who else agrees with this?

       How can you have respect for something you don't beleive in. What it sounds like is that it's not necessarily a lack of belief you have, but you just don't know which religion is the right one because of the "brain washing". You know there is a higher power, otherwise you wouldn't fear hell. Question is....who has it right? Since all religions are mutually exclusive and contradict eachother, only one can be right. But if they are all wrong, then why are you so worried about hell?

       John 3 “For this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.” all you have to say is that you believe jesus died for you and came back to life and that he is coming again. by saying that you will not go to hell

       Despite being THE most quoted verse in the entire Bible, for whatever reasons it is always cut short, and cuts off the end:
      </p>
      <p>
       "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
       <em>
        For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him
       </em>
       . Whoever believes in him is not condemned,
       <em>
        but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son
       </em>
       . This is the verdict: Light has come into the world,
       <em>
        but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed
       </em>
       . But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God."

       The thing is it's not about what you DO, you can't "earn" your way to heaven. It's about what (whom) you believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a legal system in place, there is law, order, a hierarchy and structure to everything. Sin (any sin) no matter what it is, has one and only one punishment: Death. Period. Something MUST die. There is NO way around this.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the old Hebrew days, before Jesus came as the final atoning sacrifice, pure, unblemished, clean animals were used as the sacrifice. This was temporary. Jesus came into the world at His appointed time (God in the Flesh), lived a 100% perfect life, with NO SIN whatsoever and gave HIS life for OURS. But it is a choice. We all have free will, it is a gift. With that gift comes the equal possibility that we can reject it. He will NOT force you to accept His sacrifice. He does NOT want puppets on a string. He wants those that willingly choose Him, it's the only way it is genuine. He greatly values individuality and uniqueness. He loves you and made you for a purpose! If you don't accept His sacrifice, then the sacrifice will be YOU. Eternally seperated from God, forever. This is true for everyone (with some exceptions, such as those whom are not held accountable for their sin, infants, children, mentally disabled, etc). Afterall He is a God of Love, Justice and Mercy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The choice is, and has always been, ours. If you don't make a choice, than the choice has already been made (eternal death) because we were born into a fallen sinful world, behind enemy lines, ruled by the devil (not for much longer though ...)
      </p>
      <p>
       "Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me."

       Now this comes across as bullshit unless you think about it a certain way. I don't think you need to believe in god to go to heaven. If you do, I think that god is using you.

       You can act like a saint, and you can go to church every sunday and follow all his commandments to the letter, but if you're doing it to get the reward(heaven) or to avoid the punishment(hell) then you're not going to heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's what is meant when people say you can't earn your way into heaven. Because a person who doesn't kill because of the punishment still has that urge there. That soul is corrupted. A person who "loves" not out of true love or kindness, but rather forced love/kindness is not an inherently kind person.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can apply this thought to the quote you gave Uncle_BenGhazzi.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll change it a bit so you get what I mean.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Whoever believes in
        <del>
         him
        </del>
        <em>
         true good
        </em>
        is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in
        <del>
         the name of God’s one and only Son.
        </del>
        absolute good and kindness(Jesus is the embodiment of Good and Kindness). This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by
        <del>
         the truth(aka Jesus, aka)
        </del>
        true good and kindess comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I've abandoned living by religious doctrine and I'm a more level headed and kind person for it. I will act the way I think I should act, and not because a book told me to. I'll help people to help them, rather than help them to follow a rule.

       Oh yes it is. Do you REALLY beleive that Jesus counts people who claim to follow him, but act like shit towards others as his flock? They're not following him if they're not honoring him in deeds, and if they truly believed in him, their deeds would reflect that. Yes, humans sin, none of us are perfect, and all of fall short. But that does not for a moment excuse those who don't attempt to be better than that in even the simplest areas.

       Of course our choices matter and how we treat others matter. I'm specifically talking about that you can't earn your way to heaven to be in the presence of the Almighty solely based off our 'good' works in this world, lest we should boast.

       The greatest threat to TPTB is Christianity. Everything they do undermines it. This of course always leads back to the question of who makes up the aristocracy and why they would want to suppress the Christ figure and the teachings attributed to him.

       They have also derailed the central teachings of Christianity with conservative "gay bashing" and fake "evangelical leaders" who don't teach the core of Christ's message which is love, and redemption of all sins through Jesus' sacrifice. God came to earth in the flesh to bridge us back to Him. This is the central foundation of Christianity, not judging or hating others for their lifestyle. That is in clear contravention of what Christ taught. But thanks to the manipulation of what Christianity's supposed to be, many have been led away in disgust at the church.

       True true. Todays 'church' is a far cry from what it should be. But even that was prophesied to the church in Laodicea at the end of Revelation 3. This represents the church of this time (in the last days) that is neither hot, nor cold (lukewarm) and that Jesus wants to vomit out.... doesn't paint a pretty picture, but is truth nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       " I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth. You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now add all the false prophets that have arisen (many false denominations and evangelical money-grubbing preachers) that deceive the whole world with their greed and lies.

       If people choose to live in sin and live a sinful lifestyle "Love"  not going to be your ticket in to Heaven . God detest the sin of Homosexuality and still chooses to love you but it breaks his Heart.   I don't hate the Gays and i don't bashor them I just stepped back and dont except there life style . Hating is not correct other than hate the Sins. People want to manipulate the Word of GOD and make it there own to fit there needs.  Christians are allowed to Judge one another ​accordingly this is in the Bible and it's constantly​ used against us and miss understood that we are Not to Judge one another. We are Christians are supposed to hold each other accountable for what we say and do and how we mean it . But I do agree the Churches have become a place of Harrasie and water down teachings . One day I said Let me see for my self and I have Dedicated to reading the Bible from start to Finish because God wants to know the truth not just by someone telling you ever weekend but for your self so there is no doubt on what Breaks his hearts and how we can achieve Salvation trough our Lord Jesus Christ .   "You Can't live your life like Hell and expect to get to heaven " .

       A good "study bible" edition with solid cross-references and footnotes will help a lot too. Understanding the context in which things were written is important. The Bible is encrypted, particularly the prophetic portions of it. However the decrption keys needed to unlock it are all provided within the text too. It's like a giant puzzle that you could spend an entire lifetime devoted to understanding and you still will only crack the surface to it. But it's worth it, because it is truth and provides you with an outlook of this world that (eventually) makes complete and total sense.

       I wouldn't use any modern bible  tbh there are so many errors. It's full of blasphemy, the word Jew should be Judah, and thou shall not kill should be 'thou shall not murder'. The word Rabbi should be teacher, and so on and so forth.

       2 Timothy 3:1-7:
But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having an appearance of godliness but proving false to its power; and from these turn away. From among these arise men who slyly work their way into households and captivate weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires, always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

       Sometimes the correct answer is the simplest one. It seems like TPTB are all luciferians/satanists that hate christianity, hate God, and hate people b/c that is the truth. Everything they do is to turn you away from the truth and reality of this world:

      <p>
       There is no god
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no devil

      <p>
       There are no demons
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no angels
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no spirit realm unseen that exists behind the veil (for our own protection)
      </p>
      <p>
       Your choices in this life don't matter
      </p>
      <p>
       How you treat others doesn't matter
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell is not a real place
      </p>
      <p>
       ALL LIES.

       “Sons of God”
As in Job 38:7, other scriptures refer to angels as “sons of God,” who appear before God’s heavenly throne (Job 1:6; 2:1). These verses cannot be talking about mere physical human beings. Notice John 3:13: “And no man has ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.” Angels are called God’s sons because He created them, not because they were begotten of God, as was Christ, “the firstborn among many brethren” (Rom. 8:29).
Many read Genesis 6:1-2 and conclude that this scripture is also talking about angels: “And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.”
According to pagan mythology, men of normal human physical form, but “god-like” in strength and ability (Hercules, Achilles, etc.), were born as a result of angels (“sons of God”) marrying human women. Of course, this is false—these could not have been angels, because Mark 12:25 plainly says angels do not marry!
In verse two, “God” should be god (small “g”). These were not angels, nor even God’s people (who, as Christians, are begotten sons of God). Rather, these were sons of
       <em>
        this world’s god
       </em>
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+4%3A4&amp;amp;version=NKJV">
        2 Corinthians 4:4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ). It is important to note that they were not his sons through any kind of physical lineage, but by virtue of their obedience to him (see John 8:44). History shows that an apostasy occurred at this time, led by Methuselah and Lamech, Noah’s grandfather and father. Only Noah held fast to God’s Way.

       Complicated and i don't claim to understand it all. I can tell you the story of the jews (israelites/hebrews) from the bible is not a flattering one. Despite being the chosen people of God (YHVH/Yahweh) and being privy to countless miracles and prophets sent to them, they would constantly worship false gods, (sacrificing children to Moloch comes to mind ... Remind you of anyone recently?) They would reject God, cruelly kill His prophets and distorted the law given to them that set them apart from other nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically they have a history of doing everything God told them not to do, to this day. So they would be exiled from jerusalem until they eventually repented. They refused to see the signs at Jesus coming as The Messiah, because they were expecting a King with power and prolly gold to come in glory. They couldn't accept a humble servant, born in an animal stable as Yeshua(Jesus) was. During His earthly ministry Jesus even referred to a sect of them as the "synagogue of satan."
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite all this, they are the chosen people due to the covenant with Abraham that will not be broken. The events during the coming 7 year tribulation center around them and their geographic land specifically, particularly after the israel/palestine false peace treaty is successful at the appointed time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure others can add more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like it or not, this worlds messianic salvation (Jesus) came through the bloodlines of Jews and is now available to ALL.

       Hmmm, chosen people according to them. Well actually the Jehovah was war god cult that took.over the tribe. Now you obviously believe that the Bible is the inerrant word of god. But let me ask you something. Why would an all loving creator of the universe come from "heaven" and ask some desert dwelling dimwit to sacrifice his son? That's how he chose his people? Child sacrificing stone age dick head? Save the "but he saved Isaac and it was a metaphor for what God did to Jesus", I heard it all. I grew up in church. Jehovah was all about occultic blood rituals. It's fucking creepy when you really start to examine these stories from an outside perspective. Take the Egyptian thing. I personally think it's made up folklore, but just think about the god of the universe coming down personally and killing first born children of the Egyptians. Think about that for a minute....

       Errrh, no Jesus wasn't a Jew..He was a Judean from the tribe of Judah. The Jews of today are descended from the Pharisees, and are edomites (They admit as such in their own Talmud and Encyclopedia). By saying Jesus was a Jew you are saying he was a edmote/Pharisee, lol. The white disporia are Isralities, and the jews are edomites. It's why they hate christians so much, and all of their organisations are promoting multiculturalism abortion,diversity, homosexuality,ect and miscegenation in white countries.

       Will be buried but wanted to add something regarding the Apollo missions. We definitely landed on the moon. The simple question is why would they fake it 9 times?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's something for you related to Christianity and space flight. The only world religion represented on the moon when we landed was Christianity. Between the time that the lander first touched down and the first walk, Buzz Aldrin performed communion on the moon. You can actually hear him alluding to it in the radio broadcasts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just something interesting to think about that when mankind finally made it to another heavenly body, we gave thanks and praised Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a feeling that we won't get to another one unless God is involved in some way again.

       Just an excerpt from the urantia papers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feast upon this knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, after their formal installation, Adam and Eve became painfully aware of their planetary isolation. Silent were the familiar broadcasts, and absent were all the circuits of extraplanetary communication. Their Jerusem fellows had gone to worlds running along smoothly with a well-established Planetary Prince and an experienced staff ready to receive them and competent to co-operate with them during their early experience on such worlds. But on Urantia rebellion had changed everything. Here the Planetary Prince was very much present, and though shorn of most of his power to work evil, he was still able to make the task of Adam and Eve difficult and to some extent hazardous. It was a serious and disillusioned Son and Daughter of Jerusem who walked that night through the Garden under the shining of the full moon, discussing plans for the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
       74:3.2 (830.5) Thus ended the first day of Adam and Eve on isolated Urantia, the confused planet of the Caligastia betrayal; and they walked and talked far into the night, their first night on earth — and it was so lonely.
      </p>
      <p>
       74:3.3 (830.6) Adam’s second day on earth was spent in session with the planetary receivers and the advisory council. From the Melchizedeks, and their associates, Adam and Eve learned more about the details of the Caligastia rebellion and the result of that upheaval upon the world’s progress. And it was, on the whole, a disheartening story, this long recital of the mismanagement of world affairs. They learned all the facts regarding the utter collapse of the Caligastia scheme for accelerating the process of social evolution. They also arrived at a full realization of the folly of attempting to achieve planetary advancement independently of the divine plan of progression. And thus ended a sad but enlightening day — their second on Urantia.
      </p>
      <p>
       74:3.4 (831.1) The third day was devoted to an inspection of the Garden. From the large passenger birds — the fandors — Adam and Eve looked down upon the vast stretches of the Garden while being carried through the air over this, the most beautiful spot on earth. This day of inspection ended with an enormous banquet in honor of all who had labored to create this garden of Edenic beauty and grandeur. And again, late into the night of their third day, the Son and his mate walked in the Garden and talked about the immensity of their problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       74:3.5 (831.2) On the fourth day Adam and Eve addressed the Garden assembly. From the inaugural mount they spoke to the people concerning their plans for the rehabilitation of the world and outlined the methods whereby they would seek to redeem the social culture of Urantia from the low levels to which it had fallen as a result of sin and rebellion. This was a great day, and it closed with a feast for the council of men and women who had been selected to assume responsibilities in the new administration of world affairs. Take note! women as well as men were in this group, and that was the first time such a thing had occurred on earth since the days of Dalamatia. It was an astounding innovation to behold Eve, a woman, sharing the honors and responsibilities of world affairs with a man. And thus ended the fourth day on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       74:3.6 (831.3) The fifth day was occupied with the organization of the temporary government, the administration which was to function until the Melchizedek receivers should leave Urantia.
      </p>
      <p>
       74:3.7 (831.4) The sixth day was devoted to an inspection of the numerous types of men and animals. Along the walls eastward in Eden, Adam and Eve were escorted all day, viewing the animal life of the planet and arriving at a better understanding as to what must be done to bring order out of the confusion of a world inhabited by such a variety of living creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       74:3.8 (831.5) It greatly surprised those who accompanied Adam on this trip to observe how fully he understood the nature and function of the thousands upon thousands of animals shown him. The instant he glanced at an animal, he would indicate its nature and behavior. Adam could give names descriptive of the origin, nature, and function of all material creatures on sight. Those who conducted him on this tour of inspection did not know that the world’s new ruler was one of the most expert anatomists of all Satania; and Eve was equally proficient. Adam amazed his associates by describing hosts of living things too small to be seen by human eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       74:3.9 (831.6) When the sixth day of their sojourn on earth was over, Adam and Eve rested for the first time in their new home in “the east of Eden.” The first six days of the Urantia adventure had been very busy, and they looked forward with great pleasure to an entire day of freedom from all activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       74:3.10 (831.7) But circumstances dictated otherwise. The experience of the day just past in which Adam had so intelligently and so exhaustively discussed the animal life of Urantia, together with his masterly inaugural address and his charming manner, had so won the hearts and overcome the intellects of the Garden dwellers that they were not only wholeheartedly disposed to accept the newly arrived Son and Daughter of Jerusem as rulers, but the majority were about ready to fall down and worship them as gods.

       I'm gonna upvote this to let my fellows have their little party, but I personally think the binary idea of god and the devil leaves out a lot of details, possibilities, and complexities. Maybe it makes the unknowable easier to understand, but I don't think anything good ever came out of Israel that was borne of it.

       It makes more sense to see Jesus as the Devil, he is the "son" of God cast out of heaven to walk among us, we bare worship to false idols of the Cross and he committed unholy "miracles" like rising from the dead. The Jews knew the truth and killed him.

       Don't think Alan Watts ever proferred any sort of 'theories' beyond simple philosophizing, or the most purest form of thought. And if we're God, then of course God exists. What easier way to prove the existence of God than to define it as that which does exist? Does this necessarily diminish the import of said concept, to your mind? I don't think it any less remarkable. And just because we might be God doesn't mean there isn't some other form of God which has the sorts of qualities as depicted in major religions, and that there isn't some overarching plan behind it all.

       How do you propose to stop these "heathens" from utilizing their (extremely) recently found ability to spread these ideas and theories fearless of blunt force reprisal from the flock? How does one both turn away from violence and shield ones senses against the cacophony of reason and philosophy? How will you shield your friends and family?
