       I'm not saying the Earth is flat. I'm just asking a question. Why is there a coordinated effort to cover up Antarctica? Technically, Antarctica should look more like Greenland and not a vast barren frozen waste land, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       So going by that, all the skeptics (and others), do explain. Because this shit aint making sense (if you look on a map). Thanks, and let's have a civil discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also, another one would be: Svalbard and Jan Mayen

       In my mind Antartica should be almost exactly like the north pole. Obviously its not. 
Up until around a hundred years ago (before anyone actually stepped foot on Antarctica) "they" only assumed Antarctica was there because if the North Pole was there and the earth is a sphere Antarctica SHOULD be there. 
The North and South poles should have close to the same average temperature, but its not like that.

       Precisely. Logically it doesn't make sense what they are saying. There are also other islands near Antarctica which are not frozen wastelands, either. For example:

        French Southern and Antarctic Lands

       Antarctica has thousands of square miles, most of it far from the moderating influence of the ocean. Comparing a continent with an island is like comparing central Australia with New Zealand.

       Well, one could ask why Australia is a continent and Greenland is no longer considered one, no? Also, I get that and that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying there should be lower lands and more fertile lands, along with lakes, rivers, etc etc based on where you are on the continent. It doesn't make sense that it's so much colder than the north.

       As has already been explained to you, much of Antarctica is land, rather than ice-covered ocean. This means it is less sensitive to temperature changes, meaning it will generally be colder. Haven't you ever noticed that as you go further inland, even at the same latitude, the weather can get colder in the winter? The same is true  here.

       And do each of these locations have the same humidity, temperature, and land conditions as Antarctica? It's rather hard for anything to grow when the dirt is covered by tens or hundreds of feet of snow and ice.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep providing examples of conditions that, while they are similar, as missing several key conditions that you seem to refuse to acknowledge.

       Also, I notice you seem to have dropped the claim of waterfalls, lakes, etc that you were spouting with much energy earlier.

       True, but such a big continent, must have some places. There are oasis in the desert. And, no. I'm not dropping lakes, rivers, etc etc. Those should still exist as well, because they exist in all the other places I've mentioned will cold as shit weather, so... Not sure what your point of saying that is. Sure as hell wasn't a "gotcha".

       You claim they exist in other places with "cold as shit" weather, but do they exist where the average temperature is not just below freezing, but -49F below freezing? You seem to fail to understand the magnitude of just how cold it gets down there...

       True, technically, but... My point being is that there are lakes, waterfalls, mountains, greenery in the summer, etc etc. These things should be found on Antarctica as well, but we are told they are not. It's fuckery, and it doesn't make sense.

       I have a feeling there's a LOT about Antarctica we're not being told. That being said, I have no concrete reason to explain what you're noticing. Greenland seems to cover a similar portion of the northern polar region.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember noticing this article last year. Not much of a source, but it's interesting to consider the effect of an "anomaly" under the surface. Be it a gigantic asteroid or an underground UFO base. :)

       I was looking at your post about this on C_S_T and I agree it does seem shady. But are you suggesting that Antarctica isn't at the South Pole? Just trying to understand your thoughts cause this is very interesting.

       Yeah, I went about it the wrong way over there, lol. Anyways, I don't know what this implies, tbh. I'm just curious what people think, because it's not adding up to me. Not saying this or that, just how does this even make sense? My theory, I suppose, would be whatever they are claiming is Antarctica clearly cannot be, based on the heliocentric model and the maps they "provide" for us.

       I completely agree with you something doesn't add up. Like why is the South Pole colder? Why is there land at the South Pole but water at the North Pole? Why does vegetation grow like you said near the north but apparently nothing can grow in the South? Why are they guarding Antarctica? I'm no flat earther either but you can't not ask these questions and be skeptical of what's really down there or going on ya know

       Exactly, and I don't believe in FE either. I merely say the model here because that's what I'm looking at via google earth and the fuckery is within that model. It also does not make sense that their are natives in the north, but none in the South? I'm not buying that one bit.

       Just looked up why the South Pole is colder and apparently the reasoning is because it sits on an ice sheet. That doesn't really make sense  to me why it would be colder. Maybe I'm being dumb. If the North Pole is the same distance from the equator as the South why isn't the North Pole sitting on a giant ice sheet like the South? Am I making sense lol?

       Because the North Pole is actually a sheet of ice over mostly ocean, warmer water from the low latitudes can bring heat from the equator up to the pole, increasing the overall temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the South Pole a massive landmass prevents the warmer water from the higher latitudes from reaching the ice sheet. This means it never warms up and is now miles thick.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're essentially doing is wondering why ice doesn't melt in your freezer even though it melts in your fridge.

       and go into satellite mode, go all the way to the north, and look at the coastline. It's pixelated as shit, now.. Do the same for Antarctica. Fuckery, fuckery I says!

       Antarctica is land covered by a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       thick permanent ice sheet so the surface is at a high altitude. There's also the current which surrounds and insulates it from warmer waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The arctic has a permanent ice sheet in places, but it's much thinner. It's mostly sea ice over water which has a higher capacity for heat than land.

       Because it's colder in the first place since it's a massive continent (land) and the currents. So the ice formed and got really thick.

       The Arctic and Antarctica aren't two opposites, they're really different. For an analogy look at how climates differ at the same latitude.

       This is continental scale geography. You can't compare Antarctica to anywhere else. Nepal and Texas are on the same latitude (I think) so why are they so different?

       I get it that it's cold in the mountains, but there should be lower lands based on images provided. It's almost like they are only up in the mountains for a reason (hiding something) and telling people this is how the whole of the continent is. Get what I'm saying?

       Antarctica reaches a height of about 9,000 ft, and this significantly drops the temperature if you were to compare it to the North Pole.  Greenland also has a high elevation inland, but those areas like Antarctica are very cold.  The warmer areas are at sea level.

       Why wouldn't it look similar? look on google earth of the northern parts of Greenland. Still lakes, streams, rivers, etc etc. There is no reason for parts of Antarctica to not look like that, and here is an example:

       Once again, you use a picture of an island as far

       of Antarctica as you can get and still be part of it to represent the entire continent. As long as you continue to use that picture, I'm going to call you on the bullshit of it.

       Do you even read the links that you post? Again, you are posting links that discuss islands and the coast, and expecting that to represent the interior of a continent that is 5.4
       <strong>
        million

       square miles. Does your cognitive dissonance really extend that far?

       Care to provide the context behind this picture? Ten to one, it's close to the coast, and the conditions vary too much for typical trees to get a toehold. Just because this one picture at this moment in time shows exposed dirt doesn't mean it's like this for most of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep expecting out-of-context pictures to be your "proof", but they aren't. Nine times out of ten, they just expose your complete misunderstanding of the geography of the area.
