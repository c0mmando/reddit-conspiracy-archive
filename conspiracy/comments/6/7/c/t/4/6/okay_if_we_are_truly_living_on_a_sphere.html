<p>So going by that, all the skeptics (and others), do explain. Because this shit aint making sense (if you look on a map). Thanks, and let&#39;s have a civil discussion.</p>

Up until around a hundred years ago (before anyone actually stepped foot on Antarctica) &quot;they&quot; only assumed Antarctica was there because if the North Pole was there and the earth is a sphere Antarctica SHOULD be there. 
The North and South poles should have close to the same average temperature, but its not like that. </p>

<p>Precisely. Logically it doesn&#39;t make sense what they are saying. There are also other islands near Antarctica which are not frozen wastelands, either. For example:</p>

<p>As has already been explained to you, much of Antarctica is land, rather than ice-covered ocean. This means it is less sensitive to temperature changes, meaning it will generally be colder. Haven&#39;t you ever noticed that as you go further inland, even at the same latitude, the weather can get colder in the winter? The same is true  here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the North Pole is actually a sheet of ice over mostly ocean, warmer water from the low latitudes can bring heat from the equator up to the pole, increasing the overall temperature.</p>

<p>At the South Pole a massive landmass prevents the warmer water from the higher latitudes from reaching the ice sheet. This means it never warms up and is now miles thick.</p>

Still lakes, streams, rivers, etc etc. There is no reason for parts of Antarctica to not look like that, and here is an example: <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/photo/109185663410371186785/6379152290967945570">https://plus.google.com/photos/photo/109185663410371186785/6379152290967945570</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Care to provide the context behind this picture? Ten to one, it&#39;s close to the coast, and the conditions vary too much for typical trees to get a toehold. Just because this one picture at this moment in time shows exposed dirt doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s like this for most of the year. </p>

<p>You keep expecting out-of-context pictures to be your &quot;proof&quot;, but they aren&#39;t. Nine times out of ten, they just expose your complete misunderstanding of the geography of the area. </p>
