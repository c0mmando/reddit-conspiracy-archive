<p>After retiring from the FBI, Gunderson set up a private investigation firm, Ted L. Gunderson and Associates, in Santa Monica. In 1980, he became a defense investigator for Green Beret doctor Jeffrey R. MacDonald, who had been convicted of the 1970 murders of his pregnant wife and two daughters. Gunderson obtained affidavits from Helena Stoeckley confessing to her involvement in the murders.[8]</p>

<p>He also investigated a child molestation trial in Manhattan Beach, California. In a 1995 conference in Dallas, Gunderson warned about the supposed proliferation of secret Satanic groups, and the danger posed by the New World Order, an alleged shadow government that would be controlling the United States government.[9] He also claimed that a &quot;slave auction&quot; in which children were sold to men in turbans had been held in Las Vegas, that four thousand ritual human sacrifices are performed in New York City every year, and that the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was carried out by the US government.[9] Gunderson believed that in the United States there is a secret widespread network of groups who kidnap children and infants, and subject them to Satanic ritual abuse and subsequent human sacrifice.[10][11]</p>

<p>Gunderson had an association with music producer and conspiracy theorist Anthony J. Hilder and was interviewed by him on various occasions. The two men appeared at numerous conferences together.[12] They both said that the 1993 World Trade Center bombing was a result of FBI agent provocateurs.[13]</p>

<p>Gunderson was a member of the Constitution Party.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Know this first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires. They will say, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.” For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God, and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. But by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.</p>

<p>But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed.</p>

<p>Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn! But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How come nobody here quotes any other passages then from the bible? I mean there&#39;s other religions and spiritual systems older than the bible but there&#39;s only a focus on just that book. Its also constantly interpreted to apply to the present. How many times have we gone through &quot;the last days?&quot;.... Also don&#39;t get upset by what I say, Jesus is a personal friend of mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t mind me asking, and you don&#39;t mind sharing, what changed your beliefs and perspective on God/religion? (I even noticed in a previous comment you agree that the Bible is most likely not the word of god but rather man&#39;s due to its existence/editing throughout thousands of years, which threw me off a bit)</p>

<p>I ask because I was once a devout Catholic, but then couldn&#39;t get behind it as much anymore and am now more of an Agnostic (almost atheist for awhile, but I&#39;m much more indecisive now)</p>

<p>Every now and again I&#39;ll pick up my old Bible and read various parts of it, and I always enjoy it because it really is a timeless piece of literature, if you will, and certain stories/books are relatable to various aspects of our recorded history and the present, along with personal struggles. </p>

<p>I digress. So, what exactly changed your perspective on religion/God? I only know people/friends who went religious/Christian -&gt; atheism, not the other way. </p>

<p>Thanks ahead of time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my interpretation I see it as explaining the difference of perspective between God and man.  Time is a consequence of mortality and the reason we have to endure sufferings and hardships that we call evil.  From the perspective of God these things all happen instantly and define us over time much like water and winds define the landscapes through erosion.  These trials and tribulations man faces aren&#39;t evil they are just like the wind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It means there will always be people who question the existence of God.  God doesn&#39;t step in because he is in everything, he&#39;s omnipotent so there is nothing to reveal himself into.  Death and judgement comes like a thief in the night, so we are all challenged to live dutiful and good lives.  God can take any of us when he so chooses, but through his grace period he allows mostly everyone to find their purpose in life before summoning us to our inevitable death. It&#39;s just a reminder for us to be on our best behavior because death comes like a thief in the night.</p>

<p>There are so many trying to convey the story. Heck, even Stargate SG 1 did. They gave a wink, not explicitly recounting it. They have been cited as a source of soft disclosure.</p>

<p>In Stargate, there was a group called the Ori that had a holy book and demanded worship from many worlds. They used the energy of their worshipers to feed a group of entities. A reptilian appeared in the series and was not explained or even elaborated. It was a wink.</p>

<p>Orion is very much associated with the Draco and Stargate called this group the Ori. These beings are essentially slave seeking spiritual parasites. Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. These being specialize in hacking others minds and making them into personal utility. </p>

<p>They are space trash that should be killed like flesh eating bacteria at a hospital. Yet, you&#39;ll hear the supposed Light praise them for being a catalyst for evolution or partners in contrast for consciousness. The light is also corrupt and serves the parasitism. That&#39;s why we are on our own. The light is complicit in our abuse and slavery. The light/dark paradigm is a mind control system. It&#39;s to preserve the farming of spiritual energy rather than stopping it. </p>

<p>To be light, you have to forgive and allow the dark to molest child races. Otherwise they consider you dark and allow the dark to harm you even more, causing you to act like an abused animal, lashing out in anger and feeling like crap. The light is instructed to ignore you then, because you&#39;re dark. The light is actually dark. It claims a monopoly on benevolence and selectively protects those that support spiritual energy farming. It would have us think that our protection mode, our fear, is entirely useless, because disabling fear makes us easy prey. The dysfunction of fear is the key feature of this corrupt system. It is hacked extensively. </p>

<p>An independent being requires a love/growth mode and a fear/protection mode to exist. Otherwise it can&#39;t support itself. This control system forces us to choose love or fear. If we do not, we&#39;ll see the control system and fight it out of fear of it harming what we love. I consider that behavior greater than the Light. That behavior has more value and honor than preserving parasites and corrupting consciousness to support them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think anyone can prove the existence of ET, let alone the insidious, deceptive Draco?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have sufficient evidence, understanding or experience to believe, don&#39;t believe. I was there once. Do what you think is right.</p>

<p>I am a seeker. I think about such concepts frequently, even if they make me feel awful. Why? I want the truth.</p>

<p>They DO sound crazy. I know. I say them anyway. Why? I have a model of understanding of what is going on that includes them. They are helpful, if not required, for understanding.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, I have noticed that several pieces of the narrative, a narrative I don&#39;t exclusively propose, automatically elicit ridicule and dismissal of consideration. This is how truth is hidden in plain sight. When we hear it, like Pavlov&#39;s dogs who were conditioned with food to drool at the ring of a bell, we laugh and dismiss the person who speaks about them. That keeps us from seriously considering them, quite effectively, using social fear. The experience of this reaction reinforces this reaction, conditioning us further. Enough of us in a given space have to realize this behavior pattern and not react to it, in order to overcome it and actually discuss the possibilities we are conditioned to dismiss. It&#39;s amazing to me how reptilians are a joke, but yet no other basic type of ET is heavily used in such jokes, not octopoids, felines, birds, dogs, or some other exotic things. Nope, reptilians get the laughter going. Why them? What&#39;s so special about reptilians? Why do they even look like what we consider demons? There is something more to this than what appears on the surface, I have come to believe.</p>

<p>So, no, these are not unimpeachable facts. They are ideas, some of which have some evidence, others are informed speculations. Unless you can place them in your model of how reality works in this place and time, I suggest you just put them on the infinite shelf of un/in-credible ideas. Maybe they will be useful as flimsy filler pieces in the puzzle of your model of the world one day. You may even have forgotten where they came from. This is how I consider information that has no proof (definition: sufficient evidence to believe). </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want people to take what I say as fact, I wouldn&#39;t and it&#39;s not healthy. Some already have these ideas floating around in their minds and putting out my ever evolving model of what is going on may help them find the pieces they need for theirs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so since we&#39;re speaking hypothetically, what if the Satan of the Bible I believe in is the one creating the false religions to skew the people from the truth, and also giving these false religions knowledge that only ET&#39;s would have?</p>

<p>It doesnt have to be annoying or offensive to you, but something in you is REALLY against this specific belief for no apparent reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t find it offensive, just annoyed. It&#39;s bothersome. There is so much information at our fingertips where you can disprove passages from the Bible in seconds. You can cross reference and look at the perspectives from many different angles. What got me going down this path was the original zeitgeist movie. It explains how Bible passages, Jesus, the 12 apostles, etc... are all astronomical &quot;stories.&quot; If we keep believing the Bible is true then we miss out on it&#39;s real significance. &quot;They&quot; have an incredible head start on us. I do believe these people are Satan worshippers who practice sacrifice and blood rituals. They are alchemists, astronomers. Their knowledge goes far back in history and they keep this true knowledge of our Earth and universe from us. All the false flags, the great trauma, it is all just that. Forced trauma to keep humanity fearful, separate, fighting and angry. All negative emotions. This is going to sound corny, but I think humanity at our core want to love. To be loved. Our &quot;warring nature&quot; is a product of environment. It is nurture, not nature. Our nature is to help one another, love our neighbors. Think of all the tragedies that have happened in the last 20 years and look at how humans flock to help other humans in need. This is our nature. We were taught to believe that the native America were warring, primitive tribes. In reality they were mostly peaceful with huge cities of over 100k people or more. Idk.... just off on a rant.... Humans are more powerful than we could ever have imagined. Our brain doesn&#39;t even work at full capacity. The darkness is being kept around us. We need to lift that darkness to unlock our true potential. Consciousness is no accident. We are living in strange times. A lot of weird shit is going on. From the strange microwaves that are blanketing earth, to the Schumann resonance, to pedogate, ufos and lights being seen in the sky all across earth, Antarctica, assange, fucking trump! Chaos is in control and we need to take back our earth, our consciousness, our lives, our love and our humanity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God is a local space parasite entity that plays the role of God and the devil. It has light and dark at its command. The dark lives in fear exclusively. The light rejects fear and tries to live in love exclusively. </p>

<p>As love is what generates existential value for consciousness, dark beings are parasites of it to feel joy in life. Without satisfaction, consciousness doesn&#39;t want to animate bodies. The dark loves cruelty, because it causes life to radiate the energy of joy. This is why there are sacrifice rituals, ritual abuses and a desire to cause fear and suffering generally. </p>

<p>The light refuses to do what is necessary to end the suffering, because they do not accept fear. They keep rhetorically defending the dark. They answer to the One, the Source, which is just this very same being that commands the dark as Satan/Lucifer. The dark laughs at the light. It knows they follow the same demon. The light cannot face fear. They think feeling fear is what makes you dark. They put it out of their minds rather than fully dealing with it. </p>

<p>Independent beings need fear and love to be balanced and independent. That&#39;s why this demon has us choose fear or love by covertly abusing us with the dark and healing us with the light. If we choose to embrace both fear and love, we can avoid falling into its mind control systems. This is why we will continue to be molested on other worlds after this race chooses on or the other if we refuse to choose one.</p>

<p>This is a deep distilled perspective of the propaganda from the light about what we are going through, from a person who chooses to love and fear. We are in deep trouble. The light will fool so many into being docile slaves, permitting the abuse of the dark to continue. The dark recedes it&#39;s abuse after one chooses to be light, because it serves master, Satan/God. </p>

<p>Both generating (light) and extracting (dark) this energy is required for efficient long term farming operations. That is why the system is this way, in a constant flux, a flash, artificial conflict between perceived polarities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out Bruce Lipton. He explains that even cells have modes of operation that equate to fear and love. Love is a growth mode. It is where the cell works to make itself healthy and reproduce. Fear is a protection mode. It shuts down the growth mode and reallocates resources for protection from threats. This allows it to more efficiently survive threats. This is why fear blocks love.</p>

<p>Heck, look at RTS (real time strategy games [base &amp; forces]) games, same thing. There is a an economy boom focus that makes your economy more healthy and your base more formidable over time, a growth mode. Yet, it makes you more open to attack. If you focus on defenses, you neglect growth opportunities. There are always trade offs, sacrificing resource production and construction for defenses and offensive forces. The same holds true of nations in real life. Too much military focus leads to economic problems, too little leads to invasion and exploitation by others.</p>

<p>This is a basic part of existence when we will have threats. To ignore the protection mode would please those would would attack. You&#39;ll make a juicy base for them to raid and pillage. If they could cast a mind spell on you to not enter protection mode, it would be one of the most effective moves they could make in the game. Think about it.</p>

<p>As long as there are threats, fear has its place. Yet, it is important to acknowledge that we are facing an ancient enemy that knows this dynamic and hacks fear itself. They use fear against their enemies and even feed on energy released by those in fear. They are masters of fear. To fight them best, listen to the fear, consider the evidence for it, then, if it is apparently real, think calmly and rationally about your options to deal with the real threat. Ignoring fear is not the ideal, because then you just form a block to considering their insidious tactics and strategies to subvert and control you.</p>

<p>I am saying fear/love is an inescapable dynamic mechanic of life with predators/parasites, not that wallowing in fear is beneficial at all. </p>

<p>Another thing to think about is parents. How good would a parent be if it didn&#39;t love? The children would be neglected and not well nourished (growth). What if the parent didn&#39;t fear? The children would get harmed and maybe even killed. What if the parent loves and fears? They have what they need to be a good parent. Both are required for independent being. </p>

<p>We are under attack, being tricked into lobotomizing our minds right now.</p>

<p>It&#39;s beyond ridiculous that you pump this malarkey out to whole forum with a flimsy &#39;hey this might be CGI but you should really really be aware of it&#39; disclaimer, and beyond reproach that you then ask me to hold your hand through the most rudimentary critical analysis.    </p>

<p>Only real way would be to hunt down the original sources for those clips and compare. The person who produced the clip deliberately made this difficult, but it&#39;d be possible with a little crowd sourcing. Disproving through more technical means is useless, as it will only convince people with technical understanding who wouldn&#39;t have bought the clip in the first place. </p>

<p>I may watch your link and get back to you later, JRE can be a quality source. </p>

He got paid to scare little old ladies about satanic conspiracy that only people in a place like this subreddit believe is real. He said 50 thousand human sacrifices and 4 million members. He made outrageous claims.</p>

<p>You can look at his early career and see a respected lawman, but his later life he was crook and likely batshit crazy. Do your own research on this guy, go back about three pages on Google, the conspiracy people always get their stuff on the front age somehow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;ve read all this before -- in re-investigating your link, I&#39;ve come across even more potentially damning articles.  There&#39;s simply too much mud in the water to thoroughly bring every anti-Gunderson allegation to full investigative completion; however, one thing I note are the common elements to the stories of everyone speaking against him:</p>

<p>That he invited himself into the investigations, that he himself worked to discredit the very things he claimed to investigate, that he is a belligerent and angry person, that he&#39;s unstable, that all the claims he makes regarding the child-trafficking circles are ridiculous and too outrageous to entertain, and that he&#39;s a con artist.</p>

<p>Those are all direct attacks on personal character, which is exactly how you try to take someone out at the knees if you don&#39;t want them to be taken seriously.  These are well-established and time-tested tactics used against truth for as long as truth itself has been around.  I cannot conclude with complete rational certainty whether or not Ted Gunderson is genuine (such is the quality of the smear campaign), but my gut instinct informs me that he is.</p>

<p>For the record, here&#39;s much more Gunderson-related information:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately, humanity will come to realize, collectively, the absolute truth that <em>we know absolutely nothing</em>. Only then can &#39;the self&#39; be seen as the illusion it really is, because the self is just an illusory belief, which manifests through the mind believing in its own thoughts. Because we believe in this illusion, we live in separation. But that is an outrageous illusion because, in truth, everything is <em>one</em> thing. That one thing is, indeed, no thing. But it is, in this 3d realm, what we are. </p>

<p>The disinfo will continue until we start letting go of knowing anything at all. In that moment, humanity will become who it really is. Then, love and compassion will cure all our metaphorical wounds and illnesses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ted Gunderson was one of the <a href="https://glomardisclosure.com/2016/07/06/ted-gunderson-from-cointelpro-planner-to-criminal-and-conspiracy-theorist/"><strong>architects of COINTELPRO</strong></a>, and was the Los Angeles FBI Bureau Chief.  </p>

<p><em>Ted Gunderson single-handedly destroyed the investigation into the 1984 McMartin preschool pedophile case</em>, which was prosecuted by Gunderson&#39;s pal, Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner.</p>

<p><a href="http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2005/07/interview-with-jackie-mcgauley-part_19.html"><em>Here is an interview with one of the mothers</em></a> <em>who credits Gunderson with being COINTELPRO.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did Ted Gunderson enter both the investigation and your personal life? How long did you live together?</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to clear up the misconception that gunderson (I never capitalize his name) was involved in the investigation. He was never formally hired or paid in any way. He simply stuck himself in by offering to do things. Who wouldn&#39;t trust the retired chief of the Los Angeles division of the FBI who introduced you to senators and former State Attorney Generals? Some things we allowed him to do but many of his ideas and attempts to take over were rejected.</p>

<p>He was a persistent presence. He became so annoying that <em>eventually the parents would not talk to him</em>. I always thought in some way that he would help our cause. He was present at the Archaeological dig as often as he could and he talked to the ever present media as the rest of us were exhausted or did errands for the crew. At the time we did not know what he was up to and did not think it would be harmful to let him talk, as we thought he said positive things.</p>

<p>I want you to know that allowing him to be involved was the demise of any credibility we had.</p>

<p><em>His reputation was well known by law enforcement, but he is such a slick con man that we had no clue what we were getting ourselves into.</em> I have to say that it was mostly my fault for letting him be involved. <em>Later I found out he was COINTELPRO.</em> Years later when I read the description of that program it all made perfect sense.  I met ted at a California State Social Services Hearing ion San Diego, where I was formally asked, by an invitation I got in the mail, to testify. He approached me in the hallway because I was known then for keeping a file of documentation on the issue. I had appeared on several news programs and talk shows.</p>

<p>How he wormed his way into my home is a rather long story. Basically he tried to hire me to not only work with him, but do research for attornies, which I did maybe twice, then started hanging around our apartment. I had just been diagnosed with malignant melanoma and while waiting for results of the test, was told I may only have three months to live. He got into a nasty fight with my downstairs neighbor and my landlord doubled my rent. I had thrown him out once because of his nasty temper towards the neighbors. While looking for another place to live and still communicating with him, he found a big house one block from my children&#39;s school. Needless to say the children loved the house. Against my better judgment, I agreed to let him move in with us and share expenses. This was almost immediately after we finished finding the tunnels at the preschool. I was not only exhausted, but I had contracted Psittacosis (parrot fever) which can be fatal. My temperature was so high seemed as if I were cooking from the inside. I was very sick for weeks, ted refused to help me. He took the checks I had made out to pay bills and told me he had to give his daughter the money. That was just the start of almost 4 years of my decent into debt and serious health problems.</p>

<p>Gunderson praised J. Edgar Hoover until the end of his life, which would be at odds with the decades-long elite pedophile cult that Gunderson claimed to have battled.  Hoover, of course, famously <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hoover+no+such+thing+as+organized+crime&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gbv=2&amp;amp;oq=hoover+no+such+thing+as+organized+crime&amp;amp;gs_l=heirloom-serp.3...151516.168350.0.169395.39.8.0.18.0.0.323.401.1j3-1.2.0....0...1ac.1.34.heirloom-serp..38.1.77.ItLO0ZpEMos">said there was no such thing as organized crime</a> (even while he was cultivating relationships to it) and used sexual blackmail on politicians &amp; officials.</p>

<p>Gunderson is not a reliable source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstood me. I was referring to evidence that Gunderson was likely connected to the perpetrators. And besides his obvious marital connections to the Church of Satan, I had heard the McMartin parents claimed he was a provocateur and con. This confirms that.</p>

<p>You should not be surprised. He was a long-standing agent of the FBI in what I would consider one of the lynchpin areas of the government&#39;s worst transgressions against the American people: LA county. Much like parts of Texas and Florida, the areas are heavily funded, and require the cooperation of local investigative and law enforcement bureaus to carry out their various crimes.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re calling any elite pedophilia &quot;Pizzagate&quot; then how about the Marquis De Sade from the 1700s?  Pizza wasn&#39;t even invented.</p>

<p>Not to mention:  <strong>The person you call &quot;another person discrediting pizzagate&quot; was discrediting Gunderson because Gunderson discredited elite pedophilia</strong>.  That person was the mother of a pedo/Gunderson victim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ray Buckey was probably guilty of sexual abuse imo. I don&#39;t believe the outlandish allegations but there was evidence of child molestation that even the defence acknowledged. Peggy Buckey lied on stand regarding the amount of time she worked at the school and admitted that she would check her son (who she referred to as &quot;a troubled young man&quot; to see if he had an erection after sitting the kids on his lap).
Unfortunately the due process became  fiasco but the sexual abuse was probably real. Severn out of the nine jurors which held a press conference said they believed abuse occurred but that the prosecution couldn&#39;t prove bard who abused who.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you understand the purpose of it all is generating fear to extract spiritual energy, essentially joy for consciousness, which fuels spirit to animate bodies, then you&#39;ll see that Satanic is a local adjective to describe a theme designed to inspire fear.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter which fake God or real entity (equal to any other, but acts as a parasite) they are worshipping. All spiritual parasites think very much alike. They seek slavery for others for utility for the self. They use fear to control and to extract spiritual energy from others. They are the ultimate useless eaters, but they are generally more competitive and intelligent than those they abuse. They use each other to control and extract value too. They form hierarchies.</p>

<p>Religion makes this topic so hard to discuss. Religion is another tool of these spiritual parasites. </p>
