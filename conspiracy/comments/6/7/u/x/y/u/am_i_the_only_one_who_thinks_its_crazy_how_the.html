        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>ffs, Its a show for 14+ .
It is mind boggling how a movement about questioning authority and &#39;the official story&#39; has been highjacked by fundamentalist Christians and social conservatives. I honestly don&#39;t understand how someone who &#39;questions everything&#39; believes in a book edited by one of the most corrupt institutions ever created.
Here are a few things going on that are much more interesting than an Engineer speaking about gender:
* The unelected government of Brazil, whose &quot;president&quot; was outed by wikileaks as being a CIA informant in the early 2000, is destroying the countries labour laws.
* Who is financing the anti-government protests in Venezuela, and whats going to happen now that their army is creating militias to fight the protesters, will this be the excuse for the intervention the US has been dying for?
* Isn&#39;t it odd that there where terrorist attacks the week of the French elections, surely they knew that would only help le Pen, so was it real?
* Fucking Saudi arabia is in the UN council for advancement of women, or whatever the fuck its called.</p>

<p>What else are the people who care about the real issues worried about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, all those things were extensively posted about and discussed as well as the Nye garbage. Maybe Nye is upsetting people because our generation has attachment to him. You could argue that a lot of this and the previous generation gained an interest in Science through his show, that level of thinking critically could have aided in leading us to being here. I know that&#39;s a stretch. But maybe that subconsciously hurts? Maybe to some, it offends deep memories that aided in developing into the humans we are today. </p>

<p>Not to mention the way it could shape the next generation. I mean, just look at the media. Look at what is &quot;normal&quot; now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true, there&#39;s organisms with no sex, two sexes, three sexes, one sex. There&#39;s organisms that reproduce through alternative methods of combining DNA. There&#39;s organisms that switch sex through out their lives. It&#39;s as simple as this, sex is a biological term that refers to the state of your primary and secondary sexual characteristics, gender is a set of expectations created by culture, which is impermanent and constantly changing. Sure, there&#39;s not much cultural precedent for &quot;78 genders&quot; but at that point you&#39;re just combating the oppression of social constructs by creating more social constructs. It socially convenient to have 2 genders, but I would honestly argue that there&#39;s no genders that physically exist and there&#39;s as much as a culture decides that culturally exist. It all depends on who controls the culture.</p>

<p>Not accepting that a person should be allowed to identify as a wood sprite can now be interpreted as sarcasm now. What in the actual fuck.</p>

<p>A nuclear family with a moral foundation that encourages ant-degeneracy further promoting strength and pride in one&#39;s achievements.</p>

<p>There is nothing beneficial to society as a whole when people are allowed to mutilate their genitals and call themselves whatever the fuck they want.</p>

<p>Normalizing mental illness is a huge problem all you have to do is look at what Nye has turned into.</p>

<p>What was once was a man who educated children on the proven ideals of science has become a decadent leftist promoting anti-science with full intention of indoctrinating young adults before they enter the world on their own believing that traditionalism and self respect are evil.</p>

Bill Nye is a systematic toxin that is part of a larger system of degrading the fundamental morals of Western society--sexually, scientifically and morally, working to drive a hive mind toward the goals of the NWO. Don&#39;t think so? His show is a part of Soros&#39; programming and is only a more extreme form of the mass brainwashing we have seen happening over the past decade. He is cancer--the concern is real and justified. Worry about whatever you want, that&#39;s your business. Many are concerned about these seemingly &#39;harmless&#39; techniques of indoctrinating the masses into false realities and grotesque parodies of morality that propose &#39;just fuck anything, anyone, anytime&#39; and &#39;science is whatever we say it is&#39; philosophies that are being pushed on our nation&#39;s youth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The demoralization process in the United States is basically completed already. For the last thirty-five years. Actually, it is over-fulfilled because demoralization reaches such areas where previously, not even Comrade Andropov [1911-1984] and all his experts would even dream of such a tremendous success. Most of it is done by Americans to Americans, thanks to lack of moral standards. As I mentioned before, exposure to true information does not matter any more. A person who is demoralized is unable to assess true information. The facts tell nothing to him. Even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents, with pictures. Even if I take him, by force, to the Soviet Union and show him concentration camp, he will refuse to believe it until he is going to receive a kick in his fat bottom. When the military boot crashes his, then he will understand. But not before that. That is the tragedy of this situation of demoralization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>good post. I thought you were disingenuous at first but you&#39;re right. Those issues are all way more important than this mass media bullshit.<br/>
I&#39;m surprised your being downvoted so hard.  </p>

<p>On another note, the whole thing really shows just how divided the country is on social issues. Those christians sure are easy to manipulate!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure this is going to get lost in the comments, but for me its not about the gravity of Bill Nye pushing gender views, or how its not appropriate.  I&#39;m relatively young, I grew up watching Bill Nye.  He was an idol of my childhood, who preached about truth and knowledge through science.  Now, especially as I am taking steps to understand the truth of what is going on in our world, its disheartening to see his new show have no real data points of real science, and instead is a very soft &quot;science&quot; with &quot;expert&quot; panels talking about how they feel about a subject.  He no longer is a champion of science, but just another schmuck pushing a narrative.</p>

If you argue that their lifestyle is making an impression on kids and people, then that&#39;s the parents&#39; failure in not teaching kids to look at things objectively and make decisions for themselves, and not to be influenced on whatever they see or hear.</p>

<p>The way you write comes off as sarcastic, and I was referring to your last line in your first comment about wood sprites.</p>

<p>If you are really talking science, if these &quot;degenerate&quot; people are out there not procreating and mutilating their genitals, then natural selection should naturally weed them out, right?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care who you&#39;re attracted to, who you want to fuck, etc etc. But when it comes to wanting to mutilate your body to actually become a sex you are not - you have mental problems. I don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about transexuals/transgender, I&#39;m talking about cutting your dick off and becoming something you are not. But go for it if that makes you happy. But it shouldn&#39;t be celebrated just fucking do it and go about your day. </p>

<p>I just dont think it should be celebrated. I don&#39;t give a fuck what anyone gets up to. I think we&#39;re over representing how common or normal this shit is. I think most people are impressionable and we don&#39;t know what the implications of all this leads to. </p>
