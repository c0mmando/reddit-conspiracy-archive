       Walter Cruttenden, June 2016
      </p>
      <p>
       "Astrophysicists around the world, including Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin at Caltech, believe there is a large force tugging on our solar system. It has led them to speculate that a massive 9th Planet exists somewhere beyond the known planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Binary Research Institute acknowledges there is large force tugging on the southwest underbelly of our solar system. We have been pointing this out for the better part of ten years in various papers and articles. These arguments on the BRI website show the precession observable, the Sun’s apparent lack of angular momentum relative to the planets, the unusual motion and position of unbound space probes, the elongated orbits of the minor planets, etc. are best explained if there is a very large object pulling on our solar system. But we do not think it is a 9th Planet. The force appears to be too great."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Considering  the direction and incline of the minor planet orbits it would appear that
       <strong>
        our solar system is  being  affected by the Sirius binary system.
       </strong>
       This system is equivalent to at least three solar masses. It is  also the nearest star system where one of the companions is a white dwarf. Such stars are much denser than normal matter, meaning  a tea spoonful of this dense matter would weigh about two tons. While there  are other stars and star systems that are closer, none are as collectively heavy, and none contain a  white  dwarf. Consequently, the Sirius system makes the biggest dent in the local space/time fabric."

       proposes that "Giza was created as a repository for advanced scientific knowledge. The Sphinx views the eastern horizon, its counterpart in the sky is Leo, the lion shaped asterism created in the stars indexed with the star Regulus. The job of the Sphinx is to record the range of the ecliptic from winter solstice though the spring equinox, summer solstice, fall equinox returning yearly to the winter solstice.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is this view of Sirius on the horizon, the position of the Pleiades, and the relative position of the Great Orion Nebula that is being tracked and documented. The movements of the star Sirius and the Pleiades star cluster are at odds with the current theory of precession in that they do not demonstrate the so-called wobble motion of the Earth’s axis. This implies that Sirius and the Pleiades are on a similar trajectory as our solar system. In fact, that is exactly what I have discovered encoded in The Giza Template. I
       <strong>
        propose that our solar system, the star Sirius and the Pleiades star cluster system were birthed from the same stellar nebula,
       </strong>
       that being the Great Orion Nebula, M42. These three systems are each on their own spiral trajectory or path, each being separated by time and distance directly related to the Great Year Cycle of 25,920 years. These star systems are moving away from the M42 Nebula in a spiral motion with our ecliptic rolling along like a wheel on a spiral path."

       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       Another summary of Walter Cruttenden's thoughts:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.sott.net/article/230480-Is-the-Sun-Part-of-a-Binary-Star-System-Six-Reasons-to-Consider">
        https://www.sott.net/article/230480-Is-the-Sun-Part-of-a-Binary-Star-System-Six-Reasons-to-Consider
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Just what is the real cause behind the precession of the equinoxes and why did the ancients believe this cycle was so important? Walter Cruttenden asks this question in his latest book Lost Star of Myth and Time and comes to some provocative conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the layman, the precession of the equinoxes is the observed motion of the night sky shifting backwards by a small amount every year. Of course, the night sky continuously shifts throughout the year as the Earth orbits around the Sun, but if one were to take a fixed point in time (like the Vernal Equinox, for instance) and take a snapshot of the sky on that day every year, one would notice the sky slowly shifting backwards with each progressing year. This is what is meant by the precession of the zodiac, or precessional movement. Astrologers would say we are in a different 'age' or zodiac sign depending on which constellations are visible in the sky on the Vernal Equinox of a particular year. This precessional movement of the sky amounts to about 50 arc seconds per year and takes about 24,000-26,000 years to complete a full cycle; the "great year" or "great world cycle" as it is often called.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sir Isaac Newton was the first to put forth the idea that this precession is due to a wobbly motion of the Earth's axis, and few scientists have challenged this assumption since Newton's time. Cruttenden dares to ask the most basic question about this in his book bringing together a number of clues to form a hypothesis for precession being the result of the Sun moving in a binary orbit about a companion star.
       <strong>
        Could Cruttenden's speculations really lead to data that could overturn the ideas of Newton - a man treated like a deity in the world of physics and astronomy?
       </strong>
       As we'll see below, there's actually a large body of evidence to support Cruttenden's ideas."

       Anyway, the BRI group seems to be challenging the current model of precession:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://binaryresearchinstitute.com/bri/calculations/precession-measurement-paradox/">
        Precession Riddle
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If there are 50 arc seconds of earth wobble in 365.2563 spins of the earth then how much wobble (precession) is there in 365.2422 spins of the earth? Please take a moment to calculate your answer before reading on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Logically, if the earth wobbles 50 arc seconds in 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes and 9 seconds (a time period equivalent to a sidereal year) then it should wobble 99.99% of this amount in 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds (a tropical year time period). But because the cause of precession has been misdiagnosed – the lunisolar theory has no way to logically answer the question – so the question becomes a riddle. Precession is the value of the delta between the two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The best answer under current lunisolar precession theory has to be: there is no wobble in a tropical year but for the next 20 minutes after that – the earth wobbles a full 50 arc seconds!
        <strong>
         The answer under the binary model is simple and logical: The earth does not wobble but it does change orientation to objects outside the solar system as the solar system curves through space.
        </strong>
        In the time period known as a tropical year it has curved through space 99.99% of the 50 arc seconds (of precession) found in a sidereal year. Therefore the phenomenon known as precession can only be due to the changing orientation of the solar system as it curves through space – it has almost nothing to do with a local wobbling of the earth.

       I am talking the existence of time, and I subscribe to

       <p>
        One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe—a dimension independent of events, in which events occur in sequence. Isaac Newton subscribed to this realist view, and hence it is sometimes referred to as Newtonian time.[15][16] The opposing view is that time does not refer to any kind of "container" that events and objects "move through", nor to any entity that "flows", but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure (together with space and number) within which humans sequence and compare events. This second view, in the tradition of
        <strong>
         Gottfried Leibniz[17] and Immanuel Kant,[18][19] holds that time is neither an event nor a thing, and thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled.

       Time is the measureable distance of light travel experienced.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's real but not physically tangible. It's a construct mean to grasp the "distance of light travel experienced". Just like 12 inches tells you you've grown a foot. Inches aren't real, but they are.

       Good comments but I'm not going to hijack my own post about the possibility of Sirius being our binary star, and precession model by an endless discussion what is light and whether it "travels," sorry. Next time.

       DNA is negatively charged, therefore, when an electric current is applied to the gel, DNA will migrate towards the positively charged electrode. Shorter strands of DNA move more quickly through the gel than longer strands resulting in the fragments being arranged in order of size."

       When you start a study by outlining another person's claims that you then work backwards to match you are falling victim to your own biases and not taking an objective look at the issue at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is demonstrated through multiple issues that jump out in the study.  You seriously think that
       <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/22/02/3F79020000000578-4432554-image-a-43_1492822854268.jpg">
        this is solid proof of their claims
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What did you think of the study?  You didn't find it interesting that they were citing Andrew Collins throughout, whose assumptions they were trying to match?  There was seriously nothing that struck you as reaching, when constellations are quite possibly the single thing most open to interpretation in the skies (with clouds being a close second)?
      </p>
      <p>
       There has already been a number of people who have called out the lack of scientific methodology in the study.  Don't trust everything the Telegraph writes.

       I posted several comments in the thread devoted to this paper. Ancient civilizations paid a great attention to zodiac changes and "precession" since they knew that recording and using this information is vital. YD event is real, and the consequences were dramatic.

       And you believe that in 10,000BC they were using the same zodiac/constellation signs as the Greeks, and that even though the images on the rock are wildly open to interpretation in terms of correlating them with constellations we should just believe it to be correct?

       No, the point is that the engineers are assuming that the symbols in GT represent constellations, which is based on pure speculation.  It's an argument postulated by Collins/Hancock with absolutely no logical basis, and has now been extended past it's logical conclusion to the point that we have non-archaeologists pointing to

        <p>
         At Lake Cuitzeo (Mexico), Israde-Alcántara et al. applied a fifth-order polynomial regression to derive a depth for YDB-age sediments; they state that this regression provides a result of ∼270–290 cm below surface (6). However, when the equation they provide is solved (y = −5E−07x5 + 6E−05x4 − .0025x3 + .0366x2 − .0108x + .512; solved for x = 12.9 kcal B.P.), the predicted depth of the YDB is actually 258 cm below surface, at least 12 cm above their reported depth. Further, using their same data (6), our fifth-order polynomial regression returned a different equation (y = −6E−20x5 + 8E−15x4 − 3E−10x3 + 6E−06x2 − 0.0205x + 93.278; solved for x = 12,900 cal B.P.) that puts YDB-age deposits at a depth of 259.33 cm below surface, also well above the depth presumed to mark the YD onset (see also ref. 33).

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While G waves are still barely understood the Sirius gravitational configuration may seem to act larger  than its three solar masses. It may be that the orbit of Sirius B (the heavy dwarf orbiting  Sirius A)  enlarges the wave amplitude or exaggerates the gravity well surrounding  Sirius A. Also, it is possible the  perpetual G waves very close to our solar system plane have a  more noticeable effect than closer smaller  stars that are far off  plane (like Alpha  Centauri).

        But if G waves are real (and it appears they are), and if Sirius B is indeed a s dense as believed (and most scientists would agree), then its constant action around Sirius A may be having  a far greater affect on our solar system than previously realized.
        <strong>
         The Homann’s 20-year experiment measuring the earth’s daily rotation time relative to the star Sirius, detected changes in the earth’ s rotation period when Sirius B  passed between earth and Sirius A.
        </strong>
        If such a phenomenon can noticeably affect the earth’s rotation, then it is logical to assume that the action of this nearby star system might also affect the entire solar system,  especially the minor planets at the edge of the solar system.

       "... he came across Robert Temple’s book The Sirius Mystery and later during his own research, Karl-Heinz was intrigued by the work of R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz.
      </p>
      <p>
       De Lubicz says an interesting thing while talking about the Egyptians use of Sirius to time their yearly calendar events. He said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For it is remarkable that owing to the precession of the equinoxes, on the one hand, and the movement of Sirius on the other, the position of the sun with respect to Sirius is displaced in the same direction, almost exactly to the same extent. [R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz, Sacred Science, Inner Traditions (1982)]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It was this short statement that launched Karl on his decision to find out if this was true. His detailed observations over a 20 year period show definitively that Sirius does not precess. This may have been why the Egyptians were so interested in Sirius and why it’s heliacal rising (first annual appearance of the star just before sun rise) became the calibration point for their calendar system. The beauty of their use of Sirius is that they did not have to worry about leap years at all and yet this system will maintain accuracy better than the Gregorian calendar. What Pope Gregory’s experts didn’t know was this crucial piece of information:
       <strong>
        Sirius does not precess."

       "Significant time deviations in earth’s period of rotation, as measured with respect to Sirius have occurred over certain months (e.g. in the spring of 1989, when Sirius A, Sirius B and the sun were in direct conjunction). Some minor, but nevertheless distinct deviations appear at regular yearly intervals (usually around March). Since these deviations occur annually, the gravitational influence of the moon or perturbations caused by other planets in the solar system can be excluded. Since such deviations from mean sidereal time CANNOT be caused by an increase or decrease in the speed of earth’s rotation, I suspect a combined ‘gravitational’ effect of the sun and the Sirius system on the earth’s axis of rotation. In my article “Some more thoughts on gravitation” I have tried to describe how the Sirius system might be responsible for a ‘curvature in space’ that can reach as far as to our solar system. As we know,
       <strong>
        the revolution of Sirius B and Sirius A around their common center of gravity over a period of about 49 years proceeds in an almost vertical plane relative to the planetary plane of our solar system.
       </strong>
       This motion could cause a periodic fluctuation in the curvature of space, similar to an ocean where a calm wind would create long-stretched waves. If a ship were to sail on such waves, its mast will gently swing back and forth. Likewise, during the earth’s orbit around the sun the axis of the earth would ‘oscillate’ due to these periodic fluctuations of the space-curvature between sun and Sirius. Although the speed of earth’s rotation remains unchanged (!), a positive or negative time-deviation from mean sidereal time can be measured, depending on the magnitude and direction of the oscillation of the axis, the sidereal point of reference and the latitude on earth from which the measurements are taken. As a matter of fact, the International Earth Rotation Service observes significant daily variations in earth’s sidereal rotation period.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also very important to remember that despite some major variations in earth’s period of rotation, the mean time interval of the sidereal year or earth’s complete orbit period basically remains constant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more surprising is the observation that the mean time interval of the sidereal year, as measured with respect to Sirius is nearly identical (by less than one second) to the time interval of the tropical year. According to the theory of ‘precession’, a yearly time difference of about 1223 s is supposed to occur between a sidereal year and the tropical year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The meridian transit measurements of Sirius have shown that neither a time difference of 6 × 1223 s, nor a difference of 6 × 3.34 s has occurred over the 6-year observation period from April 1994 to April 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       These observations clearly indicate that the so-called ‘precession of the earth’ is NOT a scientific fact, and that the
       <strong>
        Sirius system has a noticeable gravitational influence on our solar system.
       </strong>
       Obviously, Newton’s laws of gravitation cannot explain Einstein’s universe. In that respect, it requires further study to see if the 49 year cycle of the Sirius system can provide us with an explanation of the large fluctuations and annual irregularities in earth’s rate of rotation that have also been observed around 1941 by experts at the US Naval Observatory.!

       A few things here.... gravity does not propagate instantaneously, and, while Sirius B is a white dwarf, which is super dense, it has incredibly small volume (about the same size as the earth), meaning its mass is about the same as our sun, which in turn means that it can't have a large impact on our solar system.

       Sirius A is also a rather small, about 2 solar masses.  They are 9 Ly away from us, which is much to far for them to have a significant impact on the sun.  Gravitational force decays with the square of distance.
