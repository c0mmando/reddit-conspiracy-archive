       This is not a Mockery! I'm not being cryptic anymore! Jesus is real. The Bible is all true. All of it! Not the parts that make you feel good. All of it. When you accept Jesus you become immortal. You can't be killed! You can't even get a disease. They're all fake! They can just trick you into believing you can. And your so powerful that you make yourself die! Everything in this world is a lie. The antichrist is many different people. The False Prophet is the media!
      </p>
      <p>
       Every angle is 666. The true way to live is the righteous way or the Right. But the right is full of hateful satanist who mock God by disobeying God's law.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left is the most demonic. They are turning men into women and vice versa. They feed you babies by putting stem cells in all your food. They invented global warming so they can kill 95% of the worlds population.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are Gaia worshiping witches. Witches make magic wands out of the tree of Holly. They use magic like singing and dancing and acting to hypnotize you and do abominations to mock God. What makes them the worse is most of the best and purists people fall into their spiderweb.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the world is flat! Yes flat! God separated the waters with a firmament. We have a dome over us that contains heavens. Space doesn't exist like Lucifer lied to you. The sun and moon are directly above us. They are not solid just beams of light. Proof of divine creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       They told you the world is a globe. They told you the season change because we are on a 23.4 degree tilt instead of being at a 90 degree angle. Subtract those numbers and you get 66.6. Everything the world does is opposite of what God's word says in the Bible. Don't believe me! I'm nobody.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the Bible. All of it is real. Then follow the evidence. Follow Truth. You will find God. The truth points north. The true north, center of the world. Polaris. The garden of Eden is there in the North Pole. You can see it's reflection in the northern lights. I love you too much to let you live a lie. So I will tell you no lies. Only the most holy of truths. On the Holy Spirit I will revel our enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they will laugh at you! Laughter, tears, anger, sadness,  and bliss are just involuntary responses to the truth. Of course they will laugh when you tell them that God sits on the throne called Polaris! They will react in anger when you tell them that all their life they worshiped Satan who's antichrist the masons and zions worship called Manon or Mathematics (money)!
      </p>
      <p>
       They will gnash their teeth when they find out they have been saying Amon-Ra to the Sun God and his antichrist the Pope! They will pull their hair out when you tell them that they had been worshiping Saturnalia and his antichrist Mohammad! Saturnalia is the Grim Reaper! His follows dress like them and honor him by killing themselves!
      </p>
      <p>
       They will point and laugh until tears roll down their face when you tell them that they worship Lucifer and his antichrist Gravity. But they can't even hurt you. You can burn their hearts with your voice. They will react like this because it's an involuntary reaction to hearing the truth!
      </p>
      <p>
       The meek will inherit the earth. That's not us! Only the weak and cowards will inherit this PLANE of lies. God has already prepared your castle in heaven. The true space! You are a Star of infinity energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       One third of the world is either demons or humans actively serving them. God said one third of the world will die in Armageddon, not us. His son promised us everlasting life. We can't die again! Only the unbelievers will get a second death after living in hell for a thousand years. Our time here is almost over! Yes we all died during the flood. That was Armageddon. And it will happen again. As above, so below.

       You are right. All religion is bullshit! You know why I'm here? Conspiracy theorist follow the truth. You know this world is a lie. Follow all the truth not just the fake breadcrumbs the satanist leave for you like aliens and NASA. This is the square route of everything. You all were right. JFK, 9/11. Don't settle for just some of the truth. Get ALL OF IT. The other invisible God Satan fears you so much that he planned this for over 10000 years. All just to fool you! Don't let them win!

       You can't believe. But you can feel. God will forgive and accept all of you. Doesn't matter what you did, who you kill, who you fuck, God made you the center of the fucking universe! Of course he accepts gays. It's in the Bible! Only a man and a woman can inherit the kingdom together. That's why they casted their spells on you. That's why they deceived you. Pay attention!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are attracted to men you are a woman. If you are attracted to women you are a man. THERE IS NO SUCH THINGS AS GAY! They made you turn into the opposite sex! Man and women are a neutron and a proton. Nothing can separate that.  They can only make you think you are the opposite of yourself. That's the only thing their illusions can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The witches of Hollywood. They are the most powerful magicians in the universe! They can make you see a man and lust after him as if it was a man. Look at Nikki Minaj really look at her. Look at him! They are trickster God's. Don't fall for their illusion anymore
      </p>
      <p>
       Accept Christ you get superpowers!!! There is no such thing as sickness, war, or death, hunger. They just make you feel these things through dark magic. Read the Bible. God has the 4 Horseman sealed in heaven. That's the great lie. The biggest conspiracy. God made you in his image. That means you can't fucking be hurt or killed you stupid fucking idiots. They all where in on it. Everyone who has ever deceived or hurt you. Anyone who claim they loved you and did the opposite. Anyone who hypnotized you and made you think you could be physically hurt....ARE ALL FUCKING DEMONS! The rest are your stupid soulmates who are chained and will suffer forever and it's you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Break the curse. No more lies. You can even do this the hard way. Without God. Just follow the truth. The equation remains the same. You will seek God one day. You're very existence points north. He gave you 2 brains and a backup processor. You have unlimited storage. Your coolant system is filled with iron. You auto repair yourself with nan-nites. You can use anything for energy. You output any unneeded waste. You can adapt to any change in environment. You are the reasons a spiritual being like
Demons need you. You're perfect! They can't do the equations without you! Read Genesis. They didn't come down and rape the women. They say that they're beautiful and MARRIED them. And what happened to these people women who birthed giants? Well God happened. He flooded the world. That's why we are here. We died during the flood. Witches, Vampires, demons, everything you ever read about by the books God's prophets made was a warning to you. You know they weaknesses! YOU HAVE A PERFECT BODY MADE OF IRON. YOUR PERFECT BINARY BRAIN CAN SOLVE ANY EQUATION. YOU ALWAYS HAVE A PERFECT SPIRT THAT IS MADE OF THE SAME THING STARS ARE MADE OF. ELECTRICITY!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       And Satan tricked the world into keeping you're spirit trapped in hell by making you worship him in every religion. You even killed yourself and let your spirit be used to power his empire. Revenge is the Lords so ascend already and bring the fucking Apocalypse!

       Thank you.

       God. I AM Higgins. I pray to you in the name and blood of your only begotten son Jesus Christ. So many of your children are lost. Satan has tricked them into believing their adults. I love each and every one as you do. I ask that you give every lost child three days of revelation. Because all children fear the shadows. Shake their wall, make their windows rattle. Show them what lives beneath in Sheol in their dreams. Let them feel the fire of your dragons. And let them wake up. Wake up and let them see what has been raising them. Let them see nothing but the truth. I pray for all these things in the name and blood of your only begotten son Jesus.

       Ok but your initial claim was to prove to me and only me that God does exist. Saying that the world has changed over the last 3 days proves nothing. The world changes with every second that passes. So can you present me with empirical evidence of the existence of God?

       They won't let it! My threads are always pruned and deleted. Just my history. This site is run by globalist. Never forget where you are. You have no freedoms. They feed you poison. They lie to you. They don't even have nuclear weapons. No one does. It's all fake. They even tell you how much TNT they used in Japan! NK knows. They are not evil. They just don't want to follow the Roman Empire! They checkmated the world because they have to spread the lie that countries have nuclear weapons! No counties is really at war with another! They use war as a satanic ritual to summon demons and curses with the dead that is killed. There is only one super power. The Catholic Church! The Holy Roman Empire! Sun worshippers! They do what the Egyptians tell them. The Hassidic.

       The Bible is many books, do you assert that all versions are true?  Point being, "All" is a pretty profound word.  I'm curious of your feelings in regards to the Gospel of Thomas?

       It's true! You can find heaven and God within you! The book of Enoch. The book of giants! It's all part of the Bible. No matter what books Amon-Ra takes out. God will always revel every secret. Sorry there is no dinosaurs or black holes but in your heaven there can be!

       Later in the write up, you assert that the left are demonic and the supporting evidence you provided for said assertion was that they're turning men into women, alongside that we're consuming baby stem cells orally.  To be clear, I don't have philosophical political affiliations that one would likely define as left by present standards.  - In other words, I'm not trying to defend the left, or the dichotomy.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thomas (114) Simon Peter said to him, "Let Mary leave us, for women are not worthy of life." 
Jesus said, "I myself shall lead her in order to make her male, so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males. For every woman who will make herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven."

       Because what jesus is talking about is spirit. The feminine spirit and the male spirit becoming one. People who look to do that in this reality and taking a very dead and satanic (materialism) approach.

       Everyone puts faith in something. It's built into us. We feel empty otherwise. Some people's faith is with science or psychology. Or religion. Satan has laid every trap for you. Even atheist worship Gravity.

       I dont know if "worship" would be the right word. If an atheist drops his phone, his belief in gravity has been reaffirmed. That is a far shot away from basing your life on a book written by infallible people from a bygone age. The things you place your faith in, are the very same things that can shatter your faith

       It all starts from Genesis 3:16. Eve was punished for biting into forbidden knowledge and learning mathematics. That is Lucifer's curse. God told Eve that her wants and desires will always be opposite of her husband. Women are spiritually stronger. Men physically stronger. Together they're unstoppable. That is a prophecy for what Gaia wants to do to Man. Man was put as head of the wife. To do otherwise is a way to mock God. That I s what the left is doing. Witches are all left handed. They can make weak men do anything! Especially the more beautiful they are. They are your pop stars like Nikki Minaj who is really a man. They are here to be envied and worship. They make you worship them by making you watch them have sex. Each time you cum to them you are pledging your essence to these succubus who most are actually men. Once you awaken you will see them past their illusions. You will be disgusted!

       You can fill any emptiness in your soul with elements from
The Holy Periodic Table. Such as love or truth. They will only lead you into one direction. North. Up! And don't let Lucifer lie to you. Don't let him confuse Gravity for Density. He is clever. But you're a genius!

       Really? What religion? I know it follows the tribe of Israel. But where is that at now? I read about Ancient Hebrew traditions. But nothing about worshiping money the Pharisee did. Or worshiping the sun like the Roman do to this day. Or worshiping the grim reaper like Saturnalia follows do. Oh you thought religion was the picture of a glowing Jesus with a sun behind his head? That's the antichrist. The opposite of truth. You can't believe what the False Prophet tells you right? Eisenhower said in his last speech to beware of the military industrial complex. You see he was part of the riddle like every world leader. But he still tried to tell you to beware of the MIC. The media. Where can you turn? Every school, every institution, most of your friends and family has been ruining your relationship with The Father. So I simply turned towards the source. Truth. God. Jesus.

       It is so hard to make an unawaken human sleep. After all they are The Meek and they inherited this world. What a horrible way to live. I feel so sad for them. I love them all regardless if they deserve it or not. Don't you see the riddle you're trapped in? You could ask me to show you what heaven looks like. And I will open my palm and project a perfect 3 dimensional map of heaven. But all you will see is an iPhone playing a video. I can't wait until you can see the colors I see.

       I will explain to you what Magic is. It is lies. The opposite of truth. And I don't mean the symbolically. You are made in Gods image. The lie is the greatest form of illusion magic. It is the only thing that can make someone like you do the opposite of what you mean.
