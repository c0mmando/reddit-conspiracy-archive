        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">151</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-04-23 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ModernDayTJ.html">ModernDayTJ</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Twaidh is the core tenet of Islam which professes the &quot;Oneness of Allah/God&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The Qur&#39;an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique, independent and indivisible being, who is independent of the entire creation.[10] God, according to Islam, is a universal God, rather than a local, tribal, or parochial one—God is an absolute, who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil.[6]&quot;</p>

<p>....Islam literally believes that Allah/God is just a name given to an omnipotent, omnipresent universal force, the nature of which is the Light. </p>

<p>People....Islam legitimately believes in The Force as set forth in Star Wars and that, by the fact that man has free will, we can live in commune with The Force and its Light...a Light inherent to all of us as creations made from, of and by the universal Force of Light...or we can go against the nature of the Force, manipulate and twist it, and create Darkness. </p>

<p>How do you access the Force? </p>

<p>The Trinity of Christianity...which is really just a universal truth for all humanity which is labeled as the Trinity of an organized religion which formed around the Prophet who first delivered this truth for all to know. </p>

<p>God/Allah = Universal Force of Light</p>

<p>Holy Spirit = That part of the Universal Force of Light which lives in all of us by virtue of the fact that we are beings borne out of and created from this Universal Force of Light....meaning our nature is inherently that of the Light. </p>

<p>Christ...and Mohammad = The Prophets who came down to Earth already possessing knowledge of the Holy Spirit and how, if the actions in our lives are lived in accordance of the principles of the Light, we can re-access this Holy Spirit within us, bring our consciousness into unison with the Light....and use our Third Eye (Pineal Gland) to directly commune with the Universal Force of Light and all its creations. </p>

<p>Christ was the only Son of God....but it&#39;s never stated he was to be the ONLY Son of God for all eternity. Nor is it ever stated that there were not to be Daughters of God. </p>

<p>God/Allah are two names for the same thing....the Universal Force of Light. </p>

<p>So Christ was the first &quot;Son of the Universal Force of Light&quot; to live among humanity and to teach humans how to live their lives in order to be in harmony with the Light, thus allowing their consciousness to access this Force. </p>

<p>Live in Spirit and in Truth. Word of God (the Force) enthroned, dwell in us forever more, Love has come to show the way. Hallelujah, Peace be With Us, Love has come to show the way.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Trinity was misinterpreted and...whether by this misinterpretation or intentional deception when Christ&#39;s teachings were institutionalized...Christians have always been lead to believe that ONLY Christ could commune with God (the Universal Force of Light) and that the rest of us needed to use Christ as an intermediary to commune with God (the Force)....when the true teaching was to live Christ&#39;s teachings in order to bring ourselves into harmony with the Light in order to then tap into and commune with the Force just as he did. </p>

<p>Mohammad, as Islam very clearly states, was a Prophet of Allah/God (the Force) and the tenet of Tawhid states...as I mentioned above...that Allah/God are just names we give to this Universal Force of Light for the purpose of personification. </p>

<p>But to live in a balance of Wisdom (the truth of the Universal Force of Light) and Knowledge (our evolution as we discover more and more about the space in time we occupy, satisfying our curious nature) means that, as our Knowledge progresses....we are not supposed to be arrogant and dismiss Wisdom...the truth of the Universal Force of Light...as some fairy tale. </p>

<p>We are to reconcile Wisdom and Knowledge in order to update the underlying messages of Christ and Mohammad so that it is more clearly understood in the modern era and serves as a guide for how remembering and understanding this Wisdom, then coupled with our Knowledge, allows us to fulfill our species&#39; curiosity in the innocent and loving way like a child when we live in the Light and allow our actions to be a reflection of such. </p>

<p>The Trinity was partly correct...the Tahwid was partly correct. But man is flawed and fallible....and we sometimes make things far more difficult than they need to be. </p>

<p>What if it&#39;s just that simple? </p>

<p>Live in the Light by our words and actions. The Light is love, kindness, charity, mercy, forgiveness, peace, justice. </p>

<p>Universal Truth and Universal Justice....not &quot;Social Justice&quot; (justice derived from mob mentality going along with what&#39;s popular at the time) and not man made justice. </p>

<p>.....this is LITERALLY what the United States was founded upon. The inalienable rights endowed to all men by their Creator in Nature. </p>

<p>Of course, they could have been a bit more progressive in expanding the scope of this application but...hey...again humans are imperfect, flawed and fallible. </p>

<p>So if Christ was the Messiah for the Jewish people, and really, who the **** is going to argue that the message that man preached was not that of the first of the first Prophet to bring the chosen people out of Darkness and into the Light?</p>

<p>Thus....does this not mean that the 12 tribes of Israel are...well...all of us in the world? Presume I am right that Christ was in commune with the Universal Force of Light, but that Mohammad being sent as a Prophet by this Universal Force....or maybe even sent by ETIs who serve this universal force of light just like Jedi...was spurred on by a need to confirm the core tenets, teachings and messages of Christ, correct a few misinterpretations and misunderstandings, and solidify the message and teachings of the Universal Force of Light. </p>

<p>Furthermore, if man is fallible and flawed...but possesses Free Will...then are we not at a point where we can say that the messages of the Prophets could EASILY have been manipulated and altered...over many, many generations...by humans who fell prey to the Darkness....knowingly or unknowingly...in order to create contradiction, strife and infighting between two groups, comprising over 2 billion people today, who both fundamentally, at the end of the day, believe in this same truth of the Universal Force of Light?</p>

<p>Why do you think Israel and....certain other nations which gave rise to Israel...so heavily back the Arabic Gulf States which adhere to Wahabi Sunni Islam?</p>

<p>Because Wahabi Sunni Islam believes that man does not have Free Will...and that all of our lives, and the fate of our species, is pre-determined. </p>

<p>You know which Muslims believe that we have Free Will?</p>

<p>Shia Muslims. </p>

<p>Major Shia players in the Middle East? </p>

<p>Iran and Yemen. </p>

<p>Do you know which of the two, between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Rite Orthodox Christianity, has been scandal free the majority of its existence...has never been plagued by allegations of diddling kids...and has never turned itself into a religious empire conquering the world as a &quot;Holy Successor&quot; to the Roman Empire? </p>

<p>Eastern Rite Orthodox Christianity. </p>

<p>Do you know which country is one of the largest followers of the above?</p>

<p>Russia. </p>

<p>Do you know which country kicked out a ton of Jews for usury and general fuckery of and against the culture and the people?</p>

<p>Russia.</p>

<p>Do you know where most of those Jews emigrated to?</p>

<p>The United States. </p>

<p>Did you know that the bloodline of the Palestinians is an 80% genealogical match to the Abrahamic bloodlines and that the bloodline of the Ashkenazi Jews is a less than 10% genealogical match to the Abrahamic bloodlines?</p>

<p>Hell, the Ashkenazi did not emerge until the 1500s and their bloodline can be traced back to &lt;100 individuals from Eastern Europe at that time. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s make this clear....the people who make up the majority of modern day, genealogical descended claimants as Jews have a bloodline that is less than 10% related to the Abrahamic bloodlines...they are traced back to &lt;100 individuals in Eastern Europe in the 1500s and appear no sooner...have been kicked out of country after country since the 1500s...were kicked out of Russia...came to the United States...and the American public&#39;s image of Russia image ever since has been that of Satan incarnate. Nevermind the fact that Russia was one of the BIGGEST allies of the United States under the Tzarist monarchy, as they distrusted Great Britain as much as we did. </p>

<p>Oh hey! Who did the Ashkenazi start running to and begging for help from in 1832 to establish Palestine...even though Israel having a homeland is completely antithetical to the Torah and their covenant with God? </p>

<p>Great Britain!</p>

<p>So a small minority of people who disproportionately control the media, financial, medical, legal and academic sectors in this country are...for all intents and purposes...not the Jews of the bible...they randomly appeared in Eastern Europe in the 1500s...the last country to kick them out before WWII was the country we&#39;re conditioned to hate in spite of that country always having our back up until the Cold War...they enlisted the help of Great Britain to turn Palestine into Israel (backwater wasteland my ass....Great Britain would not have occupied Palestine were it not of some importance to the Empire)...and now that they have Israel...they are most allied with Muslim nations which believe that humanity&#39;s fate is pre-determined and that we do not have free will. </p>

<p>WHAT. THE. FUCK.....?</p>

<p>WE HAVE ALL BEEN DUPED!</p>

<p>As an American of Irish heritage whose ancestors were starved out of their homeland after living in County Cork since before English conquered the Irish in the 1100s...meaning my family has only had descendants living in a truly free land since the 1850s...I am a part of The Irish Diaspora....just as the Zionists who call themselves Jewish...claim The Jewish Diaspora. </p>

<p>So from one member of a Diaspora to the members of another.....FUCK YOU!</p>

<p>You kissed ass with the evil crown which tried to wipe my people from the face of the Earth for over 800 years, you got your religious state, then you hijacked the media, financial, legal, medical and academic  sectors of the first and only nation in which descendants of my Irish ancestors LIVE AS FREE PEOPLE, you then convinced us to forget an entire past of support from Russia, you make our enemies those Muslims who believe in Free Will, and make us allies with those who believe all is pre-destined and that it&#39;s out of our control. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like Revelations was right about <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">you</a>....and I now think I know who the <a href="https://www.enterthebible.org/Controls/feature/tool_etb_resource_display/resourcebox.aspx?selected_rid=218&amp;original_id=66">Whore of Babylon</a> is and that she lives on the Earth at this very moment....</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/david-icke-says-royal-family-8011156">Maybe David Icke is right.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://jonathanwilliamslegionsofsatan1781.blogspot.com">And maybe General Cornwallis really did give this warning to General George Washington....</a></p>

<p>It would explain why the War of 1812 occurred (trade disagreements my ass...we did not have the navy to go toe-to-toe with Great Britain&#39;s navy in 1812), how our national anthem became an altered British drinking song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqHHGLD_Ndk">instead of what it originally was</a>, <a href="http://www.reformation.org/war-of-1812.html">and why a bunch of British spies entered the country during the war and never left.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/AY5LZopqyio">If this is truly a song and words of my enemy, then I think we need to re-examine who are our enemies...or why e have enemies to begin with.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once you remember who you are, where you come from , and where you&#39;re going....it&#39;s easy to speak truth and call out contrarian actions of the few without care for being labeled an -it&#39;s or -it&#39;s.</p>

<p>If you speak Truth, then nothing else matters.</p>

<p>How do you think humans evolved to a point of advanced consciousness?</p>

<p>I believe Darwin himself said that if his.proposed &quot;missing link&quot; isn&#39;t found within a century or two, then his theory needs to be re-examined.</p>

<p>Are we not just biological computers?</p>

<p>So if the mechanical computers we&#39;ve created can send a file from a solid hard drive to a cloud storage drive or other end point without wires....then does it not stand to reason that our brain...the hub of the body that is our biological computer...can receive what we call divine inspiration in the same manner?</p>

<p>It is sent through the ether. Hell, before wireless internet....we had ETHERnet cables!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All &#39;one world governments&#39; have been loosely founded in Islam, Catholicism, and Judaism. The reason is that each of these religions teach of a &#39;mecca&#39; type of situation (Vatican, Jerusalem, Mecca (Saudi Arabia)).</p>

<p>Christianity, or rather &#39;protestant&#39; Christianity, was founded in direct opposition to power, authority, and centralization. This was the true message of Jesus Christ, as is clear if you listen to his words and observe his actions. Jesus flat out rejected the Jewish notion that there was a central authority issuing commands, burning villages, impregnating women, and demanding child sacrifices. Instead he proposed the absolutely radical idea, at the time, that each of had the ability to think and govern ourselves, without becoming beasts.</p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s not like 99% of Cath, Jews, Musl, even truly understand how the &quot;1%&quot; (really more like ~400 people) operate. Essentially these &quot;mecca&quot; creations are a tool for establishing centralized power, funneling money, and manipulating world economies.</p>

<p>When you look at terrorism, and so forth, the primary proponents are the centralized authority religions, for which the reason is obvious. Destroying national or local government forces humans to turn over their children to religious educational institutions, which in turn breeds a series of slaves.</p>

<p>It is completely false to believe &#39;jews&#39; &#39;catholics&#39; or &#39;muslims&#39; are behind terrorism &#39;at large&#39;, but the head administers of these organizations, each of them, act in unison to terrorism any sovereign nation, worldwide.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re really talking about like 400 people or some such. They may run the organizations, but they are no more representative of the people than say Hillary would have been if she had be crowned President. Even the most devote Muslims I&#39;ve had the opportunity to discuss politics with have extreme distaste for Saudi Arabia, though that is nearly sacrilege.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Islam is one of the most advanced faiths. I was bugging my friend about the &#39;magic&#39; of Mohammed, and he explained that Mohammed possess no magical powers beyond being able to write (or assemble) a book, and organize a prosperous community. In other words, Mohammed&#39;s magic was limited to being able to educate and establish politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, which is why air need to get myself in the habit of distinguishing Zionism, masked primarily through Free Masonry and with Israel&#39;s Likud and the U.S. Deep State as it&#39;s main support and muscle.</p>

<p>Funny because I&#39;m currently doing a comedy jam with a friend, who happens to be Jewish, and this is the guy who reached out his hand to me in kinship and love when I did as having a rough time with a family member&#39;s health over the holiday season.</p>

<p>He brought me to his temple where we cooked, served, and broke bread with the homeless in that neighborhood who use the temple&#39;s shelter.</p>

<p>So my point is that it&#39;s not just Christian and Muslims who have been duped....it&#39;s also my friends who are good, kind hearted people who stick to Judaism because it&#39;s their cultural root. But they, just like so many people from all different walks of life, do not know the real truth of what is happening, what has happened, and what will happened if we all do not remember our free will inherent as humans and take a stand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m not jumping on that particular train, but before asking questions in such a condescending manner, change your entire paradigm to seek answers.</p>

<p>For instance, here&#39;s a red pill: the Holocaust was facilitated by ethnic Jews to nonethnic Jews. Pretty much all of the Jews that died in WWII were actually Khazar Russians and Eastern Europeans, whose lineages had converted centuries prior under a Czar. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how racial supremacists think. They don&#39;t give a fuck about anyone but theirs. So with that new knowledge, even you can no longer lump all Jews together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I cant buy the conspiracy that Islam is the religion of peace, its even the mainstream cultural Marxist narrative. Every Islamic country has horrible human rights violations, especiallty if you&#39;re a woman or LGBT or a non Muslim. We are seeing this in Europe now with the massive surge of terrorist attacks and crime against the native populations in the name of Islam. I also don&#39;t think Islam is reformable at all, its considered blasphemy to even attempt such a thing. Islam hasn&#39;t had its age of enlightenment and never will because it is not only religious but heavily political and teaches people to submit to authority, and anything but ultimate submission is met with death.</p>

<p>A good read and I think it explains why Islam is the clusterfuck it is now. I strongly suspect that we have never seen what Islam is truly simply because peace is bad business and a unified people of the Middle East who have no reason to war with each other doesn&#39;t help the US and Western Banking and oil interest. </p>

<p>I suspect that it was absolutely necessary to create many violent sections of Islam after the Turkish Empire fell simply because infighting amongst the tribes was crucial in destroying it and allowing the west to take up ruined areas now devoid of people and snap up resources too.</p>

<p>Who knows what the situation is...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you honestly think the Western Oil and Banking interest would allow for the people in the Middle East to attempt the make peace with each other and reform their religion and ideology? Could you imagine if there was such peace in the Middle East how difficult it would be for those western oil and banking interest to play divide and conquer and continue to pillage that region?</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the people of the Middle East could never be allowed to reform and rebrand their religion. It&#39;s same reason why blacks like me and all the other races are constantly played against each other. Unified, we would collapse the banking and oil empires, divided they can misdirect us at their leisure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you fucking kidding me? Europeans weren&#39;t doing all sorts of heinous shit? Catholics weren&#39;t burning gnostics then getting persecuted themselves by protestantism enforced by a king who wanted divine permission to slay new pussy? Slavery wasn&#39;t being practiced? Cities weren&#39;t burned to the ground? Vikings never conquered, raped or pillaged anything? People were never beheaded in the streets?</p>

<p>The Middle East is the way it is by design. The Quran contains some heinous shit, true, but Islam is not without its wisdom or its connection to our past as a species. I&#39;m an atheist but I believe there is something &quot;more&quot;, and we are a species with amnesia have an untapped... thing. There was a flood. There was a lost civilization. Whether you agree from some of the content of the tales in scripture, that scripture is as much a link to our true past, and true potential, as the temples at Gobleki Tepe.</p>

<p>Psychedelics, as Hancock has focused on, is in my opinion the key to unlocking the &quot;light&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;gnosis&quot;, knowledge. The proverbial apple or fire. A concept that transcends all known religions and is referred to in most. I don&#39;t know what it is, but this farcical demonization campaign over a situation bred by the people who own you will help nobody attain it.</p>

<p>You need to study the history of the Middle East by each individual nation. Start with the Sykes-Picot Agreement, then with the House of Saud (Abby Martin has a very good and concise Empire Files episode on it). There is no such thing as &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot;, terrorism is a tactic and not tied to any ideology, and it is primarily cults doing it. Do you view Judaism with such wanton scorn, or do you not recall all those Zionist militias who slaughtered and raped helpless villages and even had a go at the British? (Related: Pan-Arabism). Do I even need to refer to the barbarism America has displayed? How about the antics of all those School of the Americas graduates throughout South America? Has the West never supported fascists, dictators and cults? No interest in Tibetan slavery? I hear North Korea is being &quot;hostile&quot;, how about those 30,000 US troops in their backyard who have supreme command over the entire South Korean military? Weren&#39;t they ran by a puppet dictator, then his daughter who the US knew was under the thumb of a cultist? See the leaked diplomatic cables for that one.</p>

<p>Suicide bombing is not Islamic and was not conceived by Muslims, it has no religious basis other than support from extremist radicals who only reign due to Western imperialism. The Quran forbids suicide in general, just like the Bible. Wahhabism and salafism are no different from the Westboro Baptist Church, they were just specifically weaponized, armed, trained, funded and propagated by Western elites for geostrategic purposes. Nation building has been in business for over a century. Look at photos of Kabul in the 60s and 70s before the US needed new poppy fields after getting skewered in Vietnam (My Lai? Agent Orange?). Bin Laden was always a player, not an outlier. As are virtually all of these cults, barring the lost, the brainwashed, the damaged, those with bloodlust, and otherwise people who just want to rape, burn, steal, destroy, murder and slaughter as they please.</p>

<p>With the utmost respect, please learn about these subjects as you are unfortunately lacking any real historical context and are focused on gross demonization through selective reasoning. There are much bigger stories playing out, you&#39;ve settled for the pulp. I have no love for any particularly religion, but they all hold some sort of value... derived from something much older.</p>

<p>It is timely that we have just confirmed a comet strike around 10,000BC. We have also confirmed at least one &quot;great flood&quot; that has left scars that make Niagara Falls look positively diminutive, in Washington State I believe. Look into Russell Carlson&#39;s work for that. </p>

<p>We live in exciting times. Indulge in the wonder, not hate. If you&#39;re going to hate, hate the elite sociopaths manufacturing the very conditions and situations you detest.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, I&#39;m baked.</p>

<p>I&#39;m giving you a direct link between that and <strong>Islam theology</strong>, and that behavior, and your answer is &quot;what about this groups&quot;. Of course there&#39;s horrible groups and people everywhere that claim to be from a certain religion while <em>not</em> following the religion they claim to represent. There&#39;s a clear difference between Christianity and Islam, one just have to look at their central figure Jesus and Mohhamed. Polar opposites. One saving love thy neighbor and if someone sticks you, turn the other cheek. While the other commands Muslims to conquer and kill infidels.</p>

<p>You never read the Quran either, so you have no idea what you are talking about. You are making emotional appeals, not logical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If that mercy comment were true, why was Syria being celebrated as the only truly secular state in the Middle East until the US wanted regime change? The US has actively aided ISIS in murdering Christians, as seen with those recent airstrikes. ISIS went straight for a predominately Christian town with the airbase out of commission. Secularism is actively killed off in the Middle East by the West, they do not want it there. The Middle East is being forced to tear itself apart from the inside-out. That&#39;s been the goal for a century. You&#39;re falling for it-- hook, line and sinker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think I&#39;m for the US invading countries? What are you talking about? That&#39;s military interventionism which isn&#39;t backed up Christian doctrine. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christianity has been doing forced conversions for two millenia. Still is, in the case of their &quot;pray the gay away&quot; schemes. There is extremism in all three Abrahamic religions. You and the other fools like you always run with this nonsense assumption that all Muslims across all denominations and sects all believe the same things and are all complete fundamentalists to those beliefs. You have no basis for any of this, you&#39;re writing your own fan-fiction based on what a bunch of sociopaths have fed you. I&#39;ve seen the exact same bile for years now, it&#39;s gotten old and with many Muslim friends of my own, I don&#39;t care for it. Wasn&#39;t true in 2001, isn&#39;t true now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? How is that &quot;selective quote&quot;? It&#39;s from the Hadith, any Muslim that don&#39;t follow the Hadith is considered an apostate and a heretic. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the whole Quran but I&#39;ll go over the glaring out of context sentences you posted, you sometimes literally are posting fragments of sentences to fit what you want to read. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you are doing it intentionally or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2:156 (“no compulsion in religion”)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know this one. But if it is like you say, it contradicts the whole Quran because Allah is precisely calling on a religious war against infidels, you only have to read a single chapter to know that Allah wants worship and commands his people to do continuously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>18:29 (“this is the truth from your Lord; so whoever wills, let him believe, and whoever wills, let him disbelieve”)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The full quote:</p>

<p>18.29. And say: &quot;The truth from your Lord (has come in this Qur&#39;an). &quot; Then, whoever wills (to believe), let him believe; and whoever wills (to disbelieve), let him disbelieve. Surely, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire, its billowing folds encompassing them. <strong>If they beg for water, they will be given water like molten metal that scalds their faces. How dreadful a drink, and how evil a couch to rest on!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>88:21-22 (“so remind, you are only a reminder; you are not a controller over them”).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Full quote:</p>

<p>You are not over them a controller. However, he who turns away and disbelieve. Then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4:90 (&quot;If they remove themselves from you and do not fight you and offer you peace, then Allah has not made for you a cause (for fighting) against them.&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quoting the whole text, the first part of that is :</p>

<p>Except for those who take refuge with a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty or those who come to you</p>

<p>So to add context, this refugees are the Christians and Jews that live with Muslims and accepted <em>jizya</em>, which is a tax that these people must pay, commanded by Allah, in order to exercise their religions on Muslim land otherwise they&#39;d be killed.</p>

<p>See verse 2:256:</p>

<p>&quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.&quot;</p>

<p>Also one verse before that in verse 4:89:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper. </p>

<p>Had your Lord willed, everyone on earth would have believed. Do you then force people to become believers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A shame that he contradicts it in verse 47: 3-4</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Those who disbelieve follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord... So, when you meet (in fight Jihad in Allah&#39;s Cause), those who disbelieve smite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives)... If it had been Allah&#39;s Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight), in order to test you, some with others. But those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost.&quot;</p>

<p>verse 25:52: &quot;Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness with it.&quot; </p>

<p>8:61: &quot;And if they incline to peace, then incline to it&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lmao chapter 8 is for the spoils of war. If you want to have an honest representation and read the beggining until verse 61 which is <em>after</em> war and is actually one of the most violent and messages against &quot;infidels&quot; in the whole Quran</p>

<p>verses leading up to it like :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>8:1 &quot;They ask thee (O Muhammad) of the spoils of war. Say: The spoils of war belong to Allah and the messenger, so keep your duty to Allah, and adjust the matter of your difference, and obey Allah and His messenger, if ye are (true) believers&quot;</p>

<p>8:12 When thy Lord inspired the angels, (saying): I am with you. So make those who believe stand firm. I will throw fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Then smite the necks and smite of them each finger.</p>

<p>8:14 That (is the award), so taste it, and (know) that for disbelievers is the torment of the Fire.</p>

<p>8:15 O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from 61 forward:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>8:67 It is not for any prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in the land</p>

<p>8:69 Now enjoy what ye have won, as lawful and good, and keep your duty to Allah.</p>

<p>4:128: &quot;Settlement is best&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not settlement of war for non-Muslims, that&#39;s for Muslim women in marriage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>47:35: &quot;So do not weaken and call for peace while you are superior; and Allah is with you and will never deprive you of [the reward of] your deeds&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This goes against your point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4:90: &quot;So if they remove themselves from you and do not fight you and offer you peace, then Allah has not made for you a cause [for fighting] against them&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same verse from before, this is for refugees</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Shia believe that there is no book of Hadith which is 100% authentic, and that all hadiths must be checked against the Qur’an and the established principles of Islam. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Quran commands Muslims to submit to Mohammed&#39;s decisions, which are in the Hadith, not in the Quran. The Quran tells Muslims to emulate Mohammed as a role model, Mohammed&#39;s conduct is recorded in the Hadth, not the Quran. Most Muslims are convinced that Islam&#39;s most fundamental teachings and practices comes from the Hadith and the Quran can&#39;t be understand without it. </p>

<p>Muslims try to distance themselves from the Hadith because it undermines Mohammed&#39;s God-like image and are full of indefensible recordings of their holiest prophet in our modern era.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Killing thousands, raping women, hitting women and paedophilia are not Islamic concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except Mohammed did those, Islam&#39;s most holiest prophet. And the Quran says Muslims should model themselves and imitate Mohammed. There are no Muslims that would say that Mohammed is a bad role model, many try to sanitize it because they <em>have</em> to believe it and emulate him to be a Muslim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>33:21 There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why you see many apologist trying to sanitize the atrocities that he did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Killing thousands, raping women, hitting women and paedophilia are not Islamic concepts. You can find them all over history and across nearly every religion. And what is your obsession with Allah punishing non-believers? Yahweh never did that? What about all those unbaptized children sitting in Purgatory according to the Catholic Church? The Abrahamic God has always been a vain, jealous dick irrespective of what he calls himself. Do you think most Catholics rejoice at their stillborn children not deserving eternal life and protection under the Lord just because a statistically likely paedophile didn&#39;t drip some water on its head? Again, you assume every Muslim is a fundamentalist. Many are picky, just like Christians and Jews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, Mohammed did them and Muslims follow and emulate him.
How are Christians picky? In the Christian doctrine God send his son Jesus to the earth.This is why the New Testament is the standard on Christianity, your question should be directed at Jewish people.</p>

<p>This is the thing, I understand context. Most God&#39;s will be violent at times of war though there&#39;s a difference between defending yourself and being the aggresor, Hebrews were historically persecuted and slaved. But fine, but the problem with Islam and why I see very little hope for reformation is that who was their last standard to follow is Mohammed which is the opposite of a good role model. They can try to paint him as good as possible, but the truth is in the book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Capital punishment is seen in the Bible for a variety of offenses: Murder, adultery, rape, Sabbath breaking, disobedience to parents, &quot;witchcraft&quot;, and idolatry (apostasy for all intents and purposes). Not much different from Islam. Moses murdered a man and hid his corpse after making sure the coast was clear, but received no punishment. Truly chosen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christians don&#39;t model themselves after Moses or consider him infalible. The only model and infallible man who ever lived was Jesus Christ since he was God on human form. Like it or not, this is the doctrine. Jesus is the opposite of Mohammed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how I got here but as a person that&#39;s from a country filled with muslims and shariah law...you are fucking wrong.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one who&#39;s ignorant of history. Islam IS inherently fundamentalist because it makes the claim of being perfect and being the last and only true religion(with muhammad the child raper as their prophet). You should read some of those scriptures you claim others haven&#39;t read because your ignorance is showing.</p>

<p>You also confuse ordinary muslims with the theology and religion that is Islam. The problem is ISLAM and those who follow it as fundamentalists, the problem isn&#39;t some ignorant dave chappelle or muhammad ali(what the fuck do they know about oppression in muslim countries...never seen them speak up about that...for them becoming a muslim is a contrarian identity issue, nothing more) becoming muslim, the problem is the very religion itself. The very book itself. The very &quot;prophet&quot; itself.</p>

<p>Seriously, go read the quran.</p>

<p>Excuse me? Wanting to be different is not &quot;contrarian&quot;. Wanting to OPPOSE is contrarian. If you can&#39;t fucking understand why someone such as muhammad ali wanted to oppose nearly every aspect of white America at that time then I have no words for you.</p>

<p>Very much on the contrary. I&#39;m not remotely politically correct and I face the facts and reality. Whereas you, passionately hate Israel and therefore think you found a natural ally in Islam. You don&#39;t know shit about Islam. You&#39;ve never lived in a state where shariah is law. You don&#39;t know shit. Your opinion is irrelevant to anyone with a smidgen of experience living in states run by shariah/muslim majority. Don&#39;t insult my intelligence.</p>

<p>Because to assume the state of Iran as it is now is completely because of America and not because of internal turmoil and power struggles is just ignorant to the core.

Yes, a couple of middle eastern countries are centred around religion. Many less than there were 30years ago. If it is Syria, you are referring, regardless of what you&#39;ve been told, it is/was before it got the shit blown out of it a secular country, progressing towards the west at a massive rate.<br/>
The countries left in the past are no different in terms of religion than the western countries whose strong Catholic beliefs hindered expression and freedoms of all but mostly women right up until recently, with the the churches clutching to power of a few remaining issues e.g. Abortion and gay rights.<br/>
If us in the west, with all our freedom, liberty and democracy are still having trouble, how can we expect those couple of middle eastern countries to change overnight.<br/>
What you and others fail to realise is that the populations of those countries, (which have effectively been controlled like dictatorship&#39;s) are only recently becoming enlightened. Treating those people as the problem will not help the issue.<br/>
If you were to start demonising me and my family, bombing where we live, treating us like shit, what do you think is going to happen? We would obviously become more insular. If the persecutions persist, my kids and others with my beliefs in other parts of the world will, out of anger retaliate as they are being demonized, exactly like what is of during now.</p>

The simple fact that you can create an absolutely false narrative about me and are unable to remember the very last comment you&#39;ve made nor carry on a concise argument from them, portrays you as the brainwashed one, scrambling for anything to justify <strong>your feelings</strong>.

<p>I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but just wow. I will respond even though I fear the worst of what and who you are. </p>

<p>No, not all Jews are terrorists that work for the Zionist militias. I think most Jews aren&#39;t actually &quot;jews&quot; in the first place, but beyond that I think most Jews have no fucking idea what is going on behind the scenes. </p>

<p>Einstein...yes the pacifist that wrote letters to Truman helping him to &quot;understand&quot;, accept, and allow the creation of the first nuclear weapon. </p>

<p>Einstein was the first famous Autistic person right? Very mentally challenged early on, trouble communicating, horrible at math...yet after working at a patent office and marrying his cousin, he suddenly became a fucking god damn genius. No questions here...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think all religion is control system based. There are plenty of wise parables that when understood will lead to a better life and a better world in general. That doesn&#39;t mean that the Abrahamic religious system isn&#39;t a bunch of bullshit. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out, although I guess apparently it does when distinguishing between atheism and spiritualism. It&#39;s like our world is stuck in a fight between two groups of mentally impaired people. One group claims that religion is for idiots, while at the same time clinging to the Scientism belief system. The other claims that religion is the truth, and for the most part disregards Science as a whole. </p>

<p>Science and Spiritualism are actually a perfect match...yet are never even in the same sentence due to the stigma that has been purposely created to keep people divided. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just some points:</p>

<p>-The &#39;surge&#39; of Islamic terrorist attacks follows a very clear correlation to when Western countries started to invade the Middle East in recent times.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Although only 20% of Muslims <strong>on the entire planet</strong> are Arabs and the majority of all muslims are from Indonesia/South China Sea area, we in Europe are seeing attacks from the <strong>oil-rich</strong> Arabic Middle Eastern countries.</p></li>
<li><p>Iraq has the second highest oil reserves on the planet and Libya has the highest on the continent of Africa. </p></li>
<li><p>Between 1980 and 2005, <a href="http://www.loonwatch.com/2010/01/not-all-terrorists-are-muslims/">6%</a> of terrorist attacks on US soil were by Islamists according to <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005#terror_05sum">FBI figures.</a></p></li>
<li><p>See also, <a href="http://www.loonwatch.com/2010/01/terrorism-in-europe/">Europe</a></p></li>
<li><p>Christianity went through similar shit to this but there wasn&#39;t a superior culture keeping it fom developing as is the case with Islam.  Nobody is involved in the Middle East because they want to bring democracy and help modernise it etc.  They&#39;re there to ransack it.  Iran and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">1953 coup</a> is a classic example.  Why is Iran in the dark ages?  Well, we helped to kick it back into there as it started to poke it&#39;s head out a bit.  Libya had the highest HDI rating in Africa till we invaded.  I believe that one of the very first places the democracy loving rebels lol destroyed was the university.</p></li>
<li><p>Islam should be dealt with at the root - As a religion and therefore an archaic time-wasting distraction.  It&#39;s hard to set an exmple of moving into the modern era when we still have the Arch Bishop of Cantebury all dressed up in weird robes, doing weird rituals and talking about a magic, bearded, invisible man in the sky.  As long as sections of our own society insist on holding onto this shit it&#39;s going to be very difficult to pull the others away from theirs.</p></li>

<p>Neocons and zionists have a state whose foreign policy depends on their constant vilification. Also, Israel controls one of the important holy mosques(Al-aqsa mosque).</p>

<p>The Saudi family is pro-Israel, the population isn&#39;t and this goes for the rest of the Arab world. In fact the US views its Arab allies as frenemies for this very reason. Pro-american/Israeli governments with populations who have negative view of Israel and the western world in general.</p>

<p>The war on terror is multi-generational. It&#39;s not only about taking your rights in the western world only. The saudis are copy pasting the western world(see agenda 2030 for saudi arabia). See also Dubai how it&#39;s becoming a &quot;smart&quot; city. </p>

<p>The rich muslim nations are going on the same track, but its taking slower because these countries are not swallowing the liberalism so quickly. Social engineering takes a while.</p>

<p>Then keep in mind that the bloodlines of almost all modern day European royal families, and those which ceased to exist at various points in the 20th century, were of Germanic origin.</p>

<p>Germany as we know it today was, for CENTURIES, a mish mash of principalities and city-state nations. A united nation of Germanic people was a feared notion dating back to the 1500s and...as time goes on and documents leaks + document disclosures force us to re-examine and re-analyze western history from ~1400 onward, a narrative of a battle between other worldly forces of good and evil (light and dark; angels and demons; Extraterrestrials good and bad) starts to become a plausible possibility borne out of historic record.</p>

<p>I&#39;d encourage you to do three things:</p>

<p>1.) Read Revelation as if the events are to occur over centuries...with some having already occurred, some occurring now, and some which have yet to occur. Keep in mind that &quot;Apocalypse&quot; is a Greek word which means &quot;to reveal&quot;. I think you&#39;ll find that the Apocalypse was never meant to be interpreted as the end of the world or the end of time...it&#39;s meant to be the end of one era for humanity and the beginning of the next. The era in which the truth about &quot;up there&quot; and who&#39;s been watching over us is revealed.</p>

<p>2.) Read John Milton&#39;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; or at least read the Wiki so you can understand why he wrote it; and</p>

<p>3.) <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rubens-H%C3%B6llensturz.jpg">Take a look at this painting...every part of it.</a>. It&#39;s titled Hollenstürz and was painted in 1619 by a man named Peter Paul Reubens. If nothing odd stands out to you, focus in on the bottom left quadrant and find the figure / being kind of set back from the foreground. This is just one of many paintings like this from the medieval and Renaissance era.</p>

<p>....clues are ample in art of the past if you know what to look for. 👍</p>

<p>Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can&#39;t help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.</p>

<p>Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of &quot;God&quot;/existence as well in session 13

    <div class="md"><p>I have known this for ages. Abraham had 2 sons, Isaac and Ishmael. Isaac is the forefather of Judaism, Ishmael is the forefather of Islam. God told Abraham to sacrifice his chosen son but he couldnt go through with it. So in the end we do not know who the chosen son was (either Islam or Judaism). Both religions contradict each others existance. You only have to look and see what is happening in Palestine to know how much they hate each other. The Balfour declaration proves that both USA and England fight for Judaism. All the hate of the Muslim religion stems from both these countries and who controls the media (and this includes an immense number of False flags attacks by those in charge)</p>

2) Ibn Sina [Avicenna]</p>

<p>Random reading as a med student, I&#39;ve come across:

4) Ibn al-Nafis [first to describe pulmonary circulation of the blood].</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Shia believe that there is no book of Hadith which is 100% authentic, and that all hadiths must be checked against the Qur’an and the established principles of Islam. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Quran commands Muslims to submit to Mohammed&#39;s decisions, which are in the Hadith, not in the Quran. The Quran tells Muslims to emulate Mohammed as a role model, Mohammed&#39;s conduct is recorded in the Hadth, not the Quran. Most Muslims are convinced that Islam&#39;s most fundamental teachings and practices comes from the Hadith and the Quran can&#39;t be understand without it. </p>

<p>Muslims try to distance themselves from the Hadith because it undermines Mohammed&#39;s God-like image and are full of indefensible recordings of their holiest prophet in our modern era.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Killing thousands, raping women, hitting women and paedophilia are not Islamic concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except Mohammed did those, Islam&#39;s most holiest prophet. And the Quran says Muslims should model themselves and imitate Mohammed. There are no Muslims that would say that Mohammed is a bad role model, many try to sanitize it because they <em>have</em> to believe it and emulate him to be a Muslim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>33:21 There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why you see many apologist trying to sanitize the atrocities that he did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Killing thousands, raping women, hitting women and paedophilia are not Islamic concepts. You can find them all over history and across nearly every religion. And what is your obsession with Allah punishing non-believers? Yahweh never did that? What about all those unbaptized children sitting in Purgatory according to the Catholic Church? The Abrahamic God has always been a vain, jealous dick irrespective of what he calls himself. Do you think most Catholics rejoice at their stillborn children not deserving eternal life and protection under the Lord just because a statistically likely paedophile didn&#39;t drip some water on its head? Again, you assume every Muslim is a fundamentalist. Many are picky, just like Christians and Jews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, Mohammed did them and Muslims follow and emulate him.
How are Christians picky? In the Christian doctrine God send his son Jesus to the earth.This is why the New Testament is the standard on Christianity, your question should be directed at Jewish people.</p>

<p>This is the thing, I understand context. Most God&#39;s will be violent at times of war though there&#39;s a difference between defending yourself and being the aggresor, Hebrews were historically persecuted and slaved. But fine, but the problem with Islam and why I see very little hope for reformation is that who was their last standard to follow is Mohammed which is the opposite of a good role model. They can try to paint him as good as possible, but the truth is in the book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Capital punishment is seen in the Bible for a variety of offenses: Murder, adultery, rape, Sabbath breaking, disobedience to parents, &quot;witchcraft&quot;, and idolatry (apostasy for all intents and purposes). Not much different from Islam. Moses murdered a man and hid his corpse after making sure the coast was clear, but received no punishment. Truly chosen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christians don&#39;t model themselves after Moses or consider him infalible. The only model and infallible man who ever lived was Jesus Christ since he was God on human form. Like it or not, this is the doctrine. Jesus is the opposite of Mohammed.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m serious this is my last post, I&#39;m spending way too much time in this.</p>
