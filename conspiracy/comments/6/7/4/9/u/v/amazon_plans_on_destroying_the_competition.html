       There have already been thousands of retail stores that have closed due to Amazon.com. How are retail stores supposed to compete with low prices and shipping (usually free if you order enough) from an online store that has nearly everything? Day by day Amazon is increasing the variety of items it has in different departments and soon will probably be the only place to shop retail. Once enough retail stores have gone out of business, amazon will be able to increase their prices and do w/e they want.

       well hopefully with all that additional business they will be able, and do lower their prices or at least keep them steady :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and opportunity to do the right thing, because online shopping is much more efficient, enjoyable,  and a step in the right direction imo. And retail has been ripping off customers for as long as I can remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if prices do go up, and hope its only because their employees are treated better than a lot of them are in retail. And there could be other reasons for price increases besides greed. Really a lot to consider...

       Yep it's not necessarily a bad thing, however that all depends on what Amazon decides to do. If they decide to raise their prices but treat their employees better then I'll support them. Unfortunately I dont think thats what is going to happen.

       yeah. Personally i like the idea of a one stop shop, and places like amazon make it relatively easy for producers of goods to get their goods to market, so hopefully the transition away from the traditional retail market will go smoothly.

       They will start to become more predatory to merchants once they get more leverage over the market. I.e. banning merchants, giving their items the buy box over other merchants, hiding the link to see other buyers, putting their items at the top of search results etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       They are already doing some of these things and it will only get worse.

       Well as i said in my edit of the previous comment, other chains have to get it together and start competing with amazon. There is no reason why amazon should have a monopoly on their business model. There is still time for other retailers/investors to give amazon a run for their money, which should curb the amount of shady practices being implemented.

       Amazon treats their employees terribly. Their warehouses have to have ambulances parked outside permanently because they force the workers to do hard physical labor in 100+ degree temps without air conditioning.

       The start up cost will be high and if Amazon does face competition they can always just lower their prices against the competitor in that particular product area.

       Millions of drones constantly in the sky, somehow not bashing into each other, somehow making sure it gets the right drop every time.   That's too much clutter and upkeep.

       im sure the MIC will chip in to help develop the software for these drones. Then the CIA / NSA can add cameras to them so boom. Deliver things to people and at same time free chance to get upclose video recording / photos of their rooms etc

       I dont know...i just dont see it happening. Don't think the tech is anywhere close enough for drone delivery to be safe or efficient. And i really haven't ruled out the idea that Amazon just suggested it to fuck with their competition.

       Yeah, i actually power watched all the black mirror episodes available on netflix the other day. Really enjoyed it. Like a techno twilight zones or something. Cant wait for new episodes. s2e4 White Christmas was my favorite so far i think. Not sure season 3 is available yet on netflicks....didnt see it if it was, will keep an eye out for that episode you mention though.

       It sounds like a complicated problem, but keep in mind that we already have self driving cars and missiles that can target a cave from the other side of the world. We would just need to combine the two algorithms and we can have a reliable drone "highway" in the sky.

       Walmart is trying desperately to catch up to Amazon in the online market place, even going so far to offer free shipping on orders over $35 thus forcing Amazon to back down off their $50 dollar orders for free shipping down to 35 to match Walmart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who will win? well.. Walmart has the infrastructure and storefronts, if Walmart can get it together, they'll end up being top dog.

       Walmart also has free store to store shipping now, so if your local shitty Walmart doesn't have what you need/want, chances are the exotic shitty Walmart 20 miles from where you live has it.

       I thought Amazon originally had the $35 free shipping and they upped it to $50? I could be wrong.

       You're right, and also Amazon originally did have the 35 free shipping, and then I think for prime members it was 2 day for 25? but then Amazon got greedy or thought they could so they bumped up the shipping to 50 for free, that went on till walmart started offering 35$ free shipping thus getting amazon to back down to $35 again lol

       Yup you do. But if you are ordering from amazon and aren't a prime member, you probably aren' the target consumer by amazon. I also get same day delivery of groceries with prime fresh and 1 hour delivers of convenience items with prime now. I know I sound like a poster boy for amazon, but for a membership cost of 10$ a month, it's hard to beat the convenience of ordering from amazon services.

       They're already kind of killing it without it. There are like three Amazon warehouses within 100 or so miles of where I live, and you can get a lot of stuff same day, and thats free with prime membership bullshit. It's pretty crazy when you step back and see how they evolved from a bookstore.

       You can actually order something from amazon and get it within like 2 hours. And as the number of distribution centers grow, that number and the amount of items available for that fast of delivery will increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember the Christmas before last, my sister had got my mom a blue ray disc, but my mom didn't have a blue ray player, so my sister ordered one on amazon, and it was there, on Christmas day, in a few hours. Ordered, shipped and delivered, on Christmas day, in a span of a few hours....that's a pretty convenient service that the masses will gobble up as it grows.

        /u/Longtimelurker859

       is saying, amazon will be hard pressed to replace ALL retail. The biggest hurdle online retailers have is that case is still king. And while visa gift cards to exists, if you are running out to convert cash to a medium that can be used to purchase online you probably will just go some where to buy with cash. I live where I get 2 hours delivers with amazon, but mind you it's a limited inventory, so if you are looking for a specialty item you either will end up waiting for it to be delivered or go find it at a store around you.

      <p>
       And to be clear, i don't think the death of retail will happen overnight, or entirely, but i do think it will reach its bare minimum within this century...possibly half century.

       Unless we blow ourselves up and have to start from scratch of course...

       There are many products not conducive to purchasing online. If I want to buy guitars, or tools, or lumber, or food from the grocery store, I need to pick it up and inspect it. I don't trust Amazon to do that, and I'm sure many others do as well.

       True. But people can't just manufacture a guitar. The industry is extremely conservative and traditionalist, and almost all companies refuse to mass manufacture beyond what they can do with wood, like CNC milling. People pay thousands of dollars for Gibsons manufactured with historical methods, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       The few companies that have tried making guitars of easier/quicker to manufacture guitars, like Switch Vibracell, have almost all completely failed. I don't foresee retail stores for musical instruments like guitars, drums, brass, or other string instruments failing any time soon, or at least until sufficiently advanced rapid manufacturing technology gets here.

       While Amazon is worth slightly more at $250 billion, they don't nearly have the infrastructure in place that Walmart already does.

       Amazon is a CIA front, so the joke is on you. Not that I have any love for Walmart or other giant corporations, but let's not pretend Amazon is benevolent retailer that "won" through fair business practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't even a conspiracy theory. According to the official narrative, Amazon makes it profit of its hosting business,
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       retail. It hosts everything from Netflix and Reddit (propaganda) to the CIA's actual servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also owns CIA mouthpiece
       <em>
        The Washington Post
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You're being played if you believe Amazon is any more ethical or different than any more corporation. If anything, they're worse, but they're better at hiding it because "free shipping."

       The "Amazon is killing retail" narrative that teevee has been spewing is getting old. Read Amazon's financials and you'll quickly realize that their annual revenue growth doesn't come close to accounting for the revenue losses experienced by the brick/mortar retailers. Wall Street doesn't want you to realize that the store closures and bankruptcies are due to the significant spending cuts by the American consumer. God forbid that  Main Street actually get out in front of a market crash and not have their 401(k)s incinerated.

       Well as i said in my edit of the previous comment, other chains have to get it together and start competing with amazon. There is no reason why amazon should have a monopoly on their business model. There is still time for other retailers/investors to give amazon a run for their money, which should curb the amount of shady practices being implemented.

       Walmart also has free store to store shipping now, so if your local shitty Walmart doesn't have what you need/want, chances are the exotic shitty Walmart 20 miles from where you live has it.

      <p>
       I thought Amazon originally had the $35 free shipping and they upped it to $50? I could be wrong.
