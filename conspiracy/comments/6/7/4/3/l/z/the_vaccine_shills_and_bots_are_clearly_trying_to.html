       The "secret knowledge" is the fact that since polio supposedly disappeared
       <a href="http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/2011/11/17/smoke-mirrors-and-the-disappearance-of-polio/">
        acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) has jumped to 100,000 cases per year and that prior to 1954 AFP would have been diagnosed as polio?
       </a>
       And that doesn't even count all of the other diseases that would have been diagnosed as polio prior to 1954.

       Fails to mention how many of those cases were a result not being vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Virus and bacteria change, that's the nature of infection.  Being vaccinated for one strain doesn't make you immune to a different strain, or the same one that has undergone a mutation.

       Self imposed elitism? Fuck off? Those don't sound like phrases someone with an open mind would say. This subject rocks people to their foundations and is very hard to confront.
      </p>
      <p>
       Denying truth is often much easier to cope with because we implicate ourselves. Let go of your guilt and just try to open yourself to a new perspective and new data and new information. Science changes all the time, everyone should be open to this idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are/were told vaccines are/were safe. We now have new information that vaccines contain dangerous chemicals and probably are creating much more harm than good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please at least watch the series through before you critique it. It's disrespectful to the makers. They literally risk their lives to make this information public. For information you people want to dismiss before even watching it. It's a disgrace to science itself.

       Being open to change is a critical necessity in science, but so is defending your work.  I've had partners in my lab spend decades of their life, their entire careers, working on vaccine research.  People far smarter than I am.  They're open to change, but it's also their responsibility to defend their research.

       I've been more than "told" vaccines are good.  I've had first hand research and experience.  I've done the science, I spend the late nights in the lab.  I've been the pipette bitch.  Don't tell me I only believe this because it's what I've been told.
      </p>
      <p>
       YES, they're may be better/less harmful ways to produce vaccines, but to state they don't work is pure ignorance.

       This is what happened to the polio epidemic...

       Vaccines had nothing to do with the elimination of polio or smallpox.

       Mainstream lie. Pay particular attention to the Nurse Kenney smear campaign in that video...Kenney was the only one who was actually helping polio victims, by curing them, and the mainstream medical community did their best to make her look like a dolt...because she made them look incompetent by actually doing something about their polio.

       Convincing an antivaxer that there are many dangers with the vaccine schedule as well as the vaccines themselves is like trying to convert a religious fanatic to atheism. I personally know 2 nurses that suffered with Guillain–Barré syndrome after a flu shot and still get the shot. Needless to say they are always shocked when they get the flu every year anyway lol.

       Agreed, that shills and bots are all over this. Remember shills often try to attack you on a personal basis, to get an emotional response. I already see, that you are being personally attacked for this post.

       IMO reddit is getting manipulated on an administrative level. A lot of accounts that might seem 'organic' might not be what they seem. Imagine what could be done with an elaborated chatbot-like AI.

       Denying truth is often much easier to cope with because we implicate ourselves. Let go of your guilt and just try to open yourself to a new perspective and new data and new information. Science changes all the time, everyone should be open to this idea.

       We are/were told vaccines are/were safe. We now have new information that vaccines contain dangerous chemicals and probably are creating much more harm than good.

       Please at least watch the series through before you critique it. It's disrespectful to the makers. They literally risk their lives to make this information public. For information you people want to dismiss before even watching it. It's a disgrace to science itself.

       I've done the research.  In my opinion, vaccines are not safe as manufactured or administered in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are coming around to the issues concerning vaccines.  That is why you're seeing increased threads on vaccines.

       I haven't commented in a vaccine thread other than this one.  If you want inoculated, go head.  My family will pass.

       The "secret knowledge" is the fact that since polio supposedly disappeared
       <a href="http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/2011/11/17/smoke-mirrors-and-the-disappearance-of-polio/">
        acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) has jumped to 100,000 cases per year and that prior to 1954 AFP would have been diagnosed as polio?
