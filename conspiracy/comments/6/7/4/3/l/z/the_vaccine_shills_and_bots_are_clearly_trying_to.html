<p>Being open to change is a critical necessity in science, but so is defending your work.  I&#39;ve had partners in my lab spend decades of their life, their entire careers, working on vaccine research.  People far smarter than I am.  They&#39;re open to change, but it&#39;s also their responsibility to defend their research.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been more than &quot;told&quot; vaccines are good.  I&#39;ve had first hand research and experience.  I&#39;ve done the science, I spend the late nights in the lab.  I&#39;ve been the pipette bitch.  Don&#39;t tell me I only believe this because it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told. </p>

<p>YES, they&#39;re may be better/less harmful ways to produce vaccines, but to state they don&#39;t work is pure ignorance.</p>

Pay particular attention to the Nurse Kenney smear campaign in that video...Kenney was the only one who was actually helping polio victims, by curing them, and the mainstream medical community did their best to make her look like a dolt...because she made them look incompetent by actually doing something about their polio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Self imposed elitism? Fuck off? Those don&#39;t sound like phrases someone with an open mind would say. This subject rocks people to their foundations and is very hard to confront. </p>

<p>Denying truth is often much easier to cope with because we implicate ourselves. Let go of your guilt and just try to open yourself to a new perspective and new data and new information. Science changes all the time, everyone should be open to this idea. </p>

<p>We are/were told vaccines are/were safe. We now have new information that vaccines contain dangerous chemicals and probably are creating much more harm than good. </p>

<p>Please at least watch the series through before you critique it. It&#39;s disrespectful to the makers. They literally risk their lives to make this information public. For information you people want to dismiss before even watching it. It&#39;s a disgrace to science itself. </p>
