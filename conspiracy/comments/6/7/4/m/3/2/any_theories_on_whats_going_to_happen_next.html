<p>People aren&#39;t &quot;waking up&quot;.  It only seems that way because this sub is an echo chamber at times.</p>

<p>No one outside this sub and a few other niche places believes in a satanic pedophile elitist cult among the politicians, and frankly reddit super sleuths aren&#39;t going to be cracking shit any time soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wild speculation incoming. The world is shifting back to a multipolar power structure. The usa will cede korea and the middle east to china. In return we will expect isreal to be expanded into greater Israel. China and Israel will cooperate and install a brutal regime ruling over the ME Arabs (think Palestine). This will be doomed to fail but will work for a time. The Arabs may simply be genocided.</p>

<p>Russia&#39;s power remains largely the same but is formalized to include the Balkans and the stans north of Afghanistan. China and Russia will end Asian opium production. South Asia and Japan and Australia will begin to cooperate more as China&#39;s power grows.</p>

<p>The us will contract our circle of influence overseas but dramatically expand our power in south America including seizing Venezuela&#39;s oil. The American continent will move towards self sufficiency as the global population problem worsens. </p>

<p>Mainland Europe remains a lapdog to England as it becomes more and more destabilized by immigration. Eastern Europe will move closer to Russian influence as us power in Europe diminishes.</p>

<p>Africa will be stripped of its resources and depopulated.</p>

<p>The &quot;hot war&quot; part of wwiii starts when the population crisis comes to a head. After the complete strip mining of Africa China depopulates south Asia (mainly India Pakistan and the Philippines) to seize those resources. There is potential for nuclear war. Tough to see past that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what&#39;s NOT going to happen.</p>

<p>Everyone realizing their political bullshit is not a team sport. That we all are stressing every day for mostly the same reasons. That we as a collective conscience should stop being angry idiots fighting for a side, blinded by common sense that is right in front of them.</p>

<p>That somehow this huge gap between radical view points in the grand scheme of life is so obviously detremental​ and easily avoidable if everyone that claimed to be a &#39;good person&#39; just let some compassion in for their fellow man. I&#39;m not a preacher or some hippy. I just have no idea why people can&#39;t have a rational adult discussion with one another while avoiding seriously harmful personal attacks on another&#39;s​ character like it doesn&#39;t affect them. The term &#39;troll&#39; is so fucking dumb yet is engrained in society now. It basically means it&#39;s ok to trigger people and be an asshole. To create hated for someone you don&#39;t have a fucking clue about. Everyone acts like they are the good guy and in the same sentence they add in that OTHER people are *insert terrible deeply personal accusation about a person because they read a sentence and it&#39;s different from what they believe in so of course they are wrong&#39;.</p>

<p>So the future will just be more divide more hate more of the things everyone preaches they are against while they are doing the same. fucking. thing. As a whole, the society of developed countries at least could be coming together and proving how much we have evolved. But instead, everyone is letting the politics they claim to dispise rule freedom of individual thought. The past couple years have made me go from a happy goofy guy, to a cynical depressed hermit. I just look at Facebook for 2 seconds and want to vomit. Even people that are &#39;red pilled free thinkers&#39; have alot of bias toward anything that makes them have to engage in good rebuttals to their discussion. It&#39;s just people staunchly kicking their feet and yelling at a brick wall while nothing is accomplished. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s the biggest downfall in my opinion. It&#39;s all of us, it&#39;s the absolute disappearance of heartfelt compassion that allows good debates between us &#39;regular&#39; people that live out all the shittiness that happens in some statistic you see on a spreadsheet. Out of a discussion with both sides trying to understand comes rational thinking, connection and maybe common ground that would spread and be a thing that could stop this fucking soapbox self promoting &#39;gotta get more acceptence in a mouse click!&#39; culture that is a cesspool. </p>

<p>All of us. And I am right there with you guys are just small examples of a system that has infected every inch of society. So fuck it. Stay hateful and watch the world be destroyed by fucking normal people that I bet alot of us would think they are insane but turned out untouchable because they accumulated a man-made product that says &#39;even though I&#39;m a frail 70 year old you could probably kill by patting on the back to hard, somehow people are still so disillusioned they just let me do my thing.. oh sometimes they blog about how I&#39;m Satan but it&#39;s not like anything would happen besides a little ad revenue for them.&#39;</p>

<p>OH LOOK AT THIS BUTTHURT LIBTARD THAT WANTS PEACE! 
OH LOOK AT THIS ALT RIGHT CONSPIRACY NUT THAT THINKS <em>IM</em> THE PROBLEM!</p>

<p>Just shut the fuck up already.</p>

<p>TL;DR - I&#39;ve lost my mind mostly lurking while everyone yells over each other about how the world&#39;s turning to shit when they don&#39;t realize they are a major reason why shit is the way it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO: Trump&#39;s design was to divide America, and to be the scapegoat for the inevitable financial collapse and next major war. The USD&#39;s value can&#39;t get much worse, our debt is so bad we can barely make the interest payments, our paper money is backed by nothing; things are out of hand and need to be reset. I think the government will shut down, people&#39;s EBT cards will stop working, the power grids will go down, there will be a big false flag in America...all of this in no particular order. I think things will stabilize after that until later this year</p>
