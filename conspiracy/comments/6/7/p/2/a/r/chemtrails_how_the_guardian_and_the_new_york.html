        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When wondering about the chemtrail-phenomenon and what possible purposes it may serve (releasing substances on the public, changing the climate, altering the atmospheric stability or maybe all of those and more together) it seems a bit unlikely that TPTB would poison the air they and their children have to breath themselves. </p>

<p>Apparently it is no secret though and has already been reported more than 20 years ago, that the air above the U.S. and GB has been poisoned for decades in secret military trials. According to the Guardian and the New York Times millions of Americans and Britons have been used as human guinea pigs, to test certain chemicals, micro organisms and fungi.</p>

<p>The information that has partially been made available due to the freedom of information act (for the U.S. data) only describes the military activity until 1979, but why would they just stop their experiments there, what did they actually find out in their trials and how did they continue after 1979? </p>

<p>This is only the information that has been made available for the public, it is quite possible that they have sprayed more substances over more locations. </p>

<p>Millions of people being sprayed with chemicals and micro-organisms, all of this reported by the MSM, why has this not become a big scandal? </p>

<p>Maybe because the reports are referencing to trials, that had been conducted  several decades before the articles appeared. To long ago to be relevant? Or maybe the MSM just didn&#39;t repeat the story often enough. If the MSM want a story to gain traction, they usually are echoing it again and again and again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Much of Britain was exposed to bacteria sprayed in secret trials</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public.</p>

<p>A government report just released provides for the first time a comprehensive official history of Britain&#39;s biological weapons trials between 1940 and 1979.</p>

<p>Many of these tests involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population without the public being told.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Army released an organism called Aspergillus fumigatus at the Norfolk Naval Supply Center because most workers were black; for some reason, the testers imagined an enemy might target the blacks at military bases. &quot;Since Negroes are more susceptible to coccidioides than are whites,&quot; a report said, &quot;this fungus disease was simulated by using Aspergillus fumigatus.&quot; Aspergillus, further, was known to cause lethal infections.</p>

<p>In 1949, and for 20 years afterward, the Army released bacteria among millions of unsuspecting people. At hearings in 1977, Pentagon witnesses acknowledged that bacteria and chemical particles were sprayed over San Francisco, St. Louis, Minneapolis and 236 other populated locations.</p>
