<p>The people of this community need a refresher course in propaganda and disinformation. As long as people keep eating right out of hand of the powers that be, they will continue to use this community and others like it on Reddit and elsewhere to spread false intel and Agitprop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I disagree. The bitchy comments on this thread are proof of that.</p>

<p>&quot;Eye on the TV</p>

<p>&#39;cause tragedy thrills me</p>

<p>Whatever flavour</p>

<p>It happens to be like;</p>

<p>Killed by the husband</p>

<p>Drowned by the ocean</p>

<p>Shot by his own son</p>

<p>She used the poison in his tea</p>

<p>And kissed him goodbye</p>

<p>That&#39;s my kind of story</p>

<p>It&#39;s no fun &#39;til someone dies</p>

<p>Don&#39;t look at me like</p>

<p>I am a monster</p>

<p>Frown out your one face</p>

<p>But with the other</p>

<p>Stare like a junkie</p>

<p>Into the TV</p>

<p>Stare like a zombie</p>

<p>While the mother</p>

<p>Holds her child</p>

<p>Watches him die</p>

<p>Hands to the sky crying</p>

<p>Why, oh why?</p>

<p>&#39;cause I need to watch things die</p>

<p>From a distance</p>

<p>Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies</p>

<p>You all need it too, don&#39;t lie</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we just admit it?</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we just admit it?</p>

<p>We won&#39;t give pause until the blood is flowing</p>

<p>Neither the brave nor bold</p>

<p>The writers of stories sold</p>

<p>We won&#39;t give pause until the blood is flowing</p>

<p>I need to watch things die</p>

<p>From a good safe distance</p>

<p>Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies</p>

<p>You all feel the same so</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we just admit it?</p>

<p>Blood like rain come down</p>

<p>Drawn on grave and ground</p>

<p>Part vampire</p>

<p>Part warrior</p>

<p>Carnivore and voyeur</p>

<p>Stare at the transmittal</p>

<p>Sing to the death rattle</p>

<p>La, la, la, la, la, la, la-lie</p>

<p>Credulous at best, your desire to believe in angels in the hearts of men.</p>

<p>Pull your head on out your hippy haze and give a listen.</p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t have to say it all again.</p>

<p>The universe is hostile. so Impersonal. devour to survive.</p>

<p>So it is. So it&#39;s always been.</p>

<p>We all feed on tragedy</p>

<p>It&#39;s like blood to a vampire</p>

<p>Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies</p>

<p>Much better you than I&quot;</p>

<p>Now in no way am I saying we are scientists but theoretically it is the same thing.

<p>Yes. They are.</p>

<p>No. This is a sub where <em>some</em> people get together to enter into discourse and arrive at Truths about historical and current events. The rest come here to spread disinformation, propaganda, wildly speculating about whatever paranoid fantasy fuels their worldview today.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Indeed, it is no way scientific. Also, you have the scientific process wrong. You make an observation, you form a hypothesis, you test your <em>hypothesis</em>, based on your results you change your hypothesis and continue the process, or accept your hypothesis and validate it by testing it again. You folks don&#39;t make observations and then form hypotheses, you are fed bullshit and go crazy and speculate wildly about it until the next thing comes along.</p>

<p>And no, most here live off of these theories because these theories give them meaning. They aren&#39;t actually interested in finding Truth, they are interested in using this community to further whatever ideology they lean closest to.</p>

<p>Note, this is not a criticism of the entire community, but quite a few of them are this way. The proof of that is the response to this thread and other threads by people who simply criticize one thing and then are attacked mercilessly for not parroting the popular view. This community thinks that it is evolved? It&#39;s just like all the rest. </p>

<p>I respect your argument regarding that &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; people are perpetuating disinformation, propaganda, and or paranoid fanatical viewpoints based on which ever way the lean towards. Albeit true, it can&#39;t take away from those that do theorize from a point of intellectualism and through patterns they see being formed from an objective point of view.</p>

<p>As for me getting my scientific process incorrect; I reiterate the fact that I am NOT a scientist and had the components of the scientific theory just incorrectly placed. Points for effort? Haha. </p>

<p>Anyone that lives vicariously through Karma points and theories that are either up voted or down voted do need some help in some area or another. Then again, people make a living based on conspiracy theories and perpetuating disinformation etc. </p>

<p>I digress, basically as long as you aren&#39;t attacking an entire community based on the few; then I can respectfully agree with your initial argument. The criticism you present should be taken in and we as frequenters of this sub should be reasonable and rational enough to take it in and then form a conspiracy on why you would say the things you do instead of berating you with verbal assaults.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time bruh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love this community, I am not attacking it. I am not attacking anyone. I am criticizing people who are a part of this community that think &quot;questioning things more&quot; means believing every batshit insane thing until it&#39;s proven not true, or it doesn&#39;t happen. These people are poison to this community, they are the result of failed education systems that pump out people that lack critical thinking skills, which is in my opinion part of the overall conspiracy. You have a population of people who&#39;ll believe anything, like say the Earth being flat, then you can get them to believe and do anything you want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I completely agree. </p>

<p>Though as a non flat earther I have to remain as open I can about their theories and the like. Some people are much more gullible and susceptible to disinformation and propaganda than others. That is a sad yet simple truth; who am I to tell them they are wrong. I will, but if they don&#39;t take well to it that is their own prerogative. I can walk away knowing I said it and be at peace.</p>

<p>I am beginning to understand your view much more in that it isn&#39;t the entire sub with the issue; its all of the over emotional connections and ties people make to the theories that should have remained entirely objective. This injects the poison and also kills the openness to criticism. </p>

<p>I see your point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Semi colons are used to link two independent clauses that are closely aligned in thought. In the sentence you&#39;re referencing, both clauses are independent; they could stand on their own as individual sentences. You should brush up on this a bit.

<p>So first you complain about conspiracy theories on a conspiracy theory forum. Now it seems you&#39;re implying I&#39;m maybe an alt? So you&#39;re spinning your own conspiracy theory? Hello cognitive dissonance.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Your sentence has too many uses of the word &quot;if.&quot; You began it with the phrase &quot;If you want,&quot; so immediately the sentence is conditional. For some inexplicable reason, you insert another conditional phrase &quot;if that helps,&quot; just a few words later. The second hypothetical adds nothing and only serves to confuse. I offered you one way of correcting it as it lays now. Perhaps I was too polite. The more I look at it, the more I think you&#39;d be better off totally scrapping it and starting from scratch. Give it another shot! You&#39;ll get there!</p>

That&#39;s right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not understand the purpose of your post. If you have ever been on this sub you would have noticed a large number of the conspiracies discussed are very hard to prove correct and often turn out to be false.</p>

<p>Every once in a while of of these theories turns out the be correct. That simple fact is what sparks the people on this sub to question everything and look past the narrative. </p>

<p>For example, I am hoping you disagree with much of the official 9/11 report or at least would like more of an explanation on many of the details surrounding the events on that day. But one of the details mentioned on that report was that the military was conducting excercises mimicing the actual events that occurred that day which was why jets were not scrambled to intercept hijaked planes. I believe that is why many people are on high alert today since there are training excercises involving nuclear attacks being conducted. </p>

<p>Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me..</p>

<p>Were you that guy calling conspiracy theorists dumb for thinking planes could be used as weapons against the US on Sept 10th.</p>

<p>Also its very easy to start calling people out in hindesight. Say it with your chest next time and call people out before rather than after nothing happends..</p>

<p>Then I said,</p>

<p>To which you said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did I say no one else bought into it? Nope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here&#39;s the thing I am confused on... First you said &quot;many here did not buy into the hype,&quot; then I made a joke about all of those posting on the front page who did, and then you said, &quot;Did I say no-one?&quot; If you didn&#39;t think many people bought into it in your first post, why are you attempting to use the amount of people who did buy into it in your last post? You first said not many believed it as a way of deflating my initial argument, but now you&#39;re saying people do believe it? </p>

<p>Could this be because you just want to have the last word, and are too dense to actually realize what you are doing and saying?</p>

<p>Maybe <em>you</em> need to work on your communications skills instead of spending so much time telling other people to work on their reading skills? </p>

<p>This is more likely.</p>

<p>I find it interesting how this community, which is supposed to be critically minded, reacts to dissenting views. You can really tell what they care most about when they&#39;re freaking out because someone isn&#39;t parroting whatever popular conspiracy theory they&#39;ve invested time in. Notice all the people putting words in my mouth, telling me to calm down, assuming I am a Trump supporter, or opposed to conspiracy theories, or a shill, or whatever. Amateurs. This is why the other day I made a post suggesting people who frequent this community could benefit from lessons in philosophy and political theory, a post that was downvoted by likely all the same people. &quot;Fuck books and logic and reasoning. I watch YouTube videos that tell me what I already believe is true! You&#39;re a loser!&quot;</p>

<p>Putin and his team literally deployed a similar tactic when he seized power to blur reality and make it difficult for people to distinguish truth from fantasy in Russia.</p>

<p>Based on the comment section, you can clearly see that some people get off on these fantasies and are clearly influenced to support them based on their perception of it&#39;s popularity and acceptance.</p>

<p>This sub isn&#39;t a family. This sub isn&#39;t the last beacon of free speech. This sub is a ripe for influencers, propagandists, and deceivers. It&#39;s pretty much a sea of deception that others interpret as entertainment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being wrong doesn&#39;t make you ignorant, not trying to learn makes you ignorant. So what if we&#39;re wrong? Life is like a reality show and we&#39;ve already gotten good plot developments; Senate meeting on N Korea, THAAD deployed to S Korea, there&#39;s a drill for invasion-response in D.C., all of which happened or are happening today. Those are pretty cool, not as significant as a big explosion, but we&#39;re going with the flow and talking with as many people as we can or care to. The big explosion doesn&#39;t have to happen today, we&#39;ll keep watching, and if we have more time we can talk to more people so I don&#39;t see what the problem is. The wheels are in motion, the next 9/11, declaration of war or economic collapse can happen at any time, it&#39;s fun to watch and speculate </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will rephrase my first statement. &quot;I&quot; am not crossing my fingers. I nor anyone that I have spoken to is hoping for a successful attack; or an attack period. </p>

<p>I respect your argument regarding that &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; people are perpetuating disinformation, propaganda, and or paranoid fanatical viewpoints based on which ever way the lean towards. Albeit true, it can&#39;t take away from those that do theorize from a point of intellectualism and through patterns they see being formed from an objective point of view.</p>

<p>I believe my main argument is that everything and I mean EVERYTHING should be looked at objectively. </p>

<p>As for me getting my scientific process incorrect; I reiterate the fact that I am NOT a scientist and had the components of the scientific theory just incorrectly placed. Points for effort? Haha. </p>

<p>Anyone that lives vicariously through Karma points and theories that are either up voted or down voted do need some help in some area or another. Then again, people make a living based on conspiracy theories and perpetuating disinformation etc. </p>

<p>I digress, basically as long as you aren&#39;t attacking an entire community based on the few; then I can respectfully agree with your initial argument. The criticism you present should be taken in and we as frequenters of this sub should be reasonable and rational enough to take it in and then form a conspiracy on why you would say the things you do instead of berating you with verbal assaults.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time bruh.</p>

<p>No I wasn&#39;t. I was telling trying to tell you that sweeping generalizations are not only often false, but also foster ignorance and misunderstanding. To which you obligingly proved my point.</p>

<p>But anyway, I enjoyed your angry ramblings quite a bit. I would say that you are probably too emotionally invested in this to make any reasonable assessment at this point. Especially since you took the time to write out this barely coherent &quot;argument&quot; based on the ambiguous semantics of my first post. I bet you spent a lot of time pouring over my words, desperately trying to find some &quot;gotcha&quot; moment.</p>
