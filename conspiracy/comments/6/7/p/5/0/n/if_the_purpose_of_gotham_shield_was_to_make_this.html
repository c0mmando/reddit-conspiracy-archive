       Nothing has happened. Nothing is happening. Nothing will happen. Downvote the cognitive dissonance away if you must, but its true. And will Redditors learn from this "conspiracy" and stop screaming, "The sky is falling"? Of course not.
      </p>
      <p>
       "But we need to 'theorize', man! That's what this is all about! Wild, unsubstantiated speculation based on disinformation and propaganda! That's what 'conspiracy' is all for!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people of this community need a refresher course in propaganda and disinformation. As long as people keep eating right out of hand of the powers that be, they will continue to use this community and others like it on Reddit and elsewhere to spread false intel and Agitprop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: And hilariously every comment so far has proven my point. Thanks.

       to calm down when you are the ones with fingers crossed, panicking WW3 is going to start, or there is going to be a  false flag. Every single one of you who says, "calm down," is in fact projecting.

       You read a post about a belief you've invested time and energy in, and because you can't intelligently defend insanely believing bullshit nonsense propagated by lunatics, you're leaning on the fallacy that
       <em>
        I

       am upset to reduce the dissonance you're feeling from these conflicting ideas. If you can convince yourself I'm just angry and raging, spouting off nonsense, then you can continue to delude yourself into believing something will happen today, or that it's justifiable to spread disinformation while recklessly disregarding the truth.

       I don't think anything will happen today, but unlike you I'm not lying to myself about why I'm spending my time following it. I think it's incredibly interesting to watch all these bits and pieces of anecdotal bull shit fall together to make it seem like there is some grand plan at work. Obviously you do as well, unfortunately you also have some superiority complex you haven't self diagnosed yet.

       Now in no way am I saying we are scientists but theoretically it is the same thing. We make observations, we test these observations by looking at the past and relative data, then we come out with a hypothesis. If something happens GREAT! If nothing happens; GREAT! It really doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure most here will agree that its terrible that we have to conspire and create theories but that is the world we live in. Things are shrouded and information diluted or not given at all.

       Indeed, it is no way scientific. Also, you have the scientific process wrong. You make an observation, you form a hypothesis, you test your
       <em>
        hypothesis
       </em>
       , based on your results you change your hypothesis and continue the process, or accept your hypothesis and validate it by testing it again. You folks don't make observations and then form hypotheses, you are fed bullshit and go crazy and speculate wildly about it until the next thing comes along.

       And no, most here live off of these theories because these theories give them meaning. They aren't actually interested in finding Truth, they are interested in using this community to further whatever ideology they lean closest to.

      <p>
       Note, this is not a criticism of the entire community, but quite a few of them are this way. The proof of that is the response to this thread and other threads by people who simply criticize one thing and then are attacked mercilessly for not parroting the popular view. This community thinks that it is evolved? It's just like all the rest.

       I will rephrase my first statement. "I" am not crossing my fingers. I nor anyone that I have spoken to is hoping for a successful attack; or an attack period.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect your argument regarding that &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; people are perpetuating disinformation, propaganda, and or paranoid fanatical viewpoints based on which ever way the lean towards. Albeit true, it can't take away from those that do theorize from a point of intellectualism and through patterns they see being formed from an objective point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe my main argument is that everything and I mean EVERYTHING should be looked at objectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for me getting my scientific process incorrect; I reiterate the fact that I am NOT a scientist and had the components of the scientific theory just incorrectly placed. Points for effort? Haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone that lives vicariously through Karma points and theories that are either up voted or down voted do need some help in some area or another. Then again, people make a living based on conspiracy theories and perpetuating disinformation etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I digress, basically as long as you aren't attacking an entire community based on the few; then I can respectfully agree with your initial argument. The criticism you present should be taken in and we as frequenters of this sub should be reasonable and rational enough to take it in and then form a conspiracy on why you would say the things you do instead of berating you with verbal assaults.

       I love this community, I am not attacking it. I am not attacking anyone. I am criticizing people who are a part of this community that think "questioning things more" means believing every batshit insane thing until it's proven not true, or it doesn't happen. These people are poison to this community, they are the result of failed education systems that pump out people that lack critical thinking skills, which is in my opinion part of the overall conspiracy. You have a population of people who'll believe anything, like say the Earth being flat, then you can get them to believe and do anything you want.

       Again, I completely agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though as a non flat earther I have to remain as open I can about their theories and the like. Some people are much more gullible and susceptible to disinformation and propaganda than others. That is a sad yet simple truth; who am I to tell them they are wrong. I will, but if they don't take well to it that is their own prerogative. I can walk away knowing I said it and be at peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am beginning to understand your view much more in that it isn't the entire sub with the issue; its all of the over emotional connections and ties people make to the theories that should have remained entirely objective. This injects the poison and also kills the openness to criticism.

       Didn't all the emails and notes to people in NY say 2:30pm is when they're supposed to move to their shelter locations? It's noon... and the drills in DC were supposed to be basically in a closed course with actors only as training for the emergency response units.

       No. I think they will delude themselves into believing something did happen. If there is a heavy thunderstorm somewhere and there's a tornado, that will be enough for some of these people and they'll say that was it.

       Maybe you should question things more. The only reason people are speculating something will happen is because the crazy recordings of "Trump goes April 26th". What do you make of that recording?

       It's amusing that you think I'm angry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're angry. I think you're angry nothing has happened, nothing will happen, and people are calling you people out on it. And because you have nothing else to lean on except insults given the fact you've stupidly promoted a theory that is clearly propaganda meant to discredit you, you're projecting your frustration on me.

       My post was an observation based on valid criticisms of this community. If you want to compensate for the discomfort you feel from someone popping your reality bubble by saying I'm upset or angry, if that helps you feel better, then by all means, go for it.

       I'm confused. You're saying I am trying to sound smart? But aren't you the one telling people how to write properly and that their sentences are improperly structured? And your "critique" does not point out how my sentence was improperly structured. So, please, point it out to me. Tell me, how is that sentence improperly structured.

       That sentence is a mess; it's bordering on being a run on. "if that helps you feel better" is a what is sometimes referred to as a "bonus phrase." If for some reason you want to keep that bizarre sentence structure, you would write it like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you want to compensate for the discomfort you feel from someone popping your reality bubble by saying I'm upset or angry

         --if that helps you feel better--
        </strong>

       I'm pretty sure you don't understand how commas are used, or what they are used for. You also don't know how to use semicolons. There's no real
       <em>
        reason

       to use a semicolon where you did other than to try to show off that you think you know how to use semicolons.

       There's nothing bizarre about my sentence structure at all. Read it aloud.

       Semi colons are used to link two independent clauses that are closely aligned in thought. In the sentence you're referencing, both clauses are independent; they could stand on their own as individual sentences. You should brush up on this a bit. You're clearly out of your element.

       So first you complain about conspiracy theories on a conspiracy theory forum. Now it seems you're implying I'm maybe an alt? So you're spinning your own conspiracy theory? Hello cognitive dissonance.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Your sentence has too many uses of the word "if." You began it with the phrase "If you want," so immediately the sentence is conditional. For some inexplicable reason, you insert another conditional phrase "if that helps," just a few words later. The second hypothetical adds nothing and only serves to confuse. I offered you one way of correcting it as it lays now. Perhaps I was too polite. The more I look at it, the more I think you'd be better off totally scrapping it and starting from scratch. Give it another shot! You'll get there!

       If there's one thing "tptb" don't like, it's large numbers of citizens coming together sharing information and crowd sourcing investigations. I don't think that should ever be discouraged. This sub is going to seem ridiculous to anyone who doesn't believe in conspiracy theories anyways. Who cares what they think.

       You realize people are wasting their day watching planes flying around because any one of them could be "the plane"? It's their day, if they want to waste it staring at planes, whatever, but one should stop and think about what it means when people will devote their entire day to watching planes because they think one of them could have a nuke, or crash into a building, or whatever. It's as though these people
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       something to happen. They can say that isn't true, but their actions say otherwise. And the moment they see it happen, they'll certainly be there to post the first post about it and get all that sweet karma--- I mean, do their part to spread the Truth. Yeah. That's right.

       Sure, perhaps some people are like that, but I'm sure the vast majority do so because they're interested in conspiracy theories. People spend their whole day in front of a tv melting their brains too. I don't see how watching planes flying around trying to find pieces to a potential puzzle is any worse than that.

       Don't come off at the set talking down to others, and some wouldn't be as negative. Once this became a widely reported "thing" even semi-reported, discerning thinkers knew nothing would happen. But you don't have to act like your above it all and Lord over other bro. Don't forget trumps meeting tonight could be interesting, however.

       I do not understand the purpose of your post. If you have ever been on this sub you would have noticed a large number of the conspiracies discussed are very hard to prove correct and often turn out to be false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every once in a while of of these theories turns out the be correct. That simple fact is what sparks the people on this sub to question everything and look past the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I am hoping you disagree with much of the official 9/11 report or at least would like more of an explanation on many of the details surrounding the events on that day. But one of the details mentioned on that report was that the military was conducting excercises mimicing the actual events that occurred that day which was why jets were not scrambled to intercept hijaked planes. I believe that is why many people are on high alert today since there are training excercises involving nuclear attacks being conducted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me..
      </p>
      <p>
       Were you that guy calling conspiracy theorists dumb for thinking planes could be used as weapons against the US on Sept 10th.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also its very easy to start calling people out in hindesight. Say it with your chest next time and call people out before rather than after nothing happends..

       You seem really riled up, my dude. Maybe you should consider that not all conspiracy theorists are the same, and that many on this board are real skeptics. Go back to those threads, and you'll see upvoted comments where people are saying reasonable things about why nothing will happen, and that military drills and such are quite common and happen all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, you could keep raging out about the people that you think are fools (many probably are, to be honest). But what's that gonna do for you?

       You seem riled up. Your comment seems to be more for you than for me, like you're trying to tell yourself this to help you cope with the fact you've been panicking over WW3 starting today, or a false flag nuclear attack.

       Maybe you can help me understand this then... Did you forget what your response to me was about? You were trying to convince me not many people believed this hype. You said,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You must have missed the part of my comment where I stated that
        <strong>

        . That includes me, which my comment history clearly supports.

      <p>
       Then I said,

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But here's the thing I am confused on... First you said "many here did not buy into the hype," then I made a joke about all of those posting on the front page who did, and then you said, "Did I say no-one?" If you didn't think many people bought into it in your first post, why are you attempting to use the amount of people who did buy into it in your last post? You first said not many believed it as a way of deflating my initial argument, but now you're saying people do believe it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could this be because you just want to have the last word, and are too dense to actually realize what you are doing and saying?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       need to work on your communications skills instead of spending so much time telling other people to work on their reading skills?

       No I wasn't. I was telling trying to tell you that sweeping generalizations are not only often false, but also foster ignorance and misunderstanding. To which you obligingly proved my point.

      <p>
       But anyway, I enjoyed your angry ramblings quite a bit. I would say that you are probably too emotionally invested in this to make any reasonable assessment at this point. Especially since you took the time to write out this barely coherent "argument" based on the ambiguous semantics of my first post. I bet you spent a lot of time pouring over my words, desperately trying to find some "gotcha" moment.

       Hey man, you do need to relax. I don't think any of us want WWIII to begin today. But it will some day in the future. I was only creeped out by this conspiracy because of the radio broadcast. And the military vehicles being shipped through my town.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason to get your panties in a bunch. Especially because this sub is meant for conspiracy theories to be shared and discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you do make a good point. Have you all ever thought about the government or higher up forces planting "evidence" for us to find and freak out about? Conspiracy this, conspiracy that. They know we're on to them. They basically know every time someone's going to take a piece of information and run with it. They're not stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to say that the April 26th posts, although nothing could come of them, have made me realize I need to start preparing. For an all out nuclear war. Instead of trying to find coincidences in everything ever.

       challenged something you currently believe. I am perfectly calm. I have my weed, I am done with classes, I've got a new, decent paying job, I'm preparing for grad school. I'm actually in a great place right now. I came on here and saw a bunch of lunacy about this supposed false flag and thought I'd comment on it and how to perhaps prevent being sucked into this disinformation trap again, only to find myself bombarded by children who lack critical thinking skills and take every criticism as a personal attack because of their inability to deal with emotions.

       I find it interesting how this community, which is supposed to be critically minded, reacts to dissenting views. You can really tell what they care most about when they're freaking out because someone isn't parroting whatever popular conspiracy theory they've invested time in. Notice all the people putting words in my mouth, telling me to calm down, assuming I am a Trump supporter, or opposed to conspiracy theories, or a shill, or whatever. Amateurs. This is why the other day I made a post suggesting people who frequent this community could benefit from lessons in philosophy and political theory, a post that was downvoted by likely all the same people. "Fuck books and logic and reasoning. I watch YouTube videos that tell me what I already believe is true! You're a loser!"

       Putin and his team literally deployed a similar tactic when he seized power to blur reality and make it difficult for people to distinguish truth from fantasy in Russia.

       Based on the comment section, you can clearly see that some people get off on these fantasies and are clearly influenced to support them based on their perception of it's popularity and acceptance.

       I think a few posts illustrated the pattern of drills and horrible events, and highlighted a few unsettling facts about the events. If you can ever make an educated decision about traveling to an area because of uncertain danger, I think this sub helped do that.

       Being wrong doesn't make you ignorant, not trying to learn makes you ignorant. So what if we're wrong? Life is like a reality show and we've already gotten good plot developments; Senate meeting on N Korea, THAAD deployed to S Korea, there's a drill for invasion-response in D.C., all of which happened or are happening today. Those are pretty cool, not as significant as a big explosion, but we're going with the flow and talking with as many people as we can or care to. The big explosion doesn't have to happen today, we'll keep watching, and if we have more time we can talk to more people so I don't see what the problem is. The wheels are in motion, the next 9/11, declaration of war or economic collapse can happen at any time, it's fun to watch and speculate

       The only think I know is I don't know anything. We know that we might not be right with our speculations but there's a women, can't remember the name, but she won a "being smart" award that said "it would be detrimental to not speculate".

       I will rephrase my first statement. "I" am not crossing my fingers. I nor anyone that I have spoken to is hoping for a successful attack; or an attack period.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect your argument regarding that &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; people are perpetuating disinformation, propaganda, and or paranoid fanatical viewpoints based on which ever way the lean towards. Albeit true, it can't take away from those that do theorize from a point of intellectualism and through patterns they see being formed from an objective point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe my main argument is that everything and I mean EVERYTHING should be looked at objectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for me getting my scientific process incorrect; I reiterate the fact that I am NOT a scientist and had the components of the scientific theory just incorrectly placed. Points for effort? Haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone that lives vicariously through Karma points and theories that are either up voted or down voted do need some help in some area or another. Then again, people make a living based on conspiracy theories and perpetuating disinformation etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I digress, basically as long as you aren't attacking an entire community based on the few; then I can respectfully agree with your initial argument. The criticism you present should be taken in and we as frequenters of this sub should be reasonable and rational enough to take it in and then form a conspiracy on why you would say the things you do instead of berating you with verbal assaults.

       No I wasn't. I was telling trying to tell you that sweeping generalizations are not only often false, but also foster ignorance and misunderstanding. To which you obligingly proved my point.

       But anyway, I enjoyed your angry ramblings quite a bit. I would say that you are probably too emotionally invested in this to make any reasonable assessment at this point. Especially since you took the time to write out this barely coherent "argument" based on the ambiguous semantics of my first post. I bet you spent a lot of time pouring over my words, desperately trying to find some "gotcha" moment.
