      <p>
       I was inboxed this eye opener.
      </p>
      <p>
       Global warming doesn’t exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Land “readings” are diverging from satellite data (which NASA itself says is accurate and should be the standard instead) because over 40% of land “readings” are estimates made for places without recording equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       To illustratively do something that the psychopaths love to do, I’ll cherrypick the last 20 years to show that there has been no warming there, despite CO2 continuing to rise. Even using just the satellite record, the world isn’t warming. If we refer back to one of the hottest years in recorded history, we see the difference. Never mind that there have only been benefits to CO2 rising.
      </p>
      <pre><code>“Waaaaa! What about the ice caps!”
</code></pre>
      <p>
       They’re not melting. They go through cycles. 1974 had less ice than today. Oh, and don’t listen to what scientists say, whatever you do. Nowhere is melting out of turn, not even Greenland (where it has been growing for something like 30 years).
      </p>
      <pre><code>“But the sea level is rising!”
</code></pre>
      <p>
       It has been rising for 13,000 years. In that time, it has never risen more slowly than right now. Were our ancestors belching out CO2 faster than we were? Maybe they were farting a lot more. It’s rising more slowly than at any time in that history, and it’s also rising more slowly than any claim made public by any outlet. Here’s the source data for that chart. It’s an FTP link, so it should automatically download the raw file (which you don’t need to worry about, as it’s a bunch of undifferentiated numbers). Turns out that NOAA marks the average as 0.63 mm per year. Not 3.3. Not 2.8. Certainly not a foot per year, which is needed for the most modern public “predictions” about this bullshit.
      </p>
      <pre><code>“But ocean acidity!”
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Guess what? It’s also cyclical.
      </p>
      <pre><code>“Okay, not ice caps, but what about the glaciers?”
</code></pre>
      <p>
       They’ve been melting since at least the 1780s when we started measuring them. I also have information for the Alps and other areas. Was our pre-industrial civilization responsible for “greenhouse gases” too?
      </p>
      <pre><code>“But but but but but but but but muh consensus! They agree! Because I say so! That makes what they say true!”
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Sorry, there never was any consensus.
      </p>
      <pre><code>“Then why don’t climate change deniers publish papers?”
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Because they do (and because papers often aren’t published because the publishing groups are owned by AGW liars).
      </p>
      <pre><code>”So what the hell is this all about?”
</code></pre>
      <p>
       The purposeful destruction of the economy and infrastructure of the Western world and only the Western world.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the data supports the existence of AGW.
      </p>
      <pre><code>“WAA! IT’S ONLY UNITED STATES TEMPERATURES!”
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Because there is no other record of meaningful scientific value anywhere. The GHCND set of stations has slowly been closed down… and what’s this! The stations being closed down ARE FAR FROM THE EQUATOR. What does that mean? The average latitude of GHCND stations IS FIFTEEN FUCKING DEGREES CLOSER TO THE EQUATOR than it used to be. Do you imagine that might raise temperatures? If you answer no, don’t bother answering in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States has a network of 1200+ USHCN stations with data going back to 1895 and earlier. The raw USHCN temperature record shows that there has been a slight cooling since 1920 (see above). USHCN is a subset of GHCND (Global Historical Climatology Network Daily.) Cooling doesn’t suit the needs of your masters, so they cherrypicked a small subset of GHCND stations (which show a large amount of warming since 1920) for use in the global GSN temperature record.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let’s stop this madness, right? What happens when we take data from SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND SOURCES? That is, 1. stations active for a long time and 2. stations that don’t move (meaning keeping the same latitude). We see what I said above. NO. FUCKING. WARMING.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very best (for your delusions), you (meaning your own authorities) can say that there has been zero change since modern recordings began. Your bastard king himself, James Hansen, ADMITTED TO THIS.
      </p>
      <pre><code>"WAAAAAA THE DOCUMENT ENDS IN 1995!"
</code></pre>
      <p>
       And yet there has been zero warming SINCE THEN, too, so you don’t have a leg to stand on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny how sea level is identical to 1870 and 1901, huh (La Jolla and La Jolla; Sydney and Sydney, respectively)? Funny how all the gauges show a 0.63mm/yr rise (which, again, is smaller than at any time in the last 11,000 years). Not 3.3. Not 2.6. Not 1.4. Certainly not “a meter by 2050.”
      </p>
      <pre><code>“But weather is becoming more extreme!”
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Nah, less. Universally. What’s more, do you imagine? Not fires. Ha! Not floods.
      </p>
      <pre><code>USGS research has shown no linkage between flooding (either increases or decreases) and the increase in greenhouse gases. Essentially, from USGS long-term streamgage data for sites across the country with no regulation or other changes to the watershed that could influence the streamflow, the data shows no systematic increases in flooding through time.
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Not tornadoes. Five (nearly six now) consecutive years of below average events. Not hurricanes. Every single indicator shows they’re not only becoming less frequent, but also less powerful. Not even drought. Hilarious! So what is it? What’s worse? Tell us. Is it anything at all? Anywhere? At any time? No. Of course, this has been known for a while. It’s global cooling’s fault, after all! Oh, wait… NOAA wouldn’t want you to hear this now, would they?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your narrative is predicated on laziness. Your narrative is predicated on people not doing their homework and not comprehending the data they see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your narrative is predicated on appeals to authority and the expectation that your masters will never lie to you. That’s the only way it has ever existed.

       The earth will survive.  I am against plastic as much as the next guy, but bacteria are already evolving to break it down.  After trees began producing cellulose and lignin, there were no bacteria or fungus that could break it down for 60 million years.  The carboniferous era had a planet covered in dead, fallen trees that would not decompose.  This, combined with higher concentrations of atmospheric oxygen led to massive forest fires that would rage for months.  Nothing we do is going to end life on this planet.  In fact, removing humans might just be the best thing for it.

       I'm just going to link this xkcd comic and you decide for yourself if the recent change in (only) temperature is natural and cyclical, especially seeing as how we're in a increasing part of the sunspot cycle.

       For the sake of my reply I'll pretend that the comic is 100% accurate. So that proves the Earth has been getting warmer for thousand of years. If the Earth was already getting warmer and warmer whos .to say this isn't natural?

       Okay thats cool man, I've been on this subject for a while now and have seen a shit tonne of evidence proving global warming is not being caused by mankind. I'm asking to be convinced either way but instead I've got 'super intelligent individuals that look down on others because they're always right and mummy makes their dinner every night' throwing sarcastic comments everywhere. Guess what? You could be wrong about everything you know, you don't know SHIT for sure, no one does.

       Lol no, you got looked down on because you made a bunch of claims (many of them wrong) and didn't provide sources, which of course made you look stupid causing people to look down on you.

       Global warming is happening. I don't believe everything scientists say is my point, you shouldn't either. Just because someone has a degree doesn't mean shit to me. Scientists can be paid off to follow agendas! Funnily enough the top scoring link today is all about scientists being paid off to push a fake agenda.

       Yeah that's what I thought, just handwave it away.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to believe everything every scientist says, that's why I said the link includes links to all the appropriate research papers and data. If the data is wrong and methodology incorrect then you can read the papers submit a rebuttal and have the record changed. Unfortunately for you, no one has been able to do that.  Sure you'll grab one of the minuscule number of climate scientists who don't believe in man made global warming (which by they way you should treat with just the same amount of disbelief as scientists who don't support your view, other wise you are just cherry picking to support your beliefs) as proof there is some kind of controversy but the problem is their theories have failed to stand up to scrutiny and convince any other scientist to change their minds.  The only people they convince are journalist and people like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a subject as complicated as climate science I know who I will trust.  The overwhelming number of highly trained people who have spent their lives studying the subject and provide clear data and methodology in their papers.  Who do you trust? I assume you can't rely on yourself because you are clearly not a scientist of any stripe, let alone one in the field.  In conclusion, you are talking complete shit based on your preconceived agenda and ideology.

       Let's simplify this immensely: you must believe in Global (insert word) because it reduces suffering in the world. How's that? you ask. The rich and empowered suffer every time they look at you. They suffer in traffic jams like some poor schlump, like you. They go to a park and have to see and hear your snot nosed little brats. They, yes even they, have to
       <em>
        wait in line with common people!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget public air transport. The refined betters often have to smell your poopy bottoms, breath your exhaled potato chip breath, and be pushed around by goons, goons that were originally meant for you! This is indeed suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your cars must be taken away. You must stop infesting our countryside and spoiling our view with your existence. Therefore, careful plans have been made by the UN. Your betters have determined you belong in a high rise restricted access allocated housing project after being properly spayed or neutered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until this and many other ongoing projects you are to be suppressed, reduced, hidden, restricted, controlled, shut down with no expectations, or, finally, eradicated to combat the suffering of your right born, refined, sensitive, superior human beings. Can't you see your hurting us, our comfort with your ugliness?

       You realize a lot of the same players are on the new energy side, right? You really don't see anyway certain people could benefit more from all the changes made in the name of AGW? Doesn't it matter if the underlying reasoning for the actions are justified? I'm down for decreasing pollution, but the path we've been on so far has done more to just change which hands the money goes to. It matters whether the science is sound, it doesn't matter if a bunch of scientists say they agree. See: big oil, tobacco, medicine, food industry. There's a lot of people that would have something to gain from manipulating data and pushing a narrative. The group-think mentality is very strong around GW. All that without even mentioning the implications these global pacts could have in transitioning to a world government.

       Basically, the reason why we have so many climate change deniers, is because of the (incorrect) heliocentric model.

       The earth is not a convex spinning ball, but a stationary ball.

       Within the concave earth are several levitating glass spheres, with the closest being at 100km high.

       Attached to the underside of this sphere is a

       This is why they are fearful of climate change.

       If a large slab of ice detached and fell onto a city (like at Tunguska), it could kill thousands.

         Or the concave model, where not only is the sun a few thousand miles way, there is a literal glass bubble between us and the sun.

       Seriously, at one point there was this thing called an ice age. Actually more than once. We have been lucky to not be living in that time. There were also dinosaurs. Also lucky to not be living in that time (some opinions may differ). Earth seems to change. Since the past 200 years we have things like thermometers, pencil, and paper. We have also noticed a trend.

       Global warming doesn't exist because the Earth isn't a planet, it's a flat &amp; circular disc covered by a dome which the stars are attached to. 3 things wrong with the solar system model: if day and night were caused by the constant and even rotation of the Earth, towards and away from the sun respectively, the half of this ball-world and half would be night for equal lengths, furthermore; if we were spinning 1000mph at the equator, then the transition would be rather instantaneous. Next, if the lore is true and Mercury and Venus were between us and the sun, and we're rotated away from the sun at night, then even a kilometer past the terminator line on the night side would make it impossible to look up at those "planets" with a telescope. Next, it's said that in the time you read this, Spaceship Earth has traveled hundreds of thousand thousands of miles, spinning on an axis around thd sun in an elliptical shape which is also traveling around the galaxy too, and through all of this, constellations are still a thing; Ursa Major has been referenced since Homer's Apollo and you'll be able to see it tonight if you live near the center of the dome. Also, the sun happens to be about 410x bigger than the moon, and also about 390x further away, making them appear the same size (particularly in eclipses)? Give me a break. Look up at the sun, is it really so hard to realize it's smaller and closer than we've been led to believe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a few reasons people became suspicious we're not on a spinning rock: the horizon stretches out further than it mathematically should, letting you see monuments and lighthouses too far away. The horizon raises to eye level no matter how high you go, you'd think an airplane would be high enough to have to look down at the horizon which should be curved on either end, but it raises to the level the ocean does at the shore and is equally flat; weather balloons with standard-lens cameras that have gone twice as high as airplanes tell the same story. The Nikon P900 can zoom in on things way too freakin far away at eye level. All space agencies and developed countries are owned by secret societies, Zionists/Masons, and they want you to think you're 1 out of a Trillion, nothing special. They also want you to think fossil fuels are scarce, but theyre not and free unlimited energy is easily possible on the flat plane we live on; Tesla described our world as a Tesla Coil. God's obviously real because who else made this place, and designed us? But to answer your question, no, man-made climate change is part of psedu-science and is not a real threat. Nor are  meteors or solar flares randomly hitting us, or an alien invasion to unite us, all fake.

       So the research you did to confirm global warming doesn't exist... do that same research into global warming being a thing. A thing that is happening. Maybe. Cause, it happened before a couple of times.
