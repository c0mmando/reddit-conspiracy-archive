<p>CIA was created in 1947. Truman put Paperclip into effect in 1946. It was JIOA who dealt with Paperclip. </p>

<p>However, you are right about CIA being linked to Nazis. Lookup the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gehlen_Organization">Gehlen Organization</a> and its connection to the CIA and BND.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a private college somewhere in the Southeast. The teachers can teach 400 level classes on things they are interested in. It wasn&#39;t what you are imagining, though. It more of an analysis of real life conspiracies and the conspiracy mind. For example, we read about CIA, Operation Paperclip, the Banana Republics, things like that. I compiled reading lists and documentaries and YouTube videos and content for the class to look at and use for their own papers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, long story. Lumumba was involved in freeing the Congo from Belgium and was their first prime minister. Shortly after independence and taking power there was a mutiny in the Congolese military, Belgium got involved, a state seceded from Congo, he traveled to New York to appeal to the UN, when he got back there was a coup by Mobutu, Lumumba appealed to the US for help, when they wouldn&#39;t help him he asked the Soviets for help, he fled, the US (CIA) helped Mobutu find him, he was starved, beaten, shot by a firing squad, dismembered, dissolved in acid, and what wouldn&#39;t dissolve was ground into powder. </p>

<p>Um, because they ARE. Because they openly espouse all of those things. Because since FDR they have been promoting globalism and big government. Because FDR started the OSS/CIA, which IS the &quot;Deep State.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be aware that &quot;liberal&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything anymore and is currently used in identity politics propaganda.
You know the old &quot;you&#39;re either a liberal/democrat or a conservative/republican&quot;.
But the truth is both parties are two sides of the same corporate banking elite coin.</p>

<p>Liberal as far as I understand (with current deceptive usage)
can only possibly mean
&quot;more left wing than conservatives&quot;
and literally nothing else.
It only means &quot;I have SOME left wing leanings&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty useless isn&#39;t?
Yet the divide and conquer corporate media (CNN, Fox, etc.)
use the liberal v conservative shit
to imply left wing v right wing.</p>

<p>In fact, both parties are right wing, authoritarian, corporate warmongers.
Just because Obama/Clinton is pro-LGBT rights (a noble left wing concept of equality)
doesn&#39;t make them left wing overall.
They&#39;re both very right wing, only a little left of republicans.
Bombing Syria isn&#39;t left wing, stealing our taxes and pumping it into privatized healthcare (where big pharma and insurance companies make big profits at our expense and take subsidies for free from our taxes)
is not left wing.
National healthcare is left wing but since obamacare is privatized by corporations through government, it&#39;s right wing.</p>

<p>Democrats are nearly all NEOliberals (very right wing, very authoritarian)
while republicans are NEOconservatives (extremely right ring, extremely authoritarian).</p>

<p>But they&#39;re both shit.
The republicans don&#39;t even try to appeal to the poor, while the dems sugar coat their shit policies.
&quot;hey guys we want war in the middle east, don&#39;t give a fuck about worker wages almost as much as republicans don&#39;t give a fuck....but vote for us because the other side will take away LGBT rights, abortion rights, etc.!&quot;</p>

<p>Do you see how it&#39;s the same &quot;lesser evil&quot; bullshit?
The left wing part of the dems isn&#39;t that bad part, it&#39;s the right wing side that overshadows the left part.
They&#39;re fake left wingers hence &quot;NEOliberal&quot; meaning &quot;new left&quot;
But they&#39;re not socialists, they&#39;re corporate warmongers controlled by fascist leaning bankers.</p>

<p>To the right of NEOliberalism and NEOconservatism is fascism...I.e. NWO &quot;big brother is watching you, ministry of truth, Mark of the beast microchip currency, etc.&quot;</p>

<p>America has become brainwashed in politics.
Bernie Sanders was approximately centrist or just to the left of centrist, and surprise surprise, the corporate media called him a scary communist, called his ideas unrealistic even though FDR already did them, &quot;HOW YOU GONNA PAY FOR THAT, BERNIE&quot;
24/7 smear job.
Clinton and Trump on the other hand get lots of airtime and much less criticism.
(Well, Trump got criticism too &quot;he&#39;s a clown, a fascist, racist&quot;
But still got 2 billion in free advertising.)</p>

<p>I know trump&#39;s original base blames left wingers and liberals (who are not the same but people wrongly equate them to be interchangeable)
But remember America is manipulated.</p>

<p>Identity politics:
&quot;you&#39;re either a white hating feminist drug addict liberal or a gun nut religious retard conservative&quot;</p>

<p>both are shitty stereotypes that cause division but what&#39;s worse is that it limits the political spectrum.</p>

<p>Liberal is used as a replacement of democrat but democrat is a BRAND just like republican.
If the true meaning of liberal is &quot;right wing conservatism with some left wing sprinkled in like pro choice, pro LGBT rights&quot;
You can see how people are pissed off with the lack of choice.
In 2012, Obama and Romney had near identical policies.
Two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>So please, people, let&#39;s not package people into &quot;liberals and conservatives&quot;
That&#39;s like saying
&quot;you&#39;re either a coca cola guy or a pepsi guy&quot;
fuck them both, they&#39;re literally almost the same shit, very little difference....maybe one has a tiny bit less sugar or something or a little cheaper....same shitty unhealthy product.</p>

<p>The establishment hasn&#39;t let a left winger or even a centrist run properly for a long time.
FDR was centrist and similar to Bernie&#39;s policies, yet he was branded a crazy communist, rigged in the DNC primaries and forced to endorse Clinton (either morally, by contract, or by physical threats).</p>

<p>If you look at Bush and Obama, the difference between them isn&#39;t that big, they&#39;re still murderer puppets who fucked the poor to give to the rich.
That alone should tell you the brand name war of liberal v conservative is horseshit.
The corporate media has injected subconsciously into people that &quot;conservatives don&#39;t care about the poor and liberals are globalists&quot;
but I can assure you they&#39;re virtually the same bullshit right wing authoritarian ideology.</p>

<p>If people stopped buying the
&quot;you&#39;re either a liberal/democrat or conservative/republican&quot;
people would wake up from the two party scam system.</p>

<p>America should give centrists and center left candidates a try for once, but elites spent billions trying to keep appearances up and get people to vote Hillary v Trump.
Completely ignored Bernie at one point even when the primaries only just started....if that&#39;s not corporate bias, I don&#39;t know what is.
Literally saw newspapers say
&quot;It&#39;s HILLARY VS TRUMP!!&quot;
like it was corporate Christmas.
They probably prefered Clinton the loyal corporate stooge but Trump isn&#39;t a spanner in the machine.
Not saying Bernie is immune from corruption (anyone can be threatened)
but he certainly was the most legit in the race except for Green party candidate Dr Jill Stein.</p>

<p>The two party system is 100% a scam.
Diebold voting machines hacked, ballots shredded, registrations dropped/switched, dead people voting, etc.
how can anyone trust the democrat or republican party??
Trump is a friend of Clinton despite being an &quot;independent running as a republican&quot;
and Bernie was rigged out despite being an &quot;independent running as a democrat&quot;.</p>

<p>The honest ones are rigged against, the false opposition is given billions in free advertisement.
You would have thought people learned by now considering the shit show that was Bush and Obama let alone earlier presidents.</p>

<p>Independent is the only way to go, people need to wake up.
But not shills like Gary Johnson, he&#39;s economically far right (anti worker, pro corporate)
and pro-TPP.
But you get what I mean.</p>

<p>Duing the Vietnam war the Central Intelligence Agency secretly initiated a sweeping program of kidnap, torture, and assassination devised to destabilize the infrastructure of the National Liberation Front (NLF) of South Vietnam, commonly known as the “Viet Cong.” The victims of the Phoenix Program were Vietnamese civilians, male and female, suspected of harboring information about the enemy—though many on the blacklist were targeted by corrupt South Vietnamese security personnel looking to extort money or remove a rival. Between 1965 and 1972, more than eighty thousand noncombatants were “neutralized,” as men and women alike were subjected to extended imprisonment without trial, horrific torture, brutal rape, and in many cases execution, all under the watchful eyes of US government agencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would focus on how much of the foreign policy of the world is US influenced. </p>

<p>Litterally. </p>

<p>During the cold war, the CIA made use of every mild mannered terrorist with a persecution complex to go after the soviets. </p>

<p>I mean, litterally, they created 90 % of the terrorists we have today. ´
Bin ladin? The one whose tunnels the US successfully bombed with the mother of bombs, a thermobaric weapon that should get them all dealt with nuremberg style because it was an atrocity? Wanna guess who co financed bin laden? That&#39;s right, the CIA. </p>

<p>Hussein and poison gas? wanna guess where hussein got his WMD&#39;s from? CIA. </p>

<p>Allende? CIA. </p>

<p>I would go over what are americas problems today, and list, one by one, which of those are directly created by the CIA. </p>

<p>Personally, I would list two things. </p>

<p>Step one, for an european, is operation Gladio. The idea that you had to hide actual nazi terrorists in europe, supply them with weapons, money and such, and watch them go afzer people, just bexcause they were supposed to form a stay behind organisation in case the soviets invaded. </p>

<p>Professionally, I would say shatter the image of the US foreign policy. I mean, shit, you guys try, and I don&#39;t believe all of it is in vain. &gt;You really have a good heart. </p>

<p>But if on the one side I see, okay, CIA goes against terrorists, and boooom, terrorists used to be fully funded by the CIA.... Chides country for having a dictator, aaaaaand... dictator put in power by the CI so his socialist rival could not get up. </p>

<p>What am i supposed to think? </p>

<p>That american foreign policy is completely free of this? That they are completely free of all this taint? </p>

<p>The biggest sin the CIA ever did was link itself with america, and the proliferation of american interrests. </p>

<p>Because if this would be a freelance organisation, it would be the biggest terrorist threat there is, and I do not see one country that could honestly say they hve not had their special surprise by the CIA to fuck with them. I would much rather say they would be one of the terrorist organisations that would be allowed to go after and hunted down like dogs, wherever they have their heads up. </p>

<p>But by linking it with america? By saying, hey, can&#39;t touch this? </p>

<p>You create a very long memory. because all these problem we have now, they have a reason why they are here now. Why they are here today. and if on the onbe hand, the amricans are demanding a voice why the problem matters, and how the problem has to be handld, but on the other side, the world is supposed to forget the CIA handled it first.... </p>

<p>The CIA nd this behavior is responsible for creating conspiracy theories. Because most of them seem to be true. </p>
