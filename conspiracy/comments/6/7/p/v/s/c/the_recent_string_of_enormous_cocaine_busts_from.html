       DEA seizes 45 lbs of cocaine and heroin ($4.5m street value) in bust of 13-man ring in NYC, caught smuggling the drugs through the USPS from Puerto Rico. Two suppliers in Puerto Rico were arrested simultaneously:

       However, in most of the MSM another enormous bust that occurred on the same day has been almost completely blacked out, with focus strongly on the ring operating through the US Postal Service.

       12 TSA employees in Puerto Rico busted in what is alleged to have been an 18-yr operation, having smuggled 20 tons ($100m) of cocaine over that period. Fox News is the single major news outlet reporting on this, which seems to imply the liberal media has a stake in keeping it quiet. This ring was successful in smuggling coke from Puerto Rico to the US through both Bush and Obama admins.

       Harking back to H.W. Bush's use of the Barbara in Operation Zapata, this would fit the trend of Presidents naming their drug-running boats after their wives. The coincidence would be a moot point if it were not for the subsequent string of high-profile social events Obama found himself whisked away to earlier this month:
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4313280/Barack-Obama-gets-lunch-Warren-Buffet.html">

       </a>
       First in NYC, then on the other side of the continent to Cali and Hawaii:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He arrived in California late that evening, but was out and about early Monday on his way to the Fairmont, where over a hundred fans lined the street to get a glimpse of the former president.
That was not to be however, with Barack making his exit and entrance in tucked away behind the tinted glass of his SUV in a four-car motorcade.
And just like his trip to Omaha, Barack left Moffett Airfield for the hotel and then the hotel for the airfield, with no additional stops.
This trip was also not on Barack's schedule, and the next stop in Hawaii followed that same pattern, allowing Barack to arrive to no fanfare or crowds.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This juxtaposition of coke busts and cross-continental travel has led some to suggest Obama is fleeing questioning or simple suspicion. This string of Caribbean cocaine busts can also be tied tenuously to Obama through his signing of The United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act (H.R.4939), yet another colonial initiative to nation-build masked as a humanitarian effort, signed quietly mere days before Obama left office:

       The final node in this line of conspicuous events is the recent opening of long-awaited Argyle International Airport on
       <strong>

       Its first and so far only reported flights were private charter planes, which landed two days before the St. Vincent-registered
       <em>
        Lady Michelle
       </em>
       was found some 600 miles south off the coast of Suriname.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not Obama is truly involved seems less important than the revelation that a nearly two decade coke smuggling operation ran from NYC to Puerto Rico seemingly unmolested by intrusion from law enforcement, and the uncovering of this ring has not been mentioned by any mainstream news outlet besides Fox News; the focus instead has been on lesser instances of social disruption, abuse and neglect involving airlines.
