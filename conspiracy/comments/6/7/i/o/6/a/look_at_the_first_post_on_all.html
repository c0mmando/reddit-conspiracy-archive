       "The 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, all feel like discrete periods with their own personalities, but the last 17 years just feels like one blob of time to me."
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this tell you?
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all it's right. Absolutely. Those decades were an example of a free population that was constantly evolving through art and consciousness. To me this shows the 2000's signfied a new era of our existence. An era orchestrated by the deep state where everything is robotic and nothing is original anymore. It's the same old shit time after time. 2001 brought 9/11 and the security state was born. But as far as art and music and clothing, it's the same old crap from here on. Nothing is original, it's the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my question to you is, Have we hit a plateau because they want us to be here or are we just robots at this point? Perhaps both.

       I disagree, it's easy to see the differences in those decades looking back, and I believe the same thing will happen when we look back at the decades we currently live in.

       I don't know...the difference between glam rock and grunge, or the difference between classic rock and disco, etc starkly contrasted. There hasn't been a counterculture movement on a scale of punk, hippies, or grunge in quite some time.

       Hip hop was a movement destroyed by white America like those other movements. Electronic music isn't new. "Rappers" signed to Sony BMG "dissing" the president isn't counter culture..

       That was when it first started to come into the mainstream but the 2000's led to the mega rap stars that sold crazy amounts of records, Eminem for example sold more records than any artist of any genre from 2000-2010

       I don't agree with that. There are different types of music and art being created like they never have before. That's not to say they're better or worse - just original in their own ways. I don't think we place much focus on them because sometimes it's difficult to notice those kind of changes as they're happening.

       There are still many outlets for personal expression and evolving art, you just have to do the work to find it now. It's no longer a part of pop culture to have a personal and unique identity, likewise critical thinking and learning are becoming "uncool". But truth and expression is still out there and it's something that will always exist, it's a part of who we naturally are. When society begins to lose sight of this it will be an unconscious feeling of inadequacy, emptiness and longing, but at the same time the forces are just as strong on the other side and people are tuning into an awakening of all that isn't suiting them anymore.

       Art and music are only the same if you listen only to top 40 garbage and consume art that is produced for the main stream. Both of those avenues have become outlets for things that only cater the lowest common denominator. Something that even the dumbest of the population can understand and enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
       For music just browse through the tons of outlets that have large, small, and emerging artists.
      </p>
      <p>
       For art there are also tons of sites for every type of niche art style and theme. You just need to them.

       It could be social engineering but it's also just the fact the the younger audience has no attention span for anything more. Which is also why things seem to fly by so fast. Like hey check out this dope song, never to ever be heard on the radio again in 3 months.

       The last 17 years can be roughly broken up into:

       2001-2007(ish) - Post 9/11 cultural upheaval tied with massive economic growth

       I think a lot of it comes down to the internet, 2000 or so was really when things like MySpace and Napster took off. We have a sort of cultural homogeneity at the moment because we're all interconnected, all the time.

       A think a marked difference in those decades as opposed to the 2000's is connection. 
In the past people had to make an effort to physically connect. 
The great hypnotist was TV and it was easily avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there is a screen in every hand connections are made instantly without the subtlety of actual socialization or social skills. 
Having your little black mirror hypnotist in your pocket has tricked people into thinking they are connected and clever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society has voluntarily become the social engineers ultimate fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignorant and detached people, thinking they are clever with the internet in their pants, never learning real social skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       They never learn how to read deeply and think critically because their hypnotic monitoring device allows them to see and interpret the world.
What most do not consider is whose version of reality they are taking for granted as "real"  as it is fed to them through corporate applications and websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paradoxically connected while detached and compartmentalized.
Propaganda and social cues fed direct 24/7 right into your hands as your queries and conversations are all scooped up and your profile built for whatever purpose the oligarchs and their deep state hatchet men  see fit.

       Design seems to really be hitting this wall, Look at a car from 1942 compared to a car from 1960, vs. a car from 2000 and one from 2017, or the fashionable clothing of 1942 vs. 1960 compared to the "jeans and a t-shirt" sameness from 2000-2017.

       So you think let's say a 2000 Cadillac is the same as a 2017 Tesla? You think bulky flip phones are the same as smartphones? You don't think the reason for "not seeing a difference" is just because we are currently living in this time so we don't feel an instant change when the decade changes?

       I wonder if it might have more to do with the age of the average person who would make/or associate with a statement like that one. I saw it this morning and immediately wondered. Our perceptions evolve as we get older and experience different things. The last 17 years have been experienced in a different way by the average Reddit user (big assumption on average age here, I may be way off-base) than our understanding of the preceding 60+ years. Just throwing it out there as a musing really, any thoughts?

       Technology became a bigger part of everyday life for people. Express themselves more through things we cannot physically show. Whether that's what we like on Facebook, what YouTube channels we subscribe to, our spotify channels, what games we play.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these things are digital and don't involve physical expression or interaction. That's just my take on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not doing things that involve going out and interacting with out surroundings as a collective group.
