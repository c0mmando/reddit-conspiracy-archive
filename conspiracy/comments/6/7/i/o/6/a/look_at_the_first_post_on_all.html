        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;The 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, all feel like discrete periods with their own personalities, but the last 17 years just feels like one blob of time to me.&quot;</p>

<p>What does this tell you? </p>

<p>First of all it&#39;s right. Absolutely. Those decades were an example of a free population that was constantly evolving through art and consciousness. To me this shows the 2000&#39;s signfied a new era of our existence. An era orchestrated by the deep state where everything is robotic and nothing is original anymore. It&#39;s the same old shit time after time. 2001 brought 9/11 and the security state was born. But as far as art and music and clothing, it&#39;s the same old crap from here on. Nothing is original, it&#39;s the same.</p>

<p>So my question to you is, Have we hit a plateau because they want us to be here or are we just robots at this point? Perhaps both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are still many outlets for personal expression and evolving art, you just have to do the work to find it now. It&#39;s no longer a part of pop culture to have a personal and unique identity, likewise critical thinking and learning are becoming &quot;uncool&quot;. But truth and expression is still out there and it&#39;s something that will always exist, it&#39;s a part of who we naturally are. When society begins to lose sight of this it will be an unconscious feeling of inadequacy, emptiness and longing, but at the same time the forces are just as strong on the other side and people are tuning into an awakening of all that isn&#39;t suiting them anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Art and music are only the same if you listen only to top 40 garbage and consume art that is produced for the main stream. Both of those avenues have become outlets for things that only cater the lowest common denominator. Something that even the dumbest of the population can understand and enjoy.</p>

<p>For music just browse through the tons of outlets that have large, small, and emerging artists.</p>

<p>For art there are also tons of sites for every type of niche art style and theme. You just need to them.</p>

<p>It could be social engineering but it&#39;s also just the fact the the younger audience has no attention span for anything more. Which is also why things seem to fly by so fast. Like hey check out this dope song, never to ever be heard on the radio again in 3 months. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The view sharpens with perspective. </p>

<p>That being said, we are in an unbelievable age of cultural diversification, driven by two factors: </p>

<ol>
<li>Any cultural touchpoint can find their rallying group online</li>
<li>The degradation of &quot;central&quot; media points, and a decentralization of cultural coverage. </li>
</ol>

<p>The last 17 years can be roughly broken up into: </p>

<p>2001-2007(ish) - Post 9/11 cultural upheaval tied with massive economic growth<br/>
2007(ish)-current - Social media domination tied with massive economic stagnation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A think a marked difference in those decades as opposed to the 2000&#39;s is connection. 
In the past people had to make an effort to physically connect. 
The great hypnotist was TV and it was easily avoided. </p>

<p>Now there is a screen in every hand connections are made instantly without the subtlety of actual socialization or social skills. 
Having your little black mirror hypnotist in your pocket has tricked people into thinking they are connected and clever.</p>

<p>Society has voluntarily become the social engineers ultimate fantasy. </p>

<p>Ignorant and detached people, thinking they are clever with the internet in their pants, never learning real social skills.</p>

<p>They never learn how to read deeply and think critically because their hypnotic monitoring device allows them to see and interpret the world.
What most do not consider is whose version of reality they are taking for granted as &quot;real&quot;  as it is fed to them through corporate applications and websites. </p>

<p>Paradoxically connected while detached and compartmentalized.
Propaganda and social cues fed direct 24/7 right into your hands as your queries and conversations are all scooped up and your profile built for whatever purpose the oligarchs and their deep state hatchet men  see fit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technology became a bigger part of everyday life for people. Express themselves more through things we cannot physically show. Whether that&#39;s what we like on Facebook, what YouTube channels we subscribe to, our spotify channels, what games we play.</p>

<p>All these things are digital and don&#39;t involve physical expression or interaction. That&#39;s just my take on it.</p>

<p>We are not doing things that involve going out and interacting with out surroundings as a collective group.</p>
