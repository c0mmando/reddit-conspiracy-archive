       We

        now know
       </a>
       that the USS Carl Vinson was in fact
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       dispatched to the North Korean peninsula as a show of strength and defiance to Jong Un. Why was this false narrative pushed by
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD6dz-e2S8">
        mainstream media
       </a>
       , and by
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ccHY0fcWTQ">
        Trump himself
       </a>
       ? You also have Chinese troops amassing at NK border right after Xi meets with Trump in Mar-a-Lago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what I think; If we would all direct our short-term memories to 1-2 weeks ago, what was the media drilling us with? Chemical attacks by Assad and Trump's subsequent response. You know exactly when the North Korea coverage ramped up and began being shoved down our throats? Right when
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OwObMIIkvo">
        this interview
       </a>
       of Assad was released, where he very cogently explains that a chemical attack by his regime in the current climate would be the dumbest possible decision to make, stating legitimate reasons why he would have had to be suicidal to do such a thing. You also had
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0cNuPd2CDk">
        Ron Paul
       </a>
       and an
       <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/384520-postol-report-sarin-syria/">
        MIT professor
       </a>
       also coming out to say it makes zero sense for Assad to do it, and it makes 100% sense for a rebel group to carry this out in order to achieve desired results.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory: People were starting to scratch their heads about who really carried out the chemical attacks, and the media needed another blitz to shake the etch-a-sketch. The drama between US and NK is a manufactured distraction. If nothing comes of it, I'd say it's pretty safe to assume, as the media is making it look like a full scale conventional or nuclear war is imminent.

       And we shouldn't. OP is on to something however. People are slowly waking up and putting things together all the while doing more (maybe not always enough) research which isn't allowing the powers that be to get away as much. Just my opinion on that.

       You're right. They don't want people focusing on
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       for too long, or else plot holes will be found. It is the media's job to then shift focus to the another subject. When there isn't an organic news story to shift to, manufacturing one is just as effective.

       The article linked about the missing carrier decries the false rhetoric by Trump as a dumb move.

       It's not a dumb move, it's a show of strength. NK was scared, so they backed down.

       I'd say they were always waking up. They just lived in the country. If you watch old movies, you'll never see a straight-up hero, always the anti-hero.

       James Cagney, arguable the most famous actor of that up and coming movement, hated those films. He was actually a great dancer, akin to Gene Kelly.

       Jack Warner forced him to make those movies.

       Humphrey Bogart also came up around that time (they were both from New York).
      </p>
      <p>
       Their films carried until the mid 50s, and then there was the Twilight Zone which was a massive red pill series (because every episode opens on characters who do not fit in their surrounding, and try to wake everyone up to the insanity of the world they live in).

       Why is it so common in conspiracy circles to see people claiming that x is a "distraction?"

       The DPRK have conducted a series of missile tests since February so this has been an ongoing story that predates the chemical attack of 4th April.
      </p>
      <p>
       What else happened on April 4th? Another missile test. And on the 15th? A massive military parade that showed off what appeared to be new ballistic missiles and ICBMs. 16th? Another missile test.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also evidence to suggest that they're planning further nuclear tests.

       Not to mention the threat to sink the Carl Vinson, strike Australia with nuclear weapons, threaten China with "catastrophic consequences" and more.

       The missile tests happen every year. The first time I was aware of them I must've been about 13. That's a long time ago. The military parade was for the Day of the Sun, also another annual event. Some of North Korea's missile tests coincide with the annual SK/US war games, which ended in around March. For some reason it's a bigger deal this year.

       I don't think you should trust Assad so much. I entirely believe it wasn't anything to do with him because like he says, it would be dumb.

       However, I don't buy it being the rebels either. I just don't believe they have the infrastructure to carry out such a sophisticated attack.

       Bill Maher was making fun of Trump for losing a fleet. This is retarded. We've become so accustomed to holding Presidents accountable for what they say publicly, or at least obsessed with fact checking it as if that's all that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple explanation is that Trump is loose with the truth and will probably tell a lie to strengthen his negotiating position. So it turns out the fleet was going south with some Japanese ships to run some military drills.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now it appears the fleet is going back north and something big with NK is looming... who knows maybe more posturing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything it should tell us to never take anything Trump says at face value.
