A lot of the contractors they use are union so they have to work during the day (ie. When your teaching). THey can&#39;t wait until the evening to do the work on the electrical things in your school</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of NORAD is participating in Vigilant Guardian on 9/11. [AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, 6/3/2002] </p>

<p>Exercise Includes Simulated Hijacking - Vanity Fair reports that the “day’s exercise” (presumably Vigilant Guardian) is “designed to run a range of scenarios, including a ‘traditional’ simulated hijack in which politically motivated perpetrators commandeer an aircraft, land on a Cuba-like island, and seek asylum.” [VANITY FAIR, 8/1/2006]</p>

<p>However, at NEADS, most of the dozen or so staff on the operations floor have no idea what the exercise is going to entail and are ready for anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that you might be misreading what was said. The title is just a school and you appear to be interpreting it as the whole district.</p>

<p>As an example, the place I work at shut the water off for 30 minutes to replace a dishwasher, switching the power off for 15 minutes is about long enough to change something out on the switch board. </p>

<p>On the other side of the wall, maintenance should be scheduled in advance but as usual, some guy with an MBA will state &quot;we can save 2.37% off the operations budget if we lay of X number of the maintenance crew, not the new guys, the super experienced ones that can do the job faster with less mistakes, and if we push the maintenance cycle all the way out to just past the recommended limits by the manufacturer then we all get massive bonuses this year and next year, followed by new jobs before it all collapses.&quot;</p>
