       I've taught for 8 years in multiple districts. THis is pretty common. Nothing to worry about. It usually means they need to replace something that requires electric. A lot of the contractors they use are union so they have to work during the day (ie. When your teaching). THey can't wait until the evening to do the work on the electrical things in your school

       Texas =/= unions. You'd be hard pressed to find unions outside of police, fire, teachers, and federal employee unions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Electric companies all over Texas work night, day, and weekends. Source: live in Texas, work in Texas, and work with electric companies on a lot of after hours events. None of the guys are union workers to my knowledge.

       There are drills going on all the time. Got a source on the latter claim? There was a computer-simulated exercise where one scenario was a normal hijacking.

       There were multiple drills that day, and I think the one that they were talking about would be the one with the most ironic name:  Vigilant Guardian.

        All of NORAD is participating in Vigilant Guardian on 9/11. [AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, 6/3/2002]
       </p>
       <p>
        Exercise Includes Simulated Hijacking - Vanity Fair reports that the “day’s exercise” (presumably Vigilant Guardian) is “designed to run a range of scenarios, including a ‘traditional’ simulated hijack in which politically motivated perpetrators commandeer an aircraft, land on a Cuba-like island, and seek asylum.” [VANITY FAIR, 8/1/2006]
       </p>
       <p>
        However, at NEADS, most of the dozen or so staff on the operations floor have no idea what the exercise is going to entail and are ready for anything.

       Yeah. Totally sketchy. It's not like power companies ever do maintenance or anything.

       Power suppliers, like telecom, have a maintenance window, usually those hours are between midnight and 5am to lessen the disruption to customers. Having this done during the day for only 15 minutes is sketchy as fuck.

       Can confirm most work like this is done at night to not piss off your customer. Because they can easily just go find a different contractor to do the job at night so there are no interruptions in their business. This is also true of cellular tower maintenance like you say.

       Meh, I'm telecom tech and I've spent the last 2 years in schools almost entirely. We do everything during the day because the district can't afford the night differential, not to mention their 9-5 network engineers don't want to work late.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now for the mutual fund company my company does work for everything is done at night because they can afford it and stopping business would cost millions.

       But this is the former and not the latter.

       I doubt any business or institution would allow a complete shutdown during operating hours to save a few pennies. I smell bull $hit.

       I think that you might be misreading what was said. The title is just a school and you appear to be interpreting it as the whole district.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, the place I work at shut the water off for 30 minutes to replace a dishwasher, switching the power off for 15 minutes is about long enough to change something out on the switch board.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other side of the wall, maintenance should be scheduled in advance but as usual, some guy with an MBA will state "we can save 2.37% off the operations budget if we lay of X number of the maintenance crew, not the new guys, the super experienced ones that can do the job faster with less mistakes, and if we push the maintenance cycle all the way out to just past the recommended limits by the manufacturer then we all get massive bonuses this year and next year, followed by new jobs before it all collapses."

       Just a 'coincidence'? will see what happens tomorrow.
It's just a giant waiting game now. But I really hope nothing does happen.
