    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fine; how then are we deciding whether each bank is Rothschild-owned or not? Syria and North Korea have central banks, but it&#39;s often said here (and elsewhere) that those two countries do <em>not</em> have &quot;Rothschild-owned&quot; central banks.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that nearly every country has a central bank; the key claim of <strong>Rothschild-owned</strong> central bank is what I never see sourcing for.</p>

<p>Also, the list you provided features countries (like Syria and North Korea) that are often claimed to <em>not</em> have a <strong>Rothschild-owned</strong> central bank. So, the key here is not whether they have a central bank or not (since they do), it&#39;s how we&#39;re concluding whether or not a central bank is owned by the Rothschilds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rothschild&#39;s don&#39;t own Central Banks.  They were influential in the creation of the modern Central Banking system.  This system is called the Basel policy, and was set up by the Bank for International Settlements.  The BIS dictates policy for all central banks that operate under Basel.  Basel policy is very reminiscent of Rothschild style banking, in which the government must borrow money from the Central Bank at interest to pay for their yearly budget.  This money is &quot;fundraised&quot; by investors who buy government bonds (government debt).  The government then has to pay back this money at interest to the bondholder over a certain period of time.  This is a system in which the government of a country essentially remains indebted to private &quot;backers&quot; with enough capital to buy bonds.  Bonds are generally seen as a good investment, because in a stable country a government will always have the ability to collect taxes.  </p>

<p>There is usually some farcical tenet in which a Central Bank will appear subservient to someone in Government, but the truth is Central Banks operate with little to no oversight from the government, and they are the ones to dictate terms to a government.  In Canada, the Central Bank &quot;answers to&quot; the Finance Minister, but there hasn&#39;t been a single example in history where a Finance Minister has overruled a decision by the Bank.</p>

<p>Many Central Banks operated very differently before adopting the Basel policy.  Before 1974, The Canadian Government used it&#39;s Central Bank to print money for it&#39;s budgets interest free.  No private bondmarket, the bank was under the governments control.  If there was a deficit it would make up for it the next fiscal year.  <a href="https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/authors/brief%20history%2012.png">This is what the Canadian Government&#39;s debt burden looks like over time</a>, notice what happens after 1974?  Paying interest on accrued debt is now the fastest rising part of a Government budget, it is nearing 10% of the budget and rising fast.  Make no mistake, there is simply no way of reversing this trend at this point under this system.  It is like a positive feedback loop that is out of control.  It is how bankers have enslaved nations, as private financial institutions are the largest bondholders.  Look at the employment history of the Presidents of every major Central Bank, they are almost unanimously of an investment banking background.  These people are loyal to the private banking elite, not a country and it&#39;s people.  </p>

<p>There are a few Central Banks that don&#39;t operate under Basel Policy, North Korea, Iran, you know, the Countries scheduled for regime change.  These banks print money for the government interest free, and are completely controlled by the government.  So there is some truth to the &quot;Rothschild Central Bank&quot; theory, but it&#39;s a misnomer, and should be called &quot;Rothschild style Central Bank.&quot;</p>
