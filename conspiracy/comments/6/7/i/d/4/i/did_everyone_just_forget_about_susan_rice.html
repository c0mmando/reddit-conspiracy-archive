Whether she did anything inappropriate is a matter of much debate. From a privacy standpoint, I think all the surveillance is bullshit regardless of circumstance, but it is not clear if she did anything actually illegal, and it looks like the matter has been tabled by all those concerned.

<p>&quot;Their connections to Russia.&quot;</p>

<p>What about the connections the Democrats have to Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar?

<p>I guess it&#39;s not important that <em>both</em> sides of the political aisle are compromised, right? And I guess it&#39;s not important that the Constitution is being shat on to attack someone the Left doesn&#39;t like. &#39;Cuz us and them and Trump being &quot;literally Hitler.&quot;</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re talking about when you say &quot;leaking a letter from the director of the FBI about an ongoing investigation.&quot; Are you referring to Comey&#39;s <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/29/exclusive-comey-memo-to-fbi-staffers-says-election-timing-required-disclosure-renewed-probe.html">memo</a> to FBI agents that was &quot;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rudy-giuliani-fbi-clinton-emails_us_581c9e3fe4b0e80b02c93d6b">leaked</a>&quot;? </p>

<p>Ah, so she <em>was</em> unmasking names? But I thought she wasn&#39;t unmasking names? And to suggest such a thing was absurd? Because the Obama administration wouldn&#39;t do that, right? They had no reason, remember? </p>

<p>I&#39;m referring to the fact that the Left doesn&#39;t care <em>how</em> Trump is taken down, so long that he is. That is why you will cheer when he is murdered. Which is surely to happen soon. He has become the focus of so much attention, so much energy is directed at him, that when they kill him it is going to be an orgasmic release.</p>

<p>Actually, your point makes no sense in this regard because Comey was appointed by Obama and has considerable ties to the Clintons. Check out his history with the HSBC bank and the Clinton Foundation&#39;s association with the HSBC bank and their clients. </p>

<p>The fact is, this has all been a pageant for the benefit of the herd. The elite are closer to giving the call to pull it and this is part of that. This is how they&#39;re going to destroy this country. </p>

<p>Ah, well if that&#39;s what the Obama administration told you, no reason to question them, right? &#39;Cuz, again, it&#39;s not like they were caught using the machinery of the Federal government to attack their political enemies in the past, or anything.</p>

<p>Question, why do you trust anything the Federal government tells you, or the news, which disseminates information for the state?</p>

<p>No, they didn&#39;t. The Obama administration denied that anyone from their administration eavesdropped on any Trump official. Only now we know they did. And so the story has become, &quot;Oh, well, uh, we were spying on, uh, foreign nationals, yeah, that&#39;s it, and uh, we just happened to, uh, listen in on them talking to people it turns out were Trump&#39;s people.&quot; The story evolved from it being ridiculous, totally unbelievable, absolutely offensive to suggest anyone from the Obama administration listened in on anything from the Trump campaign, to now of course it happened, but it&#39;s totally not what Trump said it was. It was &quot;incidental.&quot; And we should trust Obama and his holdovers and the media because, gosh, they&#39;ve never once lied to us, right?</p>

<p>The Donald Trump is the head of the <em>Executive Branch</em>, not the Federal government.</p>

<p>How convenient that Breitbart has covered this subject so that when people point these things out folks like you can say, &quot;But you&#39;re saying exactly what Breitbart said! You must be a Trump supporter!&quot; I&#39;m sure it helps with reducing the cognitive dissonance to tell yourself because Breitbart also said something, that means it isn&#39;t true.

<h2>**If this was all routine, why did the Obama administration not simply say all of this was routine? Why did they deny it happened, then as more information came out, gradually admit it happened, but it wasn&#39;t a big deal? Do you not understand the timeline of events? Do you not understand what actually happened? Why, if this was no big deal, did they not simply come right out and say it? First they denied that anyone was being spied on. Then they had to admit that they were being spied on, but it was an accident. Then they said no-one from Obama&#39;s team did the unmasking, only for it to suddenly come out that it was in fact Obama&#39;s team who did the unmasking. Again, WHY did they lie? Why?</h2>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh... Yes. They did. And this kind of response? &quot;Nobody is claiming she wasn&#39;t unmasking names,&quot; is the product of good propaganda and brainwashing. First, the Obama administration denied any knowledge of what Trump was talking about. It was impossible, unbelievable, silly. &quot;No-one was listening to Trump or to his people! This is a conspiracy theory!&quot; Then, as it came out that Rice was responsible for unmasking names of people &quot;incidentally being spied on,&quot; the official story has gradually transformed into, &quot;She was just doing her job!&quot; If she was just doing her job, why didn&#39;t they admit to her doing her job in the first place? Why deny, pivot, deny, pivot, deny, then act like you never denied anything and the truth was always that they admitted to doing it but it was no big deal?</p>

<p><em>And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed -if all records told the same tale — then the lie passed into history and became truth. &#39;Who controls the past,&#39; ran the Party slogan, &#39;controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.&#39; And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. &#39;Reality control&#39;, they called it: in Newspeak, &#39;doublethink&#39;. . .</em></p>

<p><em>His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget, whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself — that was the ultimate subtlety; consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word &#39;doublethink&#39; involved the use of doublethink.</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd to think that the only reason the CIA would gather intelligence on Russian agents is to get at Trump. His team got caught talking to foreign agents.</p>
