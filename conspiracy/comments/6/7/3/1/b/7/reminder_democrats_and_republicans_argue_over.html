<p>And the EPA threw what funding it did have at that Beale guy for 20+  years, hired as the top authority on AGW and paid the most of any EPA employee not including his bogus travel expenses.</p>

<p>He had the entire EPA including his supervisors believing he was CIA under cover secret agent and he never came into work. Charged the EPA for his luxury hotels and first class tickets to London and visits to his mom.</p>

<p>In 20 years they never thought to ask the CIA about it or a Congress oversight committee.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cost increasing is to be expected, skyrocketing is not. This is what happens wherever you put a subsidy on anything. Romneycare/obamacare was primarily written by lobbyists, and it did fuckall to help out the average American. Now instead of buying insurance with whatever coverage you wish, you get to pay more for some BS one size fits all option to subsidize others. Can you guess who made a profit of all this? Large insurance companies. </p>

<p>And btw, the &quot;the insurance company needs to give you insurance regardless of pre-existing condition&quot; notion is ridiculous. You aren&#39;t going to wreck your car and then waltz into AAA trying to buy coverage on it, so why do you think that&#39;s how healthcare should work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, let me tell you about the pre existing condition plans. They are much more expensive, and they don&#39;t cover specialists or anything you might need for a pre existing condition.</p>

<p>So, you end up paying out of pocket for your treatment, like you would have without the ACA, only now you have to fork money for no return to a corporation or face a penalty tax.</p>

<p>Meanwhile your out of pocket medical costs continue to skyrocket cause people either know and don&#39;t care, or, like you, think everything&#39;s fine now.</p>

<p>I have a pre existing condition, so I initially supported the ACA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give the people the means of production, problem solved. And by people I don&#39;t mean a representative government that abstracts the people away. I mean a non-hierarchical system of nested administrative areas that allow the creation, maintenance, and dissolution of governing bodies as needed.</p>

<p>Think of it like a file directory. Folders contain files but folders don&#39;t tell the files what to do. There&#39;s permissions, but if I&#39;m a program that can interact with files the folder doesn&#39;t get to stop me every step of the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you&#39;ll never prove that they are the same by voting for Republicans. Democrats say they want to help. Call their bluff. Voting Republican serves at best to delay the inevitable fall through their government interference. With the democrats there is at least a chance they&#39;ll do something good. Unlike Republicans they can&#39;t hide behind blaming the poor or using religion to manipulate the masses.</p>

<p>Democrats also didn&#39;t want the ISP laws. If we lose net neutrality, we will be plunged into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcy8uLjRHPM">confusion and uncertainty even further.</a></p>
