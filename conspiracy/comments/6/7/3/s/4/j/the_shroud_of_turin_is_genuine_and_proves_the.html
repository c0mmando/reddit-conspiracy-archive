      <p>
       The Shroud of Turin, if genuine, is one of the most important historical artifacts or records that conclusively proves the reality of the life of the "Jesus" of Nazareth, his death, and even his resurrection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Archaeologists, medical doctors, scientists, and others have extensively analyzed the Shroud, and there is growing concensus that it is authentic. They cannot find any evidence that it is a forgery, and have determined that it would be far too difficult, if not impossible, to do so. They cannot explain how the image on the shroud was created.
      </p>
      <p>
       The image on the shroud (which could not have been painted) depicts wounds on the body of a man exactly corresponding to the accounts in the Bible. The image has been found to have been made with actual human blood. The blood stains (image) show no sign of smearing or pulling apart as would be the case if a body were unwrapped while removing it (possible explanation: the body "vanished" and the cloth was left behind).
      </p>
      <p>
       Further evidence:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Scourge marks on the shoulders, back, and legs of the man of the shroud match the flagrum (roman whip) which has three leather thongs. Wounds one the forehead from the crown of thorns are visible.
       </li>
       <li>
        Recently, a researcher analyzed some visible writing on the shroud and claims to have translated the writing, finding that it effectively was a "death certificate", written in greek, latin, and aramaic -- containing the greek words "(I)esou(s) Nnazarennos", or "Jesus the Nazarene"....from a piece of paper placed on the body containing that writing.
       </li>
       <li>
        The image indicates that coins were placed over the eyes of the corpse, and they have found coin-lettering consistent with the lepton (widow's mite) minted by Pontius Pilate between 29 - 32 AD.
       </li>
       <li>
        Analysis has shows that pollen and floral imprints found in the Shroud only exist in the area around Jerusalem.
       </li>
       <li>
        Chemical analysis of travertine aragonite calcium, found on in the Shroud's fabric, strongly suggests it was once in direct physical contact with one of Jerusalem's limestone caves or tombs.
       </li>
      </ol>

       Of course Jesus probably existed and Moses probably existed but they sure as hell weren't ressurected. Any attempt to tell you so is an elitist scheme to distract and divide the working class with petty differences.

       How wrong you are my brother. Want more signs of His coming soon? Look up the great sign of Revelation 12 that occurs Sept 23 of this very year. Time is short.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 7 year tribulation that is about to come upon this fallen wicked world is the last and final oppurtunity to accept the truth and reality that that there are many false "gods" but there is only One True Living God, that loves you so much, that he gave Himself as the attoning sacrifice for all our sins. ALL sin. His name is Yeshua (Jesus) the Christ/Messiah.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we do have a choice to make. Choose to accept, or choose to reject. That is the price of free will, you can choose eternal death if you wish.
      </p>
      <p>
       One choice.
Two paths to choose from.
No neutral ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the last days. You don't even need to be a believer to be able to see we are coming to a breaking point. Everything we are seeing today, the very conspiracies unearthed in this sub are pre-fulfillment of prophecy.

       Is this a repost?  Feel like I see this every year...  and have since I was able to read.  Doesn't seem to bother Christians that they're wrong in regular intervals.  One may realize it but along comes another to pick up the slack.

       They used the same contaminated fibers but came up with different results? Interesting.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nickell pointed out that Fanti's tests "involve three different procedures — each with its own problems — which are then averaged together to produce the result." He said that stands in contrast with 1988's mass spectrometry tests, which yielded a date range between 1260 and 1390. Fanti says those earlier tests were not "statistically reliable," but Nickell and most scientists are sticking with the verdict rendered in 1988.

       <p>
        Because there's "no degree of security" as to the authenticity of the fiber samples, the shroud's custodians "cannot recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged experiments," Nosiglia said in a statement quoted by La Stampa's Vatican Insider. The archbishop's comments "put stakes into Fanti's work," Vatican Insider reported.

       So fucking what. 
There is a Jew 2000 years ago who entertained the masses with some parlor tricks. BFD.
Christians can't seem to make out the difference between the New and Old Testament. 
If you are a Christian you should not even recognize the Old Testament.
What is it about American "Christians".....stupid fucks.

       Anyway even if "real" it has all been programmed into this simulation. Try some comparative religious studies. 
Buddha predates this childish Judeo Christian crap. 
This country will fall apart because of its "faith".
There is nothing altruistic in the American flavor of Christianity.

       So you revere Buddha, but you try to disparage me and others for following the teachings of the Messiah.

       How do you get that out of the original post?  All I'm talking about is proof that the Messiah existed and was crucified and resurrected according to the Bible, and you bring up a subject not even mentioned -- ie, the racial component.

       Wow.  This really triggered you, didn't it?

       But you are right.  The true descendants of the Israelites are the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, and European peoples.  So this is really a "European thing".  Not just an American thing.

       I'm sorry. You are saying that all Europeans are descended from Israelites? Really? I'm sure they would have been happy believing in their Norse paganism had the Ronan's not found it politically favorable to embrace a renegade Jews teachings and pushed conversion o the European populace. Check your facts. If these teachings compel you to act altruistically and really help others than I can not fault it. Those actions should come without justification and necessity to convert those around you. 
It always gets me that christians often miss the message. 
"Serving your fellow man" isn't exclusive to Christianity.

       As a Christian, I can't give this item much importance either way. If it is real, then ppl will worship
       <em>
        it
       </em>
       instead of God. If it is not, then it can be used to distract and confuse issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scriptures have been designated by God as His method of communicating His truth. It is the final authority and provides many evidences to substantiate its authenticity and authority --like fulfilled prophecies.

       And how do you substantiate fulfilled prophecies?  Often by looking at extra-biblical historical accounts and evidence.  That's similar to what the Shround of Turin does.  It is more evidence validating the biblical account.

       So what if you are right then? What happens? We all convert? Everything is great? The judgement comes down from on high?  Fantasies of the Rapture? Everyone who isn't a Christian goes to hell?
Babies stillborn are in limbo? Dantes inferno?
What is the point? Trash the planet because it doesn't matter anyway? Since you are going to a paradise? 
Do you get 70 virgins there? Or are you a god on your own planet like the mormons? Or do you go to Valhalla?
Fantasy future tense.
Hey this is here and now.
Go out today and find someone who needs help.
Forget spending an hour in whatever church you waste time in contributing money for the preachers new car and actually go talk to a junkie or someone homeless, and deal with their inability to stay on their prescribed meds. 
Go help someone. 
That is Christlike.
Not hanging onto some cloth with some smudges that look like a man you think is your savior.

       Be someone's savior.

       No.  The Bible does not say that the earth is only 6,000 years old.  It only says Adam and Eve were created around 6,000 years ago. The earth is older than they are.

       There were other races of human on the earth before Adam and Eve were created.  And the earth was destroyed in a cataclysm some time before Adam and Eve were created.  There was life on the earth for a long time prior to the creation of Adam and Eve.  Who knows how long.  It could have been tens of thousands of years.

       You seem hung up on proving the mystery you cling to.
I understand this.
My heartfelt advice is to do more than try to convince others with your "well researched"facts. 
While I don't agree with your "facts" I feel whatever justification you seek may be found in your actions. 
Go help someone. Go help the worst most undeserving person you can find. 
That is to be Christlike.
That is to be like your messiah.

       It means nothing that your messiah did all these things if you don't hear the message.
Don't let an atheist illuminate you.
Be like your Christ. It isn't about shrouds, it is about how you act.
I will face your messiah proudly as a non believer and will proudly stand for what I have done for my fellow man.
Can you say the same?

       But unless they had DNA, it will never be definitive. Just cause controversies. Also, what difference would it make?  If it is from Jesus or not, will it impact faith?  What does it prove?

       Your title suggested there was some evidence here that would imply that the "resurrection" of jesus actually happened, but I don't see that in your post at all.

       No.  This CAN be proven or disproven using science, history, logic, etc.

       But by your own standard, does that mean that things like UFOs, remote viewing, Niburu, and similar subjects cannot be discussed here?

       All genuine truth seekers should be opposed to censorship.  I'm not trying to introduce topics that have nothing whatsoever to do with the intent of the forum.  You are opposed to this topic because it does not fit YOUR narrow view of what should be classified as a "conspiracy" topic.

       It's just strange to me that your making it sound like gathering more proof is a bad thing. I get your proud of how much faith you have, but don't cheat the world of an explanation.
