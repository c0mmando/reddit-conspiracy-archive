    <div class="md"><p>Which is a bad thing - they are crushing our spiritual side, which is very important - theres more to life than living like a debt slave; much of if is worldly, but a lot of it is also practicing an acknowledgement and an appreciation to a greater driving force - call it what you want, God, the Ying and Yang, collective consciousness - but its good that people do that.</p>

<p>Notice- all the bigger religions are being assaulted: christians look like zealots or psychopaths and are constantly shit on in pop culture; muslims are &#39;protected&#39; by pop culture, but meanwhile, the news makes them look like savages decapitating everyone; Jews are accused of running everything and being greedy and crushing society under its foot - its so obvious now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be completely honest, I rejected customary religion decades ago and haven&#39;t &quot;re-evaluated&quot; <em>other</em> avenues, or deeper understandings yet. I&#39;m not an atheist, and would have a hard time labeling it anything, for that matter. I suppose I&#39;m a blank slate right now, too consumed with the nonsense societal expectations of day-to-day to even open my mind up to such things. If not soon, I&#39;ll probably die just like many others..slaving away...for no meaning, at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In some ways I could agree that many of my traits, better or for worse, originated at some point with my parents, their parents and so forth-- with its ultimate roots stemming from religion. There&#39;s some fine lessons there, even I could admit that, but as an adult, I have no need for any of it. It&#39;s been used as a control mechanism for centuries, while squashing progress on many fronts. Exiling people, killing them, convincing them to drink actual suicidal kool aid, or starting profitable wars.</p>

<p>I am a huge proponent of science, but think to myself often &quot;really, there&#39;s nothing else?&quot;. I&#39;m just here to experience myself, not knowing why or how I&#39;m able to do this..or even if I should? Huge questions, of which I nor science have the answers for. So, with that being said, I&#39;ve been long overdue to drop back and really delve into higher meanings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That figure of 80,000 Aztec sacrifices is estimated <em>for a single four-day ceremony in 1487</em>. </p>

<p>Quite a few of your numbers are way off but the point stands.</p>

<p>&quot;Thus  we  find  the  same  impulse
acting  in  the  most  opposite  quarters  of  the  globe,  and  the  Asiatic,  the
European,  and  the  American,  each  earnestly  invoking  the  holy  name  of
religion in the perpetration of human butchery.&quot; </p>

<li>WH Prescott</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Strange,  that  in  every  country  the  most  fiendish
passions  of  the  human  heart  have  been  those  kindled  in  the  name  of
religion!&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>WH Prescott</li>
</ul>

<p>Well holy shit! I tend to write my name and date on the inside cover of second-hand books, to continue the chain of ownership, and I have a few dated 11 Sep 2001. One of those books was *The Histroy of the Conquest of Mexico&quot; by W. H. Prescott. It&#39;s a masterpiece of historical writing that all aspiring historians should read. I found the above quotes from the book while using DDG and Google to locate one of my favourite quotes of all time. I figured if all those quote sites have nothing then surely Google Books or something would have it. Nope. Nothing.</p>

<p>I tried every combination of the key words in the quote that I could think of (even including the words &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Prescott&quot; still gave top results for the Holocaust) but got nothing. I even went so far as to use Find on pdf copies to no avail. Then I remembered that I had quoted it a few years ago on a gaming forum, so searched for my name with the keywords. Sure enough, my forum posts showed up... and they&#39;re apparently one of only two sources for the quote on the internet. I checked the quote on the forum and confirmed the forum quote with the page in the physical book. The second is from Wikisource which has a scanned page waiting for proofreading. It took me a second to realise what I was seeing - with the exception of that single <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:The_Conquest_of_Mexico_Volume_2.djvu/328">Wikisource page</a>, the entire paragraph has been removed from every online copy I could find.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A subsequent insurrection was punished with greater severity. They rose on the Spaniards, massacred five hundred of their oppressors, and menaced with destruction the neighbouring settlement of San Estevan. Cortés ordered Sandoval to chastise the insurgents, and that officer, after a campaign of incredible hardship, completely routed the barbarians, captured four hundred of their chiefs, and, after the affected formalities of a trial, sentenced every man of them to the stake or the gibbet. &quot;By which means,&quot; says Cortés, &quot;God be praised! the safety of the Spaniards was secured and the province once more restored to tranquillity and peace.&quot; He had omitted to mention in his letter his ungenerous treatment of Guatemozin. But the undisguised and naive manner, so to speak, in which he details these circumstances to the emperor, shows that he attached no discredit to the deed. <strong>It was the just recompense of rebellion; a word that has been made the apology for more atrocities than any other word,—save religion.</strong></p>
