       In my opinion, some of the most MAJOR propaganda that is sitting right in front of our eyes is the propaganda against government and religion - realize that government and religion are GOOD things; they have just been infiltrated by bad people.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are the mob. Good government and good religion are our allies against the aristocracy - they are trying to destroy these institutions that WE created, from the inside out.  Government isn't the final boss here.

       By a strange coincidence, the weaponry of the Spanish Inquisition are also four: fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency, and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pople.

       It's irrelevant from my point of view, and for this argument, so are completely accurate figures. Point is, religion has killed a heck of a lot of people, and IMO continues to hold back the collective progress of humanity.

       I could agree with that, though I feel we will either all remain stagnant and die from it somehow, or continue to move away from religion altogether. People are increasingly abandoning it from what I've observed.

       Which is a bad thing - they are crushing our spiritual side, which is very important - theres more to life than living like a debt slave; much of if is worldly, but a lot of it is also practicing an acknowledgement and an appreciation to a greater driving force - call it what you want, God, the Ying and Yang, collective consciousness - but its good that people do that.

       Notice- all the bigger religions are being assaulted: christians look like zealots or psychopaths and are constantly shit on in pop culture; muslims are 'protected' by pop culture, but meanwhile, the news makes them look like savages decapitating everyone; Jews are accused of running everything and being greedy and crushing society under its foot - its so obvious now

       To be completely honest, I rejected customary religion decades ago and haven't "re-evaluated"
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       avenues, or deeper understandings yet. I'm not an atheist, and would have a hard time labeling it anything, for that matter. I suppose I'm a blank slate right now, too consumed with the nonsense societal expectations of day-to-day to even open my mind up to such things. If not soon, I'll probably die just like many others..slaving away...for no meaning, at all.

       I think there is a lot of merit in not getting overly caught up in religion when we have a major detriment at hand right now - you should be proud of that.  There's far too many people 'turning to God' or Jesus right now, when really they should be looking within or looking to one another

       In some ways I could agree that many of my traits, better or for worse, originated at some point with my parents, their parents and so forth-- with its ultimate roots stemming from religion. There's some fine lessons there, even I could admit that, but as an adult, I have no need for any of it. It's been used as a control mechanism for centuries, while squashing progress on many fronts. Exiling people, killing them, convincing them to drink actual suicidal kool aid, or starting profitable wars.

       I am a huge proponent of science, but think to myself often "really, there's nothing else?". I'm just here to experience myself, not knowing why or how I'm able to do this..or even if I should? Huge questions, of which I nor science have the answers for. So, with that being said, I've been long overdue to drop back and really delve into higher meanings.

       And in terms of meaning, I think we take the importance of life for granted.  We think there is meaning in death, but there is probably more so in life - im the same way though,, i slave away daily and pay my taxes like a good bitch because i havenT got this all figured out yet

       Well holy shit! I tend to write my name and date on the inside cover of second-hand books, to continue the chain of ownership, and I have a few dated 11 Sep 2001. One of those books was *The Histroy of the Conquest of Mexico" by W. H. Prescott. It's a masterpiece of historical writing that all aspiring historians should read. I found the above quotes from the book while using DDG and Google to locate one of my favourite quotes of all time. I figured if all those quote sites have nothing then surely Google Books or something would have it. Nope. Nothing.

       I tried every combination of the key words in the quote that I could think of (even including the words "Mexico" and "Prescott" still gave top results for the Holocaust) but got nothing. I even went so far as to use Find on pdf copies to no avail. Then I remembered that I had quoted it a few years ago on a gaming forum, so searched for my name with the keywords. Sure enough, my forum posts showed up... and they're apparently one of only two sources for the quote on the internet. I checked the quote on the forum and confirmed the forum quote with the page in the physical book. The second is from Wikisource which has a scanned page waiting for proofreading. It took me a second to realise what I was seeing - with the exception of that single

       , the entire paragraph has been removed from every online copy I could find.

        A subsequent insurrection was punished with greater severity. They rose on the Spaniards, massacred five hundred of their oppressors, and menaced with destruction the neighbouring settlement of San Estevan. Cortés ordered Sandoval to chastise the insurgents, and that officer, after a campaign of incredible hardship, completely routed the barbarians, captured four hundred of their chiefs, and, after the affected formalities of a trial, sentenced every man of them to the stake or the gibbet. "By which means," says Cortés, "God be praised! the safety of the Spaniards was secured and the province once more restored to tranquillity and peace." He had omitted to mention in his letter his ungenerous treatment of Guatemozin. But the undisguised and naive manner, so to speak, in which he details these circumstances to the emperor, shows that he attached no discredit to the deed.

         It was the just recompense of rebellion; a word that has been made the apology for more atrocities than any other word,—save religion.
