       So,  my best friends son makes references of the Illuminati to me last weekend. He's 12. My daughter just five minutes ago asks me what illuminati is.  She is 7.,she heard it from her best friend at school. Either people are waking up and kids are picking it up with them (eavesdropping) or the latter,  which scares me,  people are waking up to the bs stories that make conspiracy look like a joke. Should I be pleased hearing chatter or worried?

       He heard about it from one of the rappers. Hip hop culture has an elaborate superstition about "the Illuminati." It's kind of like how the metalheads back in the 1980s were always into "Satanism."

       Just tell him the truth - the "Illuminati" is a silly superstition promoted in the music industry to sell records.

       That's not a lie. The historical Illuminati was disestablished in the 1700s. The modern "Illuminati" is a fairy story.

       Yes, as a matter of fact I do. The "Illuminati" discussed in rap music has no relation to the actual historical Illuminati - in fact, they don't even have the same mythology. All they share is a name.

       When they are "persecuted" (ie. get too much attention) they go underground and usually change tactics. One such example could be Oculus and the Illuminati, or one could say Illuminati and Skull and Bones. They popped up after the Illuminati "disbanded". Obviously no one knows for sure, but we do have evidence in history of this within religious sects, as well.

       I know how gullible people are, doesn't negate the fact that there has to be some historically fact/symbolism in order to trick someone. Hence, what we are talking about.

        there is no evidence that these present-day groups have amassed significant political power or influence, and most, rather than trying to remain secret, promote unsubstantiated links to the Bavarian Illuminati as a means of attracting membership.

       <p>
        The Illuminati—along with Freemasonry and other secret societies—were outlawed through edict, by the Bavarian ruler, Charles Theodore, with the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787 and 1790.
        <strong>
         In the several years following, the group was vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.

       You can deny all you want, there is plenty of evidence they never went away and freemasonry is alive today. 5 million in the United States. There is a fucking mason lodge right up the street from me.

       So there "seems to have been a deathblow" when it was outlawed and Weishaupt ran away. And this is your evidence for the final end of the Illuminati? Because the creator fled? What happened to all the members? I wonder, where do you suppose Weishaupt went and what do you suppose he did afterwards? Must have quit his Illuminati business and retired along with all the members, huh? Maybe he went on to become a rapper and sing about the fake Illuminati. Keep touting that zero evidence, it's hitting my sweet tooth.

       No idea. Could all be posturing. I will say that the so-called "Illuminati" do not seem particularly "illuminated." They seem very selfish, sensation-seeking and not altogether bright. All they have going for them is an immorality that lends itself to dishonest cruelty that gives them a leg up over people with a moral. compass.

       YouTube, man. My 11yo repeats shit he hears from there all the time and to the little kids, it's just a nonsense meme, like '420' and 'Bush did 9/11' (sorry, my examples are less than dank, I can't keep up...). They really have no idea what they're yammering about. They make the little triangle with their fingers, hold it up to their eye, hum a little X-files theme or some shit like that. Meaningless nonsense.
