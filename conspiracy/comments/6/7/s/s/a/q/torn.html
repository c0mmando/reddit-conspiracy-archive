<p>He heard about it from one of the rappers. Hip hop culture has an elaborate superstition about &quot;the Illuminati.&quot; It&#39;s kind of like how the metalheads back in the 1980s were always into &quot;Satanism.&quot;</p>

<p>What mythology is that? What do rappers talk about which is different than what the Illuminati espoused?</p>

<p>When they are &quot;persecuted&quot; (ie. get too much attention) they go underground and usually change tactics. One such example could be Oculus and the Illuminati, or one could say Illuminati and Skull and Bones. They popped up after the Illuminati &quot;disbanded&quot;. Obviously no one knows for sure, but we do have evidence in history of this within religious sects, as well. </p>

<p>The Illuminati—along with Freemasonry and other secret societies—were outlawed through edict, by the Bavarian ruler, Charles Theodore, with the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787 and 1790. <strong>In the several years following, the group was vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No idea. Could all be posturing. I will say that the so-called &quot;Illuminati&quot; do not seem particularly &quot;illuminated.&quot; They seem very selfish, sensation-seeking and not altogether bright. All they have going for them is an immorality that lends itself to dishonest cruelty that gives them a leg up over people with a moral. compass. </p>

My 11yo repeats shit he hears from there all the time and to the little kids, it&#39;s just a nonsense meme, like &#39;420&#39; and &#39;Bush did 9/11&#39; (sorry, my examples are less than dank, I can&#39;t keep up...). They really have no idea what they&#39;re yammering about. They make the little triangle with their fingers, hold it up to their eye, hum a little X-files theme or some shit like that. Meaningless nonsense.</p>
