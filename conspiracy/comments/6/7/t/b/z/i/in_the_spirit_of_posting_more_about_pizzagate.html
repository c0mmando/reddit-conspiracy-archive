<p>Most of us know about the email from Tamera Luzzato where she mentions the three kids that will be in a heated swimming pool at night for the &quot;entertainment&quot; of the adults at the party.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736</a></p>

<p>Sketchy, but by no means is it concrete proof of anything. This is level 1 </p>

<p>Level 2 is the blog &quot;Evie&#39;s Crib&quot;. Most of us who have researched pizzagate know about this.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/Ij7zB">http://archive.is/Ij7zB</a></p>

<p>Note the header: </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Tamera is sure making herself difficult to defend. At this point, any reasonable person is having some serious questions about what exactly this blog is being used for, and what Tamera Luzatto is doing with these kids. </p>

<p>Next level: Tamera links us to &quot;Jack Lowell&#39;s&quot; blog: <a href="https://archive.is/GBcUU">https://archive.is/GBcUU</a></p>

<p>Where are the debunkers at? </p>

<p>How anyone can brush this off as a baseless conspiracy theory is beyond me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, it is the most straightforward evidence that should raise a flag for any reasonable person.</p>

<p>The fact he was never asked about #hotard, or the countless other sketchy pictures was what did it for me.</p>

<p>His explanation of the girl taped to the table also was super weak. <a href="https://archive.is/YJJnJ/ae6b0c66d7e98032eab9196b04342e01fffbf009/scr.png">https://archive.is/YJJnJ/ae6b0c66d7e98032eab9196b04342e01fffbf009/scr.png</a></p>

<p>He claims that the girl&#39;s &quot;kid sister&quot; taped her hands.</p>

<p>Does that tape job look like the work of a child or an adult?</p>

<p>Because a one armed idiot can tape something to a table and masking tape couldn&#39;t hold a fly to the table much less a little girl. A light pressure would pull all that tape up. </p>

<p>This this is serious question? LOOK AT YOUR POST! Anyone who is even vaguely connected gets their lives torn apart to try and implicate them in a child pedo ring. Why would they? You would just say they were in on it. Don&#39;t you lie about that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why haven&#39;t we seen any evidence that this girl is safe with her parents?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What gives you the right to demand that? You have given no evidence that would require such a thing.  That family knows EXACTLY what would happen if they came out and so do you. Pizzagate would immediately dox them and dig into every aspect of their lives to some how implicate them.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Half the internet doesn&#39;t believe in pizzagate. Hell half the internet probably hasn&#39;t even heard of it. IF I was implicated in Pizzagate I would sure as fuck keep my head down because you guys wouldn&#39;t care what I have to say you want confirmation of the conclusion you already came to and if I DARED to speak against it you would go out of your way to try and ruin my life. I would stay anonymous BECAUSE I care about my safety and privacy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for asking question. But you are not asking questions you are demanding the answers that you want and will accept nothing else. This kind closed minded thinking is exactly what doesn&#39;t belong here. </p>

<p>Ever heard of the term mentally shackled? There was a man who kept his victims in a shed. They thought they were locked in. The door wasn&#39;t locked. They never tried to escape.</p>

<p>Or you know. Someone who thought it was a silly picture. If one of my nieces taped down the arms of another one I would sure as shit take a picture of it because its funny and an adorable moment. I don&#39;t know how anyone can read it as anything else. </p>

<p>None of that is remotely true. How would a one-armed person even peel and rip the tape? This makes no sense. There is no way that girl is going to free herself easily.</p>

<p>This this is serious question? LOOK AT YOUR POST! Anyone who is even vaguely connected gets their lives torn apart to try and implicate them in a child pedo ring. Why would they? You would just say they were in on it. Don&#39;t you lie about that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By asking pointed questions, I am tearing peoples&#39; lives apart. Got it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What gives you the right to demand that? You have given no evidence that would require such a thing. That family knows EXACTLY what would happen if they came out and so do you. Pizzagate would immediately dox them and dig into every aspect of their lives to some how implicate them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When did I claim the right to demand it? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s out of the question to expect some sort of explanation for the concerns raised about the nature of these photos. Considering the seriousness of the allegations, a response wouldn&#39;t be unwarranted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Half the internet doesn&#39;t believe in pizzagate. Hell half the internet probably hasn&#39;t even heard of it. IF I was implicated in Pizzagate I would sure as fuck keep my head down because you guys wouldn&#39;t care what I have to say you want confirmation of the conclusion you already came to and if I DARED to speak against it you would go out of your way to try and ruin my life. I would stay anonymous BECAUSE I care about my safety and privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, half the internet probably does not believe or know of pizzagate. But many thousands of people do. </p>

<p>Ignoring any and all questions does not make you seem innocent. If he would have had an honest and open discussion of these allegations from the beginning, he probably could have shut down this conspiracy before it even got started.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m all for asking question. But you are not asking questions you are demanding the answers that you want and will accept nothing else. This kind closed minded thinking is exactly what doesn&#39;t belong here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think if there was any reasonable explanation for these questions, it would have been given months ago. You disagree, and that&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t put words in my mouth. I&#39;ve always been open to hearing the side of the accused, but they have offered no explanations... </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t come to my conclusions based on the circumstantial evidence, but on the complete silence from those implicated and the mainstream media. It is completely ridiculous to me that Podesta hasn&#39;t come forward with any explanations of those strangely worded emails, or that Alefantis has gotten away with not even being questioned on many of his Instagram posts (#Hotard???)</p>

<p>No fuck that. There are no real concerns raised by these photos. you are making up a lie they have nothing to answer for because you do not have fucking shit. You are accusing people of serious crimes with NOTHING. And IF they came out you would take them denying as proof that you are right. As you guys have ALWAYS done.

Then the revelations about the activity of the Clinton foundation in Haiti, a Clinton associate Laura Silsby being busted trying to smuggle kids out of Haiti and then the personal intervention of the Clintons with the assistance of confirmed pedophile lawyers to get her off the charges she was facing. It was against this backdrop that we started noticing the creepy pedophilic art that the Podestas and Alefantis were into, that actually depicted sadistic child abuse.

<p>Everyone should look at this blog and try to tell me with a straight face that this is anything other than a loving family. </p>

<p>This kind of shit is disgusting and why people hate pizzagate. Pizzagater have no problem trying to ruin the lives of innocent people in order to push their propaganda. </p>

It&#39;s easy to misconstrue words and intentions when you are actively looking at their blog with the pre-conceived notion that these people are pedophiles. This is a blog they set up for friends and family to share child pictures with...do you honestly think they expected thousands of strangers online to all of a sudden take an active interest in their personal life?</p>

<p>Yes, because they don&#39;t actually mean for it to be taken that way at all when they make the joke. Do you guys live in a bubble or something? You ever watch Louis CK standup? Because he has a few different bits about pedophilia that would probably make this community go insane if you think something like this is bad. I think most families have at least one relative who would make a tasteless joke like this...not because they&#39;re a pedophile but because they just don&#39;t have the same sense of social awareness as other people, or they just don&#39;t give a fuck and are just trying to be funny.</p>

<p>If the parents assume that the only people who will be visiting the blog are friends/family, and THAT is who they&#39;re speaking to when they make a joke like this, then it&#39;s just a simple joke to make child nudity less awkward in general. If the rest of their blog was similarly &quot;creepy&quot; jokes, then maybe I&#39;d agree that it&#39;s pretty bizarre. But instead, the rest of the blog is completely normal to me....so I should assume that it&#39;s just a joke being made to other friends/family that understand their sense of humor and aren&#39;t going to be outraged by such a joke as you guys seem to be.</p>

<p>They probably never expected an entire community of strangers online to take such an active interest in their child/blog in the first place, and I don&#39;t blame them. The creepiness is entirely on THIS side, imo...not on their side.</p>

<p>You seem to have a ton of insight into the minds of these folks.

<p>None of the people I know have anyone in their families who would make pedo jokes.  Parents don&#39;t think pedophilia is funny, or something to be flippant about.  There is nothing more loathsome in our society than a pedophile.  Not even murderes are as hated.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing how many if&#39;s you need in order to arrive at your positive conclusion.  I suppose you can rationalize anything if you try hard enough.  I&#39;ve been on the fringe but this makes me want to take a more active role.  This needs a wider audience and I will now do my part to make that happen.  I appreciate your opinions supported by all those ifs you cannot possibly confirm, but my analysis of this is much different.  Take care.</p>

<p>How do you <strong>know</strong> it&#39;s a joke, and how do you know payment isn&#39;t taken care of offsite in some fashion?  I guess you are free to think it might be a joke, but when you state that as fact you cross the line....because there is no way you could possibly know.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m not going to do that, especially on matters that can ONLY be matters of opinion. If I say &#39;That&#39;s a great photo!&#39; I don&#39;t have to append &#39;in my opinion&#39;. Just like if I make a statement about someone&#39;s intent, I&#39;m not going to add a rider every time clarifying that it&#39;s my opinion. I&#39;ll do it sometimes, but it is not, in my opinion, always necessary given the context or subject.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Out of curiosity, why do you care about this subject?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was intensely interested when I first heard about Pizzagate. My first inclination was to believe it. People who believe are very passionate in their conviction, and on the surface it all seemed to hold together. I heard all the claims about codewords and horrible pictures, and suggestive phrases from emails.</p>

<p>But every time I looked into any single claim, it just didn&#39;t ring true to me. I haven&#39;t even been going around saying Pizzagate isn&#39;t true, I&#39;ve just looked at individual threads, like this one, and found them (in my opinion) to be full of confirmation bias. I saw someone claim that the man behind the girl with her hands taped to the table had a visible erection and a wet spot on his shorts, for example, but I couldn&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>It feels more and more like a witch hunt. People either not agreeing with some weird, distasteful art. Or taking things that seem like obvious jokes to me and calling them suspicious. Clues that only appear malicious if you already believe the conspiracy.</p>

<p>I could claim that I care about the possibility of entirely innocent people&#39;s lives being destroyed, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really my motivation.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen someone claim something that is feels so wrong to you, you feel compelled to say something in response, even knowing you&#39;ll never convince them and get a lot of hostility in return? It&#39;s probably not a productive compulsion to give in to, but I do it sometimes.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll never please all of the people all of them time, but you can certainly try to be more precise with your thoughts.  Remember, this is an anti establishment sub, and you are coming in carrying the establishment&#39;s water when you take the positions you take.  That doesn&#39;t necessarily make them wrong, but it does highlight you as a potential shill because shills are using the same talking points you are.  Then wehen I see your comment history and how often you come into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for the sole purpose of carrying the establishment&#39;s water, whatever the topic, it becomes even more important for you to attempt to differentiate yourself from the people paid to be here and disrupt discourse.  Sure, some of ppl in this sub and others throw the word shill around quite liberally, but that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t a shit ton of shills on Reddit and this sub in particular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to each their own. As parents it is our job to make decisions for our children, and different parents are going to have different ideas about what is best for their kids. The important thing to remember, I believe, that different doesn&#39;t necessarily equate to &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. </p>

<p>And the &quot;premium member&quot; content is an obvious joke considering that there is no such premium membership on Blogspot. Taken in context with the quirky captions on this blog it&#39;s clear to me this is just a dad being funny (or trying). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your reading comprehension is pretty terrible. They merely stated a fact, and a fairly obvious one at that.</p>

<p>I agree that posting pictures of your kids online is weird. My mother used to do the same thing on Facebook until I was old enough (11) to realize that there are some weird people on the Internet and I&#39;d rather not be exposed to them. Healthy skepticism is fine when it comes to how people handle children. Keeping them safe is important. However, implying every &quot;weird&quot; person a pedophile seems like a really irresponsible way to go about protecting children. If there&#39;s nothing backing up your claim, then you lose credibly that could have been used to help an actual victim. If there&#39;s a kernel of truth to the claim, but the evidence cannot prove guilt, then the abuser has a chance to tidy things up.</p>

<p>Of course, you could also correctly accuse an abuser and save a child from further harm. There&#39;s the rub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first point is disproven by literally looking at John Podesta. You cite that he&#39;s 60 and therefore could
not be confused for 20-40 year old mark. Have you actually SEEN John Podesta? I&#39;d guess he&#39;s in his thirties, maybe forties. Could
be bias, but nonetheless, he visually looks much younger than he is.</p>

<p>What happened to disproving his argument about circumstantial evidence warranting further investigation?</p>

<p>People stop responding for many reasons. I took one look at your post history and figured ok - at best this guy has autism and will not let this issue go. There&#39;s no use discussing anything with this guy. At this point I&#39;m commenting just for my own amusement. Pardon me if you&#39;re not amusing for long.

<p>Which proves, unequivocally, that the photos are of one suspect. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it does not.  It unequivocally does not.  There are two images for a reason.  Because they came from more than one person.  The description in the article clearly uses the word &quot;witnesses&quot;.  Meaning more than one witness.  It also states that each witness was describing a man THAT WITNESS had noticed for several days.  Meaning more than one event.  When you have two separate witnesses describing separate events, it is clear that the statement you rest your &quot;single suspect&quot; argument on is an ASSUMPTION, either by the witnesses or by the investigators.</p>

<p>Assumptions, by definition, are not unequivocal proof.</p>

<p>Your first point is disproven by literally looking at John Podesta. You cite that he&#39;s 60 and therefore could not be confused for 20-40 year old mark. Have you actually SEEN John Podesta? I&#39;d guess he&#39;s in his thirties, maybe forties. </p>

<p>Podestas art is by a Serbian artist called Biljana Durdevic, she grew up during the war in Serbia and depicts the violent destruct of the innocence of youth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The violent themes in Serbian artist Biljana Đurđević’s works reflect her development as an artist during the horror-stricken 1990s – when violence in her country peaked following the collapse of the communist regime in Eastern Europe. The body of works featured in this exhibition represents a selection from several series created by Đurđević between 1999 and 2007, in which she gazes directly into the darkest abysses of the human soul.</p>

<p>No, I think people who offer &quot;raw and uncut&quot; pictures of their children to their premium subscribers and include a ;) face are pedos. Also when the same people offer their kids as quote &quot;entertainment&quot; is pretty conclusive. </p>

<p>The blog was not invite-only until internet stalkers started harassing the Luzzattos. </p>

<p>There is a little bit archived here: <a href="http://archive.is/3nW3z">http://archive.is/3nW3z</a></p>

<p>There were more pictures archived on sli.mg but that site has been down since mid-January.</p>

<p>As you can see, there&#39;s nothing unusual about the photos <em>at all</em>. </p>

<p>Also, the father tries to make humorous remarks on nearly every picture. People are trying to insinuate that there&#39;s something sinister about the phrase &quot;raw and uncut&quot;, but that&#39;s just the way he writes. </p>

<p>after looking at the header on the archive.is page, I figured out there are more pages archived.</p>

<p>Here is the biggest group of pictures: <a href="https://archive.is/2g30Y">https://archive.is/2g30Y</a></p>

<p>As you can see, there&#39;s nothing suspicious about <em>any</em> of the pictures.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://archive.is/8PZDn">here is the first post on the blog:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is where the magic happens!</p>

<p>Welcome! If you are here you are one of the first people to view Evie&#39;s blog! And our friends should thank us---by indulging ourselves with this web portal we are NOT filling your inboxes with large files of pictures and videos! </p>

<p>my main problem is faulty logic, and users jumping to conclusions based off of insignificant evidence. someone posted a link to a katy perry video and said (she has to be in on it) another poster claimed that almost every celebrity in hollywood is in on it, but they wouldn&#39;t provide proof.</p>

<p>people who are emotionally invested in this conspiracy also come out and defend this logic and way of thinking, and thats who/what i have a problem with, although there are a handful of users that have actually posted some descent evidence that makes you scratch your head(i dont argue with <em>these</em> users)</p>

<p>This whole thing has been an enlightening and terrifying perspective in the power of confirmation bias, and the fear of that which is different. It&#39;s amazing how some people see those pictures as absolute proof of something sordid, and others see, as you said, new parents and grandparents making jokes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what comes to mind when I see these arguments by you? Steve Buscemi in the &quot;How are you doing, fellow teenagers&quot; scene.</p>

<p>Nobody relates to what you&#39;re describing. That&#39;s not because we want to blackmail people into being marked as pedophiles. We stand nothing to gain from having these people looked at, prosecuted or anything. The issue is - frankly, that their activity was noticed and is clearly abnormal.</p>

<p>Your arguments in this thread boil down to &quot;no, it totally is normal&quot; and when people tell you that no, it fucking isn&#39;t, you double down.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a weak argument. Honestly the fact that people are openly telling you here that it&#39;s fucking weird (and have been doing so in every pizzagate thread in this subreddit ever) should resonate at some point. At the very least a logical person (as I&#39;m sure you perceive yourself to be) would realize that this argument hasn&#39;t convinced anyone so far and never will.</p>

<p>There&#39;s honestly like three guys in this thread who think this is ok and keep posting in every chain that it is, but the majority of users disagree. Still, you guys are just adamant for defending skepticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not really on one side or another on this pizzagate topic, but after reading some of your replies, what would constitute an &quot;obvious&quot; NOT joke? How far is being &quot;silly&quot; to be extended? Now to be clear. I&#39;m not conviced at all that there is anything to this particular blog, but it seems to me that you would expect a pedophile to be explicit in their intents and literally announce what they are up to. And I agree with you that pizzagaters have the potential and even misguided intent to ruin, what most likely is just a happy family. But some circumstances regarding pizzagate are worrying, and worthy of investigation - without destroying innocent lives in the process, obviously.</p>

<p>How are you <em>certain</em> that&#39;s a joke ? You seem to know lots of parents who joke publicly about prostituting their baby ?</p>

<p>The ones I know would have a negative gut reaction to an insinuation like that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen or heard of any parent making that kind of joke, but I&#39;ve seen confirmed, sentenced pedos. So from my experience, Occam&#39;s razor suggests its not a joke.</p>

<p>Sorry if they&#39;re victims of false accusations, but it&#39;s completely understandable given the context. A lot of PG arguments are super weak, but red flags are everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t upset or disturb these people and strongly encourage others to be <em>really</em> careful about not doing it either, but I wouldn&#39;t entrust a child to someone writing such a thing in his blog.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The stupidity of the joke isn&#39;t the issue, it&#39;s the sexual insinuation. And no, parents don&#39;t make sexual jokes about their baby &quot;all the time&quot;, particularly on a public Internet page. The parents I know say a lot of stupid things, but <em>never</em> of that nature and in <em>private</em>. There&#39;s a huge gap between &quot;all the time&quot; and &quot;never&quot;. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a huge world of possibilities between, and around A and B.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s evidently no proof of anything on that blog, for any conclusion (yours included). The world can be a disgusting place, refusing that is refusing reality.</p>

<p>It&#39;s at least noteworthy for people who research PG. It may just be a sign of something else. I&#39;ve been told long ago that child abusers have a tendency to make &quot;jokes&quot; about the subject, something about not processing it psychologically in the same manner. Maybe it&#39;s just a sign of what kind of people he frequents, and he unconsciously picked up this &quot;sense of humor&quot;.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, it&#39;s a shitty situation where there&#39;s danger in arguing either way. May be causing problems to innocent people, may be protecting a human trafficking ring.</p>

<p>So all I can ask is for people to be careful and rational. The PG current is happening whether we like it or not.</p>

<p>Because all you did is post a women&#39;s blog and say it&#39;s obviously nefarious? There is literally nothing nefarious here except what you interpret to be nefarious. Example, &quot;Unrated version of this photo available only to premium subscribers. ;)&quot; This is textbook sarcasm to me and most people but to you it&#39;s evidence that she&#39;s part of a child molesting cabal. Evidence that&#39;s reliant completly on a persons interpretation of it is bad evidence. </p>

<p>This is just one piece of information that I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve never even seen before, and the last part was only discovered recently.

<p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting at, I&#39;ve said nothing implying you should not investigate. You invited a skeptic to disprove your evidence and that&#39;s what I went about doing, stop trying to throw other shit in to obscure the fact that this isn&#39;t evidence of anything. This isn&#39;t evidence of anything illegal, just like all the other circumstantial evidence isn&#39;t evidence of an actual crime having taken place. Being a pedophile in and of itself is not a crime (like it or not), prove that children were actually abused or even someone claiming to have been abused by podesta and then we can take a look at all the circumstantial evidence. Because as you may or may not know, circumstantial evidence of someone having committed a crime doesn&#39;t fly when you can&#39;t prove the crime ever actually took place and not even having direct evidence of a crime. He may very well be a pedo, but if he isn&#39;t acting on those disgusting urges he hasn&#39;t actually done anything wrong. So stop trying to prove he&#39;s a pedo, and prove he committed a crime.</p>

<p>You just blew your whole theory of this being a joke.</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence can be used as probable cause. If your car smells like weed, the cop can search your car for weed.</p>

<p>If you post and speak like a child abuser, you should be investigated for abusing children. Simple as that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Seriously? I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re being serious. You&#39;ve never heard a bad joke? Or told a joke you thought was hilarious but no one else got? Or seen a comedian absolutely bomb on stage? A joke being bad doesn&#39;t prove it&#39;s not a joke, that line of reasoning is absolutely inane. Sometimes jokes fall flat, it doesn&#39;t change that fact that it was supposed to be a joke.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Circumstantial evidence can be used as probable cause. If your car smells like weed, the cop can search your car for weed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that&#39;s completely different. The evidence you&#39;ve presented is not the same as smelling burning marijuana, it&#39;s the same as weearing a shirt with a pot leaf on it in your facebook profile picture. The smell of burning marijuana is evidence a crime has taken place and is something directly observable by the officer, a weed shirt is not evidence any crime has been committed only that you might like to smoke weed. See the difference? One is evidence of the crime while the other is evidence you may be predisposed to commit the crime, only one of those grants probable cause. Not to mention in many places the smell of marijuana alone isn&#39;t actually good enough for probable cause, but that&#39;s sorta irrelevant as I understand what you mean. So prove a crime happened or provide evidence points towards a crime actually having happened. If you can&#39;t do that then the circumstantial evidence is meaningless. So provide evidence he actually did something illegal not just that he&#39;s a pedo.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well that&#39;s not how our justice system works, so that&#39;s an irrelevant point. Simple as that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it <em>can&#39;t</em> be a bad joke, but you have provided no good reason to be so sure that is what it is. You are just using your intuition on this one isolated case.</p>

<p>What I am doing is looking at a pattern of behavior where these individuals are all making references to exploiting children. Whether or not they are joking is for the authorities to figure out. The pattern is what is important, and is what gives the authorities justification for a deeper investigation.</p>

<p>Yes I can. In fact, the fact that I don&#39;t find it funny but recognize it as a joke only bolsters the argument that it&#39;s obvious.

    <div class="md"><p>When I first saw that slimage of the spiderweb last August I knew Pizzagate was gonna be huge. In honor of this being real as fuck I wanna copy paste my eli5 summary of the evidence to the case</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.) Bill &amp; Hildog creates center for missing and exploiting children John Podesta was counselor to the president at the time. 1996 or so don&#39;t quote me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2.) Anthony wiener well known sex freak. As far back as like 2008 went missing for a few days and then they caught him with like some underaged foreign girl.</p>

<p>3.)Hilary Clinton flies to Haiti in 2010 after one Laura Silsby, is arrested for smuggling 33 children on a bus to the Dominican republic. Clinton gets Silsby off. Emails show that Huma albedin(Anthony weiners wife @time) told Hildog about silsbys org and her stake in them. Silsby later becomes CEO for ALERTSENSE, a company responsible for sending amber alerts to phones. Yeah the missing children amber alert.</p>

<p>4.) an internal investigation into the 200 pentagon computers with purchased child porn is shut down by Hilary Clinton as sec of state. Think this was in 2012.</p>

<p>5.) John Podestas self described best friend and 3rd in line for POTFUS, Dennis Hassert is arrested for pedophilia and described by judge as a serial pedophile. 3rd in line to be pres. Best friends with pres advisor.</p>

<p>6.) Wikileaks drops Podesta leaks and readers and dear autists of all kinds begin to dig and make connections. Hilary and bills advisor is best friends with a pedo. Bill has been to Epstein(nother pedo) island 27 times! Hilary has actively shut down pedo investigations. They sure talk about pizza and spirit cooking a lot. Kids in the pool for entertainment? Weird. They are friends with this eccentric man who owns a pizza shop... Lets look into his Instagram and.... Oh... My... God...</p>

<p>7.) Aleftantis part of a smear campaign as he is the final piece of the puzzle. David Brock&#39;s ex boyfriend. A pizza shop owner with millions of dollars and powerful political connections. Truth is more than likely Comet is just a way to money launder political donations and the alleged pedophile ring money. There are no kids at the restaurant. The political connections however, remain.</p>

(look into the Criminal proceedings tab, while it doesnt prove bill went there, it shows that this man does do fucked up shit. also google epstein island and you will get many links to bill riding in his jets or whatever.)</p>

<p>Cant find the foreign girl story, the dennis hassert story you can look up, you can look up pizza shop owners instagram as that i do not want to see it if its real or not, and the pentagon story i can find, but its on lower end news sites, which makes me believe it could be iffy. </p>

<p>I would like to say also that I cant speak for this man or believe 100% what he is saying, but the shit regarding the laura bitch is fucked, and some of the things he said can be sourced.</p>

Also, tony gets an email from a camp nose friend, his first communication With him in 50 years, and they mention Denny. First comms in 50 years, discussing mutual friend Denny, within 2 days (I think) of dennys indictment. To me, felt like a check in email to make sure shits cool despite Denny going down. I&#39;m not going to bother with links. All is easily verified on WL emails and google, if you care to do so. Would it make sense to think Denny was allowed to rise because he could be extorted? Who knew? To me, definitely both podestas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno.....Podesta brothers are connected to a pig farm IIRC, maybe Alefantas is too from what folks found. Pigs are well known eaters of everything, including humans. There was a pig farmer who was found to have fed many &quot;prostitutes&quot; (quotes because that&#39;s what the news spun it as) to his hogs. Only getting caught because of all the shoes and purses around his property. It happened in either Canada or way up state NY.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not completely out of the possibility realm to say they fed dead victims (hopefully dead first) to hogs. Or maybe just straight into ground meat I suppose, they are into some sick shit. Who knows, maybe their pepperoni recipe is what keeps customers (unknowingly I hope) returning. </p>

<p>All the pizza art/symbolism I see while in this rabbit hole is almost always pepperoni pizza. (Anybody see the Katy Perry videos/concert footage?) Wouldn&#39;t that be the ultimate mindfuck for these cannibalistic pedos? Feeding unsuspecting folks children on their pizza??? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome! If you are here you are one of the first people to view Evie&#39;s blog! And our friends should thank us---by indulging ourselves with this web portal we are NOT filling your inboxes with large files of pictures and videos! </p>

<p>Enjoy and we will look forward to your comments....</p>

<p>Wow, that&#39;s really creepy ...  no, wait, it isn&#39;t</p>

<p>More blog entries <a href="https://archive.is/2g30Y">here</a> and <a href="http://archive.is/3nW3z">here</a>. Baby being held by friends. Baby being held by grandparents. Smiling baby. <em>Arkansas Razorbacks basketball!</em> Doggo. Smiling baby. Family get-together  on Mother&#39;s Day. Baby taken to baseball game. Baby with her grandma and cousins. Baby with cat.</p>

<p>Slightly different from the child rape and satanic ritual sacrifices we were promised.</p>

<p>The father writes pretty much every entry in a humorous way because it&#39;s more fun that way. He didn&#39;t expect his words to be twisted by a gang of internet stalkers and sickos.</p>

<p>For God&#39;s sake, leave them alone!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of PG has substance, like the penchant for &quot;strange&quot; artwork and the political/occult connections, but I finally think this particular blog doesn&#39;t hold as anything special.</p>

<p>I think the comparison between his blog and a porn-site was funny to him because like most people, he didn&#39;t even consider the idea of someone liking babies in that way.</p>

<p>That&#39;s truly my preferred theory after thinking about it. Imagine yourself as an innocent father censoring genitalia on the Internet, would you get a chuckle about thinking you&#39;re a porn site admin ? I think it&#39;s reasonable. For somebody who doesn&#39;t consider such things, the joke&#39;s not about the baby, it&#39;s about the job.</p>

<p>PG researchers didn&#39;t have the leisure to keep that perspective, thus they should be vigilant to take a step back as often as possible.</p>

<blockquote>

Julian Assange (wikileaks account) retweeted several &#39;pie ga te&#39; articles/theories and wanted to bring attention to them. Why would they do this if they thought it was fake? They have a reputation to uphold (100% accuracy in publications). Obviously Julian himself believed there were questionable content found within Mr. Skippy&#39;s emails.

    <div class="md"><p>Some people are saying that it&#39;s crazy to brush this off as baseless and I&#39;ll be honest when I read this post I thought it was bad but then I clicked the link....</p>

<p>You quickly realize that this is cherry picked out of context shit. These blogs are meant for family and friends with jokes meant for them. If you&#39;re going to spin everything as nefarious then why stop at pedophilia? Apparently Evelyn is going to be Queen of the USA and you can influence her power right now. No? That shouldn&#39;t be taken seriously? But the &quot;raw and uncut&quot; bit obviously should be taken seriously and obviously means that you can see her naked online right guys?</p>

<p>Jack&#39;s blog is even clearer that it&#39;s meant as humor. I mean there&#39;s winky face and he&#39;s censored by a Maple leafs logo for fucks sake.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t even begin to spin 95% of the rest of the blog as anything but innocent family pictures. The only way you can even see this as something more is through confirmation bias. Stop accusing people of being &quot;pedo defenders&quot; when the most you got is codewords and they really meant this BS.</p>

<p>No, this isn&#39;t evidence of a crime as far as I know, but it easily reaches the standards for probable cause.

    <div class="md"><p>Well considering it&#39;s just a free blog and there&#39;s no such thing as paid subscribers or anything, I&#39;d assume it&#39;s just a joke. Now whether or not you feel it&#39;s a tasteless joke to make because there&#39;s a kid involved is another thing altogether...and you&#39;re welcome to question their sense of humor (even though I&#39;m sure this site is mostly intended for friends/family only rather than complete strangers who would have no reason to take interest in their child).</p>

<p>But just look at 99% of the content on that blog...completely normal stuff that is in no way creepy. So to try and cherry pick a tasteless joke or two and make it seem like there MUST be something weird going on is just absurd, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because pedo stuff gets people riled up is the reason why it&#39;s used by governments for censorship. That&#39;s the thing government censorship of internet always proponents always start:</p>

<p><em>&quot;We don&#39;t want to control the internet, but surely we can block the sites for child porn?&quot;</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s how it always starts. Exceptions because of &quot;think of the children&quot;. Now you&#39;re advocating eroding judicial process for the exception of &quot;think of the children&quot;. </p>

<p>Hell no. No exceptions. If we lower the our standards for CP, then the powers that be will just falsely accuse people they don&#39;t like of CP. </p>
