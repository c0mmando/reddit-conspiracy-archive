       I have never really looked into the holocaust denial stuff, but I mean I am open to reviewing information. Idk if your actually into holocaust denial or whatever. To be perfectly honest, I think that blaming everything on the Jews seems like such an obvious scapegoat, that I can't tell if the antisemitism is being done ironically or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I hate all religion, Jews are sort of the least annoying one in my opinion. I mean aside from the fact that some of them suck blood out of baby dicks, and by 'some of them' I mean and a VERY small portion of them, Jews aren't as bad as Christians, because there is a huge amount of Christians that teach their kids creation. As far as the most annoying religion, Islam has pretty much has that shit on lock.

       You're right. Nothing suspicious about an ethnic minority controlling the globe. Not at all worth examining. Surely they're just patrons of education and fiscally wise 😉

       Your post will be downvoted, but I second this.
People need some evil goat, on whom they could aim their hate, fear, etc, it's pretty easy to pick this exactly nation. Jews in a most of us are plain people with interesting culture and many hardiness in the past. 
The "evil force" could take different faces, you should see through the masks.

       Most of the anti Jewish sentiment which has sprung up over the last few weeks is part of a organized propaganda push by the usual anti trump shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plan is to split trumps base by saying trump is being controlled by his Jewish daughter and her husband. This plays into the already existing Jews control the world conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing with this piece of propaganda is that it comes as no surprise to trump supporter's that trump is in bed with the Jews. Time and time again on the campaign trail trump expressed his love for Isreal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps campaign was based largely on anti radical Islamist rhetoric. If trump is against Islam then by default/proxy he is on the side of the Jews.

       The way I see it is Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are basically the same god, and religion. They're just continuations of each other. They're also all mutually guilty of crimes against humanity at various points through history.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have to worry about the Satanic cults, anyone who claims to worship aliens, and worse yet the actual atheists who have no values other than greed and self preservation who lack human empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty much most belief systems contain various forms of bigotry and hatred against opposing views. So it's kind of to be expected that there is propaganda against pretty much every religion as they're all essentially at war with each other.

       In a nutshell, Jewish culture places a high value on education. As a result, Jewish people, as a whole, tend to be more successful than other cultural groups. Some people look at this achievement &amp; figure there must be a nefarious worldwide Jewish conspiracy at work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're to go a bit deeper, we can examine anti-semitism from a historical perspective. To a certain extent, Jewish tribes were nomadic. I say "to a certain extent" because that's not an entirely uncontroversial statement, and because it doesn't tell the whole story. Fact is, the entire Middle East was nomadic. There ain't nothin' there but sand, so all peoples tended to move around a lot. But because the Jews are so few compared to other groups, they tended to stick out, and, as such, they were easily scapegoated.
      </p>
      <p>
       This scapegoating actually led to some of the stereotypes that stick with the Jews today. For example, as an easily identifiable "outsider," many Jews found it difficult to find work. Some countries went as far as making it illegal  to hire Jews for any sort of labor. The intent of those laws wasn't necessarily anti-Jew; for many nations it was a protectionist measure. (i.e. give jobs to citizens, not migrants.) But because they weren't able to find work, many Jews had no choice but to engage in trade &amp; other entrepreneurial endeavors. Thus birthing the jew/money stereotype.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given their long history of being targeted with bigotry, Jewish-rights groups such as the Anti-Defamation League are quick to condemn and attack anything seen as anti-Jewish. The problem there (in my view) is that some of these attacks are overzealous, and I think that frustrates a lot of people, probably rightly so. For example, it's nearly impossible to say anything critical of Israel without being labelled an antisemite. Which is a problem, because Israel does some pretty fucked up things.

       More like why should anyone care? If you want to have some empathy, then have it for the native Americans, or India under the British Raj, or Japan under Mao, or Russia under Stalin. They suffered far greater losses of life than the Jews did.

       Most aren't. Its clearly portrayed that way though. Perception is fickle, even more so when a narrative has been established with all the astroturfing lately with "its the jews!" posts. Sprinkle in a little confirmation bias with "concern" posts like this one. Its almost like clockwork

       A massive majority of Jews are good people. As are a massive amount of any group of humans. The bad eggs, evil fucks float to the top of whatever group they are in as they feel no empathy and can step in on top of the others with no qualms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buuuutt the synagogue of satan is in control of the top of all the group's. Religion may be fake but power in ritual and belief is very real. And you have to go back to the Hebrew language to understand and shed light on alot allot of the world's events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each of the Hebrew letters is also a number.  So in essence A aleph is 1 B bet is 2 C kaph is 3 so on. So in essence each word is also a number sequence that adds up to a total weight. This is called gematria. There is a concept in Judaism that Hebrew is  a sacred language and biblical Hebrew isn't even spoken in common conversation due to its sacred nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are startling proofs to the divinity of the Hebrew  language and bible. Mathematical so that the logical person can see the sublimeness within.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are interested in more on that let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the idea that each word has a numeric value means that word represents the energy behind the number. And the energy behind the numbers is based on the numeric values.  In essence createing a matrix between all the ideas and concepts expressed in language and the energy of the numbers involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may explain or lend credence to the numerology of dates and numbers.

       I think anyone who hates everyone of a certain race or religion is ignorant. There are good and bad in all groups. Denying the holocaust happened is also ignorant when you consider the structures are still there. The events involved in the holocaust are definitely up for debate and very interesting as well as the fact that you get imprisoned in some countries for questioning the official story.

       While the ptb knows it's fake,they also know that religion makes a great engine for social,economic and political control of the masses.

       They also knew they needed a patsy to hide behind. The jews were just really unlucky when they were the chosen ones to be that patsy. Any group could have been picked Jews just had the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

       Not all of any group is one way, some are good some are bad, some are radicalized or sworn into the secret societies, others are normal and I've had friends like them. But the ones that are crazy and rich consider themselves above us

       It's not the Jewish majority who is hated, it's the elite minority who follow the Talmud. Check out Brendan O'Connell on youtube, he's doing a lot of good work and has even been put in jail by the 'Jews' you're asking about.

       I do not think most rational people hate Jews (and I certainly do not), but many people are seriously concerned with
       <em>
        Zionist
       </em>
       Jews.

       When people talk about globalists, the next obvious question is who are these so called globalists?

      <p>
       When you answer that question you get a little bit closer to the truth.

       I don't hate Jews but I do hate Judaism because it's a religion that condones human slavery and pursues a goal of supremacy.  The Hollywood depiction of what Nazis were is exactly what Judaism is in the real world.
