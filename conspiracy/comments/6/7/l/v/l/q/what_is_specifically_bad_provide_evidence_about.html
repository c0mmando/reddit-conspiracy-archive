Going to do my own research and will probably go for experience sake no matter what; but if anyone has any stories, that would be great!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lower level Freemasonry isn&#39;t all doom and gloom. To become a Freemason you must believe in a higher power and it is really about perfecting your life. Imagine a brick mason learning his trade to become an expert, Freemasonry teaches that same concept but about life. It isn&#39;t until the higher degrees that you learn that they god they are celebrating is Ba&#39;al, not Yahweh. All of the temples and symbolism are straight from the Babylonian Mystery Religion (Religion of Nimrod). Freemasonry starts off by you unknowingly making taking allegiance to Pegan gods. If you do it, remember that much more could be at stake than is presented to you. </p>

<p>The highest social status mason i&#39;ve met in 15 years was a Mayor. The average age of a Freemason is 70, and 90% of them are small business owners and military veterans that want to get out of the house a night every month.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lodges vary. I can only speak knowledgeably about American practice. </p>

<p>Most lodges have an official meeting once a month. Some also break out degree conferrals  to meetings on other nights. There may be also less official get-togethers on other nights or weekends.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a short series on British Freemasonry underway on Sky TV. Its very good, though somewhat different from US practice:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My ex MIL dated a guy who was into the Moose Lodge. I assure you, there was nothing going on down there but drinking and poker and old people &quot;dances&quot;. Those guys weren&#39;t smart enough to rub rocks together much less be on this &quot;Illuminati&quot; level of running anything....always fun to watch em tho</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve come to think of local masonry as a social club/fraternity for the real world. They&#39;re used to attract potential local leaders to recruit them to their side, and a majority of them never make it past the bottom few levels. Naturally, the fun secrets wouldn&#39;t be unlocked until later levels, so most Masons wouldn&#39;t be privy to them. They&#39;re just enjoying the club, and whatever philanthropic work they use as a cover, heck, they are the cover. How do we know high-level Masons make up part of &quot;the top of the pyramid&quot; (TPTB)? Because they&#39;re at the heart of many deceptions, and many historic enemies-to-mankind have been Masons. Did you know every man to supposedly walk on the moon was a Mason? Multiple NASA directors known, if not all of them. Many Presidents; George Washington, Rondald Reagan, B Hussein Obama (possibly Trump, but we do know his pastor/mentor was a 33rd degree Mason). The aforementioned people, and many more, including a lot of celebrities whom we know push agendas and are sellouts, are seen wearing the Mason ring or other apparel. Did you know we not only planted an American flag on the moon (supposedly) but also a flag featuring the Masonic square and compass? It&#39;s all very interesting, and has been a part of history for basically forever; Masons consider themselves successors to Knights of Templar, who may have been successors themselves to sun-worshiping druids. </p>

<p>Like you said, we&#39;d like to join out of curiosity, but like the other comments said, it could have bad post-death consequences. Intellegimet design, and therefore souls/afterlife, is logical  so that is a factor to consider. Why are they logical? Because the Big Bang (theory) never happened and outer space is a hoax, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know enough to comment on outer space and or the big bang theory or anything of the like. But I am a Christian, as stated above, and my idea what happens after death is quite solid. I think what decides what happens after death is not so black and white as people think a lot of the time, or for us to judge. Also I am someone who likes to excel, especially in work and recreational activities, so I am a little put down that the more I want to excel, the more of who I am I may have to give up or share. It will be interesting to see, I definitely plan on writing a book about it one day though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha, I agree with that last bit you put in, that does seem like some people&#39;s attitude. I had a look on <a href="/r/freemasonry">/r/freemasonry</a> last night. From what I could see, everyone was pretty into talking and sharing. I read through the rules and spoke about different lodges having different rules on what rituals can and cannot be shared. As I do not know the rules of the lodge to which I will be applying, I thought it best just not to read anything and go in open minded like I do with most things.</p>

<p>One question though; are there more than just once a month meets?</p>
