    <div class="md"><p>Expanded awareness of the self. The probable and parallel yous, and other lives. It&#39;s more than possible. Don&#39;t take yourself for granted, y o ur existence is more than possible, and more than one. Billions.</p>

<p>And in those billions there are billions more and on. Each one in their own timeframe. It&#39;s actually hard to grasp and most will deny their own magnitude , buts that&#39;s because we have a selective perception and only have our attention on one thing at a time, usually. So we are patterned to perceive only one, sometimes two things at once. Perceiving a billion things at once would not work in thins reality. So we don&#39;t perceive billions, but one.</p>

<p>The awareness of these other you&#39;s does bleed through at times though. Or cross paths. Daydreams sometimes take you into another timeline, for example.</p>

<p>But yea, I think about this all the time ,also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I came up with that broke my brain at one point. If you believe in infinite possibilities and universes then it&#39;s almost guaranteed that one of these time lines at some point will invent a time machine. If you accept that then as soon as a time machine is invented time becomes irrelevant because you have infinite universes multiplied by infinite options and chances to modify your own universes time line. So at that point you have infinite squared. 
(I wasn&#39;t even high when I thought this up but it TOTALLY broke my brain)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s incredible to me is that we can witness and identify conspiracies happening in real time now.</p>

<p>I remember when the conspiracy community was pretty much relegated to talking about previous events, often decades old. It was one of the only ways to study them because the compilation of evidence was quantifiably high enough to dissect. But more information is becoming available faster than ever before. This, coupled with strong empirical evidence of known past conspiracies, makes it easier to see shit hitting the fan. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like a veil being lifted. What a time indeed.</p>

This is why &quot;fake news&quot; is so pivotal. Internet giants and MSM are pouring money into controlling the narrative, anything they disagree with is labeled fake and auto ad blocked. I have no idea where this is all going, but it sure is amazing to watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on your perspective. I used to be atheist, but after a few spiritual experiences and coming to understand the philosophies behind a few eastern religions I have come to the point where I&#39;d say that yeah I believe in God. Now my idea of God would probably be considered abstract and far from the traditional judeo-christian version of the patriarchal/&quot;made in the image of Man&quot; version of God. The way I see God is everything. The universe. You, me, anything. Brahman. We are as much the universe as the universe is us. Come to a living understanding and acceptance of yourself with yourself and you come to that same acceptance with God. There&#39;s no need to attach any &quot;woo-woo&quot; to it, just be cool with it all. You are part of the flow to go with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a lil nitpicking point to make.  We are actually made in God&#39;s image in Christian ideology, not the other way round.  But yes, thank you for your response, I appreciate it.  Everyone has a different starting point and no one on the internet can prove one wat or another.

    <div class="md"><p>Nice picking up on that! ;) I did that on purpose. Yeah I know that&#39;s how it&#39;s said in the bible, but remember the bible was written by people. And I firmly believe from my own research that in the 2000 years the bible has been around it has had parts omitted, rewritten, added in etc. The Vatican are behind this as a method of controlling the population. The idea of God in the bible/torah/qu&#39;ran is a bastardisation of what &quot;God&quot; is. Men wrote these books and men fashioned these pseudo concepts of God in the image of man and wrote it the other way round, out of either ignorance or arrogance likely. Many eastern religions don&#39;t even have a word for that concept of God, since it doesn&#39;t make sense. If God is infinite, why would he be finite? <em>Everything</em> is made in the image of God. Men, animals, trees, air, fire, galaxies. Everything. It all exists, so it&#39;s all God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you may have misunderstood. When I say &quot;God&quot; first erase the idea of the guy with a beard out your mind. God is just a word or sound for now until I explain myself. Now when we think of the universe we usually think of space: stars, galaxies and planets. And we think of us as individuals <em>within and yet separate</em> from the universe. As observers to it. Generally speaking of course! When in actuality we <em>are</em> the universe itself, just taking form in the shape of us to experience existence from this limited and unique perspective. We are not separate from the universe, as we are made of the same stuff. Atoms, Planck spheres (shout out <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a>), just vibrating at a frequency to exist in this small spectrum that everything else we see vibrates at that we call reality. When we die we will be as we are before birth. The universe again.<br/>
Now my idea of God is that God is everything. The universe. If you could somehow encompass everything that ever has, ever is, ever will be, ever could be, and even ever couldn&#39;t be - just <em>everything</em> - then that is God. From the beginning of time to the end (that is if you don&#39;t believe the universe is infinite in time and space... I do). That makes us God too. For example take a tree. Where does the tree end and the rest of the world begin? The tree is the trunk, the branches, roots, the leaves, the cycle of the leaves falling off in winter and returning in spring. The tree is as much the carbon dioxide it takes in as it is the oxygen it gives out. It&#39;s the soil it takes minerals and other nutrients from. The air that carries it&#39;s seeds, and the bee that pollinates it. Without one the other couldn&#39;t exist. Is the leaf just a leaf? Different to all the other ones and unique in its own way? Yes, from one perspective. But from another the leaf is tree, as without the roots, trunk, and branches the leaf wouldn&#39;t have anything to exist upon.<br/>
Everything is everything. It&#39;s all connected. I completely suppose, and personally reckon, that there are multiple - likely infinite - layers to existence, and that beings exist within these layers and to some beings it may appear that there are multiple &quot;God&quot; like beings. And that&#39;s valid, because there&#39;s an infinite number of perspectives for the universe to experience itself from. But ultimately, everything is God. <em>Uni</em>verse = one verse. &quot;We are all one&quot; and that that, eh? That&#39;s my interpretation of God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah I understand. Sorry by the way if you read that as me being negative toward western religions. I meant not for that! I get that for loads of people the current idea of western religions is all they have to work with, and they make it work for them! That&#39;s great and I don&#39;t want to take that away, because if it makes you happy then that&#39;s what it means to be here :) and yeah you&#39;re right, putting eastern religions on a pedestal is falling for exactly the same thing I&#39;m suggesting that western religions have done, as nothing is perfect. Just it&#39;s own interpretation. It&#39;s own understanding. I don&#39;t stick strictly to any religion myself, I&#39;ve picked bits and pieces from everything I try to read, but most significantly Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity and apply philosophies I see as beneficial to my own life. Take a look, if you wouldn&#39;t mind, at a comment I replied to another guy who just asked me about my interpretation of God, I think you might find it interesting and I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, and they are aware that information flows freely now. You can&#39;t make something disappear, you have to hide it with more information. The idea is to violate Occam&#39;s Razor and add a &#39;viral&#39; component to your conspiracy. That way you control the mainstream and the &quot;truther&quot; narrative from the very beginning.</p>

<p>Think about the way in which The Democrats and The Republicans are different sides of the same coin. Same deal with the mainstream narrative and the conspiracy narrative. They know they can&#39;t get everyone to buy into the bullshit, so they create another narrative to go along with it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do believe in conspiracies and things being under control. I&#39;m just saying that a lot of the conspiracies out there are just as much a veil as the other narratives. They just need different sizes of veils because not all minds are shaped the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you read anything Thomas Pynchon, Jorge Luis Borges, or Robert Anton Wilson/Robert Shea&#39;s &quot;Illuminatus Trilogy&quot; ?</p>

<p>They deal a lot with what truth is, and often talk about conspiracies. Borges is a good start as he mostly does short stories, but they&#39;re so dense with information.</p>

<p>For Pynchon I&#39;d recommend &quot;Crying of Lot 49&quot; (his shortest, most people&#39;s favorite, but Pynchon did not like it too much) or &quot;Bleeding Edge&quot; (about the dotcom crash and 9/11).</p>

<p>The Illuminatus Trilogy is super long (1000+ pages), but is also not as literary dense -- the airport novel of these.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;d recommend checking out these authors for ideas about what truth can be.</p>

<p>The implied twist of the phase to describe post-9/11 America and &quot;the new normal&quot; is absolutely brilliant.</p>

<p>The one thing I&#39;ve been trying to find out about (and it&#39;s a hard thing to Google) is when he talks about spy boats appearing in the rivers around NYC, did that happen? It&#39;s very brief, but he basically says that right after 9/11, the CIA had mobile command-communicate-control stations disguised as civilian boats surrounding Manhattan. Makes sense they would do that, but had never heard it mentioned outside that  book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been conspiracy theories surrounding the Clintons forever. Bill was already president, of course. Every president racks up conspiracy theories. There was so much Clinton conspiracy material going into this election - endless really. </p>

<p>Trump on the other hand had not been part of any conspiracy theories up until the election. Frankly, there wasn&#39;t much dirt known about him. He wasn&#39;t a popular conspiracy topic.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a big reason why I think Clinton had it so much harder around this sub than Trump.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree but lately I feel that I am oversaturated with information and have no way of knowing what is truth. Unless I am there to observe the event, I have no idea what really happened and who to trust. Everyone seems to have an agenda or put a spin on everything. I have no reliable news sources. I also feel like everything is us vs them (Dems/Repub) lately. I start to agree with a post and then realize it&#39;s supporting Trump or Anti-Trump. I don&#39;t care, just give me the real evidence about the conspiracy. This is how the conversation is going with people I talk to about politics/conspiracies lately. I haven&#39;t always felt this way and ever since I realized 9/11 had way too many unanswered questions I search for the truth and demand the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tbf, there was a great deal of shilling. I have an extremely hard time believing anyone was a fan of Clinton that spends a great deal of time on this sub, and subscribes to the things that we do here. There can be no doubt the majority of those were paid forum manipulators. Not to mention, we had actual evidence that there was a team doing exactly that. And look around, they are mostly gone now. </p>

<p>Trump also had Cambridge Analytica. I am not exactly how sure how well organized or effective they were though. I remember reading something that made me think the project didn&#39;t pan out that well, but that could easily have been misinformation. But we see most of the super protrump users are gone as well. Many of the natives that were explicitly protrump have kind of walked that stance back as more information about him has become available.</p>

<p>But yeah, all the constant fighting was a huge waste of time and very frustrating. I am glad it is more or less back to normal. This happens to some extent every political cycle though. We have been surviving it for like 6 years now =)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. I&#39;ve only been a part of this sub for about a week and I now spend most of my time here. I was an extremely active commenter in the r/xboxone sub I posted a few threads on the xb1 sub and to be honest they are very negative and have an extreme elitist POV. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted twice in r/conspiracy and of my post karma comes from this extremely supportive and intelligent community. The fearlessness here is almost tangible, I know if I post here I won&#39;t be bombarded with negativity and baseless opinions. It&#39;s not about the karma points, it&#39;s about putting your thoughts out there and having them met with genuinity, facts, and well thought out and strongly supported theories.</p>

<p>I love learning and arming myself with facts and strongly supported opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice picking up on that! ;) I did that on purpose. Yeah I know that&#39;s how it&#39;s said in the bible, but remember the bible was written by people. And I firmly believe from my own research that in the 2000 years the bible has been around it has had parts omitted, rewritten, added in etc. The Vatican are behind this as a method of controlling the population. The idea of God in the bible/torah/qu&#39;ran is a bastardisation of what &quot;God&quot; is. Men wrote these books and men fashioned these pseudo concepts of God in the image of man and wrote it the other way round, out of either ignorance or arrogance likely. Many eastern religions don&#39;t even have a word for that concept of God, since it doesn&#39;t make sense. If God is infinite, why would he be finite? <em>Everything</em> is made in the image of God. Men, animals, trees, air, fire, galaxies. Everything. It all exists, so it&#39;s all God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t help but cringe when people get high of the idea of God. </p>

<p>If there is a God and toy accept it,  shouldn&#39;t it be the same as accepting the air we breathe?</p>

<p>Just reminds me of dying soldiers high on morphine or oxygen tanks when a plane is crashing. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but think the majority of people use m use the high of religion when they are faced with death or remorse.</p>

<p>What do I know. </p>
