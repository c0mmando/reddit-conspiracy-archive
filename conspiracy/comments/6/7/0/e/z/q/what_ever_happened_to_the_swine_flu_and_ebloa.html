It felt as if my brain was frying and I would get hallucinations that looked like multiple grim reapers coming to claim my soul. Every time I puked into the puke bucket it would inflict so much pain that I would float outside my body, knowing death was mere seconds away...and I wished it would come faster. My dreams were best described as acid trips and were my only saving grace...until they would turn into torturous nightmares upon finally reincarnating into to my sick and sweaty hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&lt;Ebola among healthcare personnel and other people is associated with direct contact with symptomatic people with Ebola (or the bodies of people who have died from Ebola) and direct contact with body fluids from Ebola patients. </p>

<p>I read through the whole thing and have to say if this was written without mentioning Ebola, I would have said at the start, that this is some very undangerous disease that is hard to catch. Yet reality shows us that it spreads quickly and easily. How?</p>

<p>Basically it states that whilst they put monkeys and piglets through horriffic tests, it mentions that airborne contamination is not really a factor for humans.
Nobody seemed to have got ill etc.
Then you read on and it says in the end it mentions:</p>

<p>&lt;all healthcare workers must have received repeated training and have demonstrated competency in performing all Ebola-related infection control practices and procedures, and specifically in donning/doffing proper personal protective equipment (PPE). While working in PPE, healthcare workers caring for patients with Ebola should have no skin exposed. </p>

<p>If we consider the easy spread, what is the truth? Well, as you can read, &quot;no skin to skin contact with affected persons&quot;.
If the president hugged an Ebola patient, it was a risky thing to do after all. And very unnecessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ebola isn&#39;t that easy to catch - in a modern society where there are no traditions that involve the average person preparing corpses for burial, there are working sewers and basic sanitation, and where sick people are treated by trained doctors and in high-quality hospitals rather than at home. It&#39;s still a pretty contagious pathogen, but there would have be to a lot of basic societal collapses before Ebola spread in the US, for instance, in a way that was comparable to the outbreak in West Africa.</p>

<p>Also - and importantly - Obama hugged the nurse after she had been declared Ebola-free and completely cured, and well after she was out of the hospital and infectious. It would have been a very different situation if he had met her while she was still being hospitalized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that sentence on its own does. So hat off to you. However there was more written to it. Actually a whole article which IMO tried to make ebola look as difficult to catch as HIV for example.
I think we are on the same side here, because it all came about because someone said that it couldn&#39;t have been bad because Obama hugged someone with ebola.</p>

<p>So I tried to find out how dangerous it really was and found that the article [at the start] described it in a way that would make you think it ain&#39;t all so bad. </p>

<p>It described how few healthcare workers died etc and how it is not airborne. Which made me wonder how ebola spreads at all.</p>

<p>Basically reality showed us that ebola spread very quickly and easily through the population, yet the article mentioned how easy it is to prevent. Yet skin contact was still top contraction method. </p>

<p>So lets not nit pick one of my sentences, when we actually agree in general [I think]. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Conflicting or confusing article about how dangerous ebola really is. Obama should not have hugged the patient as ebola IS dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dangers of ebola are outlined in the report, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ebola virus infection causes severe <strong>viral hemorrhagic fever</strong> with a <strong>high case fatality</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re infected, you get a fever, your ass falls out, and then you die. Horrific way to go.</p>

<p>But how can you catch it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ebola virus can be transmitted by direct contact with <strong>blood</strong>, <strong>body fluids</strong>, or <strong>skin</strong> of Ebola patients or people who have died of Ebola.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A virus spread by skin contact spreads extremely quickly, and contracting it is a death warrant - sounds incredibly dangerous, right?</p>

<p>So yes, if the nurse was infected with ebola Obama should definitely not have touched her, however, the nurse was <a href="http://time.com/3537430/obama-hugs-nurse-ebola-survivor/">declared free of ebola so there was no danger</a>. </p>

<p>The reason relatively few healthcare workers have died is because they were<a href="http://www.nationalturk.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ebola.jpg"> full body condoms</a> to prevent infection, and if they show fever symptoms, they are flown back to their respective first world countries to receive the best medical care available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Swine flu is just... the flu. </p>

<p>Ebola comes and goes because of a vast and dedicated team helping prevent its spread. Luckily Ebola is its own worst enemies. It kills fast and shows its symptoms even quicker. </p>

<p>Ebola has a real potential for grand fuckery though. When they brought the Africans to the US for treatment I was pretty certain it was to wipe out the entire US. </p>

<p>If Ebola happens again, we need to have a no fly zone to the affected continent. This is one way they will wipe us plebeians out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ebola was contained. Mostly thanks to the effort of the people on the ground and isolating areas that were infected. Also, it is not as deadly in case there is some kind of medical help. If person is properly hydrated then lethality drops down to 50 percent (or even less). Also, there is a possibility that virus losses lethality with mutation.</p>

<p>For people who are speculating that was artificially created there is no proof of that. There were some laboratory’s in vicinity of first cases but there is no definitive proof that it was artificially created in laboratory.</p>

<p>You can get more information here r/ebola/ But they are not to found of different opinions (i was banned for claiming it can spread through air via water droplets)</p>

<p>Yeah, some of the outbreaks seem to indicate that there are mutations with less severe symptoms.  Still going to kill you without treatment, but with notably higher survival rates.  But it&#39;s still largely conjecture, since this wasn&#39;t taking place in a controlled environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I know.  And for what it&#39;s worth, there are more than a few professionals who believe the same.  The problem is that it&#39;s almost impossible to verify such a thing outside of laboratory conditions, which is rare to happen with Ebola.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in public health and have seen Ebola, Zika, Swine Flu, etc for myself (even had Swine Flu, ugh). I don&#39;t understand people who deny that these diseases exist - as some are doing in this post. Surely the conspiracy would be how they originate and how they outbreaks are handled by the CDC, WHO, media, etc?  </p>

<p>For instance - even as someone who had Swine Flu, I think the way the WHO and medical community handled it was slightly suspicious and made some pharmaceutical companies a lot of money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing, they pop up and are in the news for ~2 months, effect a small number of people, and then disappear forever?  Where is swine flu now?  I haven&#39;t heard of it in years?  So when the next &quot;epidemic&quot; pops up, I&#39;m probably not going to care.  There seems to be no reason to.  Except on the conspiracy angle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Swine Flu is still around, it&#39;s just that different strains of the flu circulate every year - and when they&#39;re new, we don&#39;t have vaccines or medication to prevent or treat them, which can result in higher spread and higher deaths (and thus an epidemic).</p>

<p>You only need to look at Ebola in West Africa to know why you should care about epidemics. Over 10,000 people died of the disease. Yes, the media handled it badly and ignored the thousands of Africans dying so they could make a huge deal of the few Americans who had it (and scare people at the same time), but that was a relatively small and eventually contained epidemic. At some point, there will be a virus that will be able to do to the Western world what Ebola did to West Africa.</p>

<p>I suggest ignoring the media&#39;s scaremongering and finding better sources for health news, rather than deny epidemics entirely.</p>
