Do you believe just the actual landing was faked or the entire space ship launching and being in space and everything was faked? Not looking to start a debate if the landing was real or faked. Jw what part is believed to be faked</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted a thread of pictures in response to you saying that the idea that there exists ancient structures and artifacts on the moon and mars to be fantastical and unlikely to prove. I think there is more than enough visual evidence in the photos to indicate the presence of structures that officially shouldn&#39;t exist. Show some of the unmarked pics to someone and tell them they are photos of earth somewhere, and ask them if what they are looking at is natural or artificial.</p>

<p>Apart from a few Russian lunar probe photos from the 70&#39;s and a photo of the earth pyramid in Bosnia, all of the other photos are enlargements of NASA stock pictures. I have only personally gone to the trouble of verifying a few of the anomalies with links to NASA or JPL, but those checked out and I have currently no reason to think that any of the photos that don&#39;t have a source file name linked in the picture to be fabricated, if I become aware of any hoax photos I&#39;ll remove them.</p>

<p>Obviously the government cannot be trusted to tell the truth, but they do as much as admit to doing secret stuff in space, leaving questions about the exact nature of what they are doing open to conjecture.</p>

<p>Belief is not part of my thought processes, it implies that ones mind is made up and resistant to change. If evidence indicated the  flat earth theory was correct I would have no problem saying so, but it does not.</p>

<p>Which would be appropriate if examining the motivations behind actions undertaken by non-human entities, like a robot for example.  But when this reasoning is applied to examine human motivations it falls apart because we make convoluted and emotional decisions, not just pure logical ones.</p>

<p>Also, they left a big mirror up there. Get out your telescope at look at it. It&#39;s there. </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be too difficult to fake the dust: run the camera at 6x speed. Choreograph all movements accordingly.</p>

<p>Second, the mirror cannot be observed by any telescope you our i could afford here on earth. The mirror could have been brought later on subsiquent trips.</p>

Too many black and white theories saying either we did all of it or none of it. Very possible it&#39;s a weird mix of the two. </p>

I don&#39;t believe that we really went to the moon. The Russians were more advanced than us technology and they, nor any other country with a space program, has went to the moon. And the USA supposedly went multiple times? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is theoretically possible to avoid Van Allen radiation by exiting the atmosphere at one of the poles. The Apollo missions did not bother to do this.</p>

<p>In the 60s not many people had seen a computer. Now most people understand the computer used for landing the module would be about as powerful as an 80s pocket calculator. </p>

<p>Neil Armstrong can be seen test piloting a lunar lander on earth in a video. The lander goes wildly out of control and he parachutes to safety as it crashes and burns. The lander was never successful in a test- yet NASA saw fit to send it to the moon?</p>

<p>After taking off from the moon, the lander rendezvoused with the orbiting module. How exactly was that achieved with 60s technology? The chances of missing each other by possibly thousands of miles seem pretty high. </p>

<p>NASA has erased all of the telemetry data from the moon flights. This data represents (supposedly) the apex of human achievement. Could NASA be that careless? Did they WANT to lose that &quot;data&quot;?</p>

<p>Ralph Rene&#39;s book &quot;NASA Mooned America&quot; is well worth a read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, today you learned. I have my opinions, and if we are basing it off &quot;science&quot;, this is something they cannot actually explain. You have people saying: &quot;They were there for just a short period of time&quot;. But, I do not buy it. Is it possible for machines? Maybe, but look what radiation does to the robots at Fukushima. So, based on that. I&#39;m going to say we have not sent anyone/thing beyond low Earth Orbit, and even LEO I contest...</p>
