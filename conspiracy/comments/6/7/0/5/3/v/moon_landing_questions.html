       Iam wondering for those who believe the moon landing was faked (even if you don't but know the answer/have opinion) 
Do you believe just the actual landing was faked or the entire space ship launching and being in space and everything was faked? Not looking to start a debate if the landing was real or faked. Jw what part is believed to be faked

       No worries, today you learned. I have my opinions, and if we are basing it off "science", this is something they cannot actually explain. You have people saying: "They were there for just a short period of time". But, I do not buy it. Is it possible for machines? Maybe, but look what radiation does to the robots at Fukushima. So, based on that. I'm going to say we have not sent anyone/thing beyond low Earth Orbit, and even LEO I contest...

       The period of time was around six hours total, three hours to the moon and around 3 hours back. Only going through the thinnest parts of the Van Allen Radiation belt. 
Here's a six minute video that explains it, however it might be too much science

       Why do you disagree with the dosimeter readings from each of the missions?  What data do you have to contradict the readings they provided as well as the calculations made to determine potential rad dosages for the missions?

       Here is the information without any 3rd party analysis. What leads you to suspect that the instrumentation was faulty or that the data that was returned was inaccurate? Furthermore, what evidence do you have to support your claims?

       I provided the first link because it shows the data pretty simply in the table of overall dosages for the flights, the second link is more interesting for sure because you can actually read/listen to the transcripts to see how they match up with the data.

       So your saying no one can travel outside of our magnetosphere? What if they launched themselves through the rotational, or magnetic axis? That seems to be the point of least resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, If we couldnt pass through it, than why doesn't effect the rotation of the Moon around the Earth?

       I posted a thread of pictures in response to you saying that the idea that there exists ancient structures and artifacts on the moon and mars to be fantastical and unlikely to prove. I think there is more than enough visual evidence in the photos to indicate the presence of structures that officially shouldn't exist. Show some of the unmarked pics to someone and tell them they are photos of earth somewhere, and ask them if what they are looking at is natural or artificial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apart from a few Russian lunar probe photos from the 70's and a photo of the earth pyramid in Bosnia, all of the other photos are enlargements of NASA stock pictures. I have only personally gone to the trouble of verifying a few of the anomalies with links to NASA or JPL, but those checked out and I have currently no reason to think that any of the photos that don't have a source file name linked in the picture to be fabricated, if I become aware of any hoax photos I'll remove them.

       Ok I get you. My stance is that I do not believe the Mars Rover is anywhere near Mars. I can also post links but it would be easy to google. The fact that you have faith in NASA just doesnt jive for me personally but i do agree that IF those pictures are real they are intriguing but we wokt agree on much else. But we can disagree without being knobs I hope!

       Not especially, not enough evidence confirming its existence, though there is enough anecdotal reports to warrant inquiry.

       What's your deal? Flat earther?

       Obviously the government cannot be trusted to tell the truth, but they do as much as admit to doing secret stuff in space, leaving questions about the exact nature of what they are doing open to conjecture.

      <p>
       Belief is not part of my thought processes, it implies that ones mind is made up and resistant to change. If evidence indicated the  flat earth theory was correct I would have no problem saying so, but it does not.

       Nope, I am an ex SIGINT Analyst who's first operational deployment was in Iraq. Considering the types of collection we were running, and the absolute lack of evidence of WMD, made me leave after 8 years service. The problem that it then opened the door to 9/11, Sandy Hook, Jesuits etc etc. Almost over night everything that I thought I had spent years working towards were lies.

       Which would be appropriate if examining the motivations behind actions undertaken by non-human entities, like a robot for example.  But when this reasoning is applied to examine human motivations it falls apart because we make convoluted and emotional decisions, not just pure logical ones.

       It wouldn't be too difficult to fake the dust: run the camera at 6x speed. Choreograph all movements accordingly.

       Second, the mirror cannot be observed by any telescope you our i could afford here on earth. The mirror could have been brought later on subsiquent trips.

       I think there is a gray area where we may have made it there and back at times, but faked the parts of it to cover up fuck ups or shortcomings, or straight up lies. Too many black and white theories saying either we did all of it or none of it. Very possible it's a weird mix of the two.

       I was going to share a youtube video I saved but it got deleted. I'm 99% positive that Stanley Kubrick filmed the first moon landing. I don't believe that we really went to the moon. The Russians were more advanced than us technology and they, nor any other country with a space program, has went to the moon. And the USA supposedly went multiple times?

       Neil Armstrong can be seen test piloting a lunar lander on earth in a video. The lander goes wildly out of control and he parachutes to safety as it crashes and burns. The lander was never successful in a test- yet NASA saw fit to send it to the moon?
      </p>

       After taking off from the moon, the lander rendezvoused with the orbiting module. How exactly was that achieved with 60s technology? The chances of missing each other by possibly thousands of miles seem pretty high.

       NASA has erased all of the telemetry data from the moon flights. This data represents (supposedly) the apex of human achievement. Could NASA be that careless? Did they WANT to lose that "data"?

       Ralph Rene's book "NASA Mooned America" is well worth a read.

       No worries, today you learned. I have my opinions, and if we are basing it off "science", this is something they cannot actually explain. You have people saying: "They were there for just a short period of time". But, I do not buy it. Is it possible for machines? Maybe, but look what radiation does to the robots at Fukushima. So, based on that. I'm going to say we have not sent anyone/thing beyond low Earth Orbit, and even LEO I contest...

       So your saying no one can travel outside of our magnetosphere? What if they launched themselves through the rotational, or magnetic axis? That seems to be the point of least resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, If we couldnt pass through it, than why doesn't effect the rotation of the Moon around the Earth?
