       For those who didn't know, Bill Nye used to be skeptical of GMO's. In his bill maher interview, he discusses what made him change his mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/81FAqQ1qSiQ">
        https://youtu.be/81FAqQ1qSiQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "I went to Monsanto," Nye tells interviewer Miles Leicher, "and I spent a lot of time with the scientists there and I have revised my outlook... I'm very excited about telling the world." The interview ends with a rather giddy Nye declaring, "When you're in love, you want to tell the world."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Ahh yes, the ethical Monsanto. What a great corporation right? Bill Nye can't be
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       blissfully unaware of the atrocities this corporation has committed against the world's population, can he? He must be complicit. He must have value to the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Even worse, Monsanto's Chief Technology Officer, Robb Fraley, has also shared enthusiasm over Nye's visit by tweeting about the experience. On Twitter, he posted, "Thanks @BillNye for visit &amp; advancing #science understanding. Look forward to more discussion!" The tweet also includes a link to the aforementioned video, already cued to the portion of the interview that only mentions Nye's Monsanto meeting and subsequent plans to update his book. A picture accompanies the tweet; sure enough, there's Bill Nye, donning a bright smile and bow tie, surrounded by several people from Monsanto."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       He was singing a much different tune in this clip from his show years back regarding GMO's...

       TPTB must have seen a use for him, with his nostalgic appeal to the upcoming adult generation, ands pushed his support for establishment science pro-GMO down our throats. Fuck you bill.

       The whole point of this post is to expose him because he has a new show on Netflix called "Bill Nye Saves The World", where he pushed climate change, safety of GMO's, says Chemtrails are "malarkey", all kinds of pro New World Order propaganda to brainwash the millennials (like myself) who will inevitably watch this dumb series...

       His anti "anything but western medicine" show pissed me off. My company was doing research in the nineties demonstrating the healing potential of sounds, images and even scents. I'm not being naive here I realize the point he was making, yet twenty years ago American physicians would tell you acupuncture was bullshit, now many tell patients to try it.

       I agree with what you said before 100%, and the ownership and use of pesticides is a big problem. I also think that GMOs need more unbiased research. Having more knowledge on an issue is never a bad thing.

       They already do this with nonGMO seeds. Most seeds are hybrids and cant be replanted due to traits that fail to get passed on when new seeds are formed on the crops. Does no one really understand botany and crops?

       Well, I'm a farmer and sir you couldn't be more wrong. The GMO crops give us more options for weed control and desirable traits that improve yield and profits. It would be "serfdom" if there was only one company offering GMO seed. There is competition, between the different companies and their offerings as well as the ability for the farmer to plant and grow other crops that aren't sold by these companies.

       No, because science is about "reality" and contains both positives and negatives.

       I don't like or trust Monsanto at all, but that doesn't mean I'm going to automatically assume anyone who doesn't share my feelings is a shill or sell out. It's important to remember that the mainstream view is that Monsanto is a normal company, now obviously there are valid reasons people have for thinking otherwise, but it's also very understandable why someone would not realize there was anything inherently wrong with them. Not everyone has been exposed to the same information/view points you have.

       My point was: If you take 1 minute to look up the definition of "shill".
       <br/>
       Then read the OP's post about how Nye has TOTALLY changed his story, and now spouts how he's "
       <strong>
        in love
       </strong>
       " with GMO's and M0nsant0.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he acts like a shill, looks like a shill, ignores his own previous scientific opinion ... IMO, the OP's case is pretty conclusive!

       After he went and actually saw what was happening first hand. That sounds like a pretty reasonable response to me.

       I don't know about X so I'm skeptical/critical. I learn more about X and decide I'm OK with it. This is a completely normal and acceptable scenario.

       Again I don't have to agree with his conclusion, and it's also very possible that Monsanto showed him some propaganda to make themselves look better. But again, none of that would make him a shill.

       I'd say because of the way the show is framed. They explain chemtrails as contrails without mentioning the (admitted to) geo-engineering/cloud seeding. They promote the good aspects of GMOs with Monsanto while neglecting the harmful aspects (Roundup resistance in particular). The particular guests, celebrities, corporations, etc they pull in...

       Being in his position the standards should be on a more strict basis (like having an actual degree in whatever field of science), but he isn't because he is an actor that plays a "science guy" and that can be a slippery loophole for what the general public will take as credible.  So, really this goes deeper than just "Bill Nye the Science Guy" and into the objective and reflective perception of what and who the general public are willing to hold as a standard for any subject from serious to trivial in our daily PROGRAMMING.

       I agree!  If the person or persons are actively practicing the scientific method that makes them scientists on the definition.  I should have touched on that first.  From the rest of your opinion it seems to be in congruence with mine, unless I'm mistaken.

       It's not just that he has an opinion. He has a

       When he's giving his "professional opinion" as you've chosen to call it, it's just him talking as a television host. There is no point where he stops, turns to the camera and claims to be an expert in whatever topic he has to be covering.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only standard he needs to meet to host a television show, is to be qualified to be a television host. Which he does. So he's qualified. So it's appropriate for him to give his thoughts as a television host.

       Why do you believe that they're "phony"?  Tyson is definitely trying to make science mainstream, which I believe to be fantastic.  Hawking could maybe be called a bit over-hyped, but what about his work do you believe to be fake?

       Could you give specific examples of this?  Those are pretty heavy accusations and with extraordinary claims...

       A blog saying that Hawking was replaced with a body double?  I'm asking for faulty reasoning within their work.  If a specific theory, for example, was pure propaganda or disinformation, you should be able to show that.  I'll read the rest of this article, but I'm not not too impressed by a guy that can't understand that differences in lighting affect hair color and that hair dye exists.

       As a kid growing up in Seattle, he found a way to make science cool!

       I imagine after his fame he just did a bunch of coke, and hookers and ran out of money. Asked some of his science buddies what he could do to make a quick buck, and they said "Bill! Just sell your self out to big pharma, agriculture, and climate groups. Youll be rolling in dough in no time!"

       I noticed he started to pick up in popularity around 2010. He visited my school, Kent State. Started touring colleges pushing his climate change and establishment "science".

      <p>
       He is most definitely an asset to TPTB, and now that all those kids that watched his show in school are in college now, he's the perfect nostalgic figure for them to trust and look to for scientific world views.

       You have too much trust.  People love appealing to authority because 1) they don't have to think for themselves, someone else has already done that for them, and 2) it's easier to agree with everyone else than to go against the grain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people that I've talked to that don't watch any kind of independent media are completely fucking brainwashed and trained to the point that they see any kind of alternative view as crazy or extreme or they look down on it as conspiratorial nonsense exactly as the CIA has conditioned them to their whole lives.

       His new show is awful, though. I was happy to watch until I started, you know, watching it. Made it through half an episode.

       But should anyone really care what Bill Nye is doing? He's walked back his Monsanto comments quite a bit in the meantime, but is still generally pro-GMO. I don't think he's winning over anyone who wasn't already on his side, especially not with garbage dad jokes.

       ...I find it more baffling that people will deny evolution even though
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       know the proof. People
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       , regardless of background, that "kids tend to end up looking like their parents" and that they pass down traits. Evolution is literally just that. But more importantly that some of these traits will help with survival and some won't, and so individuals with certain traits have a higher chance of living and thus over time their population will increase over that with other traits because they're surviving more. That's natural selection. And give it a lot of time, and I mean
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       , and a species can change entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean people
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       this with dog breeding, pigeon breeding, that they get some traits from their parents yet
       <em>
        somehow
       </em>
       they keep denying that it has a real lasting effect. We also know that random mutations are a thing, regardless of scientific inquiry, because of weird genetic birth defects and that our race hasn't totally homogenised over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet people choose god. Because it's not natural selection that's going to make you feel safe, it's god.

       Because the theory of evolution states that we evolved from monkeys. There are millions of monkeys, billions of people. Where are all the inbetweeners?
      </p>
      <p>
       People who believe in God, also believe in evolution, just not darwinian evolution. The bible says that God made man from dirt. Thats a simple way to say that we evolved from micro organisms into what we are today. Over the span of millions of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit, 100 years ago scientists thought we were devolving. And White women were going to start having black babies, and black women were going to give birth to monkeys.

       Have you ever taken an IQ test?  I did and I scored a 148. I am capable of critical thinking.  Also I have read a lot of literature on this and listened to people much more intelligent and educated than myself talk on the subject and I'm convinced evolution is simply a theory with no evidence it has happened.  However, as I stated above adaptation happens and traits are passed from generation to generation. I don't believe we evolved from apes.  I think we "evolved" from a species of human as all evidence would suggest. You are welcome to your opinion and belief on the THEORY as am I.   Good day to you sir.

       They died out. Neanderthals died out mostly from competitive exclusion and us eating them though inbreeding did happen. H. Heidelbergensis died out for similar reason in africa but genetic divergence after they moved into europe makes them our ancestors and that of the Neanderthals. The Paranthropus genus, the true "inbetweeners", also all died out in Africa. And so on. I have a lot more to list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did so many of them "suddenly" die out? The transition between the Pliocene to the Pleistocene saw massive changes in the environment and climate. It saw conditions that the listed species just couldn't adapt to. Why did we survive? We evolved to thrive through periods of instability, and our traits in particular made it very easy to use the environment to our advantage regardless of conditions. I'm an archaeology student, I have to read through this on a daily basis.

       Funny enough there's even a homonid species that
       <em>

       Evolution is a theory. There is literally no proof one species has ever become another species. Species most certainly do adapt and change physically and traits both good and bad are passed on from generation to generation.  That is adaptation and most certainly nor evolution.  Mutations are almost never beneficial.  Let alone the idea of a sea dwelling creature becoming a land mammal.  Think of all the mutations that would have to occur within all the bodily organs, skin, bone and muscle structure.  The chances this would happen and they would all be beneficial let alone having both male and female versions mutating simultaneously is absurd not possible.  Even Darwin himself said his theory would not hold up to scrutiny because he realized he was most likely observing adaptation since his observations were the same species just very differently adapted to their environment.

       Which is why Evolution is a
       <em>
        slow
       </em>
       process that takes place over millions of years for actual grand change over the course of several thousand generations. A mutation is likely to stay if it's beneficial, and it can change further if different changes further benefit it. Pakicetidae didn't go to being a dolphin overnight, it got adaptations which benefitted it in one environment, then it evolved into Ambulocetidae where it benefitted from a different kind of environment. and one thing led to another and we have dolphins, i'm not going to describe to whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing people
       <em>
        often
       </em>
       forget is when a species evolves into another, the former species don't just all magically become the other or go extinct, but what exactly happens is two or more populations drifting to adapt to different kind of environments, and this happens when a species migrates to multiple different areas or a group gets separated.

       That's not how genetics works. Sure, there's some genes which are sex-exclusive, but genetics is rather efficient in the sense that one small change in one area can transmit to another. Notice how both our hands and feet have five digits, and our arms and legs are not too different? It maintains these similarities because of the efficiency of our genetic information is stored. same applies to sex features. A gene changing digit count will happen to male
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       female offspring.

        Also where are all the inbetween mutated forms that weren't beneficial? We should even be living among some today.

      <p>
       Neanderthals died out because of competitive exclusion, we partially killed them and some of their offspring is literally ours. Homo Floriensis died in indonesia ~12kya around the same period of the Pleistocene -&gt; holocene transition. Homo Heidelbergensis mostly died out in Africa but the rest of them either evolved into Neanderthals or
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       . Many human species actually lived alongside paranthropus species, notably P. Boisei. Why did Paranthropus, Sahelanthropus, etc die out? They either evolved into the latter human species, but more important the transition between the pliocene to the pleistocene saw massive changes in their environments they couldn't adapt to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did we not die out? We evolved to thrive through periods of instability, something other species could not do. We actually tried to colonise (as a species) Europe far before we actually managed to but the Neanderthals successfully resisted. Also the monkeys we have today are different than the ones we evolved to, in case you say "why do we still have monkeys?".

       Calling selective breeding "genetic motification" is implying that CRISPR is more or less in the same ball park as sexual reproduction, it isn't. Calling selective breeding genetic modification is a language game meant to muddy the public's awareness of the process and it's prevalence.

       Bill &amp; Neil have set themselves up as the gate keepers of science. Sagan brought everyone in, expanded the scientific view. But the ways in which Bill &amp; Neil have been promoted and their guests, it often comes across as offputting as they flash these purchased credentials yet make science zanny. There is little reverence there.

      <p>
       All the same, I like Neil more. I feel Bill is a step away from making science and excuse for violence with his authoritarian absolutism.

       That's the type of behavior I dislike about Tyson. While science doesn't have to be 'boring', he should know full and well that the GMO controversy primarily pertains to how GMOs act in the wild. And instead of allowing each side respect, he lampoons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise I've notice he places a lot of emphasis on titles. When it comes to science, many of the greatest discoveries were from people who didn't have the proper title. Add more, it alienates a lot of people from providing input... 'Are you a Harvard Astro Ph. D.? No? Then perhaps you should shut up', is sometimes how I take his introduction of guests, and likewise flavors some of his 'non scientists' guests as pure comedians.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a way of putting people into a box, which is derogatory to humanity, though it may be unintentional.

       The active ingredient in their most popular pesticide RoundUp, glyphosate, was discovered to be carcinogenic as far back as 1981, that's how far back the EPA knew of its dangers. and now the whole world sprays this deadly pesticide everywhere and with an increase in industrial agriculture it is a direct reason for increased cancer rates in the world. Everyone should watch the documentary on Netflix called "The True Cost." it discusses Monsanto and specifically this area in India called the Punjab region that has the highest pesticide use in the world, and doctors and scientists have noticed the pesticides from Monsanto like roundup are causing  extremely high cancer rates and health problems in the region, including high amount of birth defects, etc, and one scientist studying these affects specifically said Monsanto and these pesticide companies are ignoring these health links.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the famous video where a Monsanto employee was being interviewed and he said glyphosate is perfectly safe, and then the interviewer said "if it's so safe why don't you drink it now on camera" and he then refused to drink it. *RoundUp excuse me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also recently saw this study where 2 poor villages in Argentina were compared. One village had never sprayed any pesticides, while one village had a high amount of pesticide use, the study revealed that only 3% of families in the non-pesticide village had cancer, while in the heavily sprayed village 30% of families had cancer.

       I live in a farming community that grows a lot of wheat. When the wheat is at the highest weight/moisture content, they spray the fields with round-up to kill it for profitability. Then the RoundUp coated wheat is used to make our food. Every year they spray, many in the area get "hay fever." I can't imagine it's good for the ground water supply here either.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Desiccation is done primarily in years where conditions are wet and the crop is slow to dry down," Joel Ransom, an agronomist at North Dakota State University, said. Ransom says desiccating wheat with glyphosate has been a useful tool for farmers. “It does help hasten dry down and controls grain weeds and other material that slows down the threshing practice," he said. “It has an important role in areas where it's wet."
        <strong>
         Ransom says the practice has increased in North Dakota, which is the leading wheat-producing state in the U.S., over the past 15 years
        </strong>
        due to wetter weather. While more common in Upper Midwestern states where there is more moisture, desiccation is less likely to be done in drier wheat growing areas of Kansas, Oklahoma, Washington and Oregon.

He doesn't really have the education or experience background that most people would use as a standard for considering someone an expert in anything.

       You can blame people for being sheep and allowing themselves to be lead towards the cliff, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be drawing attention to it. There are plenty of incentives for conspiracies regarding the creation and support of "science" celebrities to help form and control people's beliefs about what is healthy and normal. Such conspiracies wouldn't necessarily need to involve the awareness of the celebrity, in fact it would probably be much more successful if they were unaware themselves and simply got paid to articulate their beliefs in front of a camera.

       If this was topic that was really as thoroughly studied as evolution, I would agree. But GMO foods also involves moral and ethical concerns. To go from having one stance to another after a tour of the Monsanto factory, and to propagate his new stance to his followers I'd definitely a shill.

       The only moral and ethical concerns of GMO food is the the concern that they're being held back by people who completely misunderstand what GMO foods are.
Spraying crops with pesticides doesn't make them GMO. It makes them covered in pesticides. Making a tomato that has a higher nutritional content than a regular tomato doesn't make it poisonous. It makes it better.

       True about the tomatoes. But it's disturbing that Monsanto is allowed to develop a GMO strain, copyright it, and go after farmers' crops that may be cross pollination naturally. There are lots of other ethically questionable things that Monsanto does that you can look up.

       What Bill Nye did for Monsanto is the very definition of shilling.

       This is so absolutely false and shows just how manipulated people can get when they read things they want to agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monsanto, in fact has never sued for accidental cross pollination, there is a famous case many GMO fear mongerers love to point to but the guy was actually found guilty. Farmers purchase seeds every year, have been forever, so much if this information you seem to believe is quite manipulated and essentially false, intended to make Monsanto look worse than they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want ethical dilemma? How about the people of Southern Asia where over half a million children die each year from malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency. There is a GMO called Golden rice that could be made available to them that was shown repeatedly to help this type of deficiency, yet food awful groups like greenpeace have blocked its release by suing them, literally killing millions of children the last several years... not THATS un-fucking-ethical!!

       This only issue I'll take with this stance is regarding the pesticide issue. The GMOs make pesticide use less. The amount of pesticides that go into conventional crops is minimal compared to the fake organic crops, and their pesticides tend to be either just as if not more "carcinogenic" though technically all the pesticides used have fairly minimal risk. The biggest difference is some paid organization gets to decide which pesticide is considered organic, you want conspiracy, look into the organic business, its full of shills, and bought out people to promote false claims.

       Um, they should. "Organic" is a corporate buzzword designed to make consumers spend more money. Organic uses pesticides, in fact they use more pesticides than conventional. There is also zero health benefit. There is absolutely no advantage, even environmentally, to eating organic. The fact that a conspiracy sub believe the organic lie over scientifically proven conventionally crops is hilarious.

       The thing about this cult of personality around Nye is that at this point it is the opposite of science.  People believe him because he is an authority, not because they've actually investigated and, more importantly,
       <em>
        thought
       </em>
       about something on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what initially set science apart from religion back when it was being developed - that it isn't based on authority.  It is based on what an individual using their own sense and reason can prove for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part humans just fucking love their authorities.  They don't want to think for themselves.  They want to be told what to believe.

       A shitty PSA

      <hr/>
      <p>
       If you ever have irregular bowel movements, then consider changing your diet temporarily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cut out fruits and vegetables, for a couple of days.  See if that helps.  Maybe the chemicals still on fruits/vegetables is affecting you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cut out sugar substitutes, for a couple days.  That might help.  Maybe those chemicals aren't as good as sugar that humans have had for hundreds of thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try cutting out different kinds of meats.  Some meats are packaged differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes for medications, if you can afford to go without them temporarily.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be healthy, but don't expect 'common scientific knowledge' to help you.  You have to figure some of this /shit/ out yourself, through your own science.  Bowel movements are supposed to be regular.

       Debunked as fuck. Also, humans, by and large have been eating sugar for hundreds of years, not hundreds of thousands. Honey, sure. Sugar, not so much. Unless you mean dietary sugar, but even so, telling people to add sugar to the diet is a pretty bad idea.

      <p>
       Disagree / agree. Science is what is going to figure this shit out in the long term. However modern medicine doesn't always have the answer to IBS/etc. so it can be beneficial to experiment with taking known allergens out of your diet. But just because things get better for a few days doesn't mean you should go gluten free forever, go see your doctor and see what they think.

       A sample size of one is incredibly important when that individual is yourself.  Besides, you can repeat the experiment multiple times on yourself to confirm, increasing your statistical reliability.

       Negative studies are published quite often, they just don't get attention as much as groundbreaking studies. It's also quite common to work on a problem, get negative results, and not try to publish it because of this. I don't agree with this - I think all results are valuable - but research is done by humans with egos who want to write novel papers - which is both a positive and a negative.

       Yup, and you can choose to not believe me if you like, it's your prerogative. I'm happy to talk more broadly about what I do if it would make you feel like I'm not lying to you but at the same time I don't feel like I owe people an explanation of my life - I hope my arguments are more important than my credentials even if you disagree with them - I always try to argue intelligently, using evidence and good sources, and not just running away from an argument when I start to lose.

       So...you're here so that you can "win" and someone else can "lose"? How do you define those terms in a reddit context? I would be especially interested to hear what your personal definition of a "win" is.

       Dude, sometimes people leave the computer screen and do stuff like go fishing or go grocery shopping or watch Stanley Cup playoffs.

       Not everyone is shrinking before your perceived internet might, sometimes other things are just more important than engaging in an internet debate with someone who is not going to change their view no matter what is said.
      </p>
      <p>
       When was the last time you actually changed the mind of someone you were
       <del>
        fighting
       </del>
       debating with on the internet to the point where they admitted they were wrong and you were right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been on reddit since almost the very beginning, and I used to over-prioritize it to a fault, I simply don't get too invested into  it anymore. In this sub I like a lot of the people here and find many people to be very smart and can receive a certain amount of value and appreciation for them without agreeing with them on everything. A good example of this, for me, are the people here who earnestly believe that climate change is a hoax and the vast amount of scientific evidence supporting it is somehow just
       <em>
        not real
       </em>
       , I simply cannot get on board with them on that issue, while agreeing with them on pretty much everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today I keep things very light and transitory, I wipe my own posting history every month and like coming to this sub in particular because I like to learn something new every day and appreciate that there are still some places to go to get the truth behind the illusions of our world.

       This is why Monsanto is so pernicious -- because questions like this aren't even allowed to be asked.  If you dare to ask them, then suddenly you assumed to have positions you don't have too.

       It is not unreasonable to ask someone to try different foods and chemicals, and remove them from their diet, to find intolerances.  It's not unreasonable to come to the conclusion that some of those, like SUGAR SUBSTITUTES.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck me for trying to prevent you guys from getting MS early.   Get on the fat and sugar diet and avoid the substitutes.  Don't get fat, but getting on fat and sugar will help you to avoid that because you will feel more full and your body won't feel tricked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracy is that all these substitutes are pushed as healthy and equivalent to what we've had for hundreds or thousands of years.  It's what makes a buck, and self-deluded fools fall into it, thinking they are "pro-science", when really, they are advocating against their own health and doing

        actual

       Do you remember the psychology reproducibility scandal a year or so ago? Several studies were found to be perfectly reproducable in the US, but no so in other countries, presumably because the cultures are different.

       If I look at IBS rates in the UK before and after decreasing apple content of their diet, these results will be totally different from a study done in India, where the different fruits they eat and the amounts and other factors would obviously change the rates.

       Have a feeling I'm misunderstanding what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to parse "sugar alcohol sugar substitutes" and I'm taking it to mean you're talking about "sugar alcohols as a sugar substitute".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        due to them being used in relatively large amounts for sugar substitutes (most sugar substitutes are much sweeter than sugar)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Most artificial sweeteners are much sweeter than sugar, but I thought you were talking about sugar alcohols which are less sweet than sugar (and thus you need more). It's kinda confusing when you try to talk about two things at the same time.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        inability to be digested
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again because your writing is unclear but this makes no sense for artificial sweeteners so I'm going to make the assumption that you suddenly started talking about sugar alcohols again, in which case there's some truth to this yes, but I'm not able to source "acting as fiber" or "feeding bacteria".
      </p>
      <p>
       For feeding bacteria, did you maybe switch AGAIN back to artificial sweeteners? They may cause some changes to gut bacteria, but from what I can find, seems unlikely for sugar alcohols as they're resistant to fermentation (a reason it's used in gum, to get rid of your halitosis).
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah there is some truth here but it's hard to, ahem, digest, because you didn't make much effort to write clearly.

       Yeah I wrote this quickly because this was a minor mistake in a thread full of major ones but you parsed this mostly correctly. I was saying sugar alcohols cause problems because while the majority of sugar substitutes are relatively or wholly indigestible, the sugar alcohols lack of sweetness means they must be used in larger amounts than other artificial sweeteners. Thus their bulk comes into play. Dietary fiber is a term mostly used because the main natural indigestible we come across is cellulose fibers, it being a fiber is of lesser concern. Also sugar alcohols are absolutely digested by gut bacteria. They don't digest in your mouth because in the mouth their are easier food sources that get absorbed before they hit your large intestines.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case the laxitave effects of sugar alcohols are well documented, and thus are an important exception to your statement on artificial sweeteners.

       Okay, thanks for that. I mostly agree, though I can't find a source for the bacteria thing either way, only that one of the alchs "probably doesn't" affect gut bacteria, but didn't mention any others. But admittedly I didn't look that hard, maybe there's something more recent I missed.

       Everyone's reading into this too much. First, do you honestly believe every person working at Monsanto is some evil fuck-the-world person? No of course not. Especially the scientists, I'm sure they are doing what they love to do.

       I'm also not anti GMO. I think there is a huge need for GMO products, without them right now we'd have mass starvation in the world and then people might not be so picky. Does it need improvement and to be disassociated from a corrupt company? Yes, does that change the need for GMO? No. Does bill bye see that? Yes.

       Through the process of selective breeding, we have in a way been "splicing" the DNA of many different species. Over time, they evolve natural defense mechanisms so we breed them into other plants to share them. That isn't any different than GMOs, except on the scale that it's being done. Is there the potential for abuse? Yes, but the same can be said of any modern technology! It also allows us to pretty much feed the entire world with a farm the size of Texas, and not even worry about pests. In fact, GMOs allow for even LESS poisoned pesticides to be used, due to their added in defensive mechanisms. Despite the misinformation that all of you seem to share in, GMOs are good! Monsanto might not be due to their focus on profit, but they certainly aren't some unholy evil that you all seem to parade them as. I'm not a shill, I'm not a worker for them, I just do my research.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (
        <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy">
         http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy
        </a>
        ).
The journal Food and Chemical Toxicology retracts the article “Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize,” which was published in this journal in November 2012. This retraction comes after a thorough and time-consuming analysis of the published article and the data it reports, along with an investigation into the peer-review behind the article. The Editor in-Chief deferred making any public statements regarding this article until this investigation was complete, and the authors were notified of the findings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Very shortly after the publication of this article, the journal received Letters to the Editor expressing concerns about the validity of the findings it described, the proper use of animals, and even allegations of fraud. Many of these letters called upon the editors of the journal to retract the paper. According to the journal’s standard practice, these letters, as well as the letters in support of the findings, were published along with a response from the authors.1 Due to the nature of the concerns raised about this paper, the Editor-in-Chief examined all aspects of the peer review process and requested permission from the corresponding author to review the raw data. The request to view raw data is not often made; however, it is in accordance with the journal’s policy that authors of submitted manuscripts must be willing to provide the original data if so requested.2 The corresponding author agreed and supplied all material that was requested by the Editor-in-Chief. The Editor-in-Chief wishes to acknowledge the co-operation of the corresponding author in this matter, and commends him for his commitment to the scientific process.
Unequivocally, the Editor-in-Chief found no evidence of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the data. However, there is a legitimate cause for concern regarding both the number of animals in each study group and the particular strain selected. The low number of animals had been identified as a cause for concern during the initial review process, but the peer review decision ultimately weighed that the work still had merit despite this limitation. A more in-depth look at the raw data revealed that no definitive conclusions can be reached with this small sample size regarding the role of either NK603 or glyphosate in regards to overall mortality or tumor incidence. Given the known high incidence of tumors in the Sprague–Dawley rat, normal variability cannot be excluded as the cause of the higher mortality and incidence observed in the treated groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimately, the results presented (while not incorrect) are inconclusive, and therefore do not reach the threshold of publication for Food and Chemical Toxicology. The peer review process is not perfect, but it does work. The journal is committed to getting the peer-review process right, and at times, expediency might be sacrificed for being as thorough as possible. The time-consuming nature is, at times, required in fairness to both the authors and readers. Likewise, the Letters to the Editor, both pro and con, serve as a post-publication peer-review. The back and forth between the readers and the author has a useful and valuable place in our scientific dialog.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Editor-in-Chief again commends the corresponding author for his willingness and openness in participating in this dialog. The retraction is only on the inconclusiveness of this one paper. The journal’s editorial policy will continue to review all manuscripts no matter how controversial they may be. The editorial board will continue to use this case as a reminder to be as diligent as possible in the peer review process.

       Did the people doing the study apologize and agree with Elsevier's retraction? What did the people who conducted the actual research say about Editor-in-Chief's retraction? Did Monsanto aggressively twist any arms or apply any pressure to Elsevier? What did your research tell you about the backstory behind the retraction? Did you look into it at all?

       In short: it doesn't matter. A retraction means that the peer-review system failed. The paper was accepted when it should have been rejected. If it had been correctly rejected in the first place, this never would have seen the light of day and you wouldn't have anything to whine about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering this sub whines about "bad science" all the time, it has a surprising amount of tolerance for bad science that fits with the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, using a rat strain that has a high prevalence of tumours, then shouting "LOOK THEY HAVE TUMOURS"... yeah, good job.

       Sorry, I'm quick to downvote bad sources - the first site is 100% anti-GMO fluff with no other content. The second is also exceptionally shady bad "science" all around.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with looking at two sides here, is that one side is backed by peer review, the other side is "there are weird structures on the moon it must be aliens" (literally the first link when I looked at the second site's front page).

       Okay, so we have two possibilities here.
      </p>
      <p>
       One: Monsanto coverup. Big if true, but it's a big if.
Two: Peer review process fucked up. Possible. I haven't reviewed any papers myself but being around people that have has made me realise it's a tough and thankless job.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's look at the evidence. You provide an account, that's a good start. Unfortunately it's heavily biased as it's written by the author of the retracted article, so let's see what better we can do, shall we?
      </p>
      <p>
       So what caused the second look at this paper that caused it to be retracted? Well, after publication and before retraction, no less than thirteen(!!) letters were sent to the editor. Here are the links and thankfully they're all open access so I don't have to repeat them all:

       There is also a small number of letters after the retraction, some in favour, some not, but they're irrelevant to the reasons behind the retraction as they occurred afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went through each letter, I've read every letter of every single one. Of these, 12 call the paper into scrutiny, while only one defends it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's deal with the defender first, since there's only one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Author is this guy:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Heinemann">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Heinemann
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Heinemann is a vocal critic of the way genetic engineered risks are accessed[4][5][6] and the benefits are estimated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So he doesn't seem very neutral on this subject. Of course it's hard not to have an opinion, so I won't attack him.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now the real legwork, what dirt can I dig up on those scrutinising the paper?
      </p>
      <p>
       (I've rearranged my browser tabs to make this easier on myself so these may or may not be in the same order as above).
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Two academics in a related field. They both seem to be based at some neutral place (not in Monsanto or anyone else's pockets). They don't seem super prolific but both have a decent amount of literature under their belt.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Professor at a well known university. Has a wealth of literature on this and related subjects (plant breeding &amp; genetics). Seems solid. One link to Monsanto - after this letter was sent (years after) he was on a panel of judges for Monsanto to award a fellowship. This type of work is generally unpaid. If they met somewhere (possible but unlikely in my view) he would have had travel/expenses covered but that's it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         One works at Monsanto (can't find a timeline on this), the other does not. Read into that what you will. Both are researchers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Very highly regarded professor. Has been on a Monsanto panel (I think you'll find it hard to find someone doing research in this space who hasn't), but again, after this letter, so not the reason it was retracted.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Professor at highly regarded uni - no links to Monsanto.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A professor and other researchers - no links.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are several dozen names and reputable institutions on this one so I can't really go through them all, suffice to say it's unlikely these - professors at oxford, various US state universities and other reputable international universities - are all somehow in Monsanto's pockets.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         usual reputable professor, one year sabbatical at Monsanto.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Couldn't find much on this guy other than he has written some papers and can't find any nefarious links.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Seems to work at one of Monsanto's competitors, would be a bit weird for him to be on Monsanto's side, though I'm sure he's a proponent of GMO in general.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Different letter from an earlier author.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Don't quite understand all the links on this guy but apparently some people say there's a conflict of interest to be sure.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So what does this tell us? As far as I can tell, there's maybe one Monsanto employee in all these letters, and I can't find out when he started working there, and his letter was co-authored with someone who definitely doesn't work for Monsanto.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a few reasons to be skeptical, a fair number of the authors of these letters have had some contact with Monsanto, though as far as I can tell only several years after these letters were written. However, this is pretty normal. These people are experts in GMOs and plant science. There are only a few companies in the GMO space, and Monsanto is surely the largest. It would be almost impossible for a high level GMO researcher to not have contact with them. The issue is if their research is funded by Monsanto (and this is easy to find out) - as far as I can tell, none of it is, and nobody (other than the one guy) has likely received a penny from Monsanto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say it's all true though, what do they gain? Maybe Monsanto give them some money, or promise them funding for more research... in exchange for what? Lying about a paper? If they did that and anyone found out (hint - it's really easy to find out as all their letters and publications are easily available for anyone looking) their careers would be ruined, Monsanto would need to give no kickbacks, and you can't get funding without a career.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah there are reasons to be skeptical for sure, but the vast majority of the signs to me point to it being retracted for a reason.

       Then you should have known that there is little proof that GMOs increase yields or reduce herbicides. In fact, herbicide application increased! However, insecticide use has decreased, but herbicides take up the lion's share

       The only reason I'm even defending Monsanto is because of the serious need for food around the entire world. They as a company aren't great, but they really aren't the devil. That's all I'm trying to say. And I still haven't seen a single source in this thread that really changes anything that I already know about them. It's all hearsay and news articles, not actual studies. Which is why it's so frustrating.

       This is the number one disassociation tactic that's always brought up. Double news flash crossbreeding over multiple generations for desirable traits is not at all the same as going in and altering the genetic code with different species especially non-plant species being cut and copied into the DNA of plants.  Black and white ppl can cross breed, dogs and grasshoppers and salmon and ppl cannot cross breed and when you edit the genome you're opening pandora's box and creating unnatural results.

       Which probably is your fault for not writing clearly enough and stating what you meant plainly. I re-read what you said after I read this to see if I missed some sort of subtlety you were conveying so I could check myself on what I replied to you earlier, and I guess I am just not getting it or something, because I still can't hear the sarcasm or irony in your typed words.

       There is a lot of evidence that shows that GMO crops do not offer any greater crop yields than conventional seeds do, in fact, in India the GMO cotton yields have shown to be less than traditional seeds do. The "GMO crops will save us from starvation" has not proven itself to even be a real thing, in fact, famine and starvation has got worse since GMO's have entered the market, so the evidence is actually proving to be the opposite of what the Monsanto talking point has programmed you to believe.

       I think that now both Nye and NDT have sold themselves out for love of fame, celebrity and love of money. Being a corporate celebrity shill who gets to be on TV pays more and becomes a corrupting influence. Both have ceased being neutral critical thinkers long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that both like to play the "
       <em>
        look at me, the clever nerd-guy of the schlocky tie!
       </em>
       " card. It's like the

       TV pseudo celebrity scientist costume or something.

       They are a company that almost exclusively works to create GMOs (and products to associated with their use). Thus they have become the main target of those who view GMOs as "frankenfood" (even if they are far from the only ones to do so). This reputation was fully cemented in two actions. One they invented what are known as terminator seeds (which actually solve one of the few real concerns about GMOs which is the genes escaping into other plant populations especially wild ones) by making it so the seeds produced from the GMO's pollen or ovum are unviable or similar without special treatment. People slammed them for this on the grounds that its a trap to make farmers dependent on Monsanto and having to buy seeds from them again despite that they already are contractually banned from doing so and farmers mostly would do that anyway because, as they are hybrids of true breeding lines, the seeds the GMOs generate have a smattering of different traits with 1/2
       <sup>
        n
       </sup>
       having original ideal set of n traits (GMO or otherwise) they bought them for. The second was a few widely (and badly) publicized lawsuits the most famous of which was Monsanto Canada Inc v Schmeiser. Schmeiser claimed that the source of the GMO genes in his crop was accidental contamination and thus he had a right to use it (ignoring that he had used roundup to kill every single nonGMO crop in the field he replanted from). This claim morphed into Monsanto suing anyone who dared to grow their own crops near a GMO field and let even one grain of pollen fall on their land (Monsanto's real policy is to take the area suspected to be contaminated and compensate the farmer for it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also before you mention it seed patents predate the very existence of GMOs.

       So apparently people aren't allowed to change their mind?

       Better get this part in early:

       I'm no fan of Monsanto, mostly for patenting crops, which I find disgusting. While they have committed to not commercialising terminator seeds, I remain annoyed by their experiments with them. And I'm not saying GMOs are the answer to all our problems, or that there's no potential for misuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, GM crops are nothing new. Selective breeding has been around for thousands of years. Being a "natural" process does not make something good or bad. Even discounting that, much of the food we eat these days have been genetically modified over the last 60 or so years by blasting radiation at them and seeing what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of these techniques are far more prone to ending up with crops with bad traits than modern targeted genetic modification. With the population of the planet increasing so rapidly and with the changing climate it's more important than ever to have crops resistant to drought and disease, with higher yields, and GM is one of the tools here, and IMO one of the better tools in that it doesn't kill off the bee populations like certain other Monsanto products.

       The fact-based alternative, (which isn't a cheap creationist knock off) goes by names such as Plasma Cosmology. There are Plasma Cosmology branches like Electric Universe Theory and the like, those and dozens of others have a century of scientific evidence for support.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alternative to Big Bang Creationism is not religious beliefs like Young Earth Creationism, it's models of an infinite universe with no creation event whatsoever. These models have fact based models with experimentally verified explanations for quantum photonic phenomenon such as redshift.

       I have never heard of plasma cosmology before now. But based on a quick Google search it looks like plasma cosmology died off in the 90s from the major scientific journals due to the theory behind the behavior of plasma did not match up with the known proven models.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that is how science is supposed to work, anyone can bring forth a theory back by some evidence. If the theory can survive scientific scrutiny then it is researched further. If the fundamentals of the theory collapse then it's abandoned unless another breakthrough discovery is made.

       Plasma Cosmology has not died off, it merely does not have the support of the #fakescience establishment. It matches the observed facts and reality just fine. The "known proven models" you claim - have all been debunked and are creationist nonsense.

       I have only recently started to look into Plasma Cosmology (since you introduced me to it) so my knowledge on the subject is very minimal. But some of the sources that I used to look into it were sites likes
       <a href="http://www.plasmacosmology.net/index.html">
        these
       </a>
       which seem well regarded in the plasma community. In this site they claim:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Because the sun is seen to emit roughly equal quantities of ions and electrons, the solar wind is considered electrically neutral in mainstream circles. This is wrong. In reality it is a huge bipolar electric current, and the terms solar wind and solar radiation result from the fact that the mainstream refuses to acknowledge electricity in space.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yet mainstream science does acknowledge electricity in space. Also, "solar radiation" results from the fact that the Sun is radiating. We see light coming off of the Sun. We can also observe a stream of charged particles, of both signs mixed together, coming from the sun. This can be tested from a high school classroom.

       Electrical Plasma phenomenon however isn't an endorsement of a Big Bang or Inflationary creation event though. Can you create a model of your arm moving as an unconnected continuum to the Big Bang? Of course not, moving your arm has nothing to do with the Big Bang. Neither does solar radiation. Radiation is only proof of radiation.

       The problem is that Plasma Cosmology relies on the false assumption of the sun that I posted earlier. Since that fails under the current evidence then the greater theory fails too. I am willing to give Plasma Cosmology a second look if the fundamentals are improved, but at the moment that seems unlikely since researched on the subject has been stalled for almost two decades.

       No it doesn't. You are just making a straw man. Plasma Cosmologists have dozens of different solar models and a model of the Sun couldn't be used as the basis for a creation event anyways. Plasma Cosmology is merely the study of cosmic space plasma as "it is" through scientific investigation. It doesn't make any claims about a creation event or the age of the universe.

       I understand that it's the study of plasma, I never said that plasma cosmology claims an age of the universe. But the fundamentals of what they are claiming can be discredited with observations from our own sun.

       I don't see how, all the sun can do is enlightened our understanding of plasma behavior under various conditions. As mentioned before, there are dozens of solar models under the plasma cosmology umbrella. Dozens have been debunked sure, but others still remain and continue to get stronger. Which model in particular are referring to? What do solar models have to do with creationism in the first place?

       This false rage against GMO foods is contrived and nonsense. Selective breeding was done by our ancestors and genetically altering crops so they grow in dry climates is the "selective breeding" of today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with Monsanto is something else, and I have to say that this nonsense about poisonous GMO foods and altered DNA(scary words for the ignorant mind) HELPS companies like Monsanto. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with Monsanto is their copy-righting and lobbying power. When they copy-right a seed and a farm buys and plants it, the wind carries that seed over to the next farm that hasn't bought from Monsanto - and farm #2 is consequently taken to court by Monsanto for patent infringement or w/e. THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE. Which is minimized by idiots screaming about poisonous GMO foods...in fact,
       <em>
        puts on tin foil hat
       </em>
       , that would seem like a great divisionary tactic by Monsanto to jump in on.

       Can you link to the case where someone was sued for incidental cross-pollination.

       Only case I can find about cross pollination. The farmer was lying and found in the wrong but no damages were awarded to Monsanto. I will admit plenty of cases were Monsanto sued farmers for replanting.

       Ya know how I know Bill Nye is a shill? We were forced to watch his climate lies propaganda in middle school. That was a dozen years ago for me. They are still feeding his bullshit down our kids' throats. Fuck this cuck. Anything you are taught in a public school, especially history or stuff with the climate, believe the exact opposite. I was give in school suspension for telling my history teacher slavery was not the primary factor for the civil war AND that Lincoln only wanted to free the slaves after it became apparent it would be beneficial for him.

       The only reason I'm even defending Monsanto is because of the serious need for food around the entire world. They as a company aren't great, but they really aren't the devil. That's all I'm trying to say. And I still haven't seen a single source in this thread that really changes anything that I already know about them. It's all hearsay and news articles, not actual studies. Which is why it's so frustrating.

       I don't have any problem with GMOs, understanding the nature of biotechnology - and ignoring all attempts by either side of the question to conflate selective breeding into the matter. What I have a problem with is the monopolistic tendencies supported by their modification and control of various seed supplies and, though I'm not 100% certain, RoundUp.

       Well, it is the business side I have problems with, it's just the GMO options are often pretty attractive and in some places it's basically all that's available. It's not the advances in biotechnology I've got a problem with, though - Monsanto is just up there with Walmart on my personal disdain list. To too many people the word "genetic" is a dogwhistle.

       Monsantos is the classic create the problem and present a solution to extert more influence and control. Monsantos pesticides destroyed the soil biome which is basically the good bacteria that keeps soil healthy. The pesticides would destroy 98% of all the bacteria good and bad, leaving the remaining fungus and bacteria to mutate in response to the pesticide. They become harder and harder to kill every year, with monsantos pesticides being the only viable solution. Then they present thier gmo crops to achieve complete monopoly over your food source.

       I'm sorry that I forget that glyphosate is just the trade name and doesn't follow any real chemical nomenclature (the real name just sounds kinda stupid to me). I always end up making a name more like a chemist might make when the simply the long structural names. Now do you have any actual criticism as to the factual accuracy of my points? Or just my spelling?

       So, the way this seems to work is: blackmail. That's how they coerce people into doing their dirty work. There's money, too, but assuming Mr. Nye is not easily bought over, I wonder what little skeletons in the closet he's hiding that the elite found out about?

       Actually, Japanese universities have shown in numerous scientific trials that sniffing Rosemary Essential Oil and Lemon Oil  may improve memory, intelligence, and other cognitive attributes. Studies done by Moss et al., 2003, 2008; Tildesley et al., 2005 reported that lavender EO reduced memory and rosemary increased it. Rosemary also increased alertness in comparison to the control group and the lavender group. In other studies, peppermint improved memory and ylang-ylang impaired it. Spanish sage improved memory, speed, alertness, calmness, and "connectedness".
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to rosemary though, its effect on neural electrical activity has been shown by Diego et al., 1998; Field et al., 2005 in workplace studies to increase speed in math computation as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of odors on learning is actually a well-researched phenomenon. So, I wouldn't dismiss a site simply for stating that Rosemary has a sort of nootropic type effect. Studies show that it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Granted however, I don't know how they're measuring the 75% figure.

       Also, people are allowed to evolve and/or change their minds. I do not care about Bill Nye's titles, or lack thereof--I just know he's smarter than you and I. Not to say that demands default trust, but I'll take it over some armchair research scientists that merely look at webpages that reaffirm their uneducated theories, then come here to jizz all over it in unison.

       He is most definitely an asset to TPTB, and now that all those kids that watched his show in school are in college now, he's the perfect nostalgic figure for them to trust and look to for scientific world views.

       Um, they should. "Organic" is a corporate buzzword designed to make consumers spend more money. Organic uses pesticides, in fact they use more pesticides than conventional. There is also zero health benefit. There is absolutely no advantage, even environmentally, to eating organic. The fact that a conspiracy sub believe the organic lie over scientifically proven conventionally crops is hilarious.

        “Desiccation is done primarily in years where conditions are wet and the crop is slow to dry down," Joel Ransom, an agronomist at North Dakota State University, said. Ransom says desiccating wheat with glyphosate has been a useful tool for farmers. “It does help hasten dry down and controls grain weeds and other material that slows down the threshing practice," he said. “It has an important role in areas where it's wet."
        <strong>
         Ransom says the practice has increased in North Dakota, which is the leading wheat-producing state in the U.S., over the past 15 years
        </strong>
        due to wetter weather. While more common in Upper Midwestern states where there is more moisture, desiccation is less likely to be done in drier wheat growing areas of Kansas, Oklahoma, Washington and Oregon.

       Well, it is the business side I have problems with, it's just the GMO options are often pretty attractive and in some places it's basically all that's available. It's not the advances in biotechnology I've got a problem with, though - Monsanto is just up there with Walmart on my personal disdain list. To too many people the word "genetic" is a dogwhistle.
