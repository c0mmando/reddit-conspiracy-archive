       I think when people talk about a secret space program on here, they are not talking about rockets. I thought they were mainly talking about conspiracy theories about reversed engineered alien tech, or perhaps tech the government has traded for with aliens. Maybe even FTL capable stuff like Stargate.

       I would love it so much if the gov told us we have FLT capable ships and can go to other star systems. I would love to travel to another world, right after we revolt and kill everyone in the government who lied to us about this for years.

       In theory it could be done. All the satellite launches could be part/supply missions and the ISS could be a secret fabrication facility.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I would ask what planet and why? Venus has cool science, but it is a barren wasteland that is incredibly hot. Mercury is too close to the sun. Jupiter and it's moons are crazy far and would require engines that don't (officially) exist. Even if you want to go with the secret planet on the other side of the sun (that is totally not a lens flair guys), the transfer time would be way more than a trip to just Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       A secret mission could be done, but I'm not sure why it would need to be. Other than just secret military stuff or a near earth object situation (like the movies).

       If we're entertaining the idea of a SSP, it seems silly to quote facts from the SSP fronts about planets. We (me and you), really have no idea what planets may or may not be of interest, and we definitely can't act like we know they are too hot, too cold, etc., etc.

       Yes. I have one, and I do from time to time. I'm not saying the ISS is a secret fabrication center. However, from an engineering standpoint it would be possible to build another craft in secret using satellite missions as cover. Possibly having sections of the ISS repurposed for the new craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't for one second believe this is the case, but if I needed run a secret mission thats how I would do it. Like if the government wanted to keep a doomsday astroid hidden until they had a plan in place. I'm pulling that straight from the plot of Deep Impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ISS is a science station with some of the coolest engineering in the world.

       I think "we've" already been there, I don't understand the hype. Because it may be a desolate planet, on the surface, anyway. Also, I'm thinking, it's a 'one-way ticket' to go there. There's no Earth to Mars transit system.

        "A Dutch start-up named Mars One is hoping to send a select group of brave astronauts on a one-way trip to the Red Planet in the year 2023 with the aim of establishing a permanent human colony.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If all proceeds as planned, Mars One would launch four astronauts on the interplanetary voyage in 2022, landing the team on the surface of Mars in 2023, after which they would begin constructing the colony. Every two years, a team of four additional astronauts would arrive to reinforce the existing colony."

       If I had found something very interesting in space, I would do it in secret (if I was in charge), cancel everything space related and only work on that but that could create suspicion. Instead I would send something to a planet that wont tell us much (Mars), then I would make give some money to movie producers to give the public a movie about Mars once every year. Then hint on the possibility that a human mission to Mars was coming in the next 10 years. Saying that was our next goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real mission would be flying in FTL ufo tech spaceships to other systems and continue to talk with other civilizations in secret.

       I really dont believe that could be true though. Nobody is conspiring to hide anything. Actually I am very excited about Mars.

       I would love it so much if the gov told us we have FLT capable ships and can go to other star systems. I would love to travel to another world, right after we revolt and kill everyone in the government who lied to us about this for years.
