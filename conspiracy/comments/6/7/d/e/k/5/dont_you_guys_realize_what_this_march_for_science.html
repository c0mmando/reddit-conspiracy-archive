Gentiles, heathens, sinners, or whatever negative label you want to sitck to people you think you are better than. You fail to realize that religion is the driving force of division in this world.

<p>Not quite. They are trying to delegitimise science and destroy &quot;secular materialism&quot; so that America will return to God. This isn&#39;t a joke to be discussed in r/atheism, it&#39;s a serious conspiracy that has been ignored for 20 years. They aren&#39;t trying to create doubt &quot;to make us look like loons&quot;, they are doing it so that people will ask questions that can be answered by &quot;God works in mysterious ways&quot;.</p>

<p>The endgame of the Wedge document was played out during the 2016 election. Pence is their man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP has it right, but most of us haven&#39;t studied our history.  When the Vatican couldn&#39;t suppress Renaissance scientists - let alone enforce a monopoly on Bibles - they realized the solution to both problems was to <em>become</em> those things (or purport to) and through that control the public narrative.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll recall that Roman Catholicism is what the vast, conquest-oriented militaristic Roman Empire repackaged itself into as a response to the upsurge of legit MidEast Christianity in the wake of Jesus&#39; followers.  Because when you truly want to break something apart, you pose <em>as</em> it and get into it, where you can knock it over properly.  We&#39;ve seen them do that with Scripture, with the law by emplacing what amounts to a guild of attorneys cautiously bringing in Roman civil (statutory) law into the common law-founded U.S., and we find them doing the exact same thing with the publicly-presented scientific narrative.  Heck, they even brought about The Age of Reason themselves, by which they meant the Age of Carefully-constructed Logical Fallacies.  As long as they control it, it hardly matters to them what means they use.</p>

<p>You are allowed to have your own beliefs, but when you start pushing them on others without any evidence, people are going to call you out for that. That is not persecution. You have <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/66yluf/is_the_biblical_creation_story_incompatible_with/dgo37nl/?context=3">claimed</a> to have been persecuted by others (specifically, <a href="/u/gonnacrushit">/u/gonnacrushit</a>) as well. I guess you do this any time someone tells you that you&#39;re wrong about something?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I merely questioned the theory of gravity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/GQTqD">Here</a> is what you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravity might not be real. Maybe things fall to the earth because they&#39;re more dense than things beneath them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You said this not realizing that denser things sink <em>because of gravity</em>. This is not &quot;questioning&quot; the theory of gravity; it is misunderstanding it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the Christian teacher I got the speed of light thing from: <a href="http://www.khouse.org/articles/1999/225/">http://www.khouse.org/articles/1999/225/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that is my point. What you&#39;ve claimed about the speed of light is not based on empirical evidence; it is based on what the Bible or other Christians claim. It is hypocritical to say things like, &quot;I totally thought science was about transparency and reproducibility instead of fraud and dogma,&quot; when you get your beliefs about the speed of light from Christianity, not physical observations. </p>

<p>Science <em>is</em> about transparency and reproducibility. I can&#39;t publish any of my work without it passing peer review (I&#39;m a scientist). Part of that process is quantifying your uncertainty. Where have your Christian teachers quantified their uncertainty? </p>

<p>Like I said, your arguments against science don&#39;t hold much weight when you don&#39;t even accept things that are observed facts (like <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/66yluf/is_the_biblical_creation_story_incompatible_with/dgmk0ei/">the shape of the Earth</a>).</p>

<p>You are replying to me. Am I not allowed to respond just because you are deciding that my doing so is somehow &quot;religious persecution?&quot; You are posting comments to a public website. If you don&#39;t want people to publicly disagree with you, then why do you comment publicly?</p>

<p>It looks like you&#39;re <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/mysticism/comments/62xbo7/comment/dgqoqgq?st=J1Y6MKZN&amp;amp;sh=15ee6bd4">claiming &quot;religious persecution&quot;</a> again, because... surprise, surprise: someone else disagrees with you. </p>

<p>Also, I notice that you edited your comment above <em>after</em> I had already replied to you (without adding any disclaimer that you had edited after my reply). And you complain about me quoting you in my replies. <strong>That is exactly why I quote you.</strong></p>

<p>Also, you said the following above, but I forgot to respond to it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the record, I&#39;m not a young earth creationist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? <a href="https://archive.is/SCTCC">This</a> is what you said earlier:</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m stoked to be a young earth creationist who thinks he lives inside a planet type thing with a dome over it at the center of the universe which is probably quite small.&quot;</p>

<p>So were you lying just now, or were you lying earlier?</p>

<p>You have the right to respond or not. If you decide not to continue this conversation by replying, then it won&#39;t continue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was raised a Christian but when I reached the age of reason and graduated from sunday school to adult services at around age 11 it all fell apart. I couldn&#39;t believe all these grown adults were buying something that started to look like obvious bullshit to me and I abandoned it at age 13. My church was a non-denominational one that was all about love and Jesus. It was about as harmless as it gets but there were still plenty of sermons on how &quot;We are living in end times&quot; and people believe it. So even if they are not actively trying to fuck up the world they are pretty sure that they are going to be teleported up to a golden McMansion in the sky at any second so they don&#39;t care.</p>
