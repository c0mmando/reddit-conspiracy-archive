       They certainly do a lot of things that most people would consider evil, but I honestly think a lot of it needs to be dumb.
People are so incredibly stupid. They can be made to believe anything. People need to have reason and understanding as Plato describes it, but most people have very simple and easily manipulated beliefs. Simple beliefs should be used to manipulate those people into actions that are beneficial for a common goal.
      </p>

       Look at what we are doing to this earth. Throwing trash everywhere. 500b people scooting around walmart buying soda and cookies. Mooching off the government, costing trillions in healthcare and entitlements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone needed to take a page from the Taliban's notebook and take control of it all. Someone needs to get the CIA, FARC, soviets, terrorists, Adnan Khashoggi, etc. in order to control the drug trade. And include banks like BCCI and artists like Koons to launder the money.
      </p>

       If you learn how to use the gateway technique for remote viewing, you can,with years of practice, go far enough outside yourself that you can see the future. Sounds crazy but its true. And the future looks pretty good to me.  Everyone gets to do exactly what they want(even weird shit), but nobody gets hurt.
      </p>

       Might sound bad, but what else is going to happen with billions of people who are destroying this world?

       That isn't a bad thing, because dying isn't the end. Your body is just a vessel for your consciousness to perceive change in frequencies in the world. When you die, your consciousness simply returns to the single consciousness of the universe, where you will still be there just not able to interact physically with the world we live in.

       It's comforting to pretend there will be an afterlife with some sort of locus, like a heaven or a "single consciousness," where our souls/minds/consciousness will reside and be allowed to remain intact. That some form of our personality will remain.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we don't know how to separate consciousness from matter. We don't know if that's possible. There's no real proof that it can be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our minds are just chemical charges shifting around, swapping electrochemical energy from one cell end of the cell onto to the tip of the next cell. The essence of who we are resides in the brain's structure, and swapping electrons between chemicals within our cells. We are merely energy stored in chemicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when we're dead, the patterns we've created in our brain that make us who we are will stop. Our electrochemical activity ceases and then the biological hardware for that activity begins to break down without oxygen and glucose to nourish it. Bacteria eats us. Who we are just dissipates into rotting biological gunk. We become less organized matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our electrochemical impulses have already stilled and become electrochemically balanced. We lose the difference in charges that make thought possible. We are only chemicals at this point, no longer charges. We become part of the universe again, but only as matter. Our electrochemical consciousness is gone by this point, lost in a sea of decayed cells, a soup of less organized elements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our atoms get to be absorbed into something else. Maybe they will feed another organism one day and help create consciousness in that.

       You aren't wrong about what's being done to this planet. While a good number of us seek to care for the earth and one another (not excluding our animal populations), overpopulation, greed, and war in a grossly overpopulated world is the root of the mayhem.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't maintain our numbers but we're not approaching that practically - instead we're working harder to bulldoze more forests, drill more fossil fuels, and produce produce produce. We're burying ourselves in waste, illness from toxins and processed bullshit called 'food'. You name it, we're fucking it up somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to consider the people behind a NWO are responsible for the worst of these offenses. Producing for the masses to make money. That production is raping this planet. Crimes against the planet and humanity will not stop simply because there's a major population cull. They'll still vie for those resources. They'll continue to destroy anything they have to in order to make a profit somewhere. They'll still be in control. So no, I don't think that's a solution. I think dismantling those behind this agenda is the solution.

       I actually really enjoy watching a lot of the videos the Council on Foreign Relations' videos on Youtube.  Obviously, they're what the public is allowed to see, but when you watch them you get a better grasp on the policies they favor, the economic stakes, and a little taste of future legislation/ media carrot dangling for the masses.  It's the polite and intelligent face of globalism, and for better or worse watching their videos has helped me shape and hone my own values and develop better personal arguments much of the agenda they subscribe to.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a video of Hillary Clinton addressing the CFR back in the fall of 2015, and as someone who wasn't that interested in politics back then, it was the thing that made me say "never this woman."  She basically talked about the necessity of a 30 year minimum engagement in the middle east, and that's really easy for her to say given that no one in her family will ever be sent over there as a soldier.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, sure, there are shitty people and 500 lb goobers in Walmarts, and ignorant teeming masses throwing their soda bottles out the windows of their humvees, and Hillary Clintons and George Soros-es, but I still believe in the inherent dignity of being born into human form.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a tough lesson to learn, and the learning of this lesson never stops, especially when you're facing someone who tests every bit of your patience and empathy.  If you take the time to figure someone else's story out, it's kind of hard to really hate anyone.  Yeah, that ISIS dude is beheading a woman, but one day not too long ago he was probably a little boy getting raped or seeing his mother and sisters raped and slaughtered.  Obviously he grew up to be fucked up.  George Soros learned as a teenager what he had to do to survive, I can't with 100% assurance say I wouldn't have taken the same opportunity to survive, had I been in his shoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that mean I have to accept what that ISIS executioner or Globalist billionaire does now?  No, I think these individuals have made their choices/ cast their lots, and they have to be stopped, but I can't hate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the same way when I'm riding the bus that makes stops at the Methadone clinic, and a young mom is screaming at her kids (who have to take the trip everyday with mom to get her methadone); part of me thinks there's no hope, and fuck that woman for putting her kids through this.  But in the end, that person had circumstances and abilities different from mine; if my consciousness swapped with hers maybe I'd end up the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Nah, fuck the NWO, I love humanity and believe in 500 lb scootypuff patron's inherent dignity.

       I used to support the NWO, but I eventually realized they were pretty much evil people justifying their evil rule by proclaiming that everyone is evil.  It's not true.  It's merely emotionally flattering to people who imagine  themselves as the world's retard-wrangling only sane men.  Scratch one of those, and you'll usually find an evil retard.
