       We just had a post hit the front page. They're bringing in the big guns now to make sure their narrative is plastered in the comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Top 50 comment chains are about how terrible
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       is, and how it's a hotbed of racists and partisans.

      <p>
       It's almost ridiculous to watch evolve.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be active today on other subs. Spread the word about shills and fake accounts. We can use the attack to our advantage.

       Barking up the wrong tree man, check the history if you like. I spent the past few days trying to stop u/canonsolar for his derailing/"account age fallacy" campaign, and exposed those 3, 3day old accounts who were posting about Clapper and commenting on each others posts to create an echo chamber.

       Op's feelings towards not wanting a female president and believing pizzagate are mutually exclusive. Don't lump them together in attempt to discredit him entirely. People have flaws.

       Full disclaimer is I mostly only lurk this sub and less so since Trump supporters took over and choose to turn a blind eye to any possibility of wrong doing by this administration. But I thought we've moved passed pizza gate... and the reason I bring it up is because I think it's important context for "who" believes this sub is under attack. The post is unnecessarily political and the reason stated for the attack is one worthy of exploring, even if it's only for a short period of time.

       I'm sure he'll find some partisan hack like Gowdy that will go after her nonstop.

       While I think she needs to be investigated, I think it's more important that the FBI Director is fair and nonpartisan. Not someone selected for the express reason to investigate Trump's political rivals.

       I'm a pizzagate believer, but I honestly think that won't happen and that's because I think Trump is in on it too. Although I'd be willing to eat my words if I see him put them in prison and they don't pull him down with them. But at ther moment I think that he can't put them in prison because they would bring him down with them.

       Didn't bother to look through your post history because you where being rude and insulting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might I suggest that if you were trying to actually engage someone in constructive debate then refrain from insulting people. Insults will only lead to more insults and the point in the conversation is lost from both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is unless the point of the conversation was to defame posts that express an opinion you don't want to see so others who think the same are weary of expressing the same thoughts for fear of being ridiculed as "thick" or some type of "monkey".

       They're literally using Urban Dictionary to say "cheese pizza" is a common pedophile term. Give me a fucking break.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone knows "cheese pizza" in relation to child p*rn was created by 4chan as a meme/joke. I can't say for certain that the meme hasn't crossed into use in those disgusting circles by younger pedophiles, but I am pretty skeptical that 68 year old John Podesta is using 4chan meme terminology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit that there are some weird aspects to the story, but took make the Pizzagate theory work, they just assume to worst about every aspect to try and make it fit their narrative. Overall that post looks like Charlie from IASIP looking for Pepe Silvia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying definitively that Pizzagate isn't real. I remain skeptical and I find it irresponsible to brand someone as a child rapist without extraordinary evidence (actual victims would be a start).

       Sure, there might be certain aspects of pizzagate that are just creepy coincidences, but the big picture goes beyond just one person like podesta. "Pedogate" is 100% real. There is a massive international pedophile ring involving high level gov officials that supplies children for occult rituals and blackmail purposes.

       But Pizzagate revolves primarily around Podesta, and in my opinion is/was driven primarily by partisan group think.

       Yeah I get what you mean. It's annoying when people keep bringing politics into this, without realising that by advocating for or bashing either party they're playing into the system. But there's potentially shills and useful idiots on both sides, so I think it's best to just call out the partisanship and move on without letting it rustle your jimmies. In regards to when you say "I thought we've moved past pizzagate" do you mean the msm version which pins it solely on dems and the idea they run a paedo ring out of comet's basement? Or do you mean what most are now calling pedogate, which refers to the bipartisan elite paedo ring in which members from the upper echelons of both dems and reps participate in? Because I, along with I believe many others in the conspiracy community, do believe very much exists.

       They're also comparing him to Nixon saying that he must be guilty of something if he fired that liar who was "investigating" him, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet their cross posts will show the real difference in comment sections.  The exposure the other subs get because they don't have the reputation r/conspiracy does means, those messages will likely prevail and our tin-foil hat wearing bullshit means any message here is heard in our sub only.  Compartmentalized baby!

       Well if you evaluate the other 99% of the comments in the chains you will see what I'm saying. Obviously the original posters in the thread were legit conspiracy users before the post hit the front page. This is why the top comments in the comment chains are pro-conspiracy.

        IMO it's conspiracy hipsterism. A big part of the appeal of conspiracy theories for many people here is that it helps them feel superior to all the sheeple who have no clue. Mainstream conspiracies, true or not, don't provide the ego-boost.

         I'm not sure. I feel like this sub is just now recovering from all of the conquered altrighters.
For some strange reason a lot of it seemed to stop after Russia's efforts to influence the French election failed.

        I used to come here and enjoy the sub. I didn't buy 95% of the content here, but it was always fun reading the theories and occasionally my mind was blown when some pretty serious and persuasive connections were made. (For example, I never bought JFK conspiracy stuff untill
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        turned me on to his involvement with the CIA, the cover ups of investigations afterward, etc.)
       </p>
       <p>
        And yet here we are, were its looking more and more likely that a sitting US president or his associates may have openly colluded with the Russians in a US election, which would possibly be one of the craziest conspiracies in US history, and yet the sub seems almost silent on the issue or at times even hostile to it.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's when I realized this sub was less about conspiracies in general and more about conspiracies that advance particular political world views and ideologies of the userbase.
       </p>

        Lame.

       I believe t_d is equally as manipulated as any other brigading sub. Good source of useful idiots to go along with the bots shaping discussions. They've been doing it this way since 2007. See, before they had to actually get people to push their narrative because reddit was pretty good about killing bots when it was semi-private. Once they stopped cracking down on bots to push up site registration, they had more ammo.
      </p>

       The brigading subs are just covers for the actual vote manipulation.

       how could anyone be anti trump though? hes poised, professional and really seems to relate to the common man. his policies have all been sensational successes, and he had the most people ever assembled in one area EVER for his inauguration. Also, he was informe on 3 separate occasions by a respected fbi official that he has never been, and could never be, under investigation.

       r/conspiracy was marginalized by actual racists and woman-haters. Seriously most of you are fucking Psychotic. I can't count how frequently I've seen alt-righters here advocate for the brutal deaths of people like Podesta and Hillary.

       If you have time to dig through peoples post histories and count their karma by day, and then make a post complaining that you can't just accuse others of shilling, I'd say you can find the time to engage that person in some kind of conversation rather than just tossing an allegation at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure your God would understand, and might even prefer you converse with them rather than, you know, bearing false witness against them.

       immediately posting under this username under the 4 day old thread in which you tacitly admitted to me that was one of your other accounts, yeah, theres no way youd have known how to get to that post in that thread and its only like page 5 of my posting history, I knew where to look for it and yet youd already found it, if you werent him youd have had to sift through 4 pages of posts to even find what im talking about. you didnt do that in the two minutes it took you to post under trumprus in the old thread(after "finding"it)

       It's actually just the AP article linked without any commentary. Pretty mundane considering that the AP article could have been linked from anywhere else on reddit.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       People will bitch about this sub, but we also get a few people that come in and see that they can get some real news and information here also. Many an article that will get deleted from every default sub, even if they have to bullshit about the reasoning for the deletion, will be allowed to stand on it's own here. People see this and come to appreciate being treated like a grown-up where they  can read the censored stuff for themselves.

       One of their latest tactics is accusing everyone of being a shill. I keep getting attacked by recently created accounts calling me a shill with a 10-year old account.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's funny is I'm being called a shill for not supporting the Russian hacking narrative conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, they're flipping their tactics. Since we called them shills, they're now calling us shills to muddy the waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're now calling themselves conspiracy theorists, and pushing their own fake news and propaganda as conspiracies, but call you a shill if they disagree with their approved conspiracies.

       It's basic divide and conquer, but they're getting smarter.

       Reddit is pretty much the perfect place to practice using machine learning techniques and basic AI. If they're analyzing our responses, they can then shape new algorithms to respond. There's a possibility some of these accounts aren't real people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, if it is real people, they're idiots following a script. Which is just as likely as some of these accounts are really dumbed down.

       And like clockwork the presence of anything but far-right Trump praising comments triggers T_D so badly they respond by making posts like this one.

       It's not fake accounts dude, there are alot of people there are very suspicious of Trump's move. You've been in a self-imposed bubble for too long.

       As I see them, the Top 50 chains are not about "how terrible r/conspiracy is".  I see only a handfull of related comments.  And this sub, over he past year or so and in my opinion, has certainly become more of a hotbed of racists and partisans.  That is a fact anyone here can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stating the Top 50 are about how terrible this sub is is a flat out lie.  And if you haven't noticed the racism and partisan opinions over the past year, you certainly are not paying attention.
