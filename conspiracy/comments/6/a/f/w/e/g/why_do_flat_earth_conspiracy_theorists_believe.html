    <div class="md"><p>This is what I have gathered, I dove in to the flat earth rabbit hole, came out confused, but still believe the earth is round. Basically the earth is not just flat, but has a dome over it, look at operation fishbowl. They are saying space does not exist, it only us. So this indicates there is a creator, an intelligent designer, God. So that is the cover up, they don&#39;t want you to know that God exists, specifically the God of the bible. The way it is presented now, is that we are nothing just a speck in the universe, nothing special about us, so it&#39;s all about you, me, I. But what if we are special, what if we are the only ones? How would this change everyone&#39;s view of themselves and how they view other people? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just some history on FE. Back about 6 years ago I think, there was a satire site created called the <a href="http://theflatearthsociety.org/home/">Flat Earth Society</a>. Actually looks like started in 2004, but I saw it start getting some serious attention in like 2010 or so. Imho, this was a brilliantly executed troll. If you went to their forums and chatted them up, they stayed in character pretty well. There were some nuances that let you know it was satire though. It was really just over the top ridiculous. It was like a Poe&#39;s Law singularity. Well, people started joining the forums that obviously bought the premise. And I dunno if the original creators are still around, but eventually the movement attained its own momentum and became an actual thing. That is just how I remember the progression. I used to spend some time there myself, being at that time fairly trollish.</p>

<p>But lately I have had another idea. What if it was a psyop? What if it was created to do exactly what it did? I am starting to lean that way, they really spend a lot of time building out their theories in such a way that they were convincing to people that didn&#39;t have the greatest understanding of astronomy and physics. It is easy to write bullshit, much harder to write <em>believable</em> bullshit. And look at where we are now. What if I was red pilling my buddy and he was taking it. If I told him &quot;hey check out this great sub <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> if you want to know more&quot; he would take one look, see the flat earth stuff, and I would look like an idiot. And I bear no ill will towards those that believe it, like I said it is convincing. But </p>

<p>I think the real conspiracy here is what it has done to the image of CTs. I mean, we got plenty of other stuff that is really hard to believe. But this is like a central piece to a normal education. The founding of America, where they learned the earth was Round! (that is an <em>actual</em> lie, but whatever). It cuts us off at the knees of credibility.</p>

There is evidence including numerous photos of the planet from both the moon and way out in space.

    <div class="md"><p>A common psyop technique is to create a false story and place it near a topic you want to cover up. You then focus entirely on the false story and discredit it and the ridicule everyone associated with it. You have then implicitly discredited the REAL topic you want to hide without ever bringing it to peoples attention. (Would anyone like some pizza with their elite pedophile/trafficking rings?)</p>

<p>The real question in my mind is, what are they trying to discredit? Is it the the speculation about the elite&#39;s activity in Antarctica? Is it just to blanket attack the entirety of the conspiracy community? I have no idea...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asked two different questions in your title and body. The answer to why withheld they lie is simply imagine how living in a universe that came into being through a big bang, random evolution, one planet among millions, only through blind luck did humans appear, vs, a Flat Earth with a dome, at the center of the universe, clearly intelligently designed, along with all the creatures in it and whatever evolution there was guided. The way those two different scenarios make you feel is why they would lie. The answer to why conspiracy theorists want to prove it is because they are suspicious of science and like the idea of what a spiritual revolution discovering the earth is flat would produce</p>
