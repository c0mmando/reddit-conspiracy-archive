       I don't want some religious argument here.  This is discussing the underlying theme of every religion and acknowledging the Gnostic belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we've been trapped here, was it by God or just God to us?  A more powerful resonance of mass that enslaved our consciousness?  Is it just an alien being that we have no bearing on?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of people are waking up to this line of thinking and I'm sure many are confused about what the real situation is and while I realize nobody can answer 100%, we should narrow the discussion down past the modern religions and really figure out who is actually good and bad.  Many believe the light bringer or knowledge bringer is god for saving us and giving us choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the slippery slope because it's all layers deep in hypotheticals.  Just looking for healthy discussion and rational consensus.

       I've been studying this for over a year and probably have another 2 years to go but I did study outside of religion. What I found is that this matrix we live in is designed like a game where heavy duty beings decent down to particle level and work their way up through total ignorance back up to maxed out beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also found that there are no bad guys but there are "poisoned minds" so we aren't supposed to defeat these people but rather build a system that helps them improve and prevents future poisoned minds. Spiritual training in our education system would be ideal for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do have will for right or wrong but mid to high level beings always do and always have chosen right. There has never been an incident where they chose wrong. This is simply because they are way to intelligent. There are many, many levels past human. Animals are below us but we are below most everyone else because this is only the very beginning and the beginning is the worst part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil is inherit in ignorance but learning to avoid evil is all in our hands entirely. God isn't going to jump in and save us out of nowhere. That would defeat the purpose of the game of evolution but God is the magic wand that humans use to progress. He is the co-creator but we are in the drivers seat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, we haven't been getting worst through the ages. We have been getting better although we have ups and downs. We have been going down since the 50's but in the LONG run we are always moving up. There is no way to stop evolution but we can delay it. For most of history, we have been savages but there was a time when savagery was normal and not looked down on because we were simply too stupid to know any better. We did finally get rid of our hand weapons (IE clubs) but now we use money as a club. We still have a lot of work to do because we are in a turbulent place right now with all this madness, bullying, attacks, fear, guilt, and other elements that are tearing our society apart. We are allowed to destroy ourselves but we really should improve because suffering accompanies failure and that suffering motivates mortal creatures to move forward.

       Emotions dig at the roots of things. Make the Hu(e)man sick. We are supposed to live in tune with nature not with the way of man. Ego is absolutely a big part of it. But there are many other things.

       "Luciferian" or "Satanic"? Luciferian has more in common with "Venus = Our collective consciousness = the light" and teaches that Lucifer taught us good from evil (self-awareness), which Jehovah didn't like hence he kicked us out of the garden. He isn't our fire, but he is our intellectual light, and important to the soul. Our "spiritual fire", the highest dimensional component of an individual, is from true source (God, in the sense of what made all of original creation). Jehovah is our "simulator ruler", and a well-intentioned God that is unfortunately often ineffective since he is also learning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that the original teachings say that we have a potential to unlock, but of course what Satan would want is to twist the original teachings so much that he would prevent any development at all, except for his chosen group which hoard the true knowledge. It's not about hoarding power, it's about making humanity as a collective entity more effective by understanding how we are all connected on a soul and spirit level.

       Not necessarily. I believe the Luciferian aspect comes down to how you use your free will.  Self vs others. Lucifer inflates the ego and one becomes entitled.  The infinite deflates ego and one becomes enlightened.

       Everything is one with God; you are but a reflection of a reflection.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point after wanting to get to know itself, God decided what would it be like to separate oneself? This created the concept of "me", the dualistic realm that we see today, darkness. This principle is known to us as Lucifer. Lucifer is the lightbringer because it is through contrast with the dark, that the light seem bright. Lucifer "created beings" (ie the self reflection of the self separated from other self), which in gnostic myth would be identified with the Judaic Old Testament creation story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are many self reflections down the line, so to speak; because there have been so many similar beings before us we are a very refined version which has the potential to attain enlightenment in one incarnation cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mentioned a desire to get a more rational view as to how or why this may be case. I would recommend checking out Christopher Langan's Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe (

       ). It is the most complete theory of reality I have found, however he creates many new terms to describe the concepts in his theory so it is very dense and takes a long time to get through.

       I'm sometimes surprised how religious /conspiracy is. Does conspiracy lead to spirituality, or spirituality to conspiracy??

       Conspiracy definitely to spirituality.  If it doesn't there is something wrong because the ultimate conspiracy is spiritual coverup.

       Religion is sort of the ultimate conspiracy because it is defined as promises beyond this world, that we happen to take very seriously in this world and exist in a realm of particularly abstract concepts that rely on much different kinds of "proof" than other topics. We define our whole lives around it, and donate so much (money and otherwise) to it. Such a valuable type of information to control!

       Well the gnostics believe afaik that god is pure logic divided in echelons and the lowest echelon (sofia) trying to get to know the heart of the logic fell down and created this world. There has been talk of lucifer being Sofia too as they  are the only narratives of gods literally "falling from the sky".
Anyway looking at the Torah i find the main thing is "god is the word and the word was god" or along the lines.
Meaning god is knowledge, god is the thoughtform of the creator which the adult person symbolizes.
The holy tree of life has a highest point and that represents god, meaning it spawns from a singularity, while lucifer is represented by 2 highest points (the goat horns), meaning he presents yourself a lesson, while holding a different one for himself. The knowledge is always one, just the method of giving it is dual (deceptive, but who knows, could be pedagogic).
Anyway the gnostics were more angry at Yaldabaoth who i think could be Yahweh, but most likely was a descendant.
All discussions on the topic though consider the alien theory, since gnostics used to talk of those entities in way too real terms for them to be simple abstract entities. In my opinion.
