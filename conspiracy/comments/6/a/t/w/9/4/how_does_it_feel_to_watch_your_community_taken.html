       Really? That's amazing. I don't know what's more amazing, that I know them all from long back or that nobody in your supposed position would give themselves away before we'd actually chosen one, or be aware that no-one has been chosen yet.

       Fired? You have no idea what the culture is like here. No attack vector just waiting to see if someone asks a good question but no one cares which just means a slow couple hours until I go home.

       You're literally powerless.  I could invite this stupid LARP account to the mod team with full permissions right now and all that would happen is you getting laughed at in mod mail as you struggle to have an effect.

       Personally, not much to do with Politics as most of it is theatre anyway and keeps you distracted, clogs up the front page, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I deal more with stuff that hits too close to home, if it gains any kind of traction which seems to be happening less and less (partly due to recent acquisitions) we'll put out some spin through 'friendly press' or deploy a limited hangout to protect our interests. It's mainly GOV related and that doesn't mean politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't say much more than that. Just so you know, you've been pretty close with a few things in the past 3 months but they aren't related to politics, think bigger picture, much much bigger picture almost existential. btw the Russia baloney isn't being pushed by us, it's someone else.

       See my other comment. This guy thinks he's being slick, but revealed enough to make it clear he's low level Military intelligence assigned to social media. That or LARPing, but remember that survey a few years ago where the military base was one of the top locations visiting reddit? They have plenty of people posting on social media, and there's probably one stupid enough to think they're being slick in this taunting when really they're showing their hand.

       Hahaha, you don't even see 'the problem'. Anything of real concern to our 'employers' interests is downvoted immediately. No one ever sees it. Anything that actually makes it to front page is theatre, it keeps you distracted. I'll be very honest, a few conspirators have come pretty close to the truth with their 'investigations' but we'll spin a limited hangout to satisfy your desire for "the truth". Or we'll comment on the story and blast upvotes to sway opinion. People form their opinions based off the top comment, it's sometimes more important than the content of the "investigation" or article.

       I'm not sure to be honest, less than 1000 though. Maybe 20-50 'Gold accounts' (not Reddit Gold) which have been bought from once trusted users and are run in a very subtle way. All accounts have different OO's

       LMAO oh man! Here comes another ban! You know how I end up with all these accounts? Every time I get banned, I create 5 more accounts 😂😂 so you don't think there are other forums out there? You don't think that we have the technology to defeat these small road blocks?? Brotherman, you can't just stop us. Are you fucking retarded? When has any human, peasant or President ever been able to stop the progress. The truth will come out and all your efforts will be a sham. You nor anyone can stop it.

       SideNote: Do you tell people IRL what you do for a living? What do you lies do you tell them? What lies do you have to tell yourself everyday you sit in front of your screen? If your a scumbag behind the screen, what does that make you when you put the mobile down? Do you consider yourself human? Doubtful

       From one human to another, you should take a break from your "job" (it's not) and reevaluate your moral scale. Do you really want to live life like this? Yea maybe it was cool for 6 months but do you really want to this be a bigger part of your life? Is it healthy? Is it worth the mental bullshit you deal with?

       No brother, your not. The best part of being human, is that people are free to think and live how ever the fuck they want. Secrets out bud, we humans are much bigger than your shit mental games. There are millIons of us that have right through the the scripted code. Millions will turn to Billions

       I'm glad you see through the scripted code. That's why we're here because some of you talk about stuff you shouldn't really be talking about, just not so much anymore it seems many of you have abandoned this place. Why do you think I posted? To be mean? No, because I and some of my colleagues want to see you put up more of a fight, it's getting boring.

       We haven't left. In fact, I think we are getting closer and closer no? Isn't that why you showed up in the first place? Because we were digging where we shouldn't?? Sounds like you guys aren't doing a very good job, cause the truth is still coming out

       Used to be much closer to it actually. Basically anything that gets shilled into oblivion is what you want to be focusing on. At least give us a challenge. Like I keep saying, think bigger picture. Most of what you see in the media is theatre even though many of the actors don't know they're in the play. Goodnight.

       It might seem that I've 'given the game away' but far from it. I've been very selective with what I've divulged. I won't get fired, do you think I'd have posted this if that was at risk? My colleagues have looked at this post in fact and had a good laugh, I'm not hiding anything from them, only from you.

       No, you've been far less clever than you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Viral marketing only works when people don't think it is marketing. It's the same thing here - telling the target that you are attempting to influence them goes a long way to making them less likely to be influenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put it this way - you think you're clever, but you're not. The simple act of making the claims you are making proves they are false.

       You're right most of them can't. My point here is that such a small % of this sub will see this. Most will forget by next week, maybe the week after. Either way it's been an interesting exercise and I'll see you tomorrow on a new account.

       Does it pay well? Obviously there are different tiers to the job, like I imagine CTR made minimum wage or spiffed pay. But, in general what is the money like? Or is this just adjunct to another position which this duty is a part of?

       Based on what he said with 18 months before another job and it being sort of like a contract, my guess is Military. Remember the Reddit survey that showed a military base to be one of the top visitors to reddit?

       Not sure what you are really trying to say here.

       This is just one small stop on the internet for people who like to discuss and investigate conspiracies.

       My uncle was banned from here over some trump shit but it did matter a whole ton to him? No, pissed him off of course, but he keeps working on things. Has several investigations of his own going, has some more radio shows he will be doing in June/July, and is reading as much as he can as he always has.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't handle adversity here it isn't the right place for you anyway. You don't have to like the mods (who does?) but you can still read and learn things (there are some decent things that pop up in here which is why it is one of the many resources I use, has saved me some time on some things).

       If he's not LARPing, he's military. It fits with with what he said about salaries being similar, sort of a contract for another 18 months, and caring about bigger picture not politics. Remember when it came out that a few years ago that a military base was one of the top locations visiting reddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Low-level military intelligence. Thinks he's been briefed on the truth based on personality type, given just enough to convince him he's doing right. I had a friend who did similar about a decade+ ago in the early social media stages. Low level military intelligence.
