       Something big is coming, I can feel it....
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all seen posts like these. I used to think it was a way various intelligence outfits may have been using to check our oil, to get a read on the general sentiment. How close are the crazies from taking to the streets? I think we are a bellweather of sorts to the IC. Things that rattle around in the subconscious of regular people unformed, but we openly talk about it. So when we are all freaking out about Comey getting fired, that is a leading indicator of a common sentiment among the populace too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, while all that may be true as well, I think posts like these are part of a more nefarious design. I think I can speak for many when I say there is a sense of waiting for the other shoe to drop. Waiting for an indication that a huge group of people are going to pop off and storm congress and demand justice or something. Or that some white hat hero is going to arrest all of the the corrupt people in the government, no body will get hurt, and all the bad guys will go to prison forever. They have us in this waiting position, which is ideal to their purposes for a lot of reasons. First and foremost, when you are poised and waiting for a happening, you are not doing anything. This is a position of paralysis. You aren't prepping, you aren't hoarding food, or buying guns, or working out at the neckbeard school of ninja kung fu masters getting ready for the day you will take on the Man and really kick some ass. No, you are resigned to go with what you got on your back, because there is surely no time to do anything else.

       With all due respect, but with many nations and over 7 billion people, something big will always be on the horizon.  Wars, plagues, catastrophes, they are always going to happen and have throughout history.

       I think it comes from a feeling of "surely things won't be allowed to continue this way forever." People who see how incredibly upside down everything is find it an affront to their sanity to accept that everything will just continue this way indefinitely in my opinion. It seems unrest is on the rise around the world, and people are waking up to "reality." For me it's a hopeful feeling. But then again, I've been waiting for something to happen for a long time. Lol. I do get the feeling that what happens in the next decade or so will decide the future of humanity in a way. Will we fight for better or do we lie down and succumb to the "globalists" or "tptb" or whatever label someone chooses to give "them."

       Whether or not the intelligentsia are checking the oil is irrelevant from a game theory point of view. People using things like Reddit and Facebook to dump their thoughts is exploitable. It would be pretty silly for anyone wanting to know what people are thinking to ignore these sources of data. That's rather the genius of this internet era, not vastly different from the confessionals of a church, really, except
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       secure. It's free information. One should assume it can and will be used/viewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, it would not be difficult to experimentally verify how much data can be mined from, say, a subreddit by creating a post of the nature, "what do you guys think about X?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Truly people need to trust less when it comes to technology. And they certainly need to start appreciating what their personal information is worth. A company doesn't initiate something like online surveys with discounts as compensation if the data is worthless, and a company isn't going to want the data if they have to take a loss in the long run. This is often the trade for software and websites that don't cost a user anything. The software is free, but the data you generate for them can make them money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I agree generally with your observations on waiting. Many people are waiting for some kind of cue to go off, rather than trying to be part of the cue itself, and in the meantime accomplish little more than wasting energy. There is no end to fake news sites spouting the glorious awakening and coming collapse of the cabal. While I tend to hope for the best when presented with these claims, one best not bank on any of them.

       That is exactly what I think they do. They have standard metrics for evaluating us and this is the control. Along those lines.

       Indeed, this tactic is mentioned in the

        Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION'
       </p>
       <p>
        Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.

Some actually make a choice because they aren't content with current facilities back yonder. They will camp at the crossroads and watch which way the toilet paper is flowing or the farts are blowing and go from there. Others are less discerning. They have to go somewhere NOW.

       I've had real life friends and family express similar uneasy feelings about how "something big is coming," so I believe at least some of those posts are genuine. No doubt the demoralization shills are taking advantage of this collective unease to push their own agendas, though.
