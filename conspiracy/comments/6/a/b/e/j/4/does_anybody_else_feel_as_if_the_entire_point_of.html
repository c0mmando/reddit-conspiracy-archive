        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This has to be by design. Obviously, paper money and that entire concept is used as a wedge of control against humanity, and that&#39;s the basis upon its foundation. </p>

<p>However, the ONE facet of this bland and boring artificial habitat we live in, that I can&#39;t seem to come to terms with, is the fact that eventually we all have to get a &quot;job&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, I feel as if it&#39;s ok to feel disenfranchised with the notion of being forced to do meaningless labor just to survive. Some people will say,</p>

<p>&quot;Oh you&#39;re just a lazy piece of garbage who doesn&#39;t want to contribute to society aren&#39;t you!&quot;</p>

<p>No, I just don&#39;t want to be another cog in this global financial scheme. The economy that is the global standard is rigged in its entirety, to benefit the ruling class. We are essentially slaves kept on an endless treadmill, trading large chunks of our time, for meaningless tasks, just so we can afford basic necessities to survive. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the worst way to live and I&#39;m fucking sick of it. I suspect many of you are as well. We are highly motivated people with a desire to better the world and create a fair society for all. This current way of life is not &quot;fair&quot; at all. And that burns my ass. </p>

<p>I dream of a society where people are treated fairly, everyone is free to do whatever they please, so long as they do not infringe on the liberties of others. We look out for each other, we can use substances we want to, and we can use 100% clean sustainable energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I understand why. There are work around for rent but I&#39;m honestly too lazy to do it.</p>

<p>And I would like to add something to my previous post. Many of fellow posters here seem to think you&#39;re either born to be a boss or you&#39;re destined to be a poor ass peasant for the rest of your life. This is true but mostly false. You can get shortcut to the stars if you get lucky but you can also work your ass off to get there.</p>

<p>I know personally some wealthy bosses but these individuals was not born this way. All of them have started from the bottom. What makes them different from the others is that they kept looking for alternative routes while doing their shitjobs. These bosses didn&#39;t come to me telling how the system works. I found my way to them. And once I got there I wasn&#39;t an asshole demanding them to offer me their tips.</p>

<p>And yes, I&#39;m a poor peasant myself but I&#39;m not the kind that asks questions such as &quot;why he gets all the good stuff and I don&#39;t?&quot; &quot;why do I have to do this shitty ass job?&quot;. Just do the job while you keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>Nail on the head. </p>

<p>We just move problems around that we have created in the first place, the problem is that we have been dealing so much with problems with temporary long term fixes, problems that will create more problems created by the initial fix. Here is an example. </p>

<p>Imagine a big empty lot, a space. Some people park their cars there. Some days outsiders come to park their cars there too. That creates a problem for the people that we there first parking their cars, because now they start running out of space. So now they have two options: </p>

<p>a- talk to the new comers and find a solution </p>

<p>b- hire a henchman ( parking guard ) to scare (give tickets to) outsiders parking there. </p>

<p>The problem is that most people will pick solution B and that is the park guard. In reality, he makes no difference.  Only spreads fear for furture people that want to park there. The people that have already parked there just get a ticket, ( that goes to paying the guard salary) ... The cars taking the space are still taking it, except now they are tagged with a ticket.</p>

<p>The problem really becomes problematic when outsiders stop parking there. But the park guard still needs to give out tickets to cover his expenses.... Well ... now you can&#39;t even fire the guard coz then you are the bad person leaving people without jobs... so you end up dummyfiyng the guard untill he barley does and work, but he still pays his salary. He is useless in the system... But feels ... u know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is nothing factually wrong with my statement.</p>

<p>was on phone so didn&#39;t expand but i understand that part of the reason for this growing supply is debasing of currency, constant inflation etc.</p>

<p>i am not saying i approve of it. in my ideal world wed have closed borders (hence low growth on house prices) and some sort of asset backed currency (hence cant print money ad infinum).</p>

<p>what im simply saying is that unless there is a complete world wide overhaul of the system, what do u want?</p>

<p>it works at every level you can imagine. loads of local drug dealers? youll get higher quantities / lower price (until competition gets killed). hardly anyone? smaller amounts / higher price.</p>

<p>multiple countries already attempted the centralized planning attempt and it failed miserably.</p>

<p>closing borders, non fiat currency, stopping wasting money on international aid / climate change etc would go a long way to solving the &quot;quality of life&quot; issues for common people.</p>

<p>my opposition to the house of cards economy we have isn&#39;t inconsistent with theories of supply and demand. if it didnt act as a signaling mechanism how else would people know what endevours to invest money in (and im not talking just about Private equity funds etc. talking about mom &amp; dad taking 10-20k loan for local business etc). </p>

<p>not all economists / finance people believe in open borders, &quot;free movement of labour / resources (ala EU) and constant money printing &amp; debt so dont label us as such because chances are most of us are much better versed in the field and at the end of the day youll need someone with some sort of educational background arguing on your side to give you credibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>humans are both the creators of demand and are a supply of &quot;energy&quot;. the more humans there are (population growing) the more is required for their society not to collapse, but at same time also creating the combined resources of said society to accomplish these requirements. </p>

<p>but it is along this way that we get back to the more market / economic &quot;supply and demand&quot; i was talking about.</p>

<p>say there is a problem. a demand for a solution. lets use the same water mill. there might be multiple people who design, create, build them...but in the end a competitive advantage will arise and one predominant type of windmill will from then on be supplied to meet the demand from a capital investment point of view. </p>

<p>because remember, why invest 1000 gold coins in a mill which might bring 20 gold coins in revenue when you can invest in another one which brings 30. or even better why not a mine which brings in 150 and which brings about new possibilities for the advancement of society (e.g. coal powered machinery etc) which allows for the creation of more supply of capability and at same time more demand for various requirements because during all this, society is constantly expanding due to the supply of various new amenities, services and products to them.</p>

<p>getting back to my original point - this same S&amp;D model can still be used in our current society BUT using my previously  mentioned points (apologies might be in diff thread on similar topic) of:</p>

<p>1) close borders
2) resettle refugees/asylum seekers etc
3) stop foreign aid/climate change carbon tax shit, all this other various global BS
4) stop welfare states</p>

<p>you might at this point say &quot;ah but then low population growth breaks model&quot; if no immigration and now welfare to help grow the lowest class.</p>

<p>it is at this point why i am simply stumped at why the solution isnt obvious. BRING BACK THE EMPHASIS ON CHILD BIRTH IN EUROPE/USA.</p>

<p>i simply cant understand why in our current society, with mass unemployment, women cant take the opportunity to go on maternity leave multiple times with replacements available for solid 6month gigs (builds resumes). the state - now saving many billions in money from foreign aid / global tax - regulation BS can now use it to support these programs. AT SAME TIME it can use that money to fund the development of robotics etc to help alleviate the problem and help drive efficiencies in the economy...this will create opportunities to retrain/educate other members in society if they wish (e.g. 50-60 year olds or ppl wishing career change help) with more funding to help lower access costs to this.</p>

<p>people might say this could lead to eventual mass job loss or inability to support future pensioners etc but imo infact it could create e.g. a society of researchers, scientists, doctors, phds whilst we have robots etc do a lot of things (but at same time obvs humans in finance, marketing, legal etc)...all of this would seem to me like a solid economy. people having more income etc (due to lower unemployment creating more opportunities to create demand and supply) again alleviates the whole issue at hand. </p>

<p>country could then focus eg on space exploration, medical developments etc. eventually a solid enough asset economy owned by government (e.g. space exploration commercialization) and a solid military to protect it  could move away from fiat currency if it wanted to. use the assets of the economy and its ability to produce as the basis of the value to the before worthless paper. </p>

<p>we dont have to blow up the system to fix it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think humans are vital in the finance sector at all? Computers do all the work for you. </p>

<p>I agree the system doesn&#39;t need to be blown up to fix it. But the human nature element is too strong. Power and greed will always corrupt anything. Something totally different has to happen. Capitalism leads to corruption because humans are not mature enough spiritually(?) to be self less enough to sacrifice advantage to help another human.</p>

<p>If everyone had their own farms and food was abundant we wouldn&#39;t have to even work because most people work to stay alive. Just having to tend to your food supply and trade your chosen crop. To expand life further than that has already been monopolized by &quot;corporations&quot;. You can&#39;t go out and mine your own ore and make your own metal because, well someone else says they own that land and all within it, and they aren&#39;t sharing. Greed and power is part of human nature and will never go away in this life time.</p>

<p>Travel, entertainment, and things of that nature are luxuries to 90% of America. I think you don&#39;t realize this in our current system. There will always be the human element of greed, and those who lord power over others. In a society where everyone has their own farm. One could go about destroying others food supplies secretly to be able to sell their food for insane prices/barter of service.</p>

<p>Another system will not emerge without humans shedding their pre-conceived notions of worth and ego. So for now we have worked out a decent system that is still corruption filled, but better than anarchy. I applaud your answers as they would help alleviate the problems from working within the money system we have. I wish humans were easier to make listen and apply logical solutions though. Free will is such a little shitter eh? That is why some will fight for destroying the debt slavery ego stroking system we have, but in reality an agreed upon &quot;currency&quot; helps promote peace and fairness at the same time. The duality of human nature is like that for a reason I believe. As you cannot appreciate the good without the bad.</p>

Good behavior means you can own a house and have the good things in life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of my job is to study and draw conclusions from historical societies and cultures. One of the things that has struck me most is how, in most indigenous groups, you were entitled to a house as soon as you were married. People threw a party, built a house, and then the newlyweds were responsible for expanding it as they could. How many of us would break down in tears if we were given a little house, no strings attached, for our honeymoon? </p>

<p>You expect heat, air conditioning, television, indoor plumbing, a certain standard of safety etc...</p>

<p>Their house costs a little time. Your house costs 10&#39;s or 100&#39;s of thousands of dollars</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not wrong on that front, but to be fair, the relative cost of materials and labor inflated to the &quot;cost&quot; of the labor and materials today, is probably about the same. And even modern houses can be built properly in a very short amount of time. Look at any of those &quot;Look how great we are we built a new home for these poor people&quot; shows. </p>

<p>Most smaller, starter homes, in the 75-200k range take 3-4 months to build with crews working 50-60 hours per week.</p>

You can&#39;t use any substance you want and still be able to look out for someone else. Then, you can do absolutely anything you want. But anything you do has consequences. And our societies have in many cases decided what consequences might follow many of your actions. Yet, you decide. Want to do something. Do it. You know what can happen afterwards.

    <div class="md"><p>100% agree. This system is designed to keep us passive and obedient. You can always find a way out, but you may have to change your life completely, and give up the comfort and entertainment bullshit you&#39;ve been used to.</p>

<p>I woke up a handful of years ago when the first Zeitgeist movie got out. I quit my job, went around the world to visit The Venus Project and Jaques Fresco in FL. That is like your dream society I think :) Since then I&#39;ve seen money as the primary obstacle for our society to evolve, and I try to do the best I can, not to support that system.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don&#39;t pay taxes - In Denmark you can earn the first ~$10.000 before you need to pay tax. If you earn more, you can fake your address and tell them you need to get compensated for a long drive when you go to work. Fix this so the drive/compensation matches the taxes. Keep your values hidden from the government(s), either by cash, gold, bitcoins etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t spend money that ends in the hands of big business. Buy your food at farmers markets. Buy used stuff from other people when you need something. (I fucking need solar power now because our minister of finance sold part of the danish electrical grid to Goldman Suchs a few years back)</p></li>
<li><p>Give stuff away for free. This is the Ubuntu way, and they call it Contributionism. This is the best approach to fight capitalism, I have been presented to.</p></li>
<li><p>Use healthy food, not big pharma poison, to treat your health.</p></li>
<li><p>Be happy. Otherwise you will never influence others. The best way to teach has always been by example.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m down to working one weekend each month. But that also means I can&#39;t spend money on clothes and food. My girlfriend takes food from the supermarket containers everyday, and the refrigerator is stuffed with organic greens. We have to spend a lot of time cooking and preserving this in jars and stuff, but it&#39;s a quite nice activity. Free food taste so fucking good :P</p>

<p>&quot;In order to achieve such conformity, the lower-class family unit must be disintegrated by <strong>a process of increasing preoccupation of the parents</strong> and the establishment of government-operated day-care centers for the occupationally orphaned children.&quot;   </p>

<p>&quot;The quality of education given to the lower class must be of the poorest sort, so that the moat of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the superior class is and remains incomprehensible to the inferior class. With such an initial handicap, even bright lower class individuals have little if any hope of extricating themselves from their assigned lot in life. <strong>This form of slavery is essential to maintain some measure of social order, peace, and tranquillity for the ruling upper class</strong>.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Work: <strong>Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think; back on the farm with the other animals</strong>.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;It is only a matter of time before the new breed of private programmer/economists will catch on to the far reaching implications of the work begun at Harvard in 1948. The speed with which they can communicate their warning to the public will largely depend upon how effective we have been at controlling the media, subverting education, and keeping the public distracted with matters of no real importance.&quot;  </p>

<p>They are all the same. Distracted by something. Poor people it is money, average people it is media, and rich people it is getting the people to do as they want. </p>

<p>This is the way the world is. It can&#39;t be perfect because in order for some people to prosper others have to suffer. People have to die and some have to live. There is nothing you can do either. </p>

<p>You can try to impose what ways you think will work for someone you feel is going to do better, but usually it won&#39;t work. You know why? Because their way was just fine and it worked for so long. Why change it? </p>

<p>As far as sustainable energy......lol it will never be allowed to happen for us in this lifetime. Maybe our children&#39;s children, but not for us. The powers that be have made that very clear. They have made the world dependant on electricity to a point where if we lost it then we would be fucked. </p>

<p>Money is a construct of evil, and I was having the same discussion on VOAT last night with someone about it. They were trying to give me an example of how gold should be currency. </p>

<p>I disagreed with them, and it is because I can&#39;t use gold for my needs. I don&#39;t care what they think its value is. I said that it is funny they suggested tangible goods when labor never entered their mind as value. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t get it because our world is based on trinkets and the acquiring of more fucking trinkets. They asked if I had a bank account as well. I said I do not because I refuse to give anyone leverage over me for something that is mine and charge me for the ability to use it. </p>

<p>I keep a prepaid cc for bills and shit online. If I can&#39;t save up for something I don&#39;t get it. Everything I have is fucking mine. I own that shit. May not be the best shit, but I don&#39;t owe anyone for it. I like it that way. </p>

<p>You need to worry about those closest to you OP. Save them and forget the rest of the world. It isn&#39;t gonna happen with you saving them. </p>

<p>You can either live or die in this world choose what you will die for. </p>

<p>We have the power but we will never be on the same page to make this happen unfortunately.</p>

<p>The thing is you&#39;re relegating all socialism as being identical to Stalinism-Leninism-Maoism whereby a single party administers the planning for the entire economy via a centralized bureaucracy, but that ignores that there&#39;s a whole spectrum of socialist thought on how it should best be implemented. Just because Russia and China went one way with it doesn&#39;t mean that that&#39;s the only way and it must be followed, or that Americans couldn&#39;t ever possibly do better. People were criticizing the Russian System literally in the &#39;30s predicting that it would pretty much work as it did, these people just weren&#39;t listened to.</p>

<p>Just about every single example in South America has been crushed by US involvement, though. Guatemala, Nicaragua, Chile, etc. I&#39;d be incredibly surprised to the point of disbelief if the CIA weren&#39;t actively involved in Venezuela as well, since it&#39;d be literally the only time in history such a country would have gone unmolested, <em>and</em> they have oil. It&#39;s not logical to think that socialism itself is predisposed to failure when almost every example of failure is the result of the CIA pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into black propaganda and the funding of armed groups and actual terrorists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when money and power</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a capitalist society money and power are concentrated in the hands of a few elites. In centralized state socialist societies... money and power are concentrated in the hands of a few elites. Seems to me like we need worker ownership of capital and a constitution with checks and balances both to prevent accumulation of power by one gain, group, or official as well as to prevent the reappearance of capitalism. Otherwise the working class can only have, at best, the illusion of freedom and political influence. </p>

<p>P.s. since you mention democracy, socialism and democracy aren&#39;t ideologically opposed. Most socialists want democracy, not everyone wants an authoritarian vanguard party to leverage control via the state. </p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s kind of hard when any <em>potentially successful</em> attempts have hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars thrown at subverting them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like you&#39;re telling me &quot;Rocketry looks good on paper, but come at me with a solid example of it getting anywhere&quot; if all of Wernher von Braun&#39;s prototypes got trashed by his competitor&#39;s goons. If all his prototypes got broken by external causes, are you going to think &quot;they just don&#39;t work&quot;? That&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>There <em>are</em> small scale examples of great success, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinaleda">Marinaleda, Spain</a>. By &quot;great success&quot; I mean essentially untouched by the &#39;08 crisis, with both employment levels <strong><em>and pay</em></strong> significantly higher than the neighboring average. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but it doesn&#39;t work when you scale it up!&quot; is what I&#39;ll imagine you&#39;ll say, but again, return to my first point... How are larger scale models to function while fighting the CIA? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea that&#39;s fine but that&#39;s not a good enough, or sound enough argument to get anyone to buy into this as a legitimate potential choice. When it clearly doesn&#39;t work, regardless of billions of dollars subverting them.</p>

<p>The privilege I had of growing up in a poor small town farm community in a trailer where the majority of my class didn&#39;t graduate?</p>

<p>The privilege of losing my dad to alcoholism before I was a teenager?</p>

<p>The privilege of having a mother that couldn&#39;t afford anything but the absolute basics for me and my brothers?</p>

<p>The privilege of working as a farm hand in the summer since I was 12 to afford to go to college?</p>

<p>The privilege of studying my ass off to get a degree while working as a T.A.?</p>

<p>Fuck off with that.</p>

<p>With no to little money people are &#39;controlled&#39; in a way where there is very little to do other than to die a slow and painful death.</p>

<p>OP is correct in his way of thinking. We are all being distracted from the overall bigger picture, while we are silently obeying, being cogs in the wheel of society, the ones with the most money, are generally the ones that we should fear the most (yet we give them most, if not all, of the very pay checks that we work so long and hard to get.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His point is that not all jobs give benefits(which doesn&#39;t seem relevant seeing as you didn&#39;t mention them). But his other point is that a vast majority of jobs aren&#39;t on a set schedule. Most people go by a weekly/bi-weekly schedule, have to work on weekends, aren&#39;t going to have consecutive off days, or even set times for work. I&#39;ve lived that life, it sucks. You end up with 6 days on, 1 day off, and 3 more days before your next off day(obviously it differs based around your schedule). When you do finally get that off day it still feels like work because you have to catch up with all the other bull shit you couldn&#39;t handle on the days you worked.</p>

For exemple: 2 times 7 am to 3pm, 2 times 3pm to 11pm and 2 times 11pm to 7am making cycles of 6 days for a total of 5 teams so the factory can run 24/7. </p>

<p>6 would make the cycles too long, 12 too short. And to answer your first question, a lot of people in germany work 10 hours a day since its the standard. I guess it just depends on the country and job you have. I actually know a lot of entrepreneurs who easily work 80 hours a week. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean.. If you want to be specific about it, a human&#39;s job was basic survival for most our history, it meant hunting food, attending to crop/livestock, etc etc etc.. That isnt necessarily something you can just turn off and for a lot of our ancestors probably meant longer than 14 hour work days.  The whole point of industrialization and the reason why we have advanced so quickly is now we have time to think and improve things because so many of our basic needs are handled.</p>

<p>By extension... would the time I spend at home paying my bills, washing my clothes/body/house, prepping food, etc, also be considered work?  In that case, are we working less than 14 hours now?</p>

<p>Aside from quibbling over defining work and hours spent... a better way to look at is time spent socializing.  We used to spend far more time socializing with tribe/family than we do now.  We used to be far more &quot;human.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points, i think this is what the thread is getting to at the core of it. A lot of it does come down to income equality, and time spent away from home/those you care about/your community.  A lot of families now have both parents working, both parents in a jam to do everything they need to do for their kids between 5-10pm just to get up and repeat this everyday. Its hard for these people to care about anything outside of their own bubble and providing for their family.  My statement was just a blanket you cant blame industrialization when in reality it has/and should continue to make our life easier.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds good in theory. Have you meditated much on this?</p>

<p>How often do people actually put in 8 hours of work every day? I think 4 hours of consistent work is much more realistic, and business hours don&#39;t suffer because you just make more shifts. This creates more jobs as well.</p>

<p>However people would be getting paid half of what they usually make, would that be sustainable for most people? </p>

<p>Might we argue that the increased productivity (gained from cutting the slack hours out of the 8 hour shift and instead having multiple 4 hour shifts) would raise the supply of every industry so much that we can afford to lower the prices to a point where a 4 hour shift is livable?</p>

<p>I assume since you&#39;re only working 4 hours most people would be more comfortable working odd hours, so businesses might be able to stay open 24/7, so that&#39;s a 300% increase in productivity in itself, so perhaps it&#39;s attainable.</p>

<p>How fast will we consume our natural resources though? I think this is where it becomes unsustainable. With the increased consuming and producing we also diminish our resources proportionately. I think we would use everything up faster than it could be replenished.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really showed me man. To debate my point on work ethic and essentially economics your rebuttal was to pick at a pretty minute grammar error I made on a internet website and then challenge me on how many languages I spoke. I speak 2 languages. That&#39;s by choice by the way. I don&#39;t speak 3 languages like you probably do out of necessity because the lesser than culture you come from doesn&#39;t have everything needed to self sustain within it. Also I have a feeling your English is not as good as you think it is. People in the US will pretend to understand what you said because a lot are polite but often they&#39;re not. Probably toneless, robotic, flavorless. Have you ever made a western English speaker laugh?</p>

Sorry but not everyone is a hard worker, not everyone has a important, distinctive experience, and certainly not everyone is owed something.

    <div class="md"><p>Most people work because of debts. Mortgages, educational debts, cars, household appliances etc.
We are taught that we must have a certain style/ way of life if we want to be &#39;normal&#39;. Everyone abnormal [see below] is called a crazy or a tinfoil hat or other derogatives.</p>

<p>In theory you should be able to be self sufficient [not normal]. Especially if you own land. But even here you are restricted by laws not to do that.</p>

<p>There really is no choice. As humans we actually don&#39;t NEED to work at all.
The only people that live like we are intended to by nature are some Amazonian tribes.
Basically bouts of hunting/preparing food are interspersed with days of doing nothing.</p>

<p>We are all slaves. We seem shocked at the working conditions at the turn of last century, yet we haven&#39;t got it any better. We may not have to share a bed with three others and get paid a little more and some health &amp; safety at work has improved, yet we still die of Heart attacks caused by work related stress.
We still work far too long, we still have restrictions [toilet breaks] in some jobs that were probably less strict in the past. We are still slaves to the employer as we are dependent on their generosity. 
We need to work even if we don&#39;t feel capable that day or if we would really rather do something with the family. For a certain amount of time every day, your body doesn&#39;t belong to you at all. It belongs to your boss.</p>

<p>Adverts and movies show us what we are &#39;supposed&#39; to be like but basically there is no wrong lifestyle if it hurts nobody else. 
We should be allowed to be all different. We should be allowed to build our own homes on our land and live there, even if the building isn&#39;t regulated.
I agree we don&#39;t want shanty towns to develop but here in Britain you are not even allowed to live in a mobile home on your own land.</p>

<p>It is all designed to keep us on &#39;the path&#39;. The path on which we are all predictable and on which it is easy to manipulate large amounts of people simultaneously and easily.</p>

<p>Thing is, we live in a full-enclosure Capitalist world now, so all land is owned already. You&#39;re born into the world with nothing, and so you have <em>no choice</em> but to sell your labor at a discounted rate to the owners of the factory, so you can get a tiny amount of the product of your labor back, and then hand it to the owner of your apartment complex. </p>

<p>It&#39;s remarkably like chattel slavery except:</p>

<p>1) The guy with the whip and the guy who owns the shed you live in and the guy who feeds you gruel are all separate guys instead of one guy</p>

<p>2) You&#39;re enslaved not to a single master but to a class of masters, with a small amount of choice as to who exactly gets to crack the whip over you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ultimate tool for corporations to sustain a culture of this sort is to develop the 40-hour workweek as the normal lifestyle. Under these working conditions people have to build a life in the evenings and on weekends. This arrangement makes us naturally more inclined to spend heavily on entertainment and conveniences because our free time is so scarce.</p>

<p>But the 8-hour workday is too profitable for big business, not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours (the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours) but because it makes for such a purchase-happy public. Keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience, gratification, and any other relief they can buy. It keeps them watching television, and its commercials. It keeps them unambitious outside of work.</p>

<p>All of America’s well-publicized problems, including obesity, depression, pollution and corruption are what it costs to create and sustain a trillion-dollar economy. For the economy to be “healthy”, America has to remain unhealthy. Healthy, happy people don’t feel like they need much they don’t already have, and that means they don’t buy a lot of junk, don’t need to be entertained as much, and they don’t end up watching a lot of commercials.</p>

<p>The culture of the eight-hour workday is big business’ most powerful tool for keeping people in this same dissatisfied state where the answer to every problem is to buy something.</p>

<p>The entire system feels wrong, I did not feel like I was contributing anything to society. I felt like I only have the 1 life, why waste this working away doing shit I don&#39;t even like to do.</p>

<p>I went on holidays for a few months, when I got back I sat at my desk and said to myself &#39;I can&#39;t do this anymore&#39;. Looked into going to uni to get a degree in a science, made a plan and fucked right off out of there.</p>

<p>Doing some prerequisite subjects so I can get into a bachelor of science, wishing to major in either geology or astrophysics, I cannot make up my mind. I want to learn about the geology of other planets.</p>

<p>Fuck working my life away doing a job I dislike to make people more money. I won&#39;t do it. I now have so much disdain for the business world. I see people dressed up in the suites rushing off to their job in hopes of impressing some other business guy to climb the corporate ladder, fuck that life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both capitalism and communism are not practical in application. That&#39;s the true fallacy, both systems are systems of control played against each other. </p>

<p>The ideal solution is a hybrid system that values freedom, and liberty above all that still facilitates fair trade for the actual value of goods and services (not this fiat numbers on a computer screen money bullshit we have today with no real value). Look into anrcho-capitalism.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a collective systems of democratic contribution would likely be more than enough to facilitate things like education, public roads, public health care (although a free market system should still be in place and health insurance companies should likely be eliminated or heavily reimagined).</p>

<p>Local communities should be incentivized to work together and provide for themselves instead of relying on state or federal systems.</p>

<p>We also have the technology now to enable crowd funding for social good, and to enable people to vote easily from electronic devices using blockchain. We have the tools to build a real democracy if we truly wanted to but that&#39;s not in the interest of the global elite. They want us reliant on globalism, disconnected from our local communities, and fighting over scraps to keep us stressed and controllable. </p>

I took paperwork out of a box with a printer and took the plastic brand cover off of the printer and replaced it with a different brand one.<br/>
Then put in new papers ( of that brand ).<br/>
We then stacked them in a container to be shipped off.<br/>
Now this is not strange but wat was strange was that my friend did the same work ( on the other side of town )<br/>
But he removed the brand i added on and replaced it whit the brand i took off.<br/>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Does anybody else feel as if the ENTIRE point of having is work these pointless 9-5 jobs, is to keep us busy and occupied, so we don&#39;t keep up with current events?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I&#39;ve been working full time (voluntarily) since I was 16. I am more informed than most because I choose to be. People are lazy and don&#39;t want to know the truth, that&#39;s why they are not informed. Jobs aren&#39;t pointless either. You can choose to work or not and your lifestyle will reflect whichever choice you have made. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most adults have no idea what&#39;s going on in America, they just get the &quot;jist&quot; of things. This is beneficial to TPTB.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is true, but it&#39;s ignorance by choice not because TPTB made someone go to work. I&#39;ve met informed people that do nothing all day and informed people that work their asses off. How informed you are is a choice like any other. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This has to be by design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, paper money and that entire concept is used as a wedge of control against humanity, and that&#39;s the basis upon its foundation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First part is true, second part is gibberish. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, the ONE facet of this bland and boring artificial habitat we live in, that I can&#39;t seem to come to terms with, is the fact that eventually we all have to get a &quot;job&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s only as bland and boring as you are. My life is neither bland or boring. The fact that you can&#39;t come to terms with the fact that people will not give you stuff without you giving something in return is a problem entirely your own. You do not have to get a job. There are lots of people that decide not to work, but they also don&#39;t have very much stuff or a very high living standard. They also do not have to exchange their time, energy or labor for stuff. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I feel as if it&#39;s ok to feel disenfranchised with the notion of being forced to do meaningless labor just to survive. Some people will say,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The amount of meaning you have in your life is determined by you, not someone else. You can survive without having a job. Many beggars make more than that lots of people. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oh you&#39;re just a lazy piece of garbage who doesn&#39;t want to contribute to society aren&#39;t you!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won&#39;t say that. What you choose to do or not do is entirely up to you. The degree to which you contribute to society is up to you and there should be no shame in your choice either way. There is not anything inherently wrong with being lazy. If you value your time, energy and labor so highly that you will not trade it for stuff, then who am I to make judgement about what you personally value?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, I just don&#39;t want to be another cog in this global financial scheme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good, me either. Unfortunatley, unless you are transacting in something other than government currency, you have no say in the matter. If you are transacting in government currency, you are a passive cog in the wheel weather you want to be or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The economy that is the global standard is rigged in its entirety, to benefit the ruling class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is the way it&#39;s always been. I don&#39;t like it, but it&#39;s not going to change either. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are essentially slaves kept on an endless treadmill, trading large chunks of our time, for meaningless tasks, just so we can afford basic necessities to survive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you can survive without doing that. Many have and do. You only have a few options: 1) do nothing and receive nothing in return, 2) do something and receive things in exchange for what you did, 3) get handouts from the labor of others. Option 3 is not available to most people. Option one is not viable for most, because they want stuff - they don&#39;t want to beggars or live off others. Which means most people do option two. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s the worst way to live and I&#39;m fucking sick of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speak for yourself. I have a great life as do many others. Is it perfect? No. Is the world fucked up and are people actively trying to screw you over? Of course. It&#39;s less than ideal, but it&#39;s a function of being human. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are highly motivated people with a desire to better the world and create a fair society for all. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That will never happen. What you describe is utopia and it doesn&#39;t exist. Wherever you find humans, you will find human problems. Some are more capable than others and will produce more than others. The necessitates society either be unfair in what it takes from the producers and gives to the consumers, or is unfair to the consumers who cannot produce, by giving them nothing. Most of us are capable of <em>something</em>, so we choose to produce, so that we may consume (option 2 from above). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This current way of life is not &quot;fair&quot; at all. And that burns my ass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then do something about it. What I describe above is the current model. It&#39;s the only model humans know because it&#39;s the only model that has ever allowed us to create any kind of advanced civilizations. I do not think (at present) there is another model we can follow that will produce better results for the most people. If you have a better model, go change the world with it. I hope you do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I dream of a society where people are treated fairly, everyone is free to do whatever they please, so long as they do not infringe on the liberties of others</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are free to do whatever you please. The problem you will run into, is that doing &quot;things&quot; requires time, energy, labor and money. If you have none of those things, it&#39;s difficult to do &quot;things&quot;. Whenever I talk to people that say things like you are saying the next sentence is usually about how the government should be taking things from those that have stuff, and give it to you, so that you can do &quot;things&quot;. What you do not understand, is that the vast majority of people that have &quot;stuff&quot; did not simply have it handed to them. They did option 2 above and went out there and got the stuff they wanted, so they could do the things they wanted. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We look out for each other, we can use substances we want to, and we can use 100% clean sustainable energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pure fantasy. That isn&#39;t how people work and it never has been. You are fantasizing that the evolutionary process that made people who they are today should have been different. However, I do agree that people should be able to eat, drink, smoke or inject anything into their bodies that they so desire - from raw mil, to heroin. As far as the energy thing goes, I agree, it&#39;d be great if we could have 100% clean sustainable energy, but it&#39;s simply not possible right now (unless you include nuclear in the &quot;clean&quot; category). </p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t think this submission belongs in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> at all as it&#39;s really just one person&#39;s complaint about what they don&#39;t like about life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the system is by design--and yes, there are SERIOUSLY flawed mechanisms of control that lack ethics, morals, and any shred of human decency. Indeed, depravity and degradation is highly evident in the elite circles, but that is purely because most are asleep to their misdeeds and don&#39;t have a desire to question the inner workings of reality. This is the Allegory of the Cave in essence. </p>

<p>At some point, though, it has to be conceded that some common unit of transaction has to be used (or none at all, which, tell me how that works and I&#39;m all ears) to facilitate the flow of goods and services. People only do stuff for free when they enjoy doing it, and, even then, they only do stuff for free when they live on someone else&#39;s dime or in the deep woods of Alaska. </p>

<p>Yes, reality CAN be &quot;bland and boring&quot; (it can also be profound, mysterious, and fascinating!), but we naturally have arrived at this point by virtue of us being at this point. I&#39;ve heard the matrix argument, and I believe that reality is infinite, but until I awaken outside of it--and I&#39;ve fucking tried, mate, save for killing myself (I&#39;ll wait, thanks)--I can&#39;t concede that &#39; &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTwYRqalP0Ul90LHMoqC5mMi1ExYK_1nbtf2O1T6JSUb7arKZDfnRIPk_QI%22%3Eit&#x27;s">https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTwYRqalP0Ul90LHMoqC5mMi1ExYK_1nbtf2O1T6JSUb7arKZDfnRIPk_QI&quot;&gt;it&#39;s</a> all effed&lt;/a&gt;&#39;. </p>

<p>These systems of centralized authority are very natural as well--most animal pack species have leaders and subordinates, for example. THAT BEING SAID, I will definitely argue that we have the capacity and, in fact, the &lt;i&gt;duty&lt;/i&gt; to move beyond those roles to a more dynamic, self-reliant system based on permaculture, sustainability, hard work, innovation, and drive to better ourselves, each other, and, ultimately, the world. That is my preference though, and I&#39;m sure others will argue for centrally planned hell holes...go for it, but leave me the hell alone, please. </p>

<p>There really is no such thing as a free meal, whether you pay for it, someone else does, or you grow plants and harvest/hunt or fish. Life takes work. Ask any cheetah or gazelle. Ask any kid hauling water to his family in the &#39;undeveloped world&#39;. The unfair part is that you don&#39;t get to choose where you are born. The unfair part is that there are definitely shitty people that, undoubtedly, have cultivated their fear response to the point that they can&#39;t see the beauty in the world. They are the Darth Vaders. I feel sorry for them. But I am also glad that there are laws. But then I am disheartened that they are the ones that make them (for the most part). However, &#39;places&#39; like this forum and the red pill factories of each awoken individual is what is going to make the world better. Believe it.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I think we, in America at least, actually have all the things you said in your last paragraph, with the exception of the last two points. </p>

<p>As far as the first 4 (fairness, freedom, non-harm, watching backs), I see that every day. Every. Amazing. Day. ... BUT...I also see a lot of horseshit that is contrary to those things. Every. Damn. Day. Yes, people--as individuals--can suck and do things that are unjust, unfair, etc. to others, but if we step back and realize that most if not all of these shitty things stem from fear, insecurity, and ineptitude, with--of course--plain shitty people who have accepted the dark side. But it is rare that I see this. Ask yourself how many shitty people you meet or interact with every day. I have a positive attitude and treat everyone I meet with respect and dignity, from a homeless person to a rich one, and I&#39;ll tell you that I maybe meet ONE or TWO every few months. Sure, people cut me off occasionally, but sometimes it&#39;s my fault too. The self-fulfilling prophecy is SO STRONG when everyone walks around with a device of divisive rhetoric ready to trigger at any moment.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in your shoes: pissed about how frustrating it is to find meaningful work that adds value towards the movement to excise our excesses and promote sustainable (in every sense of the word) growth...BUT the interest I have in the mystery of life has driven me to develop many talents and skills that eventually, though serendipitously at times, provided me with meaningful work that has further developed my entrepreneurial spirit. I have ideas now that I didn&#39;t have 18 years ago when I first entered the rabbit hole--yes, it&#39;s been around for a long time. </p>

<p>If you really have the desire to do good, play the game--BUT LEARN THE RULES. If you weren&#39;t wanting to learn the rules I would suspect you wouldn&#39;t be on this sub to begin with, so good on ya holmes.</p>

<p>And ++ for doing whatever you want to yourself; I think taxation and (with meth/heroin) the &#39;public good&#39; play heavily into the logic behind illegality. I&#39;m all for individual responsibility, though, and affording the comfort of legality wouldn&#39;t reduce the amount of stupid that decides it&#39;s a great idea to go driving around all geeked out--but that&#39;s where law enforcement steps in and says &quot;hey, moron, you&#39;re endangering peoples lives.&quot; </p>

<p>As far as &quot;100% clean sustainable energy&quot; goes, I think that if you are passionate about it, you should get involved! Do independent research if you have the time and money, watch some free lectures or documentaries online, go to the library, reach out to some people who are involved with projects you are interested in! GO TEAM SUSTAINABLE ENERGY! </p>

<p>I, myself, work in the commercial architecture/design field (no degree, though almost have my associates), and I am CONSTANTLY trying to incorporate sustainability, alternative energy, and green design into my projects, but there is only so much I can propose before the budget outweighs the owners patience. These things take time to develop, both in societal consciousness, and budgetary feasibility, but once you are woke you have an obligation to share the &#39;wokeness&#39;. That, to me, is the essence of being a Jedi.</p>

<p>For the record, sorry for all the Star Wars stuff. It just kind of happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with working 9-5 or what you make. The world is a debt fueled economy. The only way the system works is by keeping everyone debt slaves to prop up global economics.
Fun fact...just in the US the current car loan debt is $1.2 trillion, credit card debt is $1.3 trillion and student loans are $1.4 trillion. I don&#39;t have the numbers on mortgage debt right now.
So just in 3 areas the US population is holding $4 trillion in debt. But with the way the market is designed to work new debt has to be constantly created so the top can still make profits. The Central Banks are pumping $200 billion a month into the market to try to keep the frenzy fueled but it&#39;s not working anymore as the market is flat and starting to retract.</p>

<p>So you can try working 20 hours at double the pay but as long as you keep incurring debt the establishment machine will keep running. But that will never happen because of people&#39;s desire to have a shiny new iPhone every year and buy vehicles that can&#39;t afford.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I do most of my conspiracy reading in my 9-5 job man.</p>

<p>I feel like I have it pretty easily now, as someone who struggled hard let me tell you that go into an office to read and work and get paid is not a bad deal.</p>

<p>The dumbasses are the ones that are wasting their money in material things instead of saving it to start their own business and help their society with that.</p>

<p>Most of the people in my office are paying a car they can&#39;t afford, or waste their entire month money in paying the newest phone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a social pressure they made up by themselves, I respect people around me and they do the same with me, you don&#39;t need these things to have people respect you even if you think so.</p>

<p>This is capitalism, I know it&#39;s one of the most famous movies but check out fight club, talks about the things you are saying.</p>

<p>There&#39;re plenty of places in the world where you can go and they don&#39;t have 9-5 jobs, you just work day by day and get enough to eat and have a place to stay.</p>

<p>Take a trip to one of those places, try to find work as a farmer or something like that, it eases everything up.</p>

<p>I feel our ideologies are so out of whack that unless something big happens or 80% of humans are wiped out, we wouldnt be able to change our thinking to, &quot;Hey, you dont need money... we can automate literally anything a person can do, so that will free up the human mind to do what they WANT and LOVE to do... You go to a store and pick up only what you need, you have a house and a car, etc, your sense of worth and ability to help others is based on you wanting to better your fellow man and do what we were made to do... HELP OTHERS.&quot;</p>

<p>Sadly we&#39;ll never see this in our lifetime.  Granted it would be A LOT easier if we had the ability to gather resources outside of our Planet.  Until then we may never experience true freedom.  </p>

<p>And why is this? Because it has been created this way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s up with all these &quot;I hate my job/life and it&#39;s TPTB&#39;s fault&quot; threads? I would absolutely love for some of you guys to be transported to 400 years ago and let me know how life is without toilet paper or electricity.  Even the poorest dude in the United States working minimum wage at McDonald&#39;s or Walmart can still afford a flat screen TV, a roof over his head and food on the table.  Even more so with a roommate/domestic partner.</p>

<p>If you spent more time helping people less fortunate than you and less time complaining on the Internet you&#39;d have a 100% opposite outlook on life.</p>

<p>Sorry, that sounds harsh, but why are you here? You clearly don&#39;t understand the big picture. Do you even know how the federal reserve system works? You need to catch up to the rest of us my friend...then you&#39;ll be pissed as we are</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know how the system works.  We are playing with toy money.  And when the world decides they are tired of playing the fake money game is over, ruh roh.  But you don&#39;t have to be a slave.  It is in all honesty not that difficult to stay out of debt outside of a mortgage/student loans, and both of those debts are good in the sense they are investments.</p>

<p>There are in fact people who are slaves and will never climb out of their debt/retire, but that is because they are stupid.  I see girls purchasing brand new 30,000 cars when they don&#39;t even make that much in a year, or dudes buying 4K tvs, cell phones, guns, PlayStations, etc. when they have absolutely zero money in the bank.  Or people going to bars and spending 60-100$ on drinks for one night on a weekend.  But that is less to do with TPTB and more about human nature.  People want things now, they want things for free, they don&#39;t want to work, etc.  There is a ton of opportunity in this country to find a job you enjoy and live a comfortable life without going paycheck to paycheck, but it requires being smart and living within your means, which no one wants to do.</p>

<p>Society in itself is what makes the world go around. Not the very thing that causes stress and keeps the many, many dangerous and evil people above us all.</p>

<p>Money is a power construct and I believe that it was created to be as such. People think that we wouldn&#39;t be where we are without money. Again I disagree. The human race doesn&#39;t and didn&#39;t need money to get to where we have got to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So....?</p>

<p>Why does that matter at all? </p>

<p>Did you know most of the world&#39;s wealth is owned by a small percentage of people at the top, who identify as these &quot;millionaires and billionaires&quot;?</p>

<p>Now, before you spin what I just said into &quot;all rich people are evil&quot;, realize that I&#39;m talking about a very small percentage of people who convene and network to establish more power.</p>

<p>You give up 30% of your salary in taxes to the government. Gone. Whoosh. Just like that. It&#39;s like giving up weeks of time every year, and it adds up. You don&#39;t get to keep that shit buddy.</p>

<p>And other than that. Most of the products you but come from these big companies and business interests, that are ALSO in this &quot;club&quot; of elites who convene and network to establish more power.</p>

<p>Your whole life serves this entity I&#39;m describing, and it doesn&#39;t care about you.</p>

<p>Are you truly happy with knowing that? Do you deny its existence? Either way all of the things I just said are true and common knowledge for people in this sub, and what I had to say clearly resonated with this community, because this post is at almost 500 upvotes. It&#39;s a relevant post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So save up and retire early. Go to that subreddit and check it out.</p>

<p>You make it seem like retirees, the disabled, rich kids, and stay at home wives are the happiest and most knowledgeable people, because they have the luxury of time. In reality, most people die soon after they retire because their life has no purpose. My family is from the carribean and I have plenty of relatives back on the island who don&#39;t work and just hang out in the streets all day - mainly the women and older men. They don&#39;t seem happier than me. The human condition is unhappiness. Beautiful millionaire celebrities and rich kids abuse drugs and kill themselves.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t mind paying taxes, especially if I lived in a country like Switzerland, where I&#39;d get a lot for my money. The US is ok but could be a lot better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So. Your dream. A society where people are treated fairly. By whom. The elite? The government? God? Which superior instance is supposed to treat you and me fairly. Next. You can&#39;t use any substance you want and still be able to look out for someone else. Then, you can do absolutely anything you want. But anything you do has consequences. And our societies have in many cases decided what consequences might follow many of your actions. Yet, you decide. Want to do something. Do it. You know what can happen afterwards. And, to finish, it is an incredibly interesting game we humans have developed for us to play. Instead of wanting to change it, first learn to play it. You might surprise yourself enjoying it at some point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting perspective you have. TPTB stand to gain just as much or more from a socialistic/communistic government which <em>seems</em> to be what you are advocating for (unless you are saying there should be no government? That is a debate in itself). No matter what they will simply adapt their strategy to the current environment. However there can be arguments made for keeping the current system. For instance, in the book Brave New World people actually barely work but they are always satisfied, on drugs, and content with everything so they don&#39;t have the desire to revolt. Inevitably, human beings seek pleasure and most will just use their extended free time to do even more mindless activities than they already do, not perform massive amounts of research into conspiracies, higher consciousness, etc, in order to understand the truth. </p>

<p>And as for you saying it&#39;s not &quot;fair&quot; or you don&#39;t want to be another &quot;cog&quot; in the machine, you don&#39;t have to be. That&#39;s the great thing about a free market economy with government regulations in place to ensure equal opportunity (or even more if you look at laws like affirmative action): if you are not satisfied with being a worker/&quot;wage slave&quot;/whatever the hell you may call it, be an independent contractor, start a business, hell go start a self-sufficient homestead and sell products on the side to pay the property taxes. Engage in trade with local farmers and craftsmen (yes they still exist, you just have to know where to look). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I dream of a society where people are treated fairly, everyone is free to do whatever they please, so long as they do not infringe on the liberties of others. We look out for each other, we can use substances we want to, and we can use 100% clean sustainable energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, human nature simply will not result in &quot;people being treated fairly&quot;. There are laws in place to ensure fair opportunity and such, but there will always be hate, greed, resentment, and violence to pull us back. People <em>do</em> use the the substances they want to but it is illegal due to private prison lobbying rather than the structure of government. A constitutional amendment outlawing lobbying, unlimited campaign contribution, etc. could fix a lot of problems in itself. We are also starting to make the transition toward sustainable energy, that is not something generally frowned upon. To put things into perspective though, you must realize that there are entire <em>countries</em> whose economic lifeline is oil &amp; gas and switching quickly from one to another would be catastrophic. Those industries support millions of jobs in the US alone and the transition will need to take place over several decades. That&#39;s just the unfortunate reality.</p>

<p>They are essentially poisoning everyone, keeping people sick intentionally for profit, letting people die painful slow deaths for profit. As a person made sick and then worse by mainstream medicine treatments, my anger is palpable. Knowing people who could have survived but were left to die, my anger is palpable. Knowing so many people who suffer for big pharma to profit, my anger is palpable. </p>

<p>I have no words for the disgust I feel for the countless systems we live with designed to fuck us over. And I know damn well, I want nothing to do with those systems. With what we now know, one would have to be a lunatic to want to participate in this nonsense anyhow. </p>

<p>***i use generalities above with the &quot;modern&quot; health care system we are fucked by. If you want to know one of the biggest, scariest conspiracy crimes currently happening, look into what&#39;s being done by big pharma to our entire health care system and what &quot;treatments&quot; we are allowed to have, vs. what actually works to cure disease. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9-5 working hours are a remnant from the industrial revolution. Factory owners would have their employees work inhumane hours in order to produce as much as possible to make the most profit. The people were disgruntled and were on the edge of a revolt, which resulted in the compromise of working 8 hours, resting 8 hours, and sleeping 8 hours. A lot of people that depended on these jobs this were more than happy to accept.</p>

<p>Problem is we stuck with it and never really adapted to the times, for example we applied these same hours in new industries and new types of jobs. An average office job worker for example is nowhere near 8 hours of productive during the day, our brain just isnt made for that kind of workload, especially 5 times a week, for the majority of our lives. 
Not to mention that times changed. Factory workers could walk home after their jobs. We now have commutes that might easily suck up another 2 hours of our day just trying to get to work/home, which then leads to either less sleep or less time to relax/spend time with friends or family. 
Lets not forget how important regular exercise is, cram getting to the gym/ working out/ getting home/ showering in there, and thats another 1/2 hours gone.</p>

<p>I think we need another rehaul. We are burning out our brains and wasting a large portion of our lives doing stuff that has very little positive impact on society. People generally like working and like feeling productive if they are actually doing something fullfilling and something that benefits society. But the truth is that jobs are becoming less and less fullfilling, and are merely a tool to line the pockets of shareholders.</p>

<p>come at me with some solid examples of it running well for a long period of time.</p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s kind of hard when any <em>potentially successful</em> attempts have hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars thrown at subverting them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like you&#39;re telling me &quot;Rocketry looks good on paper, but come at me with a solid example of it getting anywhere&quot; if all of Wernher von Braun&#39;s prototypes got trashed by his competitor&#39;s goons. If all his prototypes got broken by external causes, are you going to think &quot;they just don&#39;t work&quot;? That&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>There <em>are</em> small scale examples of great success, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinaleda">Marinaleda, Spain</a>. By &quot;great success&quot; I mean essentially untouched by the &#39;08 crisis, with both employment levels <strong><em>and pay</em></strong> significantly higher than the neighboring average. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but it doesn&#39;t work when you scale it up!&quot; is what I&#39;ll imagine you&#39;ll say, but again, return to my first point... How are larger scale models to function while fighting the CIA? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea that&#39;s fine but that&#39;s not a good enough, or sound enough argument to get anyone to buy into this as a legitimate potential choice. When it clearly doesn&#39;t work, regardless of billions of dollars subverting them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not disagreeing with that, but that&#39;s not good enough to proclaim this form of government as the best possible alternative, especially since it fails more often than not, regardless of the CIA or whatever.</p>
