        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">196</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/WeAreTheResistance.html">WeAreTheResistance</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It strikes me as very odd that both the mainstream media and the alternative media hyped the French elections so heavily, while there has been almost no coverage of the historic election in South Korea yesterday which has HUGE implications for North Korea.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/world/asia/south-korea-election-president-moon-jae-in.html?_r=0">ICYMI South Korea elected a human rights lawyer</a> today, who has voiced his preference to deal with North Korea through negotiations and diplomacy, who even went as far and said if he won, he&#39;d demand the United States to remove the THAAD missile defense system completely from South Korea.</p>

<p>President Moon <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/south-koreas-moon-takes-presidency-divided-country-amid-002544372--finance.html">also stated</a> his desire to actually go to North Korea for talks which frankly is an unprecedented capitulation by the South Koreans.  Kim Jun Un is sitting in a very good place right now, as is China and Russia.</p>

<p>The major Korean peninsula news I saw today, was that supposedly <a href="http://www.hannity.com/articles/election-493995/north-korea-confirms-it-is-preparing-15815352/">North Korea is planning</a> to go ahead with their 6th nuclear test soon and will be unafraid.  Despite the fact that their in a much better strategic bargaining position now, then have been for the last 10 years.  </p>

<p>I call bullshit.  I don&#39;t think Kim is suicidal, and wishes to bring about his own demise.  That&#39;s not logical, no matter how the media spins it, and isn&#39;t based in fact.  China and Russia have got to be incredibly happy with the election in South Korea, with the expectance of the United States&#39;s THAAD missile system leaving the peninsula.</p>

<p>Will the United States, and more importantly Donald Trump&#39;s own ego allow for all this saber rattling and troop movements to fall by the wayside without even firing a shot?  It will be very interesting to see how this plays out.  If we see in a few days that Kim went ahead with a nuclear test, it&#39;s almost 100% guaranteed it will be a staged false flag event, which will then be used by the West to attack North Korea, at which point it won&#39;t matter who won the presidency in South Korea today.</p>

<p>They are definitely greasing the skids for WW3 right now, hopefully this historic election in South Korea will deescalate the tensions and resolve the conflict peacefully.   </p>

<p>How do you all see the North Korean narrative playing out?</p>

<p>Exactly my point.  This is an election that had significant implications for both countries, for the world really.  This would seem to be a logical place to point the finger at Russia then France was, nope just crickets.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I do remember when they had almost a million people on the streets protesting, it was almost entirely blacked out on Western media also.  But in the French election, they had Macron out in front of a black pyramid practically praising it, which is literally constructed of 666 pieces of glass, and was actually built and dedicated to Satan himself.  Why would they be so obvious about it in France, but keep it so hush hush in South Korea I wonder?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The protesting was happening during the US presidential campaign and it was directed against a corrupt &quot;first female&quot; president. The media probably did not want the subconscious comparison being made.</p>

<p>Also, it has nothing to do with &quot;satanism&quot; in South Korea. I know there&#39;s a desire to process information through a familiar lens, but there&#39;s something to be said for truth, IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That means nothing though as the majority of the world owns Chinese products yet the majority of people outside china generally don&#39;t care about Chinese products. I know a few people with Xiaomi phones and they don&#39;t give a fuck about Chinese elections.</p>

<p>Hell, even my parents didn&#39;t know Samsung was Korean until a few months ago.</p>

<p>Just because we own a lot of products from them does not mean that they are at all as culturally connected to us as the french are. One of the main reasons we were able to break away from Britain was because of France&#39;s help, they were out first ally, one of the main parts of WW2 was freeing France. What large cultural impact has SK had on us other than the Korean war and Gangnam Style? SK has been becoming more prevalent recently with a lot of immigrants and tourists coming to Canada and the US, but hardly enough for the common person to care about their elections.</p>

<p>On a side note—did anyone else see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBFj0zynil8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">this?</a> Makes me wish US elections were covered that way by the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>North Korea is a puppet state for TPTB.</p>

<p>N.K. is a Trump card, being held by TPTB for use when they deem necessary.</p>

<p>BUT WAIT U/qwertyqyle, THEY DON&#39;T HAVE A CENTRAL BANK!!!!!!</p>

<p>Not true. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_the_Democratic_People%27s_Republic_of_Korea">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_the_Democratic_People%27s_Republic_of_Korea</a></p>

<p>TL;DR The bank was set up in 1946, by the Rothschild&#39;s backed USSR. They fought againt the nationalist N.K. Farmer&#39;s bank, but had a hard time. The Intl. bankers In June 1947, added around 1,000 million wŏn, which was concentrated in the Central Bank, allowing it to extend credits totalling 900 million wŏn for economic rehabilitation. Later the Farmer&#39;s bank was forced to join into the central bank.</p>

<p>NOW... Let look into the man who started N.K. Kim Il-Sung.</p>

<p>At age 17, il sung joinded an underground Marxist group. 3 years later joind the Chinese Communist party (bankrolled by Rothschilds)Here Kim met the man who would become his mentor as a Communist, Wei Zhengmin, Kim&#39;s immediate superior officer, who served at the time as chairman of the Political Committee of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. Wei reported directly to Kang Sheng, a high-ranking party member close to Mao Zedong (Also funded by Rothschilds!) In 1940, after being chased out of Korea by the Japanese, he escaped into Russia, and joined the Rothchilds Red Army throughout all of WW2! The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on 8 August 1945, and the Red Army entered Pyongyang on 24 August 1945. Stalin (Successor of Rothschilds man Lennon) had instructed Lavrentiy Beria to recommend a Communist leader for the Soviet-occupied territories and Beria met Kim several times before recommending him to Stalin. Originally, the Soviets preferred Cho Man-sik to lead a popular front government, but Cho refused to support a UN-backed trusteeship and clashed with Kim. This has Rothchilds written all over it!</p>

<p>His oldest son (you may have heard of him) Kim Jung-il is said to have received schooling at the university of Malta! Fucking Knights of Malta connection!</p>

<p>New Leader Kim Jung Un studied in Switzerland. HQ of the Rothschild&#39;s as they financed the overthrow of the Russian Czar in the early 1900&#39;s, and than all throughout WW2. Why do we think he is a stupid little boy? He was trained, and led to lead this country by TPTB.</p>

<p>If there is a war in NK, it will be the bankers war. And that is not good for anyone of us. Our monetary, physical, and emotional suffering mean nothing to them. If this war does happen, than we know the bankers played their Trump card to push WW3. And if that does happen, We need to stand together to stop the war from succeeding!</p>

Who cares [seriously] about elections in the furthest parts of the world?
If you mean we should be more interested because of all the N-Korean stuff going on, remember that Fat Boy is regularly threatening all sorts and to be brutally honest, it&#39;s been going on for years.
We all hope and trust the S-Koreans to do what needs to be one. Remember they are no 3rd world country, so they should be trusted to react in which ever way they want.
I know that americans think they are the centre of the world and everything to do with them MUST be of utmost importance to everyone, but it&#39;s not really.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why France&#39;s election results are far more important than S-Koreas.</p>

<p>North Korea shares a border with both Russia and China, both of whom are allies against the West.  The United States has for the first time deployed state of the art missile&#39;defense&#39; system in South Korea, in order to neutralize any threat to Sooth Koreas from short range missiles.  </p>

<p>The problem is, Russia and China know that this THAAD system is not solely defensive.  The radar on the system can track hundreds of miles into both country&#39;s, and can just as easily fire nuclear missiles for preemptive attacks, while using THAAD to lower the odds of a massive retaliatory strike from China and Russia.</p>

<p>With as much at stake there, and the fever of politicians always pointing the finger at Russian interference in elections.</p>

<p>France has issues indeed, but the outcome of the South Korean election, will have much more serious global implications.  </p>

<p>If Kim follows through on that nuke test, almost assuredly resulting in his own demise.  Kim is not suicidal and eager to give the West a reason for a preemptive attack on Kim.</p>

Had it not been, it remains the same, it is probably more interesting to an american.
To us in Europe it is really not that relevant what your President and Fat Boy are up to we are more bothered about mass immigration of unsuitable people ruining our Europe at the moment.</p>

<p>in order to neutralize any threat to Sooth[sic] Koreas from short range missiles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope you don&#39;t actually believe that. I&#39;m encouraged by your following paragraphs.</p>

<p>SK, along with Japan, the Philippines (off-and-on) and Australia have been set up as &quot;un-sinkable aircraft carriers&quot; to threaten China. The populations will be called upon to act as missile-sponges <em>by U.S. design</em>.</p>

<p>The U.S. is <em>at least</em> 2/3 responsible for the existence of &quot;North Korea&quot; in the first place, mismanaged its occupation of South Korea, and has treated the whole Korean Peninsula as a bastard stepchild for over 100 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol is this a shitpost? Culturally were much closer to Europe so it makes sense media would cover it much more heavily. Also, considering how hot the topic of refugees, immigrants, and terrorism is right now in the news, and considering that one of the main candidates was someone people closely compared to Trump. it&#39;s only obvious that it would get much more Media attention</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard quite a bit about the election on Reddit and on NPR.  I don&#39;t watch tv news channels, though, but I don&#39;t know why you didn&#39;t hear much about it.  Plus, the media, and everyone for that matter, has been much more focused on LaPen and Macron due to their very unconventional parties and ideologies.  </p>

<p>With regards to NK, they&#39;re not giving their weapons up.  Look at Hussein and Gaddafi, they gave up their nuclear programs, but still were killed or exiled out of power.  So, by Kim giving up his nuke capabilities, he&#39;s not paying attention to history.  He&#39;s keeping them because that is the only thing keeping the US from starting a war right now, for fear that he&#39;ll use them, even if on his own territory.  </p>

<p>I do hope the SK elections bring about some change to their part of the world, but I don&#39;t see NK and Kim toning down their rhetoric, and the US isn&#39;t going to abandon SK or Japan, so there will be a stalemate for now, complete with more bullshitting talk</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Partly it&#39;s because of Park&#39;s bullshit that was going on... but also because of the fact that South Korea elected a left-leaning liberal to lead the country. </p>

<p>It frightens many Western governments because right now, they&#39;re mostly conservative leaning or right-wing. A left-wing government in South Korea means they&#39;re LESS likely to go to war and buy weapons, and MORE likely to engage in diplomacy and try to change things with culture and love and conversation. Weapon manufacturers can&#39;t make money off culture and love and conversation. </p>

<p>So, as the U.S. mainstream media does when things don&#39;t go a certain way, they ignore the South Korea elections, just as they ignored Bernie Sanders.  </p>
