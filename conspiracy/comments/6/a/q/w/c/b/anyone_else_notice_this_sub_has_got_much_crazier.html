    <div class="md"><p>I dunno about the religious stuff, I usually give that a read. Sometimes an upvote. Depends what the content is. I believe occultism among the elite is real, just as spirituality, and that there&#39;s bits and pieces of truth spread out among many religions and philosophies. Spirituality is just the science that mainstream science doesn&#39;t get understand and that &quot;scientism&quot; doesn&#39;t acknowledge. But as always it&#39;s best to use your own intuition to sort the good info from the crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I read lots of political commentary and books by left wingers critical of just about everything that the Democratic party and liberals are about today. They were taking down Hillary Clinton, Obama, shitty infotainment shows like Stewart and Colbert, Zuckerberg and silicon valley, etc years before the &#39;alt-right&#39; was even a thing. </p>

<p>Problem is very few people read articles by what used to be called &#39;public intellectuals&#39; anymore (see a book by Russell Jacoby on this topic). The level of intelligence and writing in 99.99% of what&#39;s on the internet and Reddit is kindergarten level garbage (this sub included). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it.. There is a couple of reasons: </p>

<p>1- Shils and paied groups, find this subreddit an &quot;easy&quot; target.</p>

<p>2- SJW&#39;s that have been &quot;disillusioned&quot; and now they are angry. Same thing when new redpillers go and flame <a href="/r/feminism">/r/feminism</a> or <a href="/r/deadbedrooms">/r/deadbedrooms</a> </p>

<p>3- People that have not been long enough exposed to what happens. Take inn too much too fast and get shillshocked. </p>

<p>Bottom line is: Nothing new is going on. We have done all this shit before. Read up on Mark Twain and late 1800s USA. </p>

<p>The illuminati theorists TI type and the illuminati David Icke TI type have been submitting identical and almost identical posts in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for the past several months.

<p><a href="/u/daryatash">/u/daryatash</a> reposts almost the identical post. It would be wise for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to restrict the number of reposting of the identical or almost identical posts.

<p>The current earth shape argument is a remake of similar discussions from over 120 years ago...</p>

<p>Germ theory revisionism has died down mostly (with the exception of German New Medicine) but it was a big thing back in the late 19th Century.</p>

<p>There was even debate surrounding DNA, also. That debate died down, but has slowly increased since 2012...</p>

<p>The sub hasn&#39;t gotten any crazier. The flat earth posts might be controversial, but they haven&#39;t increased in frequency, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I think we need to acknowledge that 9/11 truth will never go mainstream. 9/11 was 16 years ago, the relatively recent flat earth movement is not responsible for the lack of interest amongst the general public.</p>

Understand there is a difference between discussing a conspiracy and using it as a means (aggressively putting it the forefront as well) to distract people, for political motives, and to gain a control over an area of the web. Maybe some conspiracy theories are being used to harm the general population of this sub, and other forums, but we cannot think inherently these conspiracy theories are &#39;crazy&#39;. I assume most of us believe in some sort of conspiracy theory, and to think another is crazy while we hold on to our own, is not good thinking. Consider everything, debate intelligently, disagree respectably. 
Sometimes, it is easy to see when a theory or idea is being used to control the direction of a discussion or board.<br/>
On this subs sidebar is The Gentleperson&#39;s Guide To Forum Spies, I recommend everyone who hasn&#39;t read it, to do so. </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve really noticed is how often people bring up the folks who talk about the FE where actual FE posters are fairly rare. Compared to a few years ago its barely a blip on the radar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I know it sounds insane, but come to terms with what you literally <em>are</em>, and that shit will seem less and less insane.</p>

<p>When you come to terms with the fact that your <em>entire knowing of your life</em> is just a memory and that what you ultimately are is the silent consciousness in which <em>every</em> thought about &#39;your&#39; life has arisen, it seems more plausible that MK and ET&#39;s might actually exist. When you recognize that what you are is a self-aware manifestation of the universe, as opposed to some individual with &#39;my&#39; life, a lot of intellectual doors can, then, be opened.</p>

<p>A year ago, I&#39;d be on your side of the fence. After glimpses of awakening to consciousness, I&#39;m not on the other! </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Have people just gotten crazier?<br/>
Point:<br/>
People aren&#39;t meant to have this much information.  It not only makes the individual crazy.  It will also drive societies crazy, because central narratives have become impossible, and a society without a central narrative is like an individual with Multiple Personality Disorder.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks internet.    </p>

<p>Counterpoint:<br/>
Maybe another way of looking at it is more positive.  The internet has provided people with massive amounts of information.  For the first time in history people are really the Truth on a mass scale, and the Truth is that shit was already crazy.  There will be an adjustment period before humankind create a saner civilization based on sane principles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is being brigaded for sure.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t your typical &quot;Correct The Record&quot; type attack either.</p>

<p>Whoever is responsible they&#39;ve improved their tactics. They&#39;re now trying to muddy the waters by posting a bunch of insane conspiracies to make the community as a whole look unstable and crazy.</p>

<p>They&#39;re also trying to divide the actual users, and keep accusing established accounts of being shills (even I&#39;ve been attacked lately with a 10-year old Reddit account). I&#39;ve had a few exchanges with these people, and they back off / delete their comments as soon as you ask for evidence of their claims. When they do provide sources their sources are typically random people on Twitter and left wing conspiracy blogs.</p>

<p>Theres a few accounts I&#39;ve noticed that are all under 30 days old that seem to be pushing certain narratives. Meanwhile, theres a lot of young naive users who seem to be going along with MSM narratives or supporting conspiracies like flat Earth, the Russian narrative, etc.</p>

<p>With that said, I think it is a combo of things. We&#39;re being brigaded, but also have a lot of new users who are new to the conspiracy space and still developing their critical thinking skills. I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of rookie mistakes, and logical fallacies being upvoted on this sub the past week that aren&#39;t typically upvoted on this sub.</p>

<p>What is up voted and popular is so fucking skewed from the brigading and rigging that it&#39;s hard to tell up from down around here. The sock puppet accounts are so numerous at this point that if one were to try and get the general consensus from nothing but comments and up votes, the take away is gonna be REAL far from reality  And sad that there really isn&#39;t much we can do send any retaliation will have us banned in a heartbeat. </p>
