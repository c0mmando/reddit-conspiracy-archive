       Are you scared of what they can do? Or are you not afraid at all? If you are afraid, then how afraid are you? Do you like being afraid? Or do you hate it? How do you know you're afraid? Do you even know what fear is? How could you know what fear is if you've never felt it before?

       I'm human. Personally, I don't see how aliens are bad for me. In my own opinion, we should greet our alien overlords with all of the gold that humans, my species, has. Because I mean we earthlings aren't doing much with gold, other than my fellow primates using it as decoration to distinguish themselves for the other primates, but that is to be expected with such a primitive race.

       Imagine that all the worst things humans do to each other... But then apply it to something we conceive in the same capacity as say a human size goldfish... Fascinating for sure but still a dumb fish that honestly doesn't have the capacity to understand why we don't care if it suffers needlessly.

       Scared? Of anal probes and egg harvesting?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like being afraid, which is why I choose to be brave.  Sometimes shit goes wrong and you're scared, but you choose to be brave to get through it.  Because nobody likes someone who screams about spiders and mice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes when you're in the woods, you come face to face with a bear.  Sometimes you have to give birth to a child and you do it at home to avoid the probing (yes, afraid of probing, so I choose to avoid it at all costs). Sometimes you're sweetie gets shot in the face.  Sometimes you accidentally go down the double black diamond when you're a newb.  Sometimes you're sweet baby gets whooping cough.  Sometimes you eat too much brownie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be brave.  Also if you get visited or abducted by aliens (let's just assume for a minute that aliens are demons, and I'm going to include the good looking blondes, too) I've heard that calling (or if you're paralyzed, even thinking it) on Jesus Christ makes them leave/ends the abduction.  It's worth a shot.

       Yes. I wouldn't be able to trust them. I have trouble trusting my own species. I'm afraid I would most likely be team Cerebus if they ever landed and I would be concerned the had other motives.

       One time I took an unknown concoction (I thought was mushrooms) but later came to believe contained ayahuasca.  For a long time I thought I knew the "truth" because of what I saw and heard during that trip.  Then later I realized that evil can disguise itself as good, and liars are liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, there is a "nice" lady down the block who lied to my face yesterday, and when I discovered the truth and brought it to her, she lied even more.  When I offered her hard copy proof, she didn't have time to look.

       You seem pretty deep in with your Atlantis friends.  Consider the possibility that they are a bunch of lying liars.

       we all lie to ourselves and dont know it anyway. for examples thoughts are not the same as the actual. Like you cant lose your virginity to the thought of a girl, has to be a real girl and real sex. And yet you think all sorts of stuff about yourself and even think that its you who is doing the thinking...but thoughts arent even real.

       These aliens do fear Jesus.  It just proves that these aliens are actually unclean spirits in disguise.  There's power in the name of Jesus

       Aliens are unclean spirits, they are here to deceive people and the aliens know that Jesus is real, because the aliens are demons.  Just as Jesus cast out demons from people, the aliens flee from Jesus, so that tells you that the aliens are demons who fear Jesus.

       You could have easily said you don't believe in God rather than outright insulting someone else's beliefs.  You notice everyone else in this thread was courteous to your question, they responded without insult even though some don't believe in the idea of aliens.

       I would assume they have always had the power/tech to influence humanity. Why would they choose now to do anything to endanger us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe like some speculation states they have been a hidden hand influencing us from the start either for benevolent aims or something more untoward. If this is the case then nothing changes apart from our perspective.

      <p>
       Basically they could wipe us out at any time I would assume and they haven't yet so I think were good.

       I do seem to be quite close to it, don't I? Maybe that's why I'm not afraid. But I'd really like to think that we'll find out if everyone else is afraid or not relatively soon. That's just my gut talking, though.

       No. If there's alien life it's likely at a similar level, or lower than us on the evolutionary scale. Like a single celled organism in a body of water somewhere, or some humanoid species on an earth-like planet.

       How could there be a super-advanced race of grey men with sci-fi technology when the rest of the universe is made up of the same elements as we are? In which case why worry? if there's life, we're never going to encounter it unless it's within our solar system.

       Looking at how different species / races / cultures on Earth treat each other through history, I think one should absolutely be afraid of aliens if we found they existed and had the capability to reach us or affect us in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, in terms of the whole universe, events on Earth are a very small sample size on which to base assumptions. Maybe life elsewhere is all about love and helping one another, who knows? But without further information we should be prepared for the worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think the universe is so vast that it's likely almost anything you can imagine is out there somewhere.

       Just read your Atlantis thread. That was great and Im in agreement with a lot of what you said.  Was it your intention to get spillover from this thread to bring attention to some of your other stuff? If so it worked. This post was the Bimini road to a great read!

       I will check out your other posts too.  A bit preachy at times but you make a lot of points under one topic and its tough to show that much passion without getting lost in the intensity. Maybe thats why the downvotes? Good stuff OP.
