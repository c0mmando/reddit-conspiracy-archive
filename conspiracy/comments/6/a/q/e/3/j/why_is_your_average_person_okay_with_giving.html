    <div class="md"><p>Mcdonalds is fucking wage slavery.</p>

<p>Wage slavery is a difficult idea to defend if you don&#39;t know how, so maybe he got confused.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a legitimate idea but it requires some radical rethinking of some assumptions our society is based on which makes it difficult for some people to comprehend and so of course they react angrily, as the ignorant always will when faced with questions which undermine their mass produced and factory farmed illusions.</p>

<p>Or maybe he said something else and realized he was wrong</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t see why you care so much</p>

<p>What&#39;s it to you if he decides to delete a post, seriously????</p>

It achieves the goal of bringing all humanity under total economic and social control by allowing or disallowing buying and selling depending on the individuals decision to take part in the new system they&#39;re creating.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the late response.</p>

<p>Well, crypto currencies weren&#39;t developed by universities and goverment. Only after it took hold as more and more people started using it and was proven to work as designed in the wild. Crypto as an idea originated from a movement called cypherpunk, who believes in using technology, especially strong cryptography, as a tool for social and political change. They&#39;ve been around since the late 80&#39;s. Now, the blockchain is a really neat idea and solves a problem called the &#39;Byzantine General&#39;s Problem&#39;. In essence it comes down to this: there&#39;s no need anymore for a &#39;third party&#39; in order to transfer ownership from one stranger to another.  Ownership can be money like bitcoin, but it can be anything, really.
It&#39;s completely the opposite of what you wrote. The blockchain cannot be controlled, it doesn&#39;t give total access to everything, it cannot allow or disallow individuals buying or selling.
I&#39;m a lurker. i don&#39;t write much. But your words just were kinda screaming at me. I recommend you to read the white paper, it&#39;s just a couple of pages and not too difficult to comprehend: <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a> 
This stuff can, and i believe it eventually will, change our world fundamentally, and for the better.</p>

And I&#39;m not saying this one thing is the mark of the beast what I&#39;m saying is that this very well could be the next currency for their NWO worldwide system.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think many people do, I&#39;m not sure, haven&#39;t heard a lot about it.  Ultrasounds don&#39;t really help anything in my opinion.  Really the only thing they are good for is finding a few very rare defects (not 100% accurate) and identifying the sex of the baby (also not 100% accurate).  There is no testing done for ultrasounds, so I skipped them.  Everyone thought I was crazy.  Baby turned out fine.  If they don&#39;t help the outcome of a pregnancy, why use them? That is what really made me say no thank you.  Doctors pestered me every visit about it though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know.  Nobody has actually studied the question, to my knowledge.  Ultrasound has always been considered safe by the medical establishment but that is not a vote of confidence in my book.</p>

<p>High frequency sounds could theoretically disrupt something in development.  I know for myself, when I have kids, I&#39;ll definitely ask for one ultrasound early in pregnancy.  It is very helpful to get one so you can locate the placenta and make sure it&#39;s not a molar pregnancy and so on.  Beyond that, less is more as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but that does not mean that the average person thinks it&#39;s okay. So this question is pretty rhetorical. Honestly, at least from the demographic of people I&#39;m surrounded with and in the area I live in, most people are NOT okay with medicating their young child. It&#39;s kinda annoying seeing all these posts recently on this sub that complain about all these parents that think it&#39;s okay to do give their children medications right away. Just because you know one or two or even ten parents that think it&#39;s okay, does NOT mean the average person thinks it&#39;s okay. </p>

<p>The only people I&#39;ve ever known to give young children medications do so because their kids have conditions that cause seizures or their child is severely autistic or has a similar condition. And even then, the parents are not just giving them loads of pills and that&#39;s it, their also trying out diet and exercise changes, therapy, and other techniques to help their child function and be capable to do everyday thinks like everybody else, and if they could do it without medications, they would. </p>

<p>I feel like saying &quot;the average person thinks it&#39;s okay&quot; is extremely one sided and not true due to lack of evidence. Once I see an actual statistic that&#39;s computed properly, I would believe that statement.There are over 325 million people in the US, to say the average person is an extreme over estimate that causes drama caused by falsehood.  Seeing how many kids are being medicated at young ages does not mean that their parents are okay with giving the medications, they&#39;re just trying to do the best they can as parents for their child. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>+1. There is evidence already that adderall, for example, rewires dopamine receptors in adults brain when taken long enough. Effectively it can change your personality. Add to this that the brain doesn&#39;t mature until 21 (arguably 25 in the ore-frontal Cortex which controls our highest conscious functions like judgment.) and you clearly have a problem. </p>

<p>My psych professors always warned of what underage drinking can do to the developing brain, I can&#39;t imagine what some of the drug cocktails given adolescents must be doing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, there&#39;s a slow developmental process that the human brain follows.  Most neurons are created before birth, then follow a specific process of migration to their eventual destinations (again, before birth).  From infancy to puberty there is a gradual but very specific process of development, including the formation of connections followed by pruning of connections, as well as a coordinated process of myelination (creation of fatty sheaths around neuronal axons in order to speed up the transmission of signals).  In particular, the prefrontal cortex has a particularly complex developmental process, which can last until young adulthood.  Development of the limbic system, which controls emotion, takes off at puberty and has a complex relationship with the functions of the prefrontal cortex.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that any drug that affects the nervous system and is taken over a long period of time will certainly alter the development of the brain and lead to permanent effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What bothers me the most is that in many cases it&#39;s not the kids fault, it&#39;s their shitty parents. </p>

<p>My nephew is in high-school and is on some of this shit for ADHD. The thing is, my sister is with an abusive guy (not my nephews father) they all drink all the time, they have parties, they fight, etc. His father basically checked out a decade ago and is 90% absentee. </p>

<p>So you have a kid from a very traumatic home, who is dealing with a ton of personal issues, and is a fucking teen with all that drama and hormones. And you wonder why he is having trouble with math class? </p>

<p>Then instead of taking a look at the whole situation objectively and making the necessary changes and getting the necessary therapy, they say it&#39;s a &quot;mental problem&quot; and drug up the kid. </p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with my nephew. The minute you get him out of that house and away from his &quot;step-dad&quot; he is a completely different person. He is attentive, happy, talkative, or just a normal kid. </p>

<hr/>

<p>My wife is a teacher and works at a high risk school, and has for over 10 years now. It&#39;s uncanny how the kids from two parent homes where the parents have their shit together, somehow 99% of those kids do well in school and are not medicated. But the kids from 1 parent homes or homes with a ton of chaos, you guessed it! The majority of them are on medications and have IEP&#39;s. </p>

<p>Either there is an outlier here that I am missing, or the problems these kids are having are NOT FUCKING MEDICAL so we should STOP FUCKING MEDICATING THEM. </p>

<p>Sorry for yelling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, well that&#39;s one case. As someone who works in special ed, I can tell you that some kids need medication in order to hold a normal conversation. The chemicals in their head are at an imbalance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Behavior should never be medicated unless it can cause harm to the individual or others. </p>

<p>This idea that we medicate kids who are 100% healthy, have perfect vitals, no physical symptoms or problems is insane. Why? Because every single child doesn&#39;t fit into this mold we created where they have to wake up 5 days a week, go to a building, sit still in a chair, listen attentively, memorize and repeat what they just saw, not talk back, not have an opinion, and do it for 12 years? </p>

<p>All while we take away recess, take away extra curricular activities, pump shitty food into them, and fill their world with insane amounts of auditory and visual stimuli. </p>

<p>If they cannot do that, in that situation, even if they are 100% healthy and pass every <strong>MEDICAL</strong> test with flying colors. We still feel the need to put chemicals in them, why? </p>

<p>Not paying attention, and not having a conversation is not a medical issue, so please stop medicating them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to be so blunt with you, but you&#39;re just wrong and have not worked with the type of kids I work with. </p>

<p>You&#39;re preaching to the choir when it comes to giving kids more time to be outside and discover things. As someone who works in public school, I think we are going down a dangerous path where every kid has to be held to the same standard. Charter schools can be a great example of how I think education should be run, but that&#39;s a subject for another time. </p>

<p>That being said, it isn&#39;t as simple as &quot;Not paying attention, and not having a conversation.&quot; If a kid can&#39;t sit and hold a meaningful conversation because of his attention span, what do you think happens to his social skills? What about skills we all learned in school that help us in the future? He&#39;s certainly not going to form meaningful relationships with peers if they can&#39;t hold his attention. That can lead to another whole set of issues like anxiety and depression.</p>

<p>So what do you do for a kid like that? Because I know them. A lot of them. I&#39;ve seen them on medication, and I&#39;ve seen them without and I can tell you it does have a positive effect. </p>

<p>Are too many kids medicated? Absolutely. Are public schools drilling kids with way to much info? You bet. Is medicating a child for ADHD an inherently bad thing? No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People place a lot of blind faith on doctors. I think this is going to be the biggest red pill for a lot of people to swallow. Patients are commodities for doctors just like cattle on the auction block. Doctors make their money from insurance, hospitals and  big pharma. Not patients. It&#39;s a facade. When the truth about the medical industry is exposed only then will things change. when patients stop using insurance and doctors are forced to get paid directly through their insurance only then will things change. Until then money talks and if you are not paying the doctor yourself then he is working for the interests of insurance and big pharma.  </p>

Why not take money out ? because no one wants to work for free. The carrot and the stick are a human nature reality. It is not how I wish we were idealistically. It is reality that humans need incentives. Socialism is a lovely theory, I also wish santa clause existed. It is a theory that unfortunately does not work because humans need incentives. The problem is not the money, the problem are the middleman that hold an unbalance of money and tip the scales too far in their direction.

<p>Try taking it out of the 600 something billion we put each year into war.</p>

<p>This is why taxation is theft. Our taxes aren&#39;t used to benefit the american people for the most part. It&#39;s used to start wars, to profit a small number of people, to better fuck us over. It&#39;s definitely not used for our roads, water supplies, electricity, or anything else like that. If it were, we&#39;d have some pretty magnificent graphite roads while being the cleanest, wealthiest country on the planet where nobody goes without. Basically a utopia.</p>

<p>But we have a government system that is built to attract and be run by sociopaths and psychopaths. Our corporations are the same. Those values are forced on the people. <em>&quot;Me me me, all about me&quot;</em>. Universal health care is the same. &quot;Why should I pay for a lazy piece of shit&#39;s health care&quot; is all I ever hear. God damn is pisses me off. We would all pay so much less for health care if everyone were paying for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem I have is when my money goes to some lazy piece of shit who just wants to sap their resources without adding any value back into it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will still cost you less. You&#39;re giving that lazy piece of shit maybe 10 bucks maximum, and that&#39;s if they got a terminal disease that lasted years. When you have 200 million people paying towards each others health care, the amount that goes towards lazy people is negligible.</p>

Ban advertising TV and  bribing of doctors and universities. Put strict regulations on insurance industry and hospitals. Give people a choice between private or government healthcare at least, let them compete. </p>

<p>Healthcare system in US is a cartel business. A medicine that costs 10$ in one country, costs 100$ in US. A month supply of Lipitor 400$, for what? A drug that damages your liver? </p>

<p>That is already what is happening in America right now. How much do you actually know about the US, outside of the conspiracies you read online? And you&#39;re completely making shit up again, just like you did with the &quot;Europe doesn&#39;t consider ADHD a real condition&quot; nonsense. Lipitor costs $140 per month in the US <em>without insurance</em>. People in the US who have insurance pay an average of between $10 and $20 for a month&#39;s supply of Lipitor. Also, for whatever reason you pointed out that Lipitor can cause liver damage, that is a side effect that occurs in less than 1% of people who take the drug for a <em>life threatening condition.</em> I think the reward outweighs the risk for people who actually need to take that drug.</p>

<p>Regarding Lipitor, I know how much it costs because I pay it for someone who doesn&#39;t have insurance. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/22M7xck.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/22M7xck.jpg</a></p>

<p>I mentioned liver damage because we are paying top dollar for a drug that has serious side effects. According to pharmaceutical companies, all drugs with serious effects only effect 1% or in &#39;rare cases&#39;, based on research funded by them. More you comment, the more you sound like industry shill! </p>

<p>Regarding ADHD I will provide you with more links to studies, but I have a feeling it&#39;s going to be a waste of time. Facts are irrelevant to you! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>80mg is an extremely high dose of Lipitor, I&#39;m sorry that you have to pay for that for someone. It&#39;s very uncommon for anyone to have to take that much. My dad is on Lipitor and was uninsured until last year, it cost him about $140 a month for 30mg. If you don&#39;t like the side effect potential of Lipitor then go with another statin? It&#39;s not like Lipitor is the only one. If your argument is that EVERY drug in that class has potential liver damage as a side effect, then I suggest you get a degree in chemistry and try to make something better.</p>

<p>The ADHD thing isn&#39;t a debate though, there are individual people in Europe who refuse to accept it is a real condition. There are also people who think that hurricanes are caused by gay marriage. However, your claim was that the whole continent of Europe does not treat ADHD as a condition. You cannot show me a source that backs that claim up as most (all?) countries in Europe approve of prescribing amphetamines or methylphenidate (or both) as treatments for ADHD. You can certainly say that American doctors overprescribe stimulants to children for ADHD when they may not actually have the condition, I would agree with that. </p>

<p>This is just a lie that you made up. Google searching &quot;adhd europe&quot; turns up all kinds of European sources on the treatment of ADHD. Approaches to treatment are different, sure, but why are people just believing your comment that Europe doesn&#39;t recognize them as disorders? There are 28 governments in the EU, it is beyond me why people are eating this crap up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone knows that US healthcare is expensive and hard to access if you don&#39;t have a job that provides good insurance. It&#39;s one of the many problems of not having universal healthcare, which I wholeheartedly support and think we need. The bottom line though is that if you can pay up, the US has some of the best doctors and hospitals in the world and wealthy people come here from all over to receive care. This is a product of the private health industry. Many doctors leave their home country and come to America for school and to work because they know that&#39;s how they can make the most money.</p>

<p>Definitely - it&#39;s very confusing.  People aren&#39;t charged the same price for the same service across the board, and you have no idea what something will cost until you get a bill.</p>

<p>Worse, it&#39;s very hard to even sort out what&#39;s going on if you <em>do</em> have insurance.</p>

<p>Prices need to be posted and the same for everyone.  You may not be aware that the uninsured are actually charged more than insurance companies pay and than Medicare or Medicaid would pay.  It&#39;s absurd.</p>

<p>Your doctor doesn&#39;t know (or care) what Rx drugs are in your insurance formulary.   You could go to a pharmacy with it only to find you owe $300 (or more) for a month because it&#39;s not covered.  Then what?   You have to get the doctor to prescribe something else which may be better, worse or exactly the same.</p>

<p>The administration of all of this is a nightmare as well and adds a lot to the total cost of care and insurance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever man... the world is messed up, has been for a long time. Back in the day when a child was depressed their parents use that as a excuse to beat them for being &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;disrespectful&quot;, and they still do. Giving them some questionable pills is a kindness. At least they recognize there is a problem. Do you have an alternative treatment that works and is feasible? Probably not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. I have horrible bipolar disorder and without medication I was literally destroying my body. I have scars and many broken relationships to prove it. With medication I am not a zombie, I&#39;m a normal human.  In fact, most people who act like zombies are on too high of a dose, which is scary and sad. </p>

<p>I think we overprescribe medication, but I do think about 5% of people really do benefit from it. Looking back, a very low dose of antidepressants along with my therapy may have stopped the suicidal thoughts that began at age 8. </p>

<p>Again, it is overprescribed and should never be used as the first line of action but rather a last resort, but not every parent is crazy for medicating their child. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m sure that this stuff is over-diagnosed, and there are real problems with the over-prescription of drugs to children, but if you&#39;d ever been around a kid who genuinely has ADHD you&#39;d understand why people are okay with giving them Adderall.</p>

<p>The real problem is that ADHD has a similar issue to OCD, where people think it&#39;s not that big a deal and everyone thinks they have it in some way.  But the fact is that, like OCD, actual ADHD is completely debilitating without medication to treat it (speaking from personal experience here).  It&#39;s not just a matter of having trouble in math class or whatever.  ADHD makes it extremely difficult to actually listen to what anyone else is saying.  This affects school, sure, but it also affects personal relationships, and kids with ADHD are often extremely socially isolated and rejected by their peers.  Having ADHD is a miserable experience.  There&#39;s a reason why ADHD is so often comorbid with depression.  Getting medicated was life-changing, for me (although I didn&#39;t get treatment until I was 24, to be fair).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was diagnosed ADHD at age 8(34 now), immediately put on Ritalin and remained on it for 7 or so years. Was a zombie. I complained to my doctor about feeling like a drone that just existed, switched me to adderall along with a cocktail of other pills for about 3 years, again, zombified. Then I started smoking weed. Cannabis helped with my ADHD more so than ANY medication I have ever been on and allowed me to feel normal. No pills, no matter the amount, is the answer.</p>

I&#39;ve even designed custom compounds made by a compounding pharmacy for my patients and I don&#39;t get a single dime from them. </p>

<p>In regards to meds for kids, at what age are meds okay? Is it okay to treat a kid with early onset schizophrenia with antipsychotics? I personally have taken a medication since I was a child and without it I wouldn&#39;t have become a doctor. It helps me function at the apex of my abilities. </p>

<p>Not all doctors are pill pushers. No doctor is getting kickbacks from pharmaceuticals since the sunshine law in the US. If I eat a drug rep lunch that&#39;s logged and public domain info. </p>

<p>You think I like giving kids psychiatric medications? Of course not. But when some 6 year old girl is seemingly immune to pain and always attempting to murder her toddler brother because the voices in her head tell her to do so, we will fix that with diet and exercise right? </p>

<p>Its not always as black and white as you list it here. </p>

<p>That being said, amphetamines and stimulants are WAY over prescribed and I&#39;ve personally wondered if this is permitted federally as an amped up population has a better GDP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kids have a lot of natural energy and in this world of smartphones, tablets, video games, and cartoons- they&#39;re typically pacified with these things and have no outlets to channel their energy. </p>

<p>Parents are working longer hours for less money and when they come home to a wired child whom they figured would&#39;ve already channeled all their energy at school, daycare, practice, whatever- it&#39;s too easy to assume their kid must have some kind of hyper energetic &quot;disability.&quot; So what do they do? Well they get their kids on the same adderall they snorted in high school to focus on tests and such. </p>

<p>In reality, there&#39;s nothing wrong with these kids- they&#39;re just energetic. We used to leave the house after school by ourselves and not come back for hours, adventuring in the woods, riding bikes, playing ball- and then we&#39;d wind down with the PlayStation an hour before bed. Kids don&#39;t play outside anymore. People are too worried about predators and mosquitoes or sunlight or some shit and would rather raise xbox vampires, so naturally when the kid&#39;s all hopped up on natural human energy and the parent is exhausted- it&#39;s just too easy to assume there&#39;s ADHD/ADD going on and give them a literal chill pill. And then you end up with a zombie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hope some of you take a breath and consider that for every person abusing the meds, there really are people who genuinely need it. 
I came from a not so great home and was on my own by the time I was 15, never intended to have kids. Got married, and my husband wanted children. Here I am, 3 kids in. I&#39;m stubborn and proud and I have the will to do things right. I tell you this so that you don&#39;t prejudge how others were raised to necessarily impact how they raise their children today. I cook most meals at home, they dont drink sodas (oldest had his first taste of one at 8!). Candy is limited. My first born who is now 10 was from the get go &quot;not right&quot;.  He screamed non stop, he had food intolerance problems, leaky gut. When he was about 9 months old I can remember his first &quot;trantrum&quot;; growling and rolling around on the ground attacking whatever was near him because he was so angry (and I assume, hurt so much). I did everything I could to refine my diet (he was exclusively breast fed), took out soy, milk, and eggs through diet experimentation and evaluation of his behavior. I still could tell something was hurting him but no one told me it could be something so innocuous as potatoes! Because it turned out when he could finally communicate it, he told me it hurt him when he ate it. We went to the dr and tried formulas with supposedly no &quot;allergies&quot; which hurt him even more than breastmilk with me having eaten something that bothered him. We went to so very many specialists in three different states that were supposed to be highly respected in the fields that we needed help in, and none had any advice if they didn&#39;t just call me crazy. He had delays in speech, we did sign language until we could understand what the heck he was saying, which was age 4. His behavior was always like a tasmanian devil. Many days it still is.
He can&#39;t follow instructions, more than one instruction and he forgets everything, including the first one. He has no ability to think of cause and effect, destroys things intentionally and unintionally, puts himself in very precarious situations, and has frequently seriously hurt his other two siblings because of this. He felt like an utter and total failure at school because he can&#39;t do what other kids seem to do so easily. He can&#39;t focus if there is any extra stimuli in the environment at all.
Now we went through many years of this. I saw the problems coming and I waited a year later than the year he was supposed to enroll in school to start him. I even took him out of school to home school him because he was failing, and in the summers I would teach him what I could to keep him afloat during the year until it was too much (third grade) for him to manage. No amount of healthy food, vitamins and herbal supplements, diet limitations, or exercise has helped him do better.
I have wrestled for years after having him officially diagnosed as ADHD with dysgraphia and aspergers tendencies to finally try medication. You know what? He can be a mostly normal kid with the medicine. Do I hate that he has to take it to be &quot;normal&quot;? you bet your ass I do. I resent it. And I&#39;m scared of what it might do to him later, because he&#39;s so young. But you know what I do know for a fact? Him being miserable 24/7 and feeling like a constant failure in school work, fighting when he&#39;s trying to spend time with his friends, causing non stop problems at home... well those things will make a person feel like they&#39;re not worth very much at all. And we all know where that can lead. 
I still feel the emotional pang of guilt for putting him on medicine. Why can&#39;t I find the &quot;magic solution&quot; to make it all better? I&#39;m mom and I&#39;m supposed to fix it.
So yea, you guys talking about the damages pharmaceuticals can do are absolutely legit, and I&#39;m on your side too. But the alternatives can be worse.</p>

<p>But everything is connected, you know? It&#39;s not that easy to just stop taking meds. I mean it was for me when I had anxiety and OCD pills, but not everyone is med-hardy like me where pharmaceuticals don&#39;t make things better or worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to try to remember to dig up some sources for this later today, but I have a good friend who is kind of an activist teacher and she is always going on about the huge percentage of students today who are dealing with complex PTSD and associated issues due specifically to their family&#39;s personal trauma and upheavals stemming from the economic collapse in &#39;08 - she&#39;s shared many eye opening studies about how poverty in general effects the brain, and how parents&#39; stress and anxiety about money, jobs, housing, and even food insecurity profoundly affects the development of children. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a PTSD patient or &quot;survivor&quot; (feel free to pm me about my life-changing experiences with EMDR therapy if you too are suffering) and I absolutely can see how all the symptoms that were ruining my life in the past 11 years would have got me medicated to high heaven had I been experiencing and exhibiting them as a child with all that extra energy and hormones coursing through me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ok, but I have enough life experience and compassion to know that it isn&#39;t a black and white &#39;lazy vs good&#39; parent thing. It&#39;s a serious generation-wide problem that has blood chilling implications our society is in no way prepared to deal with as these kids get older. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am just on this sub to see all of the denial of the Trump-Russia connection, but as someone who has studied medicinal chemistry at the Ph.D. level, you are not crazy for thinking this. Antidepressants and Adderall (which is literally amphetamine, one carbon and 3 protons from being Meth) can have long-lasting effects on neurological development through their modulation of the serotonergic, adrenergic, or dopaminergic systems. Depression and ADHD are not entirely understood from a molecular level and could possibly have many varying causes. Using these powerful neurochemistry altering drugs in children while there brains are still developing is not something I would ever advocate for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years of big pharma and indoctrination of the general public into corporate ideologies. THis belief that drugs are the solution, which leads to dependence on drugs. Your body has a natural balance, yes there could be a chemical imbalance, but the pharma industry is not interested in a cure. A cure, a medical system where a medicine is administered and once your body is better that medicine is removed doesnt exist. Yes ideally doctors do try to weine people off, but the pharma has both a hold on prescription and non prescription drugs. Years of this, leads to ideologies that parents developed towards drugs being helpful to their lives, that this then translates into being comfortable in treating their children with medication further fueling dependency. </p>

<p>What is scary is the age at which young developing argonisms of children get exposed to these drugs. Which I have no doubt causes a dependancy on the chemicals in the long run as the body will have to need to produce them, and the child will not have grown to be able to live/adjust their behaviour and mental states to deal with what ever issues they have. Saying that they cant is bullshit, as human bodies and children are designed to adapt and develop on their own. Hence why we need education, and parenting to pass on good behaviours and coping mechanisms etc. But with big pharma only working towards treating symptoms and not finding cure for a desease, means the industry must keep the investors happy. (Sure a cure is not as simple as saying it is so, but as we have seen recently with the epipen prise debacle, phafma give two shits about affordable live saving/curing devices) </p>

Really the only thing they are good for is finding a few very rare defects (not 100% accurate) and identifying the sex of the baby (also not 100% accurate).  There is no testing done for ultrasounds, so I skipped them.  Everyone thought I was crazy.  Baby turned out fine.  If they don&#39;t help the outcome of a pregnancy, why use them? That is what really made me say no thank you.  Doctors pestered me every visit about it though.</p>

<p>High frequency sounds could theoretically disrupt something in development.  I know for myself, when I have kids, I&#39;ll definitely ask for one ultrasound early in pregnancy.  It is very helpful to get one so you can locate the placenta and make sure it&#39;s not a molar pregnancy and so on.  Beyond that, less is more as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to be so blunt with you, but you&#39;re just wrong and have not worked with the type of kids I work with. </p>

<p>You&#39;re preaching to the choir when it comes to giving kids more time to be outside and discover things. As someone who works in public school, I think we are going down a dangerous path where every kid has to be held to the same standard. Charter schools can be a great example of how I think education should be run, but that&#39;s a subject for another time. </p>

<p>That being said, it isn&#39;t as simple as &quot;Not paying attention, and not having a conversation.&quot; If a kid can&#39;t sit and hold a meaningful conversation because of his attention span, what do you think happens to his social skills? What about skills we all learned in school that help us in the future? He&#39;s certainly not going to form meaningful relationships with peers if they can&#39;t hold his attention. That can lead to another whole set of issues like anxiety and depression.</p>

<p>So what do you do for a kid like that? Because I know them. A lot of them. I&#39;ve seen them on medication, and I&#39;ve seen them without and I can tell you it does have a positive effect. </p>

<p>Are too many kids medicated? Absolutely. Are public schools drilling kids with way to much info? You bet. Is medicating a child for ADHD an inherently bad thing? No.</p>
