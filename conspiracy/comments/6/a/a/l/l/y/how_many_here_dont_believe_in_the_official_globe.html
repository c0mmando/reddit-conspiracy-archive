<p>Have you, or are you simply telling us what you&#39;ve seen in YouTube videos?</p>

<p>Here is what really happens... when any video/photo shows a curvature, you lot simply claim it is fake. When you manage to find a video that doesn&#39;t seem to show the curvature, you guys (without any knowledge of the actual details of the photo) claim it is real.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called confirmation bias. When it confirms your belief you accept it, when it refutes your belief you reject it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not an investigation. That&#39;s religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  Looked at it with some interest.  Several hours worth, actually. (just to make sure I wasn&#39;t missing an important piece of the puzzle.  I came to the obvious conclusion that flat earth was clearly falsifiable.

<p>If you look into the flat earth theory for a decent amount of time, and you can&#39;t spot the dozens of glaring flaws in it, then know this:. You&#39;re simply not very smart.  At all.  Don&#39;t let your feelings fool you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much everything.</p>

<p>Take for example the oft cited claim that pilots do not adjust their flight paths to account for the spherical earth.</p>

<p>This is wrong in two different ways... firstly, long intercontinental flights most certainly do adjust their flight paths based on a spherical earth because they often fly the &quot;great circle&quot; route between their departure point and their destination. This route is specifically accounting for the fact that the &quot;great circle&quot; route is the shortest distance between two points on a sphere.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is wrong because they imply that a pilot would have to keep pushing the nose down to stop from flying off into space. This is pure bullshit and betrays a complete lack of understanding of how aircraft fly.</p>

<p>Their argument is, without making an adjustment, the aircraft would gain altitude above the surface until it enters space. But the fact is, an airplane maintains altitude by cancelling the pull of gravity with lift. One of the factors that determines the amount of lift a wing generates is the density of the air it is moving through.</p>

<p>If, as the flat earthers claim, the aircraft would start gaining altitude, the air would become less dense, reducing the amount of lift the wings generate, causing it to drop back down until the air became dense enough to create enough lift to cancel out the gravity.</p>

<p>This is extremely simple science... but the flat earthers ignore this because it doesn&#39;t suit their argument. In fact, all of their claims can be debunked like this, but they refuse to accept the evidence because it doesn&#39;t confirm their religious beliefs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to give you the laundry list of evidence against flat earth.  I&#39;ll just list three big ones that are unresolvable.
1. Pole stars
2.  Lunar eclipse.
3.  Seasonal changes of sun&#39;s path in the sky.</p>

<p>This is the part where you tell me pole stars don&#39;t exist, the moon is just half turned off to <em>look like</em> an eclipse, and the sun is actually a flat cheese wheel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple answer. I&#39;ll quote a couple of comments I made earlier today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/nqEuGAx.png">Is this a flat plane, or a circle?</a></p>

<p>It sure looks like a flat plane, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/LNWZ09C.png">But no, it is a small part of a much larger circle.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the second comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is another look at the reality of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/wusLVpP.png">This image is scaled so that one pixel represents a box with sides that are three miles long.</a></p>

<p>At the very top is a tiny red dot. That dot represents the height of Mt Everest (2 pixels/6 miles - Everest is actually 5.5 miles high).</p>

<p>I have zoomed the dot so you can get an idea of the relative scale. Our planet is so big, even the tallest mountain is nothing but a tiny dot on its surface.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you can&#39;t see the curve.</p>

<p>Not really. They make the kind of points that lazy ignorant people fall for.</p>

<p>By ignorant, I mean people who do not understand the science, and by lazy I mean people who can&#39;t be bothered to try and understand the science.</p>

<p>If you simply watch some YouTube videos in which the science is never mentioned, you only hear one side of the argument and that side ends up sounding rational. If you actually look at the other side of the argument, you realise how stupid the &quot;believers&quot; really are.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Everything. The image is made up of pixels. Those pixels cover a certain area of the view. If something is smaller than one pixel in size relative to the frame, then it will be averaged out so that a single colour can represent it (a pixel can only be one colour).</p>

<p>When zoomed out, the boat covers one pixel (or less) and is represented by a single colour. When zoomed in, the boat covers more than one pixel so different colours can be used to represent it, allowing us to see the detail.</p>

<p>A higher resolution camera has more pixels and can show more detail when zoomed out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not 100% sure on this because it might still be obscured by the reflection of the water, but as far as I know and have read of, if you use a good telescope you will see it vanish beyond the horizon and after that no amount of zooming is going to get it back.<br/>
It&#39;s more difficult with digital footage, because there&#39;s obviously a limited amount of pixels but as long as you are zooming optically and have enough zoom on your camera or what have you and the ship goes behind the horizon, you won&#39;t see it unless you move or it comes back.<br/>
This is something that I have not experienced myself (I don&#39;t really go to the sea, especially not with the express intention of testing something that is obvious to me, not only due to ships vanishing bottom up) but have read about multiple times.<br/>
Also, all of the debunk videos of this phenomenon I&#39;ve seen thus far only focus on the fact that there is some reflection and where the water line really is but don&#39;t touch at all on the fact, that while the sail is still visible, the rest of the boat is not, while the real water line, the one that mirrors the sail or whatever, is above where the boat hull would be, which in my opinion is a super weak argument unless we&#39;re talking about submarines...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It feels a little weird, having to explain how seeing things works, but ok...  I guess we&#39;ll take it from the top.</p>

<p>When you look with your eyes at distant objects, as it travels away, the details blur together, and we can&#39;t see it as clearly.  The details of the ship blur together with the details of the horizon.  This exaggerates the effect of dipping below the horizon, and it looks like they merge together, and the ship &quot;disappears&quot;.  When you zoom in with a telescope or camera, the details come back, and the image isn&#39;t fuzzed together anymore.  But as the ship continues further away, it will actually go past the horizon, instead of just appearing to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what we are told is off, when I see with my naked eyes that the ship goes over the horizon it&#39;s not going over the curve of the earth is just my perspective, it merges with the horizon. So when I zoom in I can see it again. What if I had a camera that could not stop zooming? Do you think at some point I could not see the ship with my unlimited  zoom camera? I thought after a certain amount of miles it would be impossible to zoom in on the ship. What is that distance 1 mile ? 3 miles? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even with unlimited zoom, the ship eventually dips below the horizon.  You&#39;ve already been shown a video of this happening.  What you see with your eyes is a combination of the ship going beneath the horizon, and the details fuzzing together.  It causes us to see the ship &quot;disappear&quot; before it actually does.  It&#39;s still going below the horizon, but our imperfect vision blurs the details before it actually goes all the way under.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not one of those shows the ship go over the horizon.</p>

<p>All of them resort to simple trickery to make a ship that is visible seemingly disappear by zooming out until they are hidden by the low resolution. They are still there, just hidden.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6aally/how_many_here_dont_believe_in_the_official_globe/dhdulpw/">XtendedImpact showed a video where the ship actually goes over the horizon.</a></p>

<p>I have never seen a video where you see a ship go over the horizon like that, then be brought back into full view simply by zooming in further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know why calendars have leap days? Do you know why the earth has different seasons? Well, a guy named Erasthenes, a greek genius, not only discovered some of those things but even measured them with good precision. He did that while being a fundamental mathematician of number theory and a bunch of other stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eratosthenes of Cyrene (/ɛrəˈtɒsθəniːz/; Greek: Ἐρατοσθένης ὁ Κυρηναῖος, IPA: [eratostʰénɛːs]; c. 276 BC[1] – c. 195/194 BC[2]) was a Greek mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and music theorist. He was a man of learning, becoming the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria. He invented the discipline of geography, including the terminology used today.[3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is best known for being the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth, which he did by applying a measuring system using stadia, a standard unit of measure during that time period. His calculation was remarkably accurate. He was also the first to calculate the tilt of the Earth&#39;s axis (again with remarkable accuracy). Additionally, he may have accurately calculated the distance from the Earth to the Sun and invented the leap day.[4] He created the first map of the world, incorporating parallels and meridians based on the available geographic knowledge of his era.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes was the founder of scientific chronology; he endeavored to revise the dates of the chief literary and political events from the conquest of Troy. In number theory, he introduced the sieve of Eratosthenes, an efficient method of identifying prime numbers.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes</a></p>

<p>One of his achievements in measuring the circumference of the earth, which he did with an error of only 0.16%. So not even talking about the modern day proves, even the ancient greeks not only thought that the earth was round but they even calculated it&#39;s exact measures with remarkable precision.</p>

<p>Unless the NASA can literally travel back in time to fabricate documents thousands of years ago, it can be said with certainty that people knew the earth was round since the dawn of history.</p>

<p>Well, not all people, mathematicians, physicists and generally, thinkers did. Regular morons probably did think the earth was flat.</p>

None of the things I did, the journeys I made, the places I flew from and to and over, none of that is in any way reconcilable with a flat earth. To fly from Hong Kong to London, for instance, you fly over Siberia and when you look down it is very obviously Siberia (for about six hours of flying). On the flat earth model I would have flown over India (which I have also done) and I can assure you they look quite different.</p>

It is an idealized equilibrium surface of sea water, the mean sea level surface in the absence of currents, air pressure variations etc. and continued under the continental masses.

<p>So saying we don&#39;t know the whole picture is obvious because the research is being updated. Not even real scientist say it&#39;s a sphere and know that&#39;s inaccurate. So it cannot even be perfect globe vs perfectly flat. The goddamn ocean floor expands and morphs constantly according to science. Ignoring any of this and thinking &quot;the truth is known&quot; is insane. </p>

<p>Yes. I&#39;m not a flat earther, but what does the resolution have to do with it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything. The image is made up of pixels. Those pixels cover a certain area of the view. If something is smaller than one pixel in size relative to the frame, then it will be averaged out so that a single colour can represent it (a pixel can only be one colour).</p>

<p>When zoomed out, the boat covers one pixel (or less) and is represented by a single colour. When zoomed in, the boat covers more than one pixel so different colours can be used to represent it, allowing us to see the detail.</p>

<p>A higher resolution camera has more pixels and can show more detail when zoomed out.</p>
