        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Pop quiz. Do you know what country exports the most refined petroleum of any country in the world? Take a guess. The US? Nope, we&#39;re 5th. Russia? Nope, 2nd. </p>

<p>Did you guess the Netherlands? Because surprisingly that is the actual answer: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_refined_petroleum_exports">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_refined_petroleum_exports</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Second question, what country gets the largest portion of Russia&#39;s exports? Take a guess. China? Nope. Iran? Try again. </p>

<p>Again, very surprisingly (at least to me), it&#39;s the Netherlands, and it&#39;s all oil that needs refining: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_Russia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_Russia</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So maybe the Russia/EU rivalry is not quite as hot as it seems going by the MSM? Maybe it is a bit for show and the two are quite dependent on each other? </p>

<p>However, The Netherlands is smart enough to diversify their income streams. Their economy is not too dependent on the single export of refined petroleum. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a treemap showing all their exports proportionally: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/2014_Netherlands_Products_Export_Treemap.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/2014_Netherlands_Products_Export_Treemap.png</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, it&#39;s pretty diversified. However, you know what country <em>isn&#39;t</em> diversified? Chad. Let&#39;s look at Chad. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the same treemap of Chad&#39;s exports: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Tree_map_export_2009_Chad.jpeg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Tree_map_export_2009_Chad.jpeg</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Looks a bit different, doesn&#39;t it? Eggs in one basket much? So the price of unrefined oil essentially determines Chad&#39;s GDP for that year. Great. </p>

<p>Now, guess who owns the equipment to do all this oil extraction? If you read the title, I&#39;m hoping you&#39;re guessing Exxon, and you&#39;d be right. 75% of the infrastructure to extract oil from Chad is owned by Exxon, and the other 25% <em>was</em> owned by Chevron, who sold it to the Chadian Government for $1.3 Billion dollars. In 2014.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-announces-sale-of-interests-in-chad-and-cameroon">https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-announces-sale-of-interests-in-chad-and-cameroon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Where did the Government of Chad get the money for that?! Why they got a huge loan, of course. Who did they get a loan from? Why none other than Glencore, the 14th largest company in the world, who also does extraction of oil and coal, as well as copper and zinc and already has some oil operations in southern Chad. What a coincidence. /s</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/glencoremapforweb.png?w=1024&amp;h=725">https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/glencoremapforweb.png?w=1024&amp;h=725</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile through all of this, the GDP of Chad has increased from $1.3 Billion in 2001 to $11 Billion in 2015. Almost 10x in just 20 years. Pretty good!</p>

<p>Guess what the revenue of Exxon and Glencore was in 2015, for comparison? More or less than Chad? Exxon had revenue of $218 Billion, and Glencore had revenue of $152 Billion. That&#39;s the yearly equivalent of 20 Chads and 14 Chads, respectively. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve heard of &quot;company towns&quot;, where the town is basically owned by one company? Well this is a &quot;company nation&quot; and it&#39;s <em>far</em> from the only one. </p>

<p>So really what we are seeing in 2014 is Chevron effectively selling their 25% ownership of Chad to Glencore, and doing it through the Chadian government in a way so they&#39;re on the hook for over a billion dollars of additional debt. Debt slavery, but on a national scale, to a whole government. They&#39;re also contractually required to pay it off in just 4 years! I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to make that payment schedule, which would end in 2018. I wonder what Glencore will demand in return for missed payments. What laws they will have the Chadian government make for them, in return for extending their debt deadlines. </p>

<p>Now on top of all this, in the most recent twist, as of November 2016 the Chadian Government is now <strong>suing Exxon for $74 Billion</strong>. That is 5x the GDP of Chad. </p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/11/16/exxons-74-billion-fine-in-chad-unbelievable-economic-numbers-are-unbelievable/#6ebfd3cd6878">https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/11/16/exxons-74-billion-fine-in-chad-unbelievable-economic-numbers-are-unbelievable/#6ebfd3cd6878</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The government are in a sense biting the hand that feeds them, with Exxon being responsible for essentially 75% of Chad&#39;s GDP. Exxon is unlikely to pay, because even though their insanely huge profit for 2015 (not revenue, but income profit) was a staggering $16 Billion dollars, that is still dwarfed by a $74 Billion lawsuit. </p>

<p>Will Chad settle for less than $74 Billion? Is this just a money grab and they won&#39;t actually hold Exxon&#39;s feet to the fire, and they just want a cut and will settle for a few hundred million? Perhaps. They do have that Glencore debt coming due in 2018, and the lawsuit may be their way to try and get money to pay that debt. A Hail Mary pass for sure. </p>

<p>If they don&#39;t back down and neither does Exxon, will the Chadian government use the military and exile Exxon and take over the equipment when Exxon refuses to pay? Or going even more deeply, is this lawsuit perhaps essentially Glencore kicking out Exxon, to gain control of the Chadian market? It would be great to find information on who funded and created the lawsuit, but it seems this information is hard to come by.  </p>

<p>This is where the story stands for now. I&#39;ve searched, and there seems to be a moratorium of news about this since the announcement of the lawsuit 6 months ago. The last I saw, Exxon was &quot;in talks&quot; with the Government of Chad. We will have to wait and see what happens next, but it&#39;s clear there&#39;s a strong division forming between Exxon and the Government of Chad, possibly being pushed by Glencore. </p>

<p>It seems that Chad is merely a plaything in games played by companies that are 10x bigger than countries. Reminds me of the British East India company, and how they essentially owned India for 100 years before the British Government actually stepped in and took ownership. But this is happening in 2017, and it&#39;s about oil. </p>

<p>This is called petro-imperialism. People often think of imperialism in the case of a nation conquering another nation with their army, but it also happens with companies. Companies that are even financially larger than nations, who hire mercenaries to defend their oil equipment and take over governments. </p>

<p>Ever wonder why they don&#39;t teach <em>this</em> in school? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t this also the case, that the UK monarchy basically still own/governs ALL african colonies such as Nigeria, which is also an important petrol exporter.</p>

<p>Also what about Royal Dutch Shell  ?</p>

<p>In addition to that what about Congo ?</p>

<p>Congo/Zaire was originally <strong>private</strong> property of Leopold II (King of Belgium), while the parliament was in control of Belgium.</p>

<p>Leopold II plundered it so extremely for ivory and rubber that parliament seized control of the Congo, but could that just have been a farce as well ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome! I&#39;m glad people are enjoying it and learning stuff. I learned a lot of this over just the last few days and I&#39;m happy to share it with my fellow information-explorers :) </p>

<p>Banana Republics are another great example that is historically recent. Or the Rothschild&#39;s company DeBeers owning Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). It happens all over the world, and once you see how big and obvious it is, you cannot un-see it. </p>

<p>They should honestly be teaching this stuff to 10 year olds, instead of burying it away so people don&#39;t figure it out until they&#39;re 30, if they figure it out at all. But we all know why it&#39;s hidden, because they don&#39;t want regular people knowing this stuff. Too bad for them, the internet exists now and all the hidden stuff is coming to light for everyone to see. It&#39;s amazing, and the transformative power on humanity could be absolutely amazing if we are diligent about sharing what we learn and taking those lessons to heart. I believe it can be done, even if only done by a portion of people it will still be helpful to the path of humanity. Time to air that dirty laundry so we can fix our mistakes. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just happy people care and maybe things will someday get better just because people better understand what&#39;s actually driving this crazy world of ours. The internet has such amazing potential, for the first time in 4 billion years we can really see all the information that is out there, and talk to anyone, across the whole world. It&#39;s astounding how this could potentially turn the tables on the status quo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m curious to read about how much it&#39;s helped the average Chadian. Apparently the IMF has anti-poverty measures in place in Chad to force this to happen, but who knows how well it&#39;s enforced or if it&#39;s actually beneficial in design in the first place. But it is there. Also seems to put Chad at odds with being able to pay off this $1.3 billion by 2018, so I imagine the govt is absolutely strapped for cash and has little control over itself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting point. I found this map of safety in chad from the French government international travel website, they usually have good maps: <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/jpg/19-05-2014_TCHAD-FCV_web__cle04bcbe.jpg">http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/jpg/19-05-2014_TCHAD-FCV_web__cle04bcbe.jpg</a></p>

<p>Basically all the borders are extremely unsafe, but then the inside is still pretty unsafe but not quite as bad as the borders. </p>

<p>This makes me want to watch youtube videos of travellers in chad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really impressive piece here, I&#39;m sure you could find these kind of relationships in many African nations sadly enough. The most newly emerged ones in the Horn are especially owned by investors; they have yet to explore potential petro/diamond/uranium etc resources and have no infrastructure. East Africa in particular is about to be rabidly devoured, the Great Rift&#39;s vast oil potential has finally been realized; clearly the next phase is to turn these nations into little Americas with highway systems and automobiles for everyone, funded by loans from Goldman Sachs:

    <div class="md"><p>The spark was a map on my feed that showed Asian countries with the flag of their biggest export partners, and I was very surprised by the fact Russia&#39;s biggest export partner was the Netherlands, I didn&#39;t even recognize the flag. Then I found out the NL having this huge refinery process.</p>

<p>I like to read about things I don&#39;t know too, so one day I picked a random african country I don&#39;t know anything about and read the wiki article. The oil stuff really jumped out at me, I had no idea it was 96% of their economy. </p>

<p>Then I tried to connect it to what I had just learned about the Netherlands, and I just kept digging in to the Exxon/Chevron story in Chad and it was so interesting I couldn&#39;t help but write an article about it. </p>

<p>I think equatorial guinea might be the next random country I look in to, someone pointed out they have a similar oil situation as Chad. It would be interesting to get a collection of these stories about countries being owned by companies, and then start connecting the even larger dots and show the true portfolios of these giant international companies. That&#39;s the end goal. </p>

<p>But basically I chose chad because I know nothing about it, and it seemed simple-ish to understand because it hasn&#39;t developed much and the economy is so homogeneous. </p>

<p>Good question, btw</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the GDP of Chad has increased from $1.3 Billion in 2001 to $11 Billion in 2015. Almost 10x in just 20 years. Pretty good!</p>

<p>vember 2016 the Chadian Government is now suing Exxon for $74 Billion. That is 5x the GDP of Chad. </p>

<p>maybe I&#39;m missing something, but these seem to be pretty glaring errors in your math.</p>
