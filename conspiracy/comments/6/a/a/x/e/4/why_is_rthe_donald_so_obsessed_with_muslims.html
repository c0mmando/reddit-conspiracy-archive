       I think the division of people in general is the direct intention of the NWO. No point pandering to them and giving in to the hate. Honestly, I don't care what you do, I will like or dislike you based off proven action, period. Isn't that a smarter way to look at hate/love?

       Islam is a invading force, explicitly stated. Try being a catholic, atheist, gay or a woman under Islamic rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mystical virtues of being a religion can't hide the fact it's a war cult started by a pedophile. And no, no other religion has been this bad for this long, so "muh Crusades" doesn't work, though Islam went looking for the trouble back then too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me started on the culturally ingrained child rape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Glad to discuss any of these issues in detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a Muslim as you appear to be then maybe start being honest about the problems in Islam. Only Muslims can reform it.

       Most Americans are killed by christians. The biggest wars have also been waged by christians.

       they may be normal people but they tolerate that shit. you don't see Christianity taking over America and executing all gays, nonbelievers, and heretics. or how about chopping off the hands of thieves or no rights what so ever to women. what about the normal occurrence of child brides. I understand that if they want that then they can do that but keep that shit out of the country I live in because it's barbaric and should not exist in the first world.

       i know it's not a monolith but there seems to be little work being done about reforming the religion granted that would take a long time but until then I'd rather have them not here until they reform or drop their religion or at the very least do a better job of integrating them into our society instead of letting them come to a country en masse and fucking the country up.

       It's only seemingly random if you are unaware of the historical relationship between Islam and Europeans. Scores of Europeans and Americans were kidnapped and sold into slavery by the Barbary Pirates. President Thomas Jefferson refused to pay tribute and this led to the Barbary war. Also the Crusades were a response to Christians being treated similarly. They're values are antithetical to the values of the West. Muslims are an existential threat to the West. If something seems like a "seemingly weird random obsession" then perhaps do a little technological spelunking before making biased judgements.

       The thing is some users thinking all Muslims are bad or out to get them. A large percent of Muslims are decent people trying to live their lives. There are many in higher education making some real contributions, it just gets drowned out by all the terrorism and other stuff.

       It is true that some people will overgeneralize. However, humans have evolved to focus on the threat and not the person minding their own business. A shockingly large percentage of the Muslim world supports the subjugation of non-believers, women and even other Muslims. This is a cause for concern. I don't think that most people have the verbal skills or education to make a logical point. They are expressing themselves to the best of their ability. Also, there are many people trolling and it helps to assume that is the case unless it is otherwise obvious.

       I can say that I am much, much more happy to be on the right than on the left at the moment. There is no 73 different fucking genders and the PC push is fucking stupid.

       In regards to muslims, not all are bad. I have quite a few muslim friends. With that being said, even my muslim friends tell me that their religion in no way is compatible with western society and they have no intentions of changing their views, beliefs etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is NOT with muslims. The problem is the clashing of ideologies. History shows that Christians and Catholics have been barbaric and, in a lot of ways still are, but Islamists have no wiggle room. The quran explicitly states to murder and kill disbelievers. It says that using tricks, lies etc to oust others is fine and acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to say the issue is with MUSLIMS is completely incorrect. To say the problem is Islam is ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see the influx of "refugees", mostly in europe, that are all males between 18-40 then you can see it is an invasion on incompatible ideologies and shit is going to go down no matter what you think.

       I will try to make this clear. Fundamentalism is way more common in Islam. There isn't really a thousand off shoots of the religion like Christianity. There are just a few Muslims types.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you understand that, it's time to understand Islam. The religion is based around the idea that there is nothing worse than not believing in Allah. The main goal of the religion is to convert everyone on earth like other popular religions. The only difference is that to Muslims it's okay to convert people be force.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll notice that no Muslim countries are considered modern civilizations. That's because of hard core beliefs like science is worthless (because allah knows better) and the punishment for leaving Islam is death.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the migrant crisis going on, Europe is being invaded by people from the third world that don't want to change their ways. So they are bring with them a barbaric culture where you can rape women and attack anyone you don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Effectively making Muslims the number 1 threat to the way we live.
