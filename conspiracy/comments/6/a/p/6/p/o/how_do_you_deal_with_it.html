       At first after realizing the truth about the globalist conspiracy, I actually lost friendships and I eventually got them back. Although I became a lot more cynical and paranoid about both people and politicians for the most part, I've become somewhat happy enjoying some time alone to the point I've started embracing loneliness and philosophy. How do you deal knowing the truth and how did that affect your relationships with others?

       i mean, who really knows what's going on?  the possibilities are endless. to some this is scary, to others it's hilarious.  try to have fun is the motto, and general ethic i live by.  this, in turn, informs ethical behaviour (you can't have optimal fun if you cant share it, for instance)...it's a very simple walk, really.  "mostly harmless" is how humans were once described.  sounds about right.

       I can tell you for sure that because of them, no nation in the world can achieve true independence. They fear all Nationalisms and if you love your home, knowing the truth can surely be painful, all the more if people don't believe you.

       i got that far that i give "hints" in directions. if some topic comes up i always let them tell their brainwashed opinion and then tell them "maybe, most likely, we cant know, can we?" they answer with "ye, true we really cant". "yep, they can tell us everything and we would believe it, wouldnt we?" "....ye actually we would..." they start to think twice then, introduce them to wikileaks right after or show them 1 piece or 2 and let them realize its no tinfoil shit.

       You have to ease people into the truth, if that's what you're looking to do. No one wants to be ridiculous, no one wants to believe their government is capable of being a corrupt fuckhole, and no one wants to be a spooky "conspiracy theorist." So naturally people are just gonna work themselves into a coma and die with a Coke in one hand and reality tv in the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Easing people into the truth is difficult but once you show someone something that was
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       obviously faked, like Sandy Hook for example- you start to see the gears in their heads working, wondering "holy shit if they can fake this they can lie about
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       !" and all of a sudden
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       not so crazy anymore.

       I like to think of life as the macrocosm and the microcosm.  The macro is global: politics, corruption, wars.  The micro is my village:  family, friends, work.  What's the point in worrying about the macro if your micro - what you have to deal with daily - is not... good, fun, nourishing?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am definitely the "nutty conspiracist" among my family and friends.  But I'm not trying to "wake" anyone up, no more than I'm trying to tell people who to vote for.  I don't know what the "truth" is any more than they or you do.  I have an idea of "truth" that may differ from theirs, but I don't
       <em>
        know for sure
       </em>
       (none of us do).  But when a conversation comes up where I can thoughtfully include what I've learned in my digging, I do.  And often times very interesting conversations ensue.  Because I'm trying to share &amp; educate, not change minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - Friendships and relationships are more important than being "right" or "waking people up".  Instead, take opportunities to share what you know when it comes up, and otherwise talk about what matters most in your micro - not what's terrible about the macro.

       Talk to the old-timers.  They remember what life was like in their day.  Talk to open minded people, they are out there.  I like to make jokes to feel people out, like "wow, that flu shot last year really took me out for a couple weeks, so I skipped it this year.  I can't figure out if it was the aluminum or the fetus cells."
      </p>
      <p>
       But pretty much I just live my life.  I work summers, play winters, have no money, catch fish and eat it, drive my skiff, throw frisbees for dogs, burn firewood, pick berries, play with my baby, build things, talk to people, ride my bike, walk backroads, let the baby stomp in mud puddles, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a bike for sure.  So much better than driving or walking.  It's like Goldilocks would say, not too fast, not too slow, just right.

       Get a dog. Man's best friend. Go to the shelter and save one. Before it's too late, and appreciate your new friend with walks, fetch, belly rubs, snacks, and nice place to sleep near you.

       I've been into conspiracies for about fifteen years now but I only took a deep dive into the rabbit hole over the past year. My close friends and husband know that I've been 'into' this stuff for a long time and I tend to send them links/articles/videos on a regular basis so they got used to it and kind of expect it now. I did manage to 'wake up' my best friend and open his eyes to the corruption of the world (and more) over the past few months which has been nice. He used to not take me very seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't bother sharing much with friends I'm not very close with. They seem set in their ways and we've had political arguments before because they don't realize that democrats and republicans are two sides of the same coin and that we're being ruled by psychopaths. Or maybe they do realize but the cognitive dissonance tends to be strong on this one. They'll hopefully eventually wake up on their own. It's not up to me this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking about things shared on this forum with other people can be incredibly frustrating and disheartening. I think it's best to do it in small spurts. Or maybe only attempt it with people you're close to for a little while and see how that goes. I despair a lot about the things I know but I try my best to keep going. We're all in this together. 💪

       Meh at least your best friend believes you and you can share your thoughts with him. I don't know I just dedicate myself to training and studying so I can one day help or even face them myself.

       It has to be done in steps. I guess I was lucky because I started talking about this stuff to my friend during the US primary last year and was able to open my friend's eyes to the DNC's blatant corruption. Everything after that followed suit.

       I abandoned my Facebook page.  None of my hundreds of friends / family ever took any interest the red-pilling I was trying to accomplish.  It just caught me criticism and put stress on relationships (like you said).  Now I try to enlighten in more subtle
 ways, one-on-one only.

      <p>
       It's tough, knowing most of your relatives think you're bonkers.  I just stopped broadcasting.

         Go low key on FB. Delete the apps from your phone and dial back the notifications so you only receive email updates from close friends or family members you're interested in.

         Maintain perspective. Never forget that the media promotes whatever gets clicks, views, or viewership - humanity in general is in one of its least violent periods, and people are generally decent.

         Don't fall into ideological traps. When you're emerging from an intellectually somnambulant state it's easy to get sidetracked- it's unsettling to feel untethered to what you believed was a bedrock reality, and normal to want to quickly replace it.

         Get used to being at slightly uncomfortable or unsettled all the time. To me it's a feeling akin to not being sure if you turned the oven off and have no way of checking. Things are not OK and they probably won't be in our lifetimes.

         As an empathetic person, it's hard to process what the psychopaths in charge are doing to your fellow human beings. Do what you can in your own way using whatever means you can spare to help a victim. You nourish at least two souls when you do so - theirs and yours.

         Be ready for the critical moment of clarity and know when to take action. Until then, when people express a sleeper's view of the world, ask gentle but leading questions. Help them reach their own conclusions about the state of things. Comfort them. Allow them to grieve for the loss of the dream state, as you are doing right now.
