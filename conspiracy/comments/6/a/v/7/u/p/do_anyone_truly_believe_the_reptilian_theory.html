    <div class="md"><p>I do because my wife&#39;s a lizard.</p>

<p>Let me explain...</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t shape-shifting lizard-people. There are people with lizard blood. The rhesus factor is what got people talking about how humans were evolved from monkeys (I&#39;m simplifying - this isn&#39;t &quot;ask science&quot;) but a small percentage of the population do not have this factor. That&#39;s where the positive and negative comes in with blood types. Our blood (us monkey people) is iron based and has a red color. They (the reptilians) have copper based blood which has a bluish tint when it dries. This is where we get the phrase &quot;blue bloods&quot;. </p>

<p>When a monkey-man and a reptilian mix their blood together it curdles. This is why native Americans used to cut their hands and do the &#39;blood brother&#39; handshake. To see if the blood curdled. For this reason reptilians have a hard time getting pregnant and when they do get pregnant by a monkey their body tries to reject the baby so they must get a RhoGAM shot. When these babies are born the hospitals treat the umbilical cord like it&#39;s made out of gold and most governments have a registry to keep track of Rh negatives. </p>

<p>Read more <a href="http://www.rhnegativeregistry.com/Rh_Negative_Facts_Fiction_Origin_Personality.html">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>You can recognize a reptilian because they almost always have green eyes, have no wisdom teeth, are usually missing a vertebrate, and have low blood pressure. They have a hard time caring about anybody but themselves but they scare easily and are always worried about something.  </p>

<p>Because they don&#39;t really care about other people but are not actually sociopathic they make great leaders and a lot of the ruling class in Europe in the past have been these &quot;lizards&quot;.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The A or B or O have nothing to do with the Rhesus factor. It&#39;s the positive or negative that determines it. You can have A+, B+, and O+ which are all monkey blood types or you could have A-, B-, or O- which are all lizard blood types. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why even buy into the whole reptile/mammal dichotomy if the terms were arbitrary, and not to mention, wholly looked down upon in today&#39;s perception? Like if it&#39;s not genetic, or evolutionary, and there aren&#39;t people who are literally descended from reptiles, why not just try to draw attention to the fundamental differences in the character epxressed by those with the differing blood types and use new names like &quot;copper-blooded&quot;, or something, you&#39;d probably be better at naming them.

<p>I remember stumbling upon a Stratfor email that discussed interbreeding, and how that the rumors of royalties trying to breed reptilian bloodlines were somewhat factual. I wouldn&#39;t know where to find it if asked for the source and unfortunately, some Stratfor emails contain malware that I&#39;m convinced f&#39;ed with my old computer... so I don&#39;t want to go looking for it again.</p>

<p>But it was in an attachment, and it was back when I was going down a very big rabbit hole about Albanian dragon bloodlines and how Thaci was deemed &quot;the snake.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah, this was an interesting read. I guess I can kind of confirm, hahah. I&#39;m an &#39;O neg&#39; woman in her late twenties. I also have green eyes, very low blood pressure, only had one wisdom tooth (must be my monkey dad&#39;s doing, lol), I scare very easily and I&#39;m definitely always worrying/despairing about something or another. I do have high empathy levels and genuinely care about people, however. Must be the &#39;cancer&#39; part of me.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, I somehow ended up with another lizard. He&#39;s probably the most selfless person I&#39;ve ever met so neither of us fit the &#39;not caring&#39; description it seems. We both get called on a lot to donate blood. It&#39;s strange to think that my body won&#39;t try and kill the baby if I ever get pregnant. </p>

<p>Kind of creepy that the government keeps track of Rh negatives. Not surprised in the least, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are exceptions to every rule.</p>

<p>If two lizards conceive a child you usually don&#39;t have to worry about your body rejecting it, but you will have a difficult time conceiving. If you have green eyes and brown hair you could go your whole life believing you are infertile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do have green eyes and brown hair. Spooky. I&#39;m not even sure if I want kids though my husband would like to have at least one eventually. I&#39;ll definitely be holding onto this info. Thanks so much for sharing! I have a lot of research to do now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting. I have very green eyes, low blood pressure, no wisdom teeth. I have O- blood type, which I hear is rare, my ex consistently tried to have a child with me and I never got pregnant (thank god I hate kids) I have severe anxiety and borderline personality disorder. I am selfish but I do have empathy for certain people and I have intense love for my boyfriend and animals. I&#39;m also rather empathetic and positive, I&#39;m always the optimist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. So i dont disagree with you. My moms side of the family is odd. Like thelemic practices and kabbalah odd... Auburn red hair all that. There are the claims of witch craft rituals and powers. My mother though being o positive. She is in a way &quot;gifted&quot; and high anxiety. We have brown eyes and brown hair with auburn highlights that bleach with salt and sun. Any vacation to cali i would come back with different hair. I think theres something about the rh negative and even other blood types idk about lizards though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe. But I do wonder if a reptilian apex intelligent race couldn&#39;t have evolved out of the dinosaur eras? I mean, it&#39;s crossed my mind in fun. That is alot of millions of years, and there was a ton of species diversity, why couldn&#39;t evolution have thrown another intelligent species?</p>

<p>Fun stuff</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>The Real Truth:</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose. Then the Lord said, &quot;My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years.&quot; *</em>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them*<em>. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.&quot;</em>
- Genesis 6:1‭-‬4 ESV</p>

<p>&quot;Sons of God&quot; = Fallen Angels</p>

<p>Bloodline of Human/Spirit (angel) that is a genetic hybrid abomination that has been passed down, preserved, and inter-bred among the ruling luciferian elite. AKA - The Serpent Seed</p>

<p>This is part of the reason why Jesus Christs bloodline is perfectly recorded in the Bible (line of king David is pureblood)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Urantia book.<br/>
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=urantia+creation+of+humanity">https://www.google.com/search?q=urantia+creation+of+humanity</a><br/>
&#39;&#39;The Urantia Book (sometimes called the Urantia Papers or The Fifth Epochal Revelation) is a spiritual and philosophical book that originated in Chicago sometime between 1924 and 1955. The authorship remains a matter of speculation.&#39;&#39;<br/>
A very weird and mysterious book about a group of higher level beings seeding the Earth [Urantia] with life, as one of a myriad of petri dish experiments.<br/>
A small cult of unknown .... well, I have no idea what they&#39;re about.<br/>
My story;  I was selling quartz crystals in 1986, from a blanket on the sidewalk on 2nd ave in NYC. A homeless black dude came and sat with me and started by calling me by name, and telling me about myself, accurately. A very shiny friendly dude.  He recommended I get the Urantia book, among others. He told me East/West Books would have it. I asked there and the clerk said it wasn&#39;t listed. hmm<br/>
I figured out who the manager was, while browsing the store. I asked if he was the Mngr, he said yes. &#39;&#39;Do you have the Urantia book here?&#39;&#39;<br/>
He said &#39;&#39;Who told you about that book?&#39;&#39;<br/>
I told him of the psychic homeless guy. Mngr said &#39;&#39;I have a copy in back, and I am going to give you my manager&#39;s discount, 40% off.&#39;&#39;<br/>
Then he told me about forming a new freemasonry for the underclass to rival the upper class, and a Rosicrucian org to do the same, b;ah blah blah.<br/>
I balked at joining. Then he wrote down an address,and his name, and told me to go to this library, and with his name, I can join as a member for free.<br/>
And that is how I learned about Lucis Trust, and the Arcane library.<br/>
1986, I literally stumbled into the power elite cult, from digging up rocks and selling them on the sidewalk.<br/>
What a day. <a href="https://www.lucistrust.org/arcane_school/library/new_york_headquarters_library">https://www.lucistrust.org/arcane_school/library/new_york_headquarters_library</a><br/>
Occult everywhere, thousands and thousands of books, weird grinning New Age people, like HOLY FUCK WHAT IS THIS? in my 1986 mind.<br/>
Then.....I found the one section not about occult or esoterica.<br/>
The United Nations section, filled with hundreds of publications.<br/>
The staff guy came over and told me about the wonderful relationship Lucis Trust has had with the UN, listing officials who were members, openly spelling it  out to me. &#39;&#39;We built the meditation room, and run the World Goodwill program, sending out Goodwill Ambassadors.....&#39;&#39;<br/>
If you sign up with them, they are very inviting,and no pressure. They&#39;ll mail and email all sorts of stuff to you, inviting you to weird events.<br/>
I visited the library plenty, but never attended an event.<br/>
I have never in the rest of my life been able to convince one person to go and have a look.<br/>
Everyone near NYC on this sub should have a look.<br/>
Imagine how lonely it was to know things in 1986. LOL<br/>
I&#39;m grateful for this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they are absolutely real.</p>

<p>But asking for &#39;proof&#39; is misunderstanding the nature of multi-dimensional reality on earth.</p>

<p>There are many beings that exist beyond the vibrational spectrum of human eyes, ears, touch. That does not mean they are not real. There are house pets that can &#39;see&#39; more than humans for example</p>

<p>How do I know these thing are real? Personal experience. I have not personally seen a reptilians - but I have seen a Grey. And I have seen orbs, and humanoid ETs up close. I have a close family member who has a fully opened third eye chakra and can see all of these beings and more - including Reptilians.</p>

<p>Regardless of the matter of shapeshifters, they are incarnated into the bloodline families and other positions of power, including military and law enforcement. Just as there are positive ET groups incarnated into physical form.</p>
