Just looking at it in terms of sports there is no way, we were almost identical, we are still &quot;brothers&quot; today.

<p>Well if you really want to know last year I tried to take my own life, I was getting divorced and in the army and chose to opt out. I&#39;ve been on anti depressants ever since, a really high dosage, almost a half gram a day, but I always quit taking them when I run out and I&#39;m still here and I guess they work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve been through so much. Anti-depressants do work, but they have side effects too (sometimes).</p>

<p>Have you tried adding magnesium to your diet or taking it through supplements? That seems to help some people. It&#39;s natural, so it can&#39;t hurt.</p>

<p>Magnesium is in Epsom Salt too. Once a week, my son takes a bath in warm water and Epsom Salt. He will soak for 30 minutes. The magnesium soaks through your pores, so you can benefit from it that way.</p>

<p>Many athlete&#39;s do this for aches and pains too.</p>
