    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a Clinton fan, but this went on under his watch:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Things looked bleak until <em>North Korea asked to meet with the U.S. government to settle their disputes.</em> The Clinton administration agreed—on the condition that the IAEA have all they access it had sought. North Korea eventually agreed. In turn the administration <strong>called off annual war games with South Korea</strong>—North Korea had insisted on that—and began negotiations. Clinton also conditioned the talks on continued IAEA access and North Korean negotiations with South Korea.</p>

<p>Under the resulting &quot;Agreed Framework,&quot; North Korea <em>would convert its nuclear industry from heavy- to light-water reactors for power generation.</em> In the meantime the U.S. government would provide it oil for heat and electricity. In addition the governments would normalize political and economic relations, and the U.S. government would forswear the use of nuclear weapons against North Korea, which would remain a party to the NPT, with all this implied for IAEA inspections.</p>

<p>All of this was most promising. North Korean froze its plutonium program beyond Clinton&#39;s tenure, until 2002, and the administration, writes historian Bruce Cumings, &quot;in October 2000, had indirectly worked out a deal to buy all of its medium- and long-range missiles. Clinton also signed an agreement with Gen. Jo Myong-rok stating that henceforth, neither country would bear &#39;hostile intent&#39; toward the other.&quot;</p>

<p>However, as Fareed Zakaria writes, &quot;the brief effort at cooperation during the Clinton years was halfhearted, with Washington failing to fulfill some of its promises to North Korea. In any event, the rapprochement was <em>quickly reversed by the George W. Bush administration</em>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone with Korean in-laws within artillery range, I&#39;d have liked Kim to have sold off his nukes and missiles 15 years ago.</p>

<p>They were said to have been <strong>reporting on</strong> <em>the trafficking of women</em>...</p>

<p>According to Kim Tae-woo of the Korea Institute for Defense Analysis, a South Korean institute, &quot;<em>[t]he journalists considerably weakened their government&#39;s leverage against the North</em>&quot; in ongoing negotiations over the DPRK&#39;s nuclear program.[26] William Stanton, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Seoul, reportedly expressed a similar but stronger view, <em>calling the two journalists &quot;stupid&quot; and arguing that their arrest was &quot;distracting from bigger issues</em>&quot; in April 8 remarks to several U.S. congressional staff visiting South Korea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of thoughts:</p>

<p>One, NK is just a scare tactic used to build support for huge levels of military spending.</p>

<p>Two, every year US + SK have a huge wargame that simulates an attack and overthrow of the NK government. This usually happens in March and is timed to coincide with NK harvest season. It&#39;s deliberate timing because that&#39;s the time of year when the most men are needed for farm labor.</p>

<p>NK always responds to this exercise with threats and (sometimes) missile or nuclear tests.</p>

<p>We get intensive coverage of their missile/nuke tests... and complete silence on the huge military drill that sets them off in the first place.</p>
