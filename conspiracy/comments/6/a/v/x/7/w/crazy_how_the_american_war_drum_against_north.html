       I'm not a Clinton fan, but this went on under his watch:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Things looked bleak until
        <em>
         North Korea asked to meet with the U.S. government to settle their disputes.
        </em>
        The Clinton administration agreed—on the condition that the IAEA have all they access it had sought. North Korea eventually agreed. In turn the administration
        <strong>
         called off annual war games with South Korea
        </strong>
        —North Korea had insisted on that—and began negotiations. Clinton also conditioned the talks on continued IAEA access and North Korean negotiations with South Korea.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the resulting "Agreed Framework," North Korea
        <em>
         would convert its nuclear industry from heavy- to light-water reactors for power generation.
        </em>
        In the meantime the U.S. government would provide it oil for heat and electricity. In addition the governments would normalize political and economic relations, and the U.S. government would forswear the use of nuclear weapons against North Korea, which would remain a party to the NPT, with all this implied for IAEA inspections.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of this was most promising. North Korean froze its plutonium program beyond Clinton's tenure, until 2002, and the administration, writes historian Bruce Cumings, "in October 2000, had indirectly worked out a deal to buy all of its medium- and long-range missiles. Clinton also signed an agreement with Gen. Jo Myong-rok stating that henceforth, neither country would bear 'hostile intent' toward the other."
       </p>
       <p>
        However, as Fareed Zakaria writes, "the brief effort at cooperation during the Clinton years was halfhearted, with Washington failing to fulfill some of its promises to North Korea. In any event, the rapprochement was
        <em>
         quickly reversed by the George W. Bush administration
        </em>
        ."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As someone with Korean in-laws within artillery range, I'd have liked Kim to have sold off his nukes and missiles 15 years ago.

         calling the two journalists "stupid" and arguing that their arrest was "distracting from bigger issues

       A couple of thoughts:
      </p>
      <p>
       One, NK is just a scare tactic used to build support for huge levels of military spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two, every year US + SK have a huge wargame that simulates an attack and overthrow of the NK government. This usually happens in March and is timed to coincide with NK harvest season. It's deliberate timing because that's the time of year when the most men are needed for farm labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       NK always responds to this exercise with threats and (sometimes) missile or nuclear tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       We get intensive coverage of their missile/nuke tests... and complete silence on the huge military drill that sets them off in the first place.

       But is has a long-lasting effect.
       <br/>
       The majority of the population of the U.S. thinks NK is a belligerent unpredictable threat to the world that needs to be dealt with.
       <br/>
       Because of this steady propaganda campaign, the corporate-military-intelligence complex will encounter essentially no opposition or outcry when military action is taken against NK.

       You're right but not at the same time. I think humans are so much more powerful than we know, especially on a unified front. I don't think political change will come from expecting the status quo to change; we have to be the change. It's not easy and I don't know exactly how to do that on the political stage... but i think it's a defeatist attitude to say shit is stacked against us.
