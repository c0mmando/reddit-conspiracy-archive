       Sometimes they just cover it up by making them super poppy, too; not just by coming from super cookie cutter to rebellious all of a sudden. One Direction has some "naughty" stuff on their first album but you don't think about it too much because of how it sounds and because of the supposed target audience.

       Another case of misinterpreting what was said by somebody. He never said he
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       grab someone by the pussy, he just said he
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       , and he's right. There are loads of self-loathing women who will willingly throw themselves at somebody rather physically unattractive in order to get the taste of a billionaire lifestyle. I dated a pretty well-known Indy car driver for a brief period of time and the amount of debauchery was...ridiculous. Don't underestimate what some women want. Some of them are despicable.

       You mean there's a hidden meaning behind someone being marketed to young people then as they grow old with their fan base, they must continue to generate attention by changing their persona, appealing to an older audience and continuing to stay in the public limelight in order to create media publicity and have them not fade into obscurity?

       or maybe you're overreacting a little? Nothing they're doing or singnig about is even remotely satanic or extreme. Casual drug use, sex, doing stupid/reckless things? that's called being a teen in america.

      <p>
       They're also not even the ones who decide what goes in the videos most of the time, its the director/producer slipping in the illuminati references, so if anything your beef is with them.

       Katy Perry's newest video is literally a video about cannibalism and human sacrifice. Totally no satanic themes there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And once again, you're wrong. Teens have always been rebellious, but have you seen teens today? They're not like teens from the 70s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rebellious isn't smoking a joint anymore, it's being 12 and wearing booty shorts and smoking weed every day and looking up to people like Kim Kardashian.

       You realize in the 70s that if you said "have you seen the teens today, they're not like the teens from the 30s" you'd have entirely correct?  And further that if in the 30s you'd said "have you seen the teens today, they're not like the teens from the 1890s" you'd also have been correct?

       It sound like you're inferring that educated people are idiots because they paid for an education and owe money. Then you seem to blame poor people getting tricked by banks into buying homes with shady agreements that inflated their rates at a speed so fast and amounts so hefty that no one could pay, causing the largest financial crisis of our time. It not only bankrupted the home loan defaulters, but the entire fucking economy. The government not only didn't punish the banks for it, they bailed them out with taxpayer money. And you're blaming the poor suckers who were sold a dream. Wow. Your ignorance is really, disheartening.

       Because the poor tale you told is the universal story of every debtor right? Plenty of people borrow money with no intent on paying it back. And no not all educated people. But some. Plenty with tons of book smart yet zero common sense ready to believe any horseshit the media sensationalizes. Their ignorance and placidity is partially why we are all in this giant shit storm now. They just sat by and consumed like leeches while the worst of societies parasites have taken over. I have zero sympathy for those who recklessly consume and live above their means. My inbred family taught me even if your making 5 million live live like you only make 250k. Its not just the poor one who are stupid either. Have you ever worked for a collection agency or are you just being a good little hipster and fighting the man? Because as a collector i saw none of that sap story and a whole lot of 30k millionaires living life like they dont care. Until the boat they show off on FB gets repoed. The ones i dealt with were majority jack asses who got that magic plastic card and started swiping away with no forethought of "i may have to pay this back huh"

       Child stars have young fans. The stars go through puberty. So do their fans. They become sexually interested and express themselves through their work. One thing every generation of aging people seems to have in common is a feeling that those darn teenagers are devil worshipping sexual deviants. The teenagers rub it in their faces because they're rebelling, as most teenagers do. Sexual expression is normal, and the "satanic" crap is only huge to people who were brainwashed as kids by silly religious ideas invented to keep the peons obedient. You sound like you're coming from a place of religious extremity where sex is evil and the devil is to blame for human suffering instead of the humans.

       Yeah, there's a big difference between a 12 year old and a 16 year old. That change happens over just a few short years. Pop stars go through the same changes and need to keep connecting with their audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that people change a lot during pubery doesn't have to have anything to do with satanism, cults, and uman sacrifice.

       The demographic of kids who watched Hannah Montana grew up and don't watch it anymore, she got older too, so her marketing team decided to repackage her with a more edgy adult gimmick where she gets sexual and sticks her tongue out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really see a big conspiracy there, its just changing someone's style to cater to their teen fanbase who aren't little kids anymore. Britney Spears did the same thing once she got a little too old to be singing about a high school crush.

       Thus theredpill (sub); though generally marriage is ill advised (I personally wouldn't do it in Australia either), the lessons of that sub can be applied for men to lead successful marriages.

       I think they get manipulated and marketed that way... but also it coincides with them going through puberty and what parental/support system they have around them....young Disney stars get older..and like most people between 17-25...sex is on the brain 24/7.......I think if I went from 13-19 starting as sweet kid and evolving to a horny 19yr old...then throw fame,power and an unlimited bank account behind it....there'd be some headlines I'd regret down the road.

       This one's pretty straightforward: sex sells. A child star can only be marketed towards children, but once they're an adult the easiest way to market them towards adult is through sex appeal. It has nothing to do with trying to make kids horny, it only has to do with what makes the most money.

       This doesn't have to be a nefarious scheme. Miley Cyrus growing up had every choice made for her. Disney decided on her hair cut, what she could wear in public, everything about her appearance and image was controlled because Disney owned Hannah Montana.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then her 'shocking' appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards happened, and for days she was the most discussed celebrity in the world. It was about marketing, advertising and rebranding, and also about rebelling against everything that kept her controlled as a teenager. Hannah Montana had to be wholesome? She became a sex symbol and twerked against Thicke. She had to have a certain haircut before? Now she's going to shave her head.

       You all are acting like the existence of patriarchal capitalism is some Illuminati ass shit you're all uncovering for the first time.  That's you're somehow to only people who have ever pierced the veil and realized that pop stars are manufactured by the record industry.  No shit there is a formula to use to manufacture pop stars, the world is full of books written by former record label executives talking about the formula they use to manufacture pop stars.  It isn't some nefarious scheme, it's just a bunch of (mostly white, mostly old dudes) making money off of music by exploiting women and ripping off black people.

       I agree to an extent, especially for Miley.  Ariana really hasn't gone too crazy into sexual stuff.  I think Miley wanted to shed her good girl Disney image and she also got into drugs.  Whether it was planned or not I think you could argue either way.  Britney and Christina Aquilera are good examples of what you're saying for sure though.

       Am not remotely religious but here's my take on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US was historically mostly Christian. The entertainment industry is mostly Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jewish people aren't big fans of Christians but mostly, they don't abide to 'sin' the same way Christians do, so they have no problem selling sin', which is generally really profitable if you're peddling to the youth markets where they're not highly religious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sex sells because it's controversial due to the US Christian base having a lot of hang ups about sex, so they freak out, which drives up controversy, and sales.

       Both Hanlon's and Occam's Razors tell me that, at least for the majority of these cases, it's much easier to see this as a matter of becoming a part of the Hollywood society than anything directed specifically upon the celebrities.  There could be direction of the culture, but it really doesn't appear authoritarian in nature.  Cultural inertia in a sphere of ideologues who are continually unhappy with their lives fits the bill much better.  (It also explains why Scientology uses the particular methods they do.)

       This is how PR works under18 and you have to present a certain image once they hit 18 their PR agents literally tell them to go get into trouble, to make a spectacle of themselves and cast off their little kid image to generate free press and create a new image.

       These are just a few of the heavy hitters, but in reality most pop music is manufactured in board meetings. Just look at the reach something like
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHeartMedia">
        Clear Channel
       </a>
       has. Since they changed their name to "iHeartMedia" they have continued the same shady and overreaching bullshit they have always pulled with our media.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're asking the wrong questions, and being misled in the exact way you're supposed to. Fuck the musicians, who cares what they do. The real culprits are those actually in charge of our media.

       But interestingly the music industry social conditioning could be a thing. Since the rap industry had closed doors meeting and they changed rap from being anti establishment to violence and hos n shit. THere was a video posted on here about it years ago. And rightfully so it made sense because back in early 90s rap was wholesome it discussed issues and pointed to injustices int eh world. Then it was flipped out of nowhere. Ad this intellectual problem discussing music turned into crap of drug,, guns and gangster rap. The reasons were to curb anti establishment movements (as they are always being shutdown) and promote violence int he lower classes, a strong link to prison industrial complex is inferred in that.
