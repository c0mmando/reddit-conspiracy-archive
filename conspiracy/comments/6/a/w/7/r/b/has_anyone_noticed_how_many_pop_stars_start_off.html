    <div class="md"><p>Another case of misinterpreting what was said by somebody. He never said he <em>did</em> grab someone by the pussy, he just said he <em>could</em>, and he&#39;s right. There are loads of self-loathing women who will willingly throw themselves at somebody rather physically unattractive in order to get the taste of a billionaire lifestyle. I dated a pretty well-known Indy car driver for a brief period of time and the amount of debauchery was...ridiculous. Don&#39;t underestimate what some women want. Some of them are despicable. </p>

Their ignorance and placidity is partially why we are all in this giant shit storm now. They just sat by and consumed like leeches while the worst of societies parasites have taken over. I have zero sympathy for those who recklessly consume and live above their means. My inbred family taught me even if your making 5 million live live like you only make 250k. Its not just the poor one who are stupid either. Have you ever worked for a collection agency or are you just being a good little hipster and fighting the man? Because as a collector i saw none of that sap story and a whole lot of 30k millionaires living life like they dont care. Until the boat they show off on FB gets repoed.

A child star can only be marketed towards children, but once they&#39;re an adult the easiest way to market them towards adult is through sex appeal.

<p>Then her &#39;shocking&#39; appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards happened, and for days she was the most discussed celebrity in the world. It was about marketing, advertising and rebranding, and also about rebelling against everything that kept her controlled as a teenager. Hannah Montana had to be wholesome? She became a sex symbol and twerked against Thicke. She had to have a certain haircut before? Now she&#39;s going to shave her head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am not remotely religious but here&#39;s my take on this.</p>

<p>The US was historically mostly Christian. The entertainment industry is mostly Jewish.</p>

<p>Jewish people aren&#39;t big fans of Christians but mostly, they don&#39;t abide to &#39;sin&#39; the same way Christians do, so they have no problem selling sin&#39;, which is generally really profitable if you&#39;re peddling to the youth markets where they&#39;re not highly religious.</p>

<p>Sex sells because it&#39;s controversial due to the US Christian base having a lot of hang ups about sex, so they freak out, which drives up controversy, and sales.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 1999, Martin has written and co-written 22 Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits (most of which he has also produced or co-produced) in the United States, including Katy Perry&#39;s &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; (2008), Maroon 5&#39;s &quot;One More Night&quot; (2012), Taylor Swift&#39;s &quot;Blank Space&quot; (2014) and The Weeknd&#39;s &quot;Can&#39;t Feel My Face&quot; (2015). Martin is the songwriter with the third-most number one singles on the chart, behind only Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of January 2011, he has garnered 21 Top 40 Billboard Hot 100 singles, becoming the producer with the third most such hits since the charts were created.</p>

<p>Wells has songs on over 85 million units sold. He has produced and written with Katy Perry, Keith Urban, Adele, Mayer Hawthorne, Twenty One Pilots, Rufus Wainwright, Theophilus London, Weezer, Kid Cudi, OneRepublic, Grace VanderWaal, Dua Lipa, Ariana Grande, Kelly Clarkson, Pink, Pharrell Williams, Holychild, Ella Eyre, The All American Rejects, Otep, Deftones, Aerosmith, Burt Bacharach, Celine Dion, Crash Test Dummies, Elton John, Jars of Clay, and the Count Basie Orchestra.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the heavy hitters, but in reality most pop music is manufactured in board meetings. Just look at the reach something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHeartMedia">Clear Channel</a> has. Since they changed their name to &quot;iHeartMedia&quot; they have continued the same shady and overreaching bullshit they have always pulled with our media. </p>

<p>You&#39;re asking the wrong questions, and being misled in the exact way you&#39;re supposed to. Fuck the musicians, who cares what they do. The real culprits are those actually in charge of our media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the logic leaps in OPs argument. I mean as the stars age, so do their audience. </p>

<p>But interestingly the music industry social conditioning could be a thing. Since the rap industry had closed doors meeting and they changed rap from being anti establishment to violence and hos n shit. THere was a video posted on here about it years ago. And rightfully so it made sense because back in early 90s rap was wholesome it discussed issues and pointed to injustices int eh world. Then it was flipped out of nowhere. Ad this intellectual problem discussing music turned into crap of drug,, guns and gangster rap. The reasons were to curb anti establishment movements (as they are always being shutdown) and promote violence int he lower classes, a strong link to prison industrial complex is inferred in that. </p>
