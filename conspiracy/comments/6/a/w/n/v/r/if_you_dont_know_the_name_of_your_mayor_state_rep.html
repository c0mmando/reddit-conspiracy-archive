       Getting fucked over by your elected officials is a real and unfortunately very common problem. It's also very easy to cast blame to the top of the totem pole, but in reality, using your voice/vote to express dissent is exponentially dimished by being lost in a sea of our culture of ignorance and apathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tyranny works from the top down due to consolidation of power. However, institutional change doesn't work that way, and must come from the bottom up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone knows the two party system is fucked, but the only times that alternatives are offered and heard about are in Presidential elections, where third parties have no real chance of getting more than about 10% of voters to align with their platforms. If alternative parties, or even better, independent non-partisan candidates were to start sowing the seeds of legitimacy at the more local levels, there might be some hope for us yet.

       I'd say even if you do know their names, stop acting like who the president is matters much to your life. As usual they were two sides of the same corporatist coin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shocking thing is how personally people take it all, like people ending friendships or relationships over it or stopping talking to family members over political arguments. isn't that what they want? having us at eachothers throats instead of at theirs.

       Of course that's what the ever-elusive  "they" wants. What I'm suggesting though, is that you'd be much more likely to get a few thousand people to understand the power they wield than you would with damn near 400 million, and if you can drive the point home that legislation is where the real action is, that may at least get the ball rolling.
      </p>

       As far as the division and passion behind it, well... cult of personality is a bitch. It wouldn't be so bad if people understood that those feelings they hold so dear have been sold to them and cultivated, but ultimately hold no substance at their roots.

       It REALLY doesn't matter though. Zionists have the entire election process bottled up. I'm not demoralizing or anything -quite the opposite - but it truthfully doesn't matter because you cannot become president in this country if you are not a part of their club.

       This was evidenced in Ron Paul's un in 2012. Look no further than that to see HOW this is the case.

       The president sets the tone for our country, and when you have a president saying outright sexist and racist comments, it penalizes them and makes people more likely to speak on their hateful thoughts. Just look at the video of the guy at the beach harassing a Muslim family because he "rejects Sharia law", or the woman in the grocery store who tells a random Muslim girl that she shouldn't be allowed in.

       Health care is by far the single most important political issue in my life. That is decided by Congress, with the president having veto power and a ton of influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It
       <em>
        very much
       </em>
       matters to me who is president and what they do.

       That said, I know my local politicians, too. One difference being, I can move to a different state or city pretty easily. Moving to a different country is far, far more difficult.

       I think the most likely way that they get put away is by using the same tactic used on us. Division and dilution. The more people that are involved in an election/referendum, the more divided they tend to be, and ultimately ineffective. Likewise, the more options for candidates we have weakens the chance for any particular one (or just two in our case) to use consolidation of power to advance their agendas. It's being run and sold as if it were a monopoly, but in reality there are tons of other local options that given enough support, could eventually capture a respectable market share. For example, imagine what would happen to Walmart if people stopped going there and went to Kroger, Ingles, Bilo, King Sooper, Safeway, and the likes instead.

       As for Tulsi, I haven't decided how I feel about her at this point. True, the media could/would blackball her, but again, her scope of influence as far as I'm concerned equates to me as crossing that bridge when I get to it. I live in a state that pays Lindsey Graham a salary, and I'm more in opposition to that alone than I would be in support of her political aspirations.

       True that, we won't start to get a different kind of politician, one that really puts the people first, from the top down it has to start at a local level. This is still a democracy and even if the ever elusive "they" try to subvert our democracy they'll eventually be exposed. Keep voting USA. The ones who would make you think you can't change the system are the ones who don't want it to change.

       Honestly social media websites like FB or IRL interactions are going to be better for local elections than Reddit is. Don't let OP make you feel bad for wanting a real choice for president, especially here on Reddit where the system inherently works better for national elections.
      </p>

       We were cheated out of an option in 2016 when the DNC rigged the primaries against Sanders and elevated Trump, but the emperor has no clothes. We live in a society that now has more access to information than we've ever had before; and thanks to WikiLeaks, millions of people have finally found what a sham this system really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have to do is organize. I've started at

       .
      </p>

       Oh... and the president has more powers than a local politician could ever dream of. We are talking about saving human lives and OP can fuck off imo if they want to discourage us from saving people.
