        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Getting fucked over by your elected officials is a real and unfortunately very common problem. It&#39;s also very easy to cast blame to the top of the totem pole, but in reality, using your voice/vote to express dissent is exponentially dimished by being lost in a sea of our culture of ignorance and apathy.</p>

<p>Tyranny works from the top down due to consolidation of power. However, institutional change doesn&#39;t work that way, and must come from the bottom up.</p>

<p>Everyone knows the two party system is fucked, but the only times that alternatives are offered and heard about are in Presidential elections, where third parties have no real chance of getting more than about 10% of voters to align with their platforms. If alternative parties, or even better, independent non-partisan candidates were to start sowing the seeds of legitimacy at the more local levels, there might be some hope for us yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course that&#39;s what the ever-elusive  &quot;they&quot; wants. What I&#39;m suggesting though, is that you&#39;d be much more likely to get a few thousand people to understand the power they wield than you would with damn near 400 million, and if you can drive the point home that legislation is where the real action is, that may at least get the ball rolling. </p>

<p>As far as the division and passion behind it, well... cult of personality is a bitch. It wouldn&#39;t be so bad if people understood that those feelings they hold so dear have been sold to them and cultivated, but ultimately hold no substance at their roots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most likely way that they get put away is by using the same tactic used on us. Division and dilution. The more people that are involved in an election/referendum, the more divided they tend to be, and ultimately ineffective. Likewise, the more options for candidates we have weakens the chance for any particular one (or just two in our case) to use consolidation of power to advance their agendas. It&#39;s being run and sold as if it were a monopoly, but in reality there are tons of other local options that given enough support, could eventually capture a respectable market share. For example, imagine what would happen to Walmart if people stopped going there and went to Kroger, Ingles, Bilo, King Sooper, Safeway, and the likes instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for Tulsi, I haven&#39;t decided how I feel about her at this point. True, the media could/would blackball her, but again, her scope of influence as far as I&#39;m concerned equates to me as crossing that bridge when I get to it. I live in a state that pays Lindsey Graham a salary, and I&#39;m more in opposition to that alone than I would be in support of her political aspirations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly social media websites like FB or IRL interactions are going to be better for local elections than Reddit is. Don&#39;t let OP make you feel bad for wanting a real choice for president, especially here on Reddit where the system inherently works better for national elections.</p>

<p>We were cheated out of an option in 2016 when the DNC rigged the primaries against Sanders and elevated Trump, but the emperor has no clothes. We live in a society that now has more access to information than we&#39;ve ever had before; and thanks to WikiLeaks, millions of people have finally found what a sham this system really is.</p>

<p>All we have to do is organize. I&#39;ve started at <a href="/r/new_movement">/r/new_movement</a>.</p>

<p>Oh... and the president has more powers than a local politician could ever dream of. We are talking about saving human lives and OP can fuck off imo if they want to discourage us from saving people.</p>
