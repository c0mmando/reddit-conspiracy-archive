<p>What do you mean by this? We don&#39;t shadowban on this sub, but we do have a 48 hour hold on new accounts being able to post/comment. We also have automod set to remove posts that specifically break rules (facebook posts, certain meme domains, maybe a few others), but all other removals are done by one of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. At some point it was approved by one of us mods. At one point it could have been removed by a different mod, but honestly it&#39;s really hard to find out for a post that old. Reddit limits how many items you can fetch from their API (for understandable performance reasons), and you can&#39;t view mod actions on a per-post basis. So I can&#39;t even tell you why you weren&#39;t able to find the post. </p>

<p>If it happens in the future, just send us a modmail when you notice it. We&#39;ll either give you an explanation on why it was removed, or try to rectify it if it was removed in error.</p>

<p>What sometimes happens is that reddit has a site-wide domain block list that will automatically remove comments with a certain domain (such as naturalnews.com, infowars.com, etc.) We have automod set up to approve some of these domains, but reddit doesn&#39;t publish their full block list. </p>
