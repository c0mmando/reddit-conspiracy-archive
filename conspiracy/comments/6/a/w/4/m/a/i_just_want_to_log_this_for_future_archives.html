       So I have a family member who was a brilliant neuroscientist. I wish to catalogue it on the internet. Believe it or not I do not care.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have this uncle who was a neuroscientist many decades ago, he claims that he worked for the government, more specifically in the field of mind control. Long story short one day he woke up and jumped out of a window one day. He survived but the basis of his theory as he has relayed to me is that he was involved in mind control research and later in his career was forced to jump out of a hospital window against his will after working for the CIA. He jumped out and became a social worker since then, and has left the world of neuroscience behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this isn't exciting but I personally know this man because he is part of my family. He claims the government tried to fake his suicide . He is dead now but was an amazing neurosurgeon who ended up being a social worker after this happened to him. He was involved in MK Ultra and ultimately was trying to be objective. I'm sorry this story isn't longer but that's all it is, he worked for the government and died, but I know how insanely smart he was.

       Wicked interesting story!  Did he ever explain  what it was exactly that he did, while working for the government?

       Did your uncle ever tell you what happened when he was made to jump out of a window?

       No he actually refuses to discuss it. It's from his sister that most of the story is told. It sounds like he was told to be quiet and enjoy the rest of your life. No idea what he was working on but it is important to note that this was during the MKultra time period so presumably that.

       My understanding is that it was a threat of sorts, though he doesn't really get into it. He had a very promising neuroscience career so the switch was pretty weird.
