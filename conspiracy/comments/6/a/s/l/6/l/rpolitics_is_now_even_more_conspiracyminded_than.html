<p>As Carlin said &quot;When are you going to stop electing these rich c<strong><em>s</em></strong>**s who don&#39;t give a fuck about you?&quot;</p>

<p>Even the gatekeeper Noam admits in the mainstream that the best way to control a population is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, and encourage lively debate within that narrow spectrum. As long as we&#39;re fighting with each other, we won&#39;t think to unite and oppose our rulers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I&#39;m not sure. From my recent studying of history, politics used to be even more brutal in the beginnings of our history. Some nasty stuff would be said of political oppositions. I believe at one point, one of the presidents was even trying to dismantle the Supreme Court, which actually wound up back firing and made it the powerful court system that we have today.</p>

<p>I think what&#39;s going on is a mix of complex issues intertwining that makes the political storm we have today.</p>

<p>I think in our grandparents time, you didn&#39;t really need an education to have a good job. All you had to do was work in a factory or a labor type job, and you would be set for life. This allowed a comfortable life in rural parts of the country and in the rust belt. But, as those jobs started to disappear, whole towns and cities started to become poverty holes and economic ghost towns. I think that as this started to happen, people would start moving to the cities, and taking jobs and businesses with them, which made it even worse.</p>

<p>The thing is that as cities became denser and denser, the economic whole of our country became richer and gave the appearance of everyone in the country doing very well. </p>

<p>But, meanwhile, the rural towns and cities are being decimated by poverty and desperation. And most politicians come from big cities and probably never even know how bad it really is in these areas.</p>

<p>So people in the city are living the good life, and think everything is going grand, while people in the rural towns are thinking people are insane when they say that life in America is great right now. Because, they themselves aren&#39;t enjoying the economic prosperity that everyone else is in the cities.</p>

<p>And I believe that what&#39;s happening is that this is creating a huge political rift and divide between city urban areas and rural areas of the country. </p>

<p>Thinking about it now, I think there isn&#39;t a democrat vs republican divide. It&#39;s a city vs rural divide. And it&#39;s the rural people that are really getting the shit end of the stick.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/">Cracked actually did a pretty good article about something like this in the past. It&#39;s written by someone who grew up in the rural parts of the country</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is an excellent analysis. Impressive grasp on how regional economic factors have pushed us into population centers. It&#39;s almost as if we&#39;re being pushed into population centers so that we&#39;re more easily manageable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is readily transparent to anyone with a brain, across the political spectrum, that there was no improper Russian dealings in the election.</p>

<p>What some fail to realize (due to incessant anti-Putin propaganda) is that the cabal pushes this as a means of keeping Trump from working with Russia, and jumping in with China&#39;s recent infrastructure-building projects to form a pro-humanity triumvirate of the world&#39;s 3 biggest powers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time to stop shrugging at baseless attacks on Putin, and call them what they are: treason against humanity.</p>

<p>Withdraw all support for this meme. Aggressively attack it wherever you see it: if you attack Putin, you are a liar and a traitor. There is one world leader that would bring the cabal down right now if he could, and he is nothing short of a hero deserving of lionization and full support.</p>

<p>God Save Vladimir Putin, leader of the Resistance!</p>

<p>Stop playing games, and stop defending murderous savages who would turn on you as soon as Putin left power. Your account is devoted to slandering Putin. You just did it by implying he murdered hundreds of his own people. </p>

<p>The US government does those kinds of things (9/11), but you prefer to slander the one person with enough power to stop that regime. The same regime that created the Chechens, and all other radical Islamic terrorism.</p>

<p>Once again, I just explained this, and your inability to understand is a result of your will. It was done by CIA-backed Chechens to punish Putin for nationalizing the industries the CIA had bought up during the 1990s.</p>

<p>Stop lying, and stop slandering Putin. He is the only person with nukes standing between you and genocidal maniacs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people in this sub can see the hypocrisy.  Also can understand who exactly is pushing this &quot;conspiracy&quot;. Its CNN/CIA/Military-industrial-complex pushing this on us. In short its the establishment pushing this. Did Russia want trump to win? Of course they did. Are they supposed to support Hillary even though she threatens their nat sec.<br/>
What russia may or may not have done is meaningless compared to what we have done and continue to do to other countries around the world. The hypocrisy is hard to take seriously. A much more likely outcome is that Trump is an Israeli agent who is giving them undue influence.  If the same standards are being applied there is much more reason to believe Trump is in the pocket of israel rather than russia.</p>

<p>But you shouldn&#39;t be surprised that people in this sub roll their eyes when people are pushing this &quot;russia conspiracy&quot; that is also being pushed by the MSM and everybody else this sub hates. And that doesn&#39;t mean that this sub supports trump or people who oppose the russia narrative oppose trump. More likely oppose the establishment and their foreign policy that has caused so much nonsensical destruction around the world in the last 20 years from Iraq to Syria and everything in between.  </p>

<p>People trying to say they were behind the firing on Comey, so they appear to have power.</p>

<p>Normally I would dismiss as fake, but the people making the claims have a very clear understanding of the world (Britain is the center of Mystery Babylon, including lots of historical details).

<p>Short of benevolent infiltration(a scenario for which there are likely constant failsafes), I differ to this. There must be an explanation that allows Britain to be Mystery Babylon and Comey to be fired, but for the two to be (at least through direct contact) unrelated.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin is the only thing that has stopped the elites from turning Syria into a hellhole, with ~5 million dead, and the country reduced to a permanent rubble pile.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. Sounds like you&#39;re getting scared about the agenda &quot;certain people&quot; are pushing. You should be. They want nothing less than large scale genocide.</p>

<p>Go read r/futurology for all of their attempts to convince everyone that automation is going to lead to dystopia, and maybe we should just bleed off these &quot;worthless eaters.&quot; Putin is the only person with nukes who is firmly committed to defending humanity at any cost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to be fair, the MSM was silent on Obama&#39;s many scandals, so many of them don&#39;t remember what its like to have the MSM actually report negatively on a president. Poor things. It&#39;s like they just figured out that the government is corrupt. Too bad they still don&#39;t realize it&#39;s &quot;both&quot; sides, and are directing all their ire at Trump, a guy that&#39;s ben a politician for a whole 6 months. It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s being done by design. Don&#39;t blame the whole corrupt system, blame Trump! &quot;When Trump is impeached, everything is puppies and rainbows again, like it was when I had my Obama rose colored glasses on!&quot;</p>

<p>Reading Trumps recent tweets, it seems there is a brigade by multiple verified check mark accounts with many many followers. It would be one thing if they were replying with actual facts and/or thought provoking debate. </p>

<p>Nope! It&#39;s all memes(did you notice that the far left are shit meme makers? no sense of humor)</p>

<p>Straight up insults, and regurgitated CNN bullshit. Absolutely ZERO fact based comments. </p>

<p>Do not let your emotions cloud your sight.</p>

<p>Strive for objectivity, it is nearly impossible yet the only way to exist.</p>

<p>Pick your battles and do not burn yourself out tilting at windmills no matter how much they need to fall.</p>

<p>Do not be blinded by your ego, its biases and wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Practice strategic enclosure, reveal yourself only when absolutely inevitable.  </p>

<p>Essentially get your house in order before you set out to save the world. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t wait for hope or inspiration create it with your words, thoughts and deeds. </p>

<p>Never stop being an honest student of life.</p>

<p>Life here is suffering and the task is to acknowledge this and yet bare it with dignity and dare I say grace.</p>

<p>The more you learn about the objective truth of our &quot;reality&quot; the more your heart will break.
Discover the concept of &quot;positive disintegration&quot; and run the gauntlet.</p>

<p>All seekers of truth will face the fires of their own crucibles and it will change you. It is your sheer will that will determine if you come out as lead or gold.</p>

<p>&quot;be wise as the serpent and gentle as the dove&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest question. Do you think if Trump knew he could get away with changing our constitution so he is essentially a dictator he wouldn&#39;t? I think it&#39;s kinda gone beyond right/left for allot of people. Our president is tweeting like its his job. News flash, it&#39;s not. The man is bumbling through this first couple months. Can find a clip of him explaining his policies, any of them, in detail and makes you think he has a grip on the world and its problems? When I hear him just repeat that things at very very bad that&#39;s not a position, you have to tell me why for me to believe you. If a mechanic told you you&#39;re alternator was very very bad, wouldn&#39;t you ask well what&#39;s wrong with it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has hardly gone beyond a right/left mindset for a lot of people. If people can figure out that part we wouldn&#39;t have such a shit show for elected politicians. Trump tweeting could be a great thing, I mean the president being able to speak his mind to the public without a filter would be amazing considering the media attack frenzy. But he makes poor use of it I agree.</p>

<p>I also agree that he is clearly not in to reading the fine print and knowing the in&#39;s and out&#39;s of the laws and plans his &quot;trusted circle&quot; is trying to accomplish. But that was evident during the election. The only thing I applaud him on in relation to a world view of his is when a reporter told him &quot;Putin is bad, he is a dictator. Putin is a KILLER.&quot; He looked at the reporter right in the eye and said &quot;What you think we&#39;re so innocent? America has it&#39;s killers too. We are not so innocent.&quot; But again the president is limited on the things he can fix. Congress is mainly in charge of making laws, and the judicial branch enforces those laws. He cannot fix things by himself. He has to rely on others.</p>

<p>But aside from all that, his blatant overly enthusiastic support of Israel is troubling and highly suspect. Either he is boldly lying to everyone about liking them, is ignorant of their crimes and subversion of our government, or is a pawn to divide us further and throw us into a war. So that he can take all the blame and disappear in a few years. Still the media coordinated hate towards him gives me and the Russia deep state approved conspiracy theory gives me a very, very tiny sliver of hope that he might be trying to arrest the pedophiles, and end the state sanctioned human trafficking. But again, I doubt he can do this on his own if he&#39;s legit about that one  issue.</p>

<p>get away with changing our constitution so he is essentially a dictator he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
This is <em>very</em> tricky. He could e.g. change the constitution to limit seats in the supreme court and elevate regional courts to make federal policy. He also could just amend that interstate infrastructure has to be voted on <em>by delegates of the states</em>, not congress, so that e.g. urgent matters could be decided by the local governments. This would - justly and correctly done - not inflict harm to the division of power, as long as <em>congress</em> decides on funds/taxes. Another point is harmonizing VAT to e.g. 2% for <em>everything</em> and writing that amount into the constitution. Everything proposed here would be passed by the congress, but I guess they would spin it as dictatorship. 
 that things at very very bad that&#39;s not a position<br/>
Yes it is. Since curiously 1991, there wasn&#39;t any party claiming &quot;this stuff stinks and we want to fix it&quot;. The pirate party was an attempt and promptly dismantled by hm, services. Right wing parties were ridiculed as ewiggestrige, stickinthemud loonies, right until just above 50% fell behind the sonic wall of automation, outsourcing and shifting service employment.<br/>
Formulated differently: I am glad as a European that after 30 years of bright future and everything under control somebody repeats this message. Not everything works. This is tailwind for all kinds of development plans. See e.g. the coming vote on the future energy politics in <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/may-21--2017-vote_voting-on-switzerland-s-energy-future/43090272">Switzerland</a>. We could have done such things 20 years ago with a longer and much more agreeable horizon, with time left to adjust, but back then it was all green pastures and nothing to worry about. Peak oil? Are you a lunatic? Russia was cool again, the EU worked and everything looked fine. This political climate changed everything in lot of domains. Let&#39;s see what happens.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Was created 1 year ago, after CTR was already public</p></li>
<li><p>Built up it&#39;s posting history posting about sports</p></li>
<li><p>Suddenly switched to posting in support of HRC on <a href="/r/hillaryclinton">/r/hillaryclinton</a> and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a></p></li>
<li><p>Posted like it was their job, generating what is now &gt;130k comment karma and &gt;3k submission karma in less than a year, mostly from political posts supporting HRC</p></li>
<li><p>Alleged in their linked post that they &quot;had the opportunity this summer to overhear some of the sales people for a company that comes into contact with a lot of campaign revenue.&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Calling them a shill here does not break any rules here since:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Despite getting gilded 12x for a conspiracy theory post in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, have never once posted in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, therefore no Rule 10</p></li>
<li><p>I have not posted any links and I do not encourage witch hunting.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Just pointing out how obvious they are. Click on any &#39;real&#39; (using your best judgment) and you will see how ridiculous it is to be at 130k karma for a 1 year old account without it being your day job.</p>

How many people here are touting the establishment MIC/MSM/CNN/CIA &quot;conspiracy&quot; that Russia is a clear and present threat and to Americans and they interfered in our politics. Of course the only point of this &quot;conspiracy&quot; is to make sure that Trump continues to take a harder line towards Russia in foreign policy and at the same time increasing the likelihood of WW3.</p>

<p>As Carlin said &quot;When are you going to stop electing these rich c<strong><em>s</em></strong>**s who don&#39;t give a fuck about you?&quot;</p>

<p>Even the gatekeeper Noam admits in the mainstream that the best way to control a population is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, and encourage lively debate within that narrow spectrum. As long as we&#39;re fighting with each other, we won&#39;t think to unite and oppose our rulers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I&#39;m not sure. From my recent studying of history, politics used to be even more brutal in the beginnings of our history. Some nasty stuff would be said of political oppositions. I believe at one point, one of the presidents was even trying to dismantle the Supreme Court, which actually wound up back firing and made it the powerful court system that we have today.</p>

<p>I think what&#39;s going on is a mix of complex issues intertwining that makes the political storm we have today.</p>

<p>I think in our grandparents time, you didn&#39;t really need an education to have a good job. All you had to do was work in a factory or a labor type job, and you would be set for life. This allowed a comfortable life in rural parts of the country and in the rust belt. But, as those jobs started to disappear, whole towns and cities started to become poverty holes and economic ghost towns. I think that as this started to happen, people would start moving to the cities, and taking jobs and businesses with them, which made it even worse.</p>

<p>The thing is that as cities became denser and denser, the economic whole of our country became richer and gave the appearance of everyone in the country doing very well. </p>

<p>But, meanwhile, the rural towns and cities are being decimated by poverty and desperation. And most politicians come from big cities and probably never even know how bad it really is in these areas.</p>

<p>So people in the city are living the good life, and think everything is going grand, while people in the rural towns are thinking people are insane when they say that life in America is great right now. Because, they themselves aren&#39;t enjoying the economic prosperity that everyone else is in the cities.</p>

<p>And I believe that what&#39;s happening is that this is creating a huge political rift and divide between city urban areas and rural areas of the country. </p>

<p>Thinking about it now, I think there isn&#39;t a democrat vs republican divide. It&#39;s a city vs rural divide. And it&#39;s the rural people that are really getting the shit end of the stick.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/">Cracked actually did a pretty good article about something like this in the past. It&#39;s written by someone who grew up in the rural parts of the country</a></p>
