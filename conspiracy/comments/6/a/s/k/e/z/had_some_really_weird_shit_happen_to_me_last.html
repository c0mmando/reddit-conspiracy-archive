       So last night I woke up in the middle of the night, and half in half out of consciousness/sleep all of a sudden saw a word in my minds eye, one that doesn't resemble anything and doesn't even exist when I google it, but it triggered something in me.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I saw it I went into some sort of strange deja vu weirdness, like I knew what the word was, and I knew it was mine, that it was for me, that comes from some deep place and is meant only for me. But it was still weird as shit because what the heck is this thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then sort of got to thinking about all the MK Ultra ish and trigger words and all sorts of other possibilities. Or maybe its the other way around, maybe our souls have original names that aren't the same as the names our parents/government record our xxx-xx-xxx as.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cool ish to contemplate

       I don't really feel comfortable sharing it yet, because I don't know the implication of it. It had two X's in it, not next to each other, but in a place where it is pronounceable

       Well there's calculators online (just look up life path number ). They give you an explanation and some insight into your personality. Like all personality tests, there is some vagueness, but it is quite helpful in the long run.

       yeah, mine is 'investigator' and I've always like to take things, ideas, philosophies apart and reverse engineer it, then once I've figured it out, I dont care anymore and off to the next thing. Maybe that's why I like the sub here, so many things to dig into and contemplate

       I've never heard of an enneagram test before so I gave it a go. I took my time and answered each question completely honestly, even if it was hard to do. I ended up getting "The Individualist".....and
       <em>
        boy
       </em>
       is  it spot on. Eerily so. Their are many things I love about this type, and many things I despise. I've always felt these things, but for some reason seeing it all laid out in that way struck me to my core. It was like a wake up call....to be more determined to change the things that are holding me back and to appreciate and utilize the good traits that I have. Thank you for posting!

       Those are indeed hard hitters, a lot of these "signs" could be explained by "coincidences" and just general personality but to those that read it and it resonates with you, it's much more than "just personality" and we just know..
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the why, from my general understanding, humankind (recent history) was mislead by people with bad intentions and we kinda ended up where we are now. Apparently there's buttloads of starseeds on earth at the moment in preparation for soon (I keep hearing sept). I'm speculating the quantom solar shift might be the trigger for most of us in this time in the world. But hey what do I know lol

       Starseed or pretentious asshole? the world may never know.

       I don't mean to shit on the idea, it reminds me a lot of the whole indigo aura thing, but those characteristics seem either like things damn near everyone can identify with or stem from delusions of  grandeur. I mean, if living life as a Starseed makes someone a happier, healthier, more productive individual than who am I to judge.

       Starseed is a synonym for indigo child and some others I think I've seen them written around. And no it's not just characteristics, I mean that's a starting point. It goes along the concept of Synchronicity, where you will see patterns of numbers (11:11 being the biggest one I guess) but not in the I'm looking each minute the clock because i'm in class kind of thing. It's more random then that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It ties in with so much other stuff going on now. Anyways  regardless of if you believe or not, I'm of the opinion we'll have an answer within the year so I don't really care haha

       Oh, that makes sense. I really didn't mean to come across as a douche. I just read number 4, or whatever it was, about feeling as if you have the power and responsibility to change the world, and all I count think of was indigo children and how infuriating I find them. But seriously, to each there own. Live long and prosper.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an aside, is there any public figure recognized as a starseed? Either by the starseed community or yourself. Someone who seems to really be putting their cosmic powers to proper use? I only ask as the few self identified indigo children I know spend most of their time smoking weed and making gemstone jewelry, which if they are powerful cosmic beings, seems to be squandering their potential.

       No worries mate, no offense taken, people in general are pretty on edge on a variety of things in recent times, online games are more toxic than ever, discussions online are hard to have, or at least calmly lol
      </p>
      <p>
       I very recently stumbled starseeds and whatnot, started with a comment I saw on Jordan Sather's facebook (Destroying The Illusion on youtube, he's got great content, from news update and what's going on in the world to belief shattering speed courses on ancient history and hidden science haha) but didn't think much about the comment (as I had no idea what a starseed was) but then while browsing new in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that same day, the article I posted in this thread showed up, then I did some googling and tried to understand what the fuck I was reading. Thing is, if I had read that stuff maybe a month prior maybe I wouldn't have thought much of it but I dove into researching UFOs more closely .
      </p>
      <p>
       As for public figures, I don't believe so, at least not in the mainstream sense. The whole starseed concept cannot exist without a whole lot of other stuff existing, but from my point of view and observing, we're on the right track. I think the more outspoken ones do so because it is their role, a bit like a priest's role is to preach. They are there to inform others that have not awakened yet, that this exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh! I do remember either Jordan Sather or Victor Oddo saying the christ, mlk and malcom X as examples of starseeds but off what that is based I have no idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for cosmic power I'm really unsure as I'm not even sure what's that referring to haha, I'm guessing contact through meditation, message transmission and that kind of stuff, see Zingdad, I don't know much about him, but he says he's in contact with Adamu, plaiedian of some importance
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw the stuff about gemstone jewelry, from my minimal amount of time spent reading that, my general understanding is that crystals have some kinds of properties or whatever to channel energies and stuff like that but ehhhh not sure I buy that
      </p>
      <p>
       I do love the dank stuff though

       That's cool. And I'm glad you weren't offended, so often Internet discussions devolve into arguments and name calling.

      <p>
       My issue with the whole indigo child thing is that it sets some individuals above othera, I'm all for acknowledging that someone like MLK did more good for the world than I ever will, but it seems ridiculous to go a step further and say he wasn't just an incredible human being but some transcendent being. It almost seems to undermine how important he was and could discourage others from striving to be equally great.

      <p>
       As for cryatals, I think the idea is interesting but there's so far no hard evidence that they're anything but interesting and often useful rocks.

       Yes and no. Let me explain. What is death? What happens after death?  We often wonder that right? What's that light at the end of the tunnel people keep bringing up, etc, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Some believe it's just pitch black game over (I did) some believe in reincarnation. When I said starseed concept needs other theories to be even able to exist well here is one such condition. The underlying concept is that there's some kind of big pool, some kind of non-physical plane of existence where it's an in between life of some kind, that would be "entering the light" and where you get to see past memories and such, and basically there's a bunch of aliens who owuld have chosen to start a new life here on earth for X reason, but to do so they must bring down their frequency to ours and thus they have no knowledge of past lives, until they go back in the pool I guess. It's something along those lines, you get what I mean, so basically those starseeds are just other souls in the  universe. You gotta remember that a body is simply a vehicule, what is you is your soul, or at least what we call a soul I guess.
      </p>

       So, the idea is that indigo children are alien or non-human souls reborn in human form? Are there "true" human souls or is everyone just a former non-human being reborn in human form?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess at the end of the day, be it soul reborn or regular ass human spirit, we're all here and all look like people. It seems strange to me to even bother differentiating. Is an indigo child who's soul can communicate with other souls not just an incredibly empathetic person? That's obviously a great trait but why does it have to be an inhuman one?

       That's the thing, it's not inhuman, anyone can do it apparently and that's probably why a lot of starseeds are here at the moment, I guess the plan is probably along the lines of, informing people once it's the time, most likely at the quantum solar shift, how to ascend and shit, which is in short term, be at peace with ourselves, be loving of others etc etc, so being what we consider decent human beings and then that raises our frequency, collectively and in theory when the wave from the sun hits we get a spike and we ascend, not exactly sure what that does but in theory that's where communicating with other souls is a thing
      </p>
      <p>
       So in short I guess, defeat the cabal, disclose everything, no more secrets, free energy, get rid of diseases, space exploration, UFO (we've had that since long), alien life etc etc, then the quantum solar shift happens (mayan 2012, we're off by a couple years) we will then have moved a bit in the universe (non-linear movement, check out helical solar system, cool stuff) so the stars (which our calendars are based on) will be fucked and will have to be redone (mayans were smart, albeit they killed people for their gods lol) and then we should ascend as a specie. Crazy eh?

It's one of those things where im fully on board for the outcome, an end to corruption and disease and all that jazz, I just don't see it as being realistic, nor does the method jive with my current world outlook.

       Honestly, it always brings to mind mental illness for me. The feelings of being an outsider/not belonging, delusion of grandeur, etc. Not to knock anyone who identifies with it or anything, but I am curious as to how many starseeds have been diagnosed as bipolar or something similar. Of course, I haven't found any studies on this particular topic. I'd be interested in talking with some starseeds, either here or in pms, and compiling some info if people are down for it.

       That's definitely an element. On a related note, I remember seeing a short documentary on indigo children and a shocking number of them were autistic. In part, I think is the parents of those children trying to justify why their child would be dealt such a difficult hand in life. On top of that, autistic people are often incredibly talented in some area, like a musical or artistic savant.

       why? Every time I go there, the shrinks end up admitting that I'm right, they start questioning their own lives, jobs, existence, and some of them have ended up quitting to go live life by following their heart

       Starseed is a synonym for indigo child and some others I think I've seen them written around. And no it's not just characteristics, I mean that's a starting point. It goes along the concept of Synchronicity, where you will see patterns of numbers (11:11 being the biggest one I guess) but not in the I'm looking each minute the clock because i'm in class kind of thing. It's more random then that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It ties in with so much other stuff going on now. Anyways  regardless of if you believe or not, I'm of the opinion we'll have an answer within the year so I don't really care haha

       Honestly, it always brings to mind mental illness for me. The feelings of being an outsider/not belonging, delusion of grandeur, etc. Not to knock anyone who identifies with it or anything, but I am curious as to how many starseeds have been diagnosed as bipolar or something similar. Of course, I haven't found any studies on this particular topic. I'd be interested in talking with some starseeds, either here or in pms, and compiling some info if people are down for it.

       A lot of the things on that list resonate with me, but I can't help but feel like, the article is written to pander to exactly the kind of person who would be convinced they are a starseed special magical something or other.

       bingo. Snake oil salesmen, used car salesmen, politicians, grifters and con artists of all kinds know that flattery, or making a target feel special, makes them more likely to take the bait. Whose a special snowflake? Who is? You, and you, and you and you... what a lot of special star people we have here with us today! Why don't you step right up, and buy into my unique brand of hocus pocus, touchy feely bull shite
