       My guess is, its not that dark when panning to the moon and its not that bright when panning to the sunrise. Tricks of the camera and exposure.

       The sun doesn't just fade away in the sky when it gets past its range of light, it clearly comes up from over the horizon.

       The horizon is caused by human perception and our field of vision. If you were to pull out binoculars as the sun sets over the horizon... it would pop back up.
      </p>

       You could could keep doing it over and over with more powerful telescopes and it wouldn't disappear.

       That sounds like something 4Chan would say to trick people into burning their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see the sun go halfway down the horizon - That's nothing to do with field of view or human perception, that's because the horizon is blocking the bottom half.

       Until you burnt out your eyeballs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, this is wrong, once its set past the horizon its out of view, a telescope wouldnt see the sun again it would let you see the horizon 'closer' but the sun is hidden behind it. If you moved your actual eyes closer you'd see the sun, chase it, chase the sunset.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or if you dont have a telescope and dont feel the need to fry your e balls lie on the beach at sea level, watch the sunset, stand up quickly and watch it again.

       No such video exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single one of the videos you're talking about do the same thing - they point at a ship that is not over the horizon, then zoom out until the low resolution makes the ship 'disappear'.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll never find a video that is zoomed in enough to clearly see the ship as it goes below the horizon, then zoom in more to make it reappear.

       The video actually proves the earth is not flat, barring any camera trickery/exposure issues already mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the Earth turns, and the sun 'comes up', the light from the sun travels to and (more importantly for this video) around the earth. The horizon is bright, but the light doesn't bend (enough anyway) to wash over the rest of the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shine a flashlight over a ball or sphere, you'll see the light illuminate parts of the ball the light doesn't directly shine on. You could quite literally pinpoint a location on your ball where you could stand and see the light coming but still be in darkness.

       Depending on where you live, at certain times in the year, night is longer than daytime. In winter where I live, it's dark by 4:30-5:00 PM and the sun rises again around 8:00 AM. When summer rolls around, it's daylight until around 11PM with dawn at roughly 5:30 AM. Day and night length vary with the seasons in some places. Part of the round-Earth wobbling on it's axis...

       It works in the sense that it explains the locations of the planetary bodies as we could measure them in 150AD.

       It obviously doesn't 'work' in the sense that it could actually be happening.

       I think the comment and use of the word 'work' was pretty obvious, and that I didn't mean it works with what we have learned since 150 AD...

       People think the moon and the sun run on perfect circles in total opposition to each other. If that were so, the moonrise and moonset would co-occur with the sunrise and sunset and we'd never see the moon in the daylight.

       We should be able to detect that light doesn't travel but a few thousand miles pretty easily if this was reality. would it be super easy to replicate a test to do that? Light just losing power and disappearing makes no sense to me I can't wrap my head around it. Flat earthers say the sun is 3000 miles away or so but doesn't light up a area 3000 miles wide ?

       Put simply, our atmosphere is like a glass of water - it refracts and reflects light.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/optpic/brokpen.jpg">
        We've all seen this
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IV3Jpxm.png">
        Here is how it works on our spherical planet.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Th small red line on the right is the location of the observer on the surface. The dark blue line is the line of sight to the sun, which you can see is blocked by earth. If the observer looks to the left, he can not see the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The yellow line is one ray of sunlight refracting in the atmosphere. As you can see, this ray is bent down and hits the observer. Reflection and refraction of sunlight is why our atmosphere glows blue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking in the direction of the sun, the observer would see this reflected and refracted light as the sky glowing, getting brighter towards the horizon. But if he turns around, he would not see this light because the moon is orders of magnitude less bright than the sun, so not enough light from it is being reflected and refracted to cause the sky to glow.
      </p>
