       What doesn't make sense is how there are places on Earth that go on for hundreds of miles with little to no curvature despite there having to be if we lived on a sphere earth.

       *Keep in mind you would HAVE TO see 8 inches of curvature every square mile on a sphere Earth.

       There is an explanation in the thread that you linked to. It has to do with the fact that a salt flat acts more like a body of liquid than solid due to environmental conditions when it comes to curvature. It is basically a giant salt lake that gets smoothed over and flattened year after year.

       You're talking about places on earth having little to no curvature to see, and then claimed that water remains at level with no curvature (which then I said, get a hot air balloon and overlook the ocean). The point is, it's extremely difficult to see any sort of curvature from sea level. It's very difficult to see curvature with the human field of view at that level.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a camera with a larger field of view that takes in more of the horizon at sea level, you will be able to see the curvature more clearly.

       Fun fact - two places on opposite sides of the world can have the same elevation. This is because elevation is based on distance from the surface of a sphere, not surface of a flat plane.

       How does a picture like that show anything? I fail to follow the logic in the OP there that the center of the picture is somehow supposed to be higher. The horizon is equidistant in all directions from where you stand (assuming perfectly spherical earth, rather than the oblate spheroid with elevation differences that it is).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would any 'dipping' be observed? Imagine looking in one direction  x, then it sounds like that OP expects dipping on an angle to the left (y). But if you had originally looked at y, then shouldn't x be dipped using the same logic? They can't both dip relative to each other.

       Why are you getting so angry and cussing at people in these threads?
      </p>
      <p>
       You still haven't answered my questions on this thread. I'm not trolling, I seriously want to know what evidence you think is compelling.  I thought about it more and did some research looking at websites and youtube videos. I still don't find it convincing. Maybe you could give me a top 3 best knockdown arguments that you find convincing?

       For me, it presents too many problems that need ad hoc conspiracies to wave them away. I also researched this Chicago skyline photo too. Based on this webpage

       , he was standing on top of Tower Hill which is 250 feet above Lake Michigan. Add 6 feet for his assumed height and you have 744 feet obscured by horizon just doing simple back of the envelope calculations. The height of Sears tower is 1450 feet so 1450 - 744 = 706 feet of tower that should be visible on a clear day and assuming no refractive effects of the atmosphere. If you have refractive effects, this fully explains the many images that people have produced. It is all explained here

       from across Lake Michigan ~60 mi. With a curvature of ~8 in. per miles  squared the vertical distance hidden by the earth’s curve should be ~2166 . The Sears tower is 1,729′ tall at the tip. None of this should be visible.

       It shouldn't be hidden, it's not far away enough. If anything that picture is clear evidence for curvature since you clearly can only see the tops of some buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, after reverse googling, this picture is not taken from eye-height, but from 'a dune', make sure to take that into your calculations if you want to determine which buildings should be visible.

       So? Google earth is not made to be some kind of perfect earth curvature representation device. The horizon there is likely artificially limited to some distance, with no relationship to curvature or altitude or anything like that. It's not like it's loading in the entire model of earth

       So yes, there's some arbitrary mechanism that google is using. On one picture, the entire right side of the city disappears. While there's no obvious 'dipping' of the city. It just gets smaller over distance. They basically just use a flat-earth like representation in their model with some max limit at which they put their horizon.

       There is curve. You cannot see it because it is insignificant. 8 inches for curve every mile inches, or 0.04°. You don't even know the focal length of the camera used or post processing done. It is literally evidence of nothing.

       No, it doesn't magically cease at any point. And your statement really makes no sense. People do see things which ought to be hidden beyond the curvature. That might be as they say, refraction, a mirage, a play of the light. But it is beyond the curve, beyond the horizon, and occurring. This is regardless of the observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, you are still missing the point. The arguments usually go that some play of the light allows sight of otherwise unviewable objects, but the reverse is never true, that viewable objects cannot be seen when they should. They wish to have their cake and eat it, too. Although it could be the case that refraction always works towards the observer.

       Well, close enough, I guess. Just that it's not me making claims about refraction, except that all else being equal, once allowed, it ought to affect all cases. Not just the cases which might tend to run in favor of flat earth.

       It affects all cases. There is nothing about a boat going over a horizon and disappearing from the top down that is contradicted in any way by atmospheric refraction.

       All it does is artificially extend your horizon sight line out further.

       There isn't anything to get, you just have a fundamental misunderstanding of what refraction is and what it does.

       So far you have provided no explanation for what you are saying.

       because the earth is so massive that if you were standing on the surface the horizon would seem flat. Its the human mind being confused by the sheer size of the marble we are walking on. Its very similar to why the human mind can not fathom infinity.

       Actually the Earth is a little less than 25,000 miles in circumference so by using basic math we know the exact amount of curvature we should be seeing.

       then you should look up the term superior mirage, which debunks the idea that we should lose ships over the horizon. Hot air drives the image upward created a mirage above the actual object, creating the idea that we see a "flat horizon". And the biggest part. Hotter air is always above because heat rises. Now try again.

       Fata Morgana displays the same thing. Its a distortion of light. Unfortunately, the FE believers use their senses for their argument and not weather, atmospheric, or physical sciences to discern what is going on. Senses can be easily fooled and traditional mirages and both superior and inferior versions of them prove our senses fail us.

       The Earth is huge, to see the curvature at ground level is difficult because of our field of view and geological structures in the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       To begin to see the curvature you need to increase in altitude, stand at the top of a mountain peak and you will see it. This is because compared to ground level, your field of view can see much more of the earth within the distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       At ground level the horizon is around 5km away, at 30 meters the horizon is at 19.6km so on so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The further away the horizon gets from you, the more land you can see between you and the horizon, the more you can see the curvature.

       If flatheads are going to AstroTurf and aggressively push this nonsense at every turn, then I'll be there to point out how retarded it is.  If rational people don't respond to it, it will turn into a moronic circle jerk of stupidity.  Then anybody can look at it, and say "hey, look at all these people talking about flat earth.  They actually believe that crap!". Ignoring it makes the AstroTurf grow faster.

       Logic is a weak point for flat earthers, so here's a tip.  Refuting flat earth nonsense does not in any way equate to "believing everything his government and indoctrination tells him".

       You just listed things that are plausible (to at least some degree, though the "holograms" thing is a really weird and unfounded claim) using technology we know exists and has been fully researched by science and engineered examples can be seen everywhere. Sandy Hook and the Holocaust are simply matters of evidencing crimes using available resources, and requires some (minimal) amount of human intent and intervention to become accepted fact. In other words, the existing facts are able to be contested/demonstrated through forensic methodology, and alternative, plausible explanations can be said to exist for all above examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flat earth theory, however, has no scientific research to substantiate it. It guess against the grain of known scientific laws such as the law of gravity. It would therefore requires not only the known body of physical science, but also natural math and the number system to be a complete forgery. This has not been demonstrated successfully, and natural math continues to be the basis for discoveries in the physical sciences and the globe by people of diverse cultures and independently in many cases. There is no plausible and fully explained alternative that describes the movement of heavenly bodies like the currently accepted heliocentric model. There are pictures taken from anything from passenger jets to space agencies to private corporations that show curvature of the earth, pictures of the roundness of earth from space, etc etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the plausibility of the flat earth theory is of a far, far more vanishing degree than anything else you listed.

       9/11 was an inside job, culprits include certain elememts of the US government, Saudi-Arabia, Isreal, Russia, and Europe. No holograms were used but explosives most certainly were.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Holocaust definitely happened but they exaggerated the number of Jewish people who were murdered. Hitlers rise to power was mostly funded by hidden forces in the US and Hitler was a pawn used to rebuild the economy in Germany while simultaneously seeking to crush the Soviet Union.
      </p>

       Sandy Hook was a hoax. There is plenty of compelling evidence.

       A quick google search tells me that Anton Drexler founded the party. But either way what you're telling me is that national socialism wasn't created by the cabal, and was just propped up by them? I ask this because communism was invented by them (Karl Marx).

       just entertaining the thought that people who have nonsensical beliefs (e.g. that the earth is flat) might actually be here as part of a  conspiracy to limit the spread of the truth that could break people out of the false reality they live in (i.e. The West is bringing democracy to the Middle East).

       No, but it people actually believe the flat earth theories in the face of so much evidence rejecting it, then yes they are idiots. And if supporters of the theory don't actually believe it what motivation would they have to pretend they do? Money is the universal motivator

       That would only be a counterpoint if it was something which isn't immediately disprovable. You can fly a plane in a spherical orbit around the earth, that wouldn't be possible if it were flat.

       Thus we have bots/brigades influencing votes here on reddit. It influences the mind; "if most people (dis)believe that, then surely I must be crazy for thinking otherwise!" We tend to naturally want to adhere to the herd's mentality for social benefits. Even if we know something to be false, a lot of us will still overlook it and create an alternate reality in the mind that justifies everything so we can keep deriving the social benefits. And then reinforce it by turning to point and laugh in their circle.

       I'll add that "Collectivism" has been around as long as any form of democracy has. They are somewhat inseparable, and thus they both play a deep role in most definitions of "western values" in the first place.

       Well, capitalism has a few things to say about "human resources" too...
      </p>
      <p>
       But more importantly, I think you're missing something out of your western values. They contain
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       individualism and democracy (group/collective decision making and action). The entire history of "Western" thought is a balance of the two (traditionally traced to ancient Greece at least), you can't leave out the group/democracy part.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will give you that the individual is sacred. Now, you can follow it with "the law of the jungle is the only law", money-talks, might is right etc (these are the only alternatives to popular law and democratized power) then I'm saying you've​ walked off the "western culture" reservation just like half of the right wing of the USA are trying to do.

       I'd say responsibility is the meaning of life, which is the culmination of the Western Values...Not accepting the freebee of the nanny-state and becoming absolute slaves who worship degenerate cultural values.

       Socialism with Might = 30 million dead in the Soviet Union from 1915-1950.  Then there is Mao.  Recently? Scope Venezuela.

       I appreciate your viewpoint and I apologise for denigrating your opinion in my first post in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal responsibility
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a major aspect of the human condition but I don't know if I would call it the meaning of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you would help your children and parents if they needed it, your brothers and their children... Possibly your cousins and their families... Some particular friends and neighbors... some extremely unlucky member of your community... But at some point along this continuum you would stop calling it your "responsibility" (perhaps right after the first hurdle). Me too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to live in a family/town/city/community/country/world where those who can help those who need, even if I do more giving than receiving. where there is a decent public health system,  education for everyone, basic transport and infrastructure as standard, accountable law enforcement, collective fire department, national defense. Some things
       <em>
        can work better
       </em>
       on a group scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       But note that I'm not saying all those things
       <strong>
        always
       </strong>
       work better if socialized. There are tons of examples of success and failure throughout history and the world, and you guys just love to pick the disasters and throw your hands up, claiming it can never work...
       <em>
        ignoring all the cases where it does
       </em>
       . Socialism + might is dangerous but the same can be said of pure free markets + might.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the "Nanny State" presents a moral hazard and the free market should be the basic engine of the economy. I believe in equal opportunity but I don't believe in equal outcomes. I believe in incentives for hard work, inventiveness, raw intelligence, risk-taking, but I don't think inherited wealth should stagnate and "sink up" to the top 0.1%...
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you feel about "accepting the freebee of grandpa's millions??"
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as "degenerate cultural values" I'm not even sure what you mean. I'd say the two top degenerate cultural values I know are "the church of the free market" (it works to solve some things so it ought to be applied to everything) and basic "Sod you, Jack, I've got mine."

       It's not really a matter of "internet points determine reality". Or a matter of any given youtube video being
       <em>
        universally
       </em>
       good or bad. And you basically explained why.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm looking for, let's say, a Howard Stern bit on youtube I know the likes/dislikes are given by other Stern fans. So if it has 90% likes I know it's gonna be good quality &amp; the content I'm looking for. If it has 90% dislikes I know it's going to be shit but not because of Stern. It's be poorly titled or bad sound or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a 70-80% liked flat earth video just means other flat earthers thought it was a quality video. If I were looking to see what makes these flat earthers tick I would start with a video like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, I thought this was a known approach to viewing likes/dislikes.

       I don't watch them myself. Can't stand Dawkins. One might categorize me as atheist or agnostic though. But that's not even a thing, so I don't care for the category or attempt to box people into some kind of opposing non-religion. It's just not a thing at all.

       Im with you. Im just saying your explanation is true about any other community. Especially atheists. Im atheist myself, but right now theres something far worst than religion itself. the SJW cult. I thought once we eliminate religion from earth everything would be almost perfect. How wrong I was. I prefer religion 1000x better than the SJW cult.

        I just saw the stupidest video on youtube and it had 75-80% likes vs dislikes. That isn't possible without something being rigged.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it is. The people seeking out and watching videos like Eric Dubay's are those who are fans of his.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless a video gets linked to somewhere else on Reddit or something for being stupid and a bunch of people dislike it then the videos of a FE video will be mostly likes by like minded individuals.

       The problem comes when you tend to believe conspiracy theory as the default explanation for things. Just because you're not a flat earther or don't believe in other conspiracy theories that you find dumb, doesn't mean your belief in certain conspiracy theories are necessarily valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd guess Alex Jones isn't a flat earther, but he believes every conspiracy theory there is by default.

       A lot of them do believe it is a conspiracy.  They actually think that the Antarctic is a giant wall of ice no one can go beyond.  And some think it is guarded by militaries so no one tries to go past it.  And that NASA is conspiring by faking putting satellite into orbit, and the space station is not real.  There are many conspiracies woven into the flat earth theory.

       Another point is that it is incredibly easy to buy, likes, subscribes, views for whatever fake BS you want to propagate.  Many many things here in cyberspace are "rigged" (as you say) and pushed into the sphere of public domain to control the narrative.  Whether that be consumer trends in the form of amazon and yelp reviews, political and foreign policy as pushed by big media, or manipulating public opinion on conspiracy theorists by promoting flat Earth.

       Read the comments, flat earth = God is real and is coming back. Essentially flat earthers are moved off the chess board as a threat. They all believe this has been foretold and the devil is trying to deceive them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you need to rise up and battle your oppressors when God is the only one who can, and will defeat them? Most of the comments are always something like "Jesus is coming, my eyes are open"
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion and government are two sides of the same coin, they are both needed to keep the masses in check fearing their master.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all to keep people ignorant to the truth of how easy it is to just, well stop all this bullshit. If people were beaten over the head with how few people are controlling their entire lives and for the worse, and how easy it would be to just change it all and keep it changed... well we can't have that, so people must either worship God, or worship Government as the solution to the problem and not their own actions.

       Upvoted videos rise to the top of searches. It's to get rational people to NOPE out of any investigations. They can then say they investigate and say it's just crazy people talking about 9/11 or whatever. Classic PsyOp.

        internet shills are a proven reality on both sides of the political spectrum, and this has been reported on in the media for years.
       </a>
       From time to time, even some people in this sub question whether or not shills exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of people out there who are busy with other things and read other kinds of information, so they may not be aware that "guilt by association" or "black propaganda" is a common tactic manipulators use to discredit a subreddit, a worldview, or something else. I'm sure there are tons of people who believe all Flat Earthers are 100 percent serious.

       Me too. I get called a shill all the time for pointing out the house of cards that pizzagate is, but sadly I don't get a cent for it. You'd think that the Government would be able to spare some cash for me, considering all the millions of dollars it must spend annually maintaining its coverups of 9/11, Sandy Hook, pizzagate, JFK, Roswell, Dulce, the moonlanding, alien abductions, the Illuminati, shape-shifting reptilian aliens, etc, etc. I mean, we must be talking hundreds of dedicated in-house employees, as well as the staff at other organisations such as NASA, FEMA, and NIST who have to be bribed. Then there are the resources dedicated to tracking the people investigating the coverups and murdering them, and the cost of paying people to post criticisms of conspiracy theories on the internet.

       I imagine a lot of it is various intelligence agencies who have a guy just say some dumb shit on different forums and on facebook for about 20 minutes a day. All you really need are a few instigators and then herd mentality kicks in and real people continue the work for you. Same thing with paid protestors. They're not paying thousands of people to riot. They're paying one or two guys to break a window and then the rest happens on its own. All you need is the catalyst.

      <p>
       It's also a common tactic used by conspiracy theorists. I've seen people use two or three degrees of separation to try to "prove" that someone is guilty of something: A met B, who knows C, and C is guilty of a crime, therefore A is guilty too.

       I see it as a double whammy though. I think flat-earth theory also has this "credibility" because we live in an age where it so easy to prove that 99% of "trusted" sources are lying to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public is developing major trust issues and our physical reality is already very weird and hard to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely have substantial evidence to support and then believe that the earth im standing on is a sphere, but to entertain the idea that it's flat isn't nearly as insane as many people might think at first glance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell even the system of "belief" is illogical as fuck. When someone asks you "hey, does the ocean appear to be blue?" it's not like you go through the inventory of your life's experiences/research before answering - you just grunt out some subconscious (and ultimately pre-programmed) response with probably verrry little thought. I'm sure plenty of us have a long list of shit saved in our brain that's actually just flat out wrong, because it was saved wrong back when we "learned" about it. Blurr the lines a bit over some time, and suddenly this solid, defined 4D life we live is more like a complicated delusion than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I'm trying to make here folks is - we're all here learning together. Let's try not be too insensitive or egomaniacal when teaching each other, or discovering truths.

       Now I don't dispute for a second that we have millions of people in this country, so fucking gullible, they'll believe ANYTHING a little magic box tells them is true......hence why they vote democrat or republican......but there is NO QUESTION, that all of these smoke screen laughable "conspiracies" are being planted to make all conspiracies look equally crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are easily manipulated, some are taking the bait, others are trolling for fun, but this is absolutely being pushed HARD by those who want to smoke screen their real doings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I call it "the balance" essentially, only so many people can become hip to the bullshit, or the machine stops, so when google searches for certain events with "hoax" or "conspiracy" start getting too heavy, it's important that a bunch of this wacked out shit is injected to make any normal, fairly sane person feel stupid for even thinking to watch or read more on it.

       It's attacked because it's intellectual cancer.  A crime against reason, logic, and simple observation.  It only gets "attention" because most of the people who push this garbage are religious zealots who spam the crap nonstop, and they will not be reasoned with.  They will ignore all contrary evidence, and will just repeat the same retarded nonsense over, and over, and over again.

       What are they hiding?  Lots of stuff.  But nobody can hide the complete and utter stupidity of flat earthers.

       You don't need a balloon and ocean to see a horizon buddy. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Flat Earth Theory is.

       I see more of these posts everyday than actual FE posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not there is a lot of sketchy things when it comes to NASA and the apparent lack of curvature of this Earth and a lot of people like to look into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had discussions with people who genuinely try to explain and provide links - but most just like to comment and call everyone retarded. You're not smart for believing what everyone on earth currently assumes - just like FE aren't smart for going against it.

       I know what you mean, hope I didn't come off rude myself. I just have 100% confidence that whatever science info he is feeding me is going to be as non-bullshit as it can possibly be. I know he doesn't have a hidden agenda or paid for by shills or just whatever the fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just asked him to give me the lowdown on global warming one day, and he explained it to me as thoroughly as he could. Explained to me what they do in order to test for these things and how they have basically direct correlation to global warming and manmade greenhouse gases, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways I'm not trying to go on a global warming tirade, but I think if the earth were flat, or we didn't land on the moon or global warming was bullshit. He'd tell it to me straight up, I've known him for almost 20 years. That's all I've got on that tho

       Lol okay I get it. I understand being skeptic of some random person on Reddit claiming such a thing. Obviously I have no way to prove myself without doxxing my friend, which of course is dumb. So I won't fault you for that. But for whatever it's worth I'm being 100% honest, I have no agenda to push other than just the science as I understand it.

       Uh because I'd be happy to discuss the science with you and share the knowledge that has been shared with me via my friend who has happened to start working for NASA. Whether you want to retain that knowledge or not is whatever. But instead you refuse to even entertain the idea that maybe I'm telling the truth.

       I mean I really don't care if you believe me, I'm just trying to do the right thing by sharing what I know. Like I said though that's on you, not me.

       You need to stop saying "science" and focus on evidence. Science can be unproven theory just as much as it can also be verified facts. One must distinguish these of course.

       Yes, that is very true man, luckily science doesn't claim to be absolute.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think the word you were looking for is "hypothesis". Which would be more like a prediction based on observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A "theory" is a rigorously tested, unifying explanation based on a varying set of proven factors.

       What we call "Planets" and "stars" are just flickering lights from our perspective. All "close up" pictures of these objects are CGI artistry created by NASA contractors. So essentially we have no proof that they are round solid objects either.

       you will see "bursts" of FE posts when the actual news is getting interesting. You will also notice most of the posters have never been here or its a pretty fresh account. You will also see 3-5 posts within 10 minutes within 10 minutes from "different" accounts. Thats how i know something fucky is going on.

       Have you not considered that those accounts could be made to spread disinformation and tarnish the flat earth topic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone could set up a fresh account and start posting stupid comments and pretend to be a flat earther. Saying stuff like ''flat earthers all around the globe".
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it only takes someone like you to read their comments and not give any more insight.

       look up the electric universe theory.. mainstream science doesn't like that theory because it goes against what they say... they do propose alternative theories about the universe and planets, but are they wrong like the flat earth theory, looking at their evidence and analysis, the electric universe theory makes more sense than mainstream science.

       It was actually EXTREMELY controversial when first proposed. It was heavily debated even has late as the 1890s here in America. Even the builders of the ancient megalithic structures, we tend look back at with awe,  thought the earth was flat. They were masters of mathematics, celestial alignment, and obviously were advanced in ways we cannot completely replicate today... how could have they been so wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at all the historic people who've proposed the heliocentric model and see if you can find a common thread. (Hint they all have ties to masonry just like many if not all of the NASA astronauts).

       I'm not sure of the shape of the earth. But I am certain
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       doesn't want people asking questions. Maybe NASA pays them, I don't know, but as soon as a pro-flat earth post is made, they come out of the woodwork to ridicule or attack, sometimes reading off a cheat sheet. Some of them do nothing on reddit but comment on flat earth posts, and not a single thing else. Bizarre.

       It's going to have a kind of Streisand effect probably, and make people stop and look at it more and more as they see the evidence. Excessive shilling and blatant attacks online typically do not seem to have the desired result of whoever pays the shills. A bunch of shills calling me stupid will not make me stop commenting, and them telling me to pay no attrntion to the man behind the curtain is only going to make me even more curious of what's behind the curtain.

       Nope. They just need a Houghton-Mifflin science book drilled into their brains. They need to tested on their knowledge of sphere earth, and graded on their memorization of the facts.  Just in case anyone ever questions it, so they can be shame them with the facts they memorized in 4th grade.  Who the hell is Houghton-Mifflin anyways? I want to know!

       Atmospheric refraction , especially over cool bodies of water, affects the math of how far and what you can see.

      <p>
       Here is a great explanation with video evidence of the refraction as well as all the math involved. Flat Earthers have linked me the exact same image you did and all the math for curvature as well many times. It is thoroughly debunked. The picture you linked is a GREAT example of a curved Earth because much of the city is missing due to curvature, which is proven by math in the link I provided. As
       <a href="https://youtu.be/o_W280R_Jt8">
        MinutePhysics
       </a>
       points out, if the Earth didn’t curve and the horizon didn’t exist, when you looked at Chicago from across Lake Michigan, you’d be able to see the the Rocky Mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah but I see from the other comment you just sent that you don't trust "experimental mathematics" aka completely valid and thoroughly tested math based on hundreds of years of testing and research on physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like most Flat Earthers this confuses you because you don't understand therefore it is "experimental" yet you are willing to believe wholeheartedly in the the Earth Curvature Calculator and never take into consideration other factors (with equal mathematical and scientific backing)
      </p>
      <p>
       Fair enough. Here are a multitude of experiments you yourself can do to prove the Earth is a round spinning ball:

       I have done the Coriolis Effect one myself.

       I also live right next to the beach and have watched a ship sail away with binoculars (no it did not reappear as FE's say it will) just slowly descended below the horizon.

      <p>
       A hilarious and cheap one if you got the time and gumption is :
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         You move in a straight line for a long enough distance
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Turn right 90° degrees, walk in that same direction for the same distance
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Turn again to the right 90° degrees and walk again the same distance
        </p>
       </li>

        After this you'll end up at the starting point. This is not possible  on a flat surface since you'd just be "drawing" a half-finished square.

       You can also fly to Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Watch a sunset then take the elevator to the top of the super high building and watch the same sunset again. You can do this with any conveniently located really tall skyscraper of your choosing. but it will work best with some real big bastards like 1WTC etc.

       Okay, in one sentence you question
       <em>
        what are only the tops of building visible
       </em>
       and two sentences later you answer your own question :
       <em>
        Atmospheric refraction .. affects the math of how far you can see
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       At 8 inches per mile squared not even the top of the Sear’s tower should be visible.
      </p>

       Your link including it’s theoretical physics proves nothing. Otherwise please explain in your own words what it proves.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your claim that you should be able to see the Rocky Mountains is laughable for the same reason as stated above (i.e.
       <em>
        Atmospheric refraction .. affects the math of how far you can see
       </em>
       ). Why don’t you look at a forecast from Chicago or Michigan and notice the value for
       <em>

       The Earth Curvature Calculator is an approximation based on your theory. It is not created by a Flat Earther and all of the mathematics is there for you to see. Otherwise calculate it by hand and compare the results. You see the difference is you don’t have to believe in the calculator - it merely takes the official curvature 8 in/ mi ^ 2 and calculates it for you.

       Do you really believe this is anything more than pseudoscience? Lay on a flat sidewalk and watch your friend walk away from you.

       There is zero explanation for how changing your "perspective" on a flat Earth in height would allow you to watch a sunset again. That's not how perspective works at all.

       Do you have any tests that prove a flat Earth because I've never seen one except for some outdated and debunked experiments from like the 1800s trying to measure the "firmament"?

       which shows the multiple buildings when they should be obstructed by earth's supposed curvature? Yea that proves my point very well. Visibility is always affected by moisture so, yes near the water light is refracted but mirages do not as form as perfect replicas of a skyline in the exact position where they should be.

       Easiest experiment? Sit on the ground with an unobstructed view of a sunset. As soon as the sun goes under the horizon stand up and you can see the sun again. If the Earth was flat, sitting or standing wouldnt matter. (This one has been mentioned else where in this thread)
      </p>
      <p>
       Harder experiment: Record sunrise and sunset one day and travel either North or South a significant distance (Im talking about Canada to Mexico distance ~1200 miles) and record again. You will find that the length of the day changes with latitude, and also what time of the year it is. A flat earth would have no day change based on latitude (or even the season).
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I gave up in the video when i realize that Eric Dubay had no understanding of gravity whatsoever. He keeps talking about rivers traveling a long distance, and that if the earth was curved, they would have to travel up hill then down hill (up the curve then down the curve). He is imagining drawing a line between the start and end and saying from that line gravity is down. Either he really is an idiot (likely) or he is intentionally misrepresenting gravity to prove his point.

       No one is claiming that the length of day would be different - I'm guessing you haven't honestly investigated this theory, have you? Different latitude experience different lengths of day because the sun rotates near the earth and near the equator. The proposed model looks something like

       First of all, this isnt true. If you think its true, then you have never actually been somewhere flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second one though... Good. God. Any tiny amount of critical thinking destroys that "model". How about we go through just a few of the reasons why that "model" is absurd.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        According to this image, the sun only lights up the area below it. Clearly the sun is not round then, because if it was, then as long as it is above the "flat" earth you would be able to see it. You would have to have some edge to the sun that would be like a lamp moving around in the sky, but if that were the case then on off angles instead of being a circle it would become elongated (an oval). Except the sun is always round.
       </li>
       <li>
        Next, if the sun is always in the sky directly above (as in the picture) it would never drop below the horizon. It would just be in the sky then suddenly gone.
       </li>
       <li>
        In order for that map to work, everything in the southern hemisphere has to get stretched to make it lie flat. This in turns causes huge oceans to the south which are significantly larger than have been known for hundreds of years. Just compare the distance between the tip of South America to Africa and the US to Europe. They are roughly the same distance, but that map makes it almost 3 times farther. Shit, just look at the size of the Pacific compared to the Atlantic.
       </li>
       <li>
        You could never go in a straight line either east or west, as you would have to keep turning otherwise if you went far enough you would be going south.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I could go on an on about the number of issues with this "model".
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, your strawman argument about gravity. Did you even watch the video you linked? According to the video:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We can describe gravity. We can say what it does to other things. We can...We can measure it, predict with it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I called Eric Dubay an idiot because he has no understanding of gravity, and he doesnt, because he is, in fact, an idiot. We know enough about gravity to predict how it interacts with something as small as an atom all the way to galaxies and the structure of the universe. Recently, scientists have even detected gravitational waves. You don't have to "prove the theory of gravity" (which i don't even know what you mean by that, and you certainly dont either) in order to
       <em>
        understand
       </em>
       gravity. And Eric Dubay doesn't even have a middle school knowledge of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly though, all this thread and shown me is the completely and utter lack of critical thinking skills required to believe such a theory. Truly, I now know that those people are even more delusional that i first imagined, which also lets me know there is no point arguing with such people. They are so far into their delusion that nothing will change their minds. Thus, I'm out.

       Yea i watched the video in which Tyson admits that he does not know what gravity is. Making predictions does not prove the model. For instance, predictions regarding lunar eclipse events are accurately made by believers in both flat and round earth model, for hundreds of years.

       Why does a helium balloon rise? Gravity? No, it is trying to reach a state of equilibrium where the environment is equally dense. Same with the apple that fell on Newton’s head - the surrounding air is less dense therefore it falls. No gravity is needed.

Once you understand why the earth is flat, you are basically god in charge of your own reality. This is the most basic human way I can possibly explain the truth.

       Personally I think it's because so many fields rely on the conclusions drawn from the heliocentric model. So for there to be a massive global conspiracy I must be part of it, every physicist I've ever worked with, the teachers and contractors and engineers and techs and business executives, all in the know and all dedicating there life to the cover up of a flat earth? I mean phones, airplanes, boats, cars, computers literally everything works using some aspect of the heliocentric model. I'd imagine anyone that has a deep understanding of one of those things might take offense at the idea that's he's part of a massive conspiracy. I might not comment a lot but if I come across someone questioning what I consider my life's work, I usually get offended and feel the need to comment.

       It's because as many things in this world are still unknown when someone comes and challenges something very elementary such as the shape of the earth, they aren't just challenging our knowledge, they are challenging our intellect. I'm​ no scientist but I can use logic to understand the shape of the earth by using scientific reasoning: sunsets, roundness of horizon, timezones, watching a timelapse of the celestial bodies as the earth rotates, pilots and sailors circumnavigating the earth, etc..., all of which do not go against a round earth model. So when someone comes along and challenges that they are also challenging my ability to use logic and I must be some sheep just listening to our overlords. That's my take on why people are so defensive about this issue. Tell me Bush did 9/11 and I'll say prove it because I don't have evidence he did or didn't, but I do know the earth ain't flat.

       watch the links, do the scientitic experiments your self (8 inches per mile squared) and you will see how easy it is to prove the earth is 100% flat. I would have never thought i would ever say something lie this, but if you actually look at it with an open mind (and with good understanding of the globe model) you will see it immediatly.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said, the attack on Flat Earth is very huge and organized, there is a good reason for that. Majority of Flat Earthers are NOT religious not cases, most of them examined the evidence themselves and were forced to accept that it shows the earth to be flat. This does raise the possibility of a creator (for me as well even though i was one of the biggest evolution and globe earth fans out there) but non of the thousands of flat earth friends on facebook i have will tell you its the same creator in the bible or quran or whatever. Only a few flat earthers do so because "the bible says so" and those are not better that people who blindly believe the globe with out investigating it first.

       Thank you for sharing the links, that's s ton of info. I've seen some and will check out the rest, as I'm sure the flat-deniers will as well.

       That's a good point about religion. I'm not religious but even when I believed in the Big Bang it seemed like a creator or creators set creation in motion like computer code, and it's still tough for me yo see how any of reality is accident or coincidence. Still, maybe a lot of hate for flat earth theories goes hand in hand with hate against religion, or that some scientific-minded people are conditioned to only believe in science dogma and shun any kind of creation theory. But creator or not, the earth appears to be flat for whatever reason, and after simple observation it's tough to deny that.

       Or maybe ya know, it's just fucking stupid that the earth is flat lol. Didn't we figure out it was a sphere like thousands of years ago? These people are claiming this conspiracy stretches back that far. I jump on any flat earth post because it's fun to watch people defend their crazy viewpoint. Am I a shill? Can NASA pay me?

       We
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       the earth was flat centuries ago. Then we
       <em>

       the earth was a sphere. What next? We'll

       NASA has no need to waste a single red cent on the likes of conformists who parrot whatever the commonly held beliefs are. They know enough people accept their master's word, and will fight tooth and nail to defend that word against all common sense and their own observation, even if it changes back and forth. In fact, it's the other way around,
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       pay NASA! Just don't wait for a return on that investment.

       This is my theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       That there is a secret out there so big that if it got out it would completely change the entire world. Some powerful people know and they are taking every step imaginable to keep it a secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever someone gets a little too close they go into full suppress mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not just Flat Earth and PG, it's almost all of them (UFO's, Bigfoot, etc.). And I think they are all part of the same secret.

       The secret? That our world history is a complete lie.

       I think you may be right. I can just feel it. I'll bet we aren't even touching on the actual secret stuff, but the first domino may be ready to fall which will eventually lead to the truth. The earth may be round, but flat earthers believe space is fake, and
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       might be the secret. Or there may be secret vast resource-filled continents beyond Antarctica, which, if exposed and people made a run for it, could wipe out world hunger and destroy the international economy, and
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       might be it. Or incredible technology or cures for all illness is hidden. Or like you say, the true history of life on earth could be revealed thanks to this kind of questioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of me is terrified of the truth. There is also a slight, albeit very minuscule, possibility that those in power have a benevolent reason for the great deception (that would go against everything we've seen from TPTB), such as keeping people from learning something that is forbidden knowledge, something aliens or other entities have forbidden for whatever reason. Maybe it's the hollow entrance to earth in Antarctica where terrible evil exists. Maybe just knowing it will change space and time! Of course that's taking it on a fantastical route, but truth is stranger than fiction, as we may well find out soon enough.

       People are appalled that something so ridiculous could be said or believed. Any time someone says something completely wrong there are people correcting them. And how can you not have an opinion on the shape of the earth? How do you think gravity works? Why are all the other planets and stars spheres? Why are the days longer in the summer? When you go on vacation how can the days be longer there?

       To be fair, that is how quite a few conspiracy theories work.  Pick and choose what evidence to believe, throw all evidence to the contrary out.

       Can you explain to me how it promotes intellectual laziness?  I see saying 'the earth is a globe because these guys over here say it is' and giving it no other thought past that as intellectual laziness, myself.

       Reinforces solipsistic qualities in people. Do you believe computers are magic because you have never seen an electron move through a circuit? Or have you actually seen a CPU shuffle values through a gate?

       Saying computers are magic is insane but you are taking the word of others if you have never those principles in action

       I don't see my food go through my gut but I see myself shit everyday, what's your point? It doesn't promote intellectual laziness.  If everyday people had the means to view an electron moving through a circuit they damn sure would do it and if something didn't look quite like it was presented would they be ridiculed for bringing those points up?

       It certainly does. If someone told you that when they eat food its broken down by shit elves and put into a furnace you would laugh in their face. To what lengths should you go through to prove its a normal biological process?

       My point still stands. A normal person doesnt have the technology to see an electron travel and a normal person doesnt have the technology to view exoplanets.

      <p>
       Why is one not magic but the other is?

      <p>
       I would also argue that with a little research into PCBs and how they function you could understand how it works without fancy technology. You can perform an experiment and see if the result at the end is what we would expect if an electron moves across the board.

       6 posts simply asking about FE theory (along the lines of "what is the best argument for flat earth"), neither positive nor negative

       10 Posts arguing against flat earth or arguing that it is a psy-op

       17 posts either supporting flat earth or complaining that people are calling it out

       Fairly convinced at this point that they genuinely believe it. Some people reach a point where they stop trusting anything/everything being told to them by people in positions of power. I'm pretty paranoid myself though not at the 'flat earth level' quite yet, thankfully. Hoping to never reach this point tbh.

       What I don't get at all is why such an earth would be enveloped by a gigantic dome. 🤔

       If you do reach that level, you will never again believe you are on a spinning globe. I'm not so much sure of the shape of the earth, whether it is concave, hollow, flat or a massive, massive globe unlike anything we're told it is, so much that I'm
       <em>
        certain
       </em>
       something just isn't right (no curvature, water is always level, scientist after scientist ptoving we are motionless, the absurdities of modern science dogma, and on and on). The evidence is too much once you look into it, we're clearly being lied to about the most basic stuff.

       Well I certainly don't want to make the people of this sub seem
       <em>
        bad
       </em>
       ! And you said far more than one word, but who's really counting. Spaceflight: all evidence points to all of NASA being complete fakery (bubbles in the water of "spacewalk" videos, green screen and astronauts hanging on wires on ISS, ISS videos showing no clouds at all at night, too much curvature of the earth, or sometimes forgetting to put lights on the night, satellites and ISS is made of material which should melt where they are, video of the spinning globe but
       <em>
        no

       moving clouds at all, the photoshopped word
       <strong>
        sex
       </strong>
       written in clouds in official NASA photos of the earth, Moon Landings: Ha, don't get me started!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Satellites are unnecessary and might not exist. Why have none of the 10,000 satellites in orbit ever seen in ISS video? Everything a satellite is supposed to do can be done by planes, cables and towers.

       not a single piece of that is true or accurate. Just because NASA might fake some shit to make pictures look good or create a flashy website, does not mean that nothing has ever left our orbit. Why should satellites and ISS melt where they are? Do you truly believe that satellites dont exist? How does Direct TV work? GPS units?

       NASA's website designers may be the same people who design the images of outer space. There never seems to be a single untouched picture published by NASA. Can uou see the problem? We have no way of knowing if it's all completely faked. It's all complicated because NASA may be a scam, and the earth may still be a globe, or the earth may be s globe but thry csn't leave LEO for some reason so thry hsve to fake everything, or outer space is not what they say it is, so they fake everything, or the earth is concave but space travel is real...we have no way to be sure if any of this is true.

       The temperatures supposedly can reach up to 4000 degrees where ISS is, thousands degrees hotter than the melying points of its materials (aluminum, titsnium, etc). The ISS may even be up there, but people can't survive on it. DirectTV could easily be just signals pointing to towers which repeat the signal, just like radio communications. That's why dishes aren't pointing up as you would think: they point to the towers. There is also an idea that the government figured out how to interact signals with thd
       <em>
        dome
       </em>
       , exactly how satellites are supposed to work. Did you know an author came up with satellites as fiction, and they supposedly became fact only two years later? Hmmm....

       Heat is essentially the activity level of matter. It's "hot" where the ISS is, but there is so little matter there that it does not transfer heat to solid bodies in a meaningful way, so it's not hot in the conventional way. E.g., if your arm was exposed to space it would hurt from the low pressure but not feel hot.

       The planets' gravity helps to create an atmosphere. Energy can travel through a vacuum. If an atmosphere is close enough to an energy source, when the energy hits the atmosphere it transfers to the matter in the atmosphere and you get heat.

        But death is not instantaneous. For example, one 1965 study by researchers at the Brooks Air Force Base in Texas showed that dogs exposed to near vacuum—one three-hundred-eightieth of atmospheric pressure at sea level—for up to 90 seconds always survived. During their exposure, they were unconscious and paralyzed. Gas expelled from their bowels and stomachs caused simultaneous defecation, projectile vomiting and urination. They suffered massive seizures. Their tongues were often coated in ice and the dogs swelled to resemble "an inflated goatskin bag," the authors wrote. But after slight repressurization the dogs shrank back down, began to breathe, and after 10 to 15 minutes at sea level pressure, they managed to walk, though it took a few more minutes for their apparent blindness to wear off.

       Do you think everyone at boeing, lockheed, or spaceX is a shill? I've watched the '200 proofs the earth is flat' video, and its literally the same misunderstanding of basic science 20-30 times. Go get a degree in mechanical engineering. Study combustion, or maybe EE and do satellite communication. TEST what they teach you on your own, don't take any of it for granted. Use your own findings to convince yourself. Don't live in a reality where you are question basic things that you can test yourself. There are so many things we have to question, and so many others that can be answered with just introductory knowledge of math and physics. Or maybe astronomy: get a decent telescope, and learn the constellations. Watch as they change seasonally. Then go down to the southern hemisphere and see new ones! We live in a world of physical, natural realities that we can understand, and perhaps super-natural realities that we don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think, aside from the scientific illiteracy of the flat-earth dogma, the thing that bothers me the most is how they are wasting their time on something so TESTABLE, when there is so much more interesting and enigmatic things to consider .

       posted some videos explaining certain parts of the FE theory that they find intriguing. Instead of this generating any kind of debate it instantly devolves into name calling and negativity.

      <p>
       When we outright dismiss nonsensical conspiracies without doing our own due diligence and research then we are no better than the masses who accept what Fox and CNN tell them at face value.

       Didnt see any videos. Though everyone on their right mind (or who has travelled, americans usually havent) knows how stupid flat earth theories are. There are some facts you cant challenge without looking like a potato. Its good to Be sceptical, its Bad to Be paranoid And stupid.

       Well I see you deleted your original comment. Again, you illustrate my point by devolving to name calling. Innovative and original ideas are usually labeled as stupid at first. Astronomers were persecuted by their governments and churches for spreading blashemy and false information. When we accept science's theories at face value without performing our own research then it is no better than religious dogma.

       Americans travel all the time. I'm American,  I have been all over Europe,  all over north America including Canada and Mexico. I have been to Japan and have been in the middle east. I'm only 25. Please don't say bullshit like "Americans usually don't travel". Do you not know how big the U.S.A is? You have people in Britain whom have never even left their tiny little island. I can get in my car and pretty much go any direction for hundreds and hundreds of miles.

       Why does everyone who disputes FE always resort to name calling? Using your unicorn example, I would argue that the narwhals existence could be linked to the myth of unicorns. Narwhal horns that wash up on beaches where wild horses roam for example could have been interpreted as evidence of unicorns in ancient times. Turns out there actually is a sea-unicorn. My point is not that I believe in unicorns or a flat earth, but that we should stop outright dismissing even the most outlandish claims. Usually there is a nugget of truth buried very deeply. Experiments and discussion can sometimes help coax that truth out, but dismissal, aggression, and negativity only serve ignorance.

       Ive heard this one before! So the upper atmosphere is actually really hot, way hotter than one would think. Like 2500C in the thermosphere where the ISS sits. What you are forgetting is how little gas there is.

       So if you have a handful of molocules per square foot even though they are at a high temperature there isnt enough of them to feel it.

       It would be like having a grain of rice 2500C and tossing it in with sand. The sand wont rise to 2500C

       high up when they take a photo its only of a very small part of the earth so after a dozens of passes the satellite has piece by piece taken photos of the whole planet. Now the clouds wont line up because they are in motion so they edit them to give the best images possible and never once have they lied about it being edited.

       Look up the DSCOVR-EPIC satellite. These are unedited whole Earth photos.

       Nice comment. I don't want to fuel the 'flat earthers', however I

       disagree with this statement.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_retroreflectors_on_the_Moon">
        Russia is known to also have two mirror arrays on the moon
       </a>

       It's cool, I'm a moon hoaxer so just wanted to clarify as I hear it allot from people who support manned landings. It's kinda irrelevant anyway as even if man did land it doesn't make the earth flat.

       If not obvious, catering for man is an order of magnitude harder then sending unmanned. For a start, you
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to get man back. period.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need air, food, water, warmth, protection from radiation and long term affects of Zero-G on the frail human body. A spaceship that can cater for these needs are going to cost and
       <em>
        weigh
       </em>
       considerably more than an unmanned lander, meaning lots of fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is just the plain old facts. Just look at the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_the_Moon">
        US
        <em>
         unmanned
        </em>
        failures
       </a>
       . We couldn't even
       <em>
        crash
       </em>
       a robot into the moon properly until 28 July, 1964. 5 Years later no single failure of all
       <em>
        manned
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        return

       missions. I'm not buying it.

       But why is it so hard? At the end of the day it's just a bigger ship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Air is sent anyways. Rockets need Oxygen to burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Food doesn't need to weigh that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water does weigh more. Although is still just a bit more weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Warmth isn't an issue as much as cooling is. Heat doesn't spread out easily in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Radiation isn't a large concern for a simple moon trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       0-g isn't going to be a huge concern for a week. Keep in mind the record is over a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, 5 years prior they had issues, and then fixed the issues. The math was improved, and suddenly it wasn't that bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the ship would cost a lot. And it did. Weighing over 6.5 million pounds, it could put a load of 310 000 pounds into orbit. Including the fuel. And once in orbit you're done the hard part.

       Tl;dr: I don't firmly believe any of this as of yet. These are just ideas, and I only speak for myself. I'm curious as to the shape of the earth and the nature of reality. I'm not sure what shape earth is for certain, but most signs point to it being far different than what mainstream science and the governments that control it say it is. I know the theories, and believe some of it and have problems with some of it. You'd have to watch the thousands of videos out there for a grasp of commonly accepted flat earth theory. But what I would start with, is seeking answers to the problems of your commonly accepted world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fermi's paradox: where is everyone? There should be someone else, but there isn't. Why? This all could be a hologram projected from somewhere else, another dimension maybe. Or a zoo, or petri
       <em>
        dish.
       </em>
       A domed earth could be a place for safe-keeping of life, by someone out there, whatever out there is.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you look at stars through a telescope and ignore the official science book pictures, the stars appear to us as though they are behind glass and within water. Sonoluminescence is light from frequency vibration in water, and those little mini-stars they can make with sound in a bubble in water in labs actually look just like some of the stars we see in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who made the earth and/or dome? That's like asking what existed before the Big Bang or why the Big Bang happened, there are only theories. I don't know, but one theory of mine is that we are put here not by creators but by preservers of sorts. Something surely created them, but that's another story. In every direction, if the earth is domed, we are held back, kept from escaping, which means we may have been put here for observation like a zoo, or a type of ark. We have only ever dug 8 measly miles into the earth, because the molten rock keeps us from digging deeper. If you go up, you can't breathe, hit deadly radiation, hit the dome possibly. Try to venture out, salt water and stormy seas are a barrier, then you get to ice and stormy weather and deadly cold, again thin air you can't breathe at high altitudes and then possibly the dome. It seems something put us here. It could have all happened by chance, a one in a 10 to the 40th power chance for life alone, and that's to say nothing of the chance of the universe forming how it did, and how it led to life being possible, or it could all be an experiment or remnants of a previous dead intelligent life out there, a repeating program to keep something of themselves around before the universe collapses. Or god(s) only knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       In our reality, we exist in exactly the right conditions for life against all incredible odds, there are signs of repeating code, patterns all over the place, signs this was all created. Maybe there was no purpose, maybe the creators were crazy. We may never know. But time and technology have led the human race to a point where we wonder why we are here and test boundaries in every direction. The U.S. government's Operation Fishbowl may have tested the dome, and satellite technology (bouncing signals off the dome?) came soon after. Someone may know the truth, and no matter if the earth is flat or concave or something, that someone doesn't want us to ask questions for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't the other planets flat? Merely observing things in the sky is no proof of the shape of our own earth. They can theorize that gravity makes balls of matter at that scale, but that is only a theory, and one possibly made to keep up with the narrative of a spinning ball zooming through space at a ridiculous 600 million miles per hour, spinning 1000 miles per hour. The stars may be very close, and they may be something totally different than science books say. Add to that the possibility of a dome, and as I said, another barrier to keep us here, creators or preservers may have put an infinite hologram on it, so you'll only ever see mostly empty space no matter where you look.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also tl;dr: the earth may or not be flat, or may be curved, but is not the size if not the shape that science teaches for sure. What it is and why we are here can only lead to speculation.

       OK, thanks for the in depth reply. I have a bit of a better understanding now, but unfortunately I'm not convinced due to fundamentally differing opinions (beliefs?) I have in regards to the science and other points you brought up. I don't have the time to produce as detailed a counter reply as I'd like to right now since I'm at work.

       Thanks for reading. I don't have concrete beliefs in any of this yet, and I admit there are problems in both models, flat or globe (maybe it's concave of course, which probably has its own problems). Going back before one month, you won't even find anything flat earth in my reddit history so I am new to this. Before that I was firmly believing in the globe earth. Things change, and I have to look at all the evidence, of which there is a vast amount of, on youtube and other places. Either way, there is much to learn.

       You can see what they say is ISS, but some people just believe what they are told. Some people claim to see a satellite occassionally, but more people have seen UFO's (I'd argue thry are UFO's more likely). And if there is a dome, you can't image they'd make use of it to bounce signals off of for GPS? Most people are not liars, they are dupes. My earth is the same as yours, I just don't believe what they say it is. What it is entirely I don't know.

       Bond's statement is true but doesn't apply to airliners because the GPS speed limit is mach 2. They don't work in airliners because GPS signals don't penetrate the body of an enclosed metal tube well enough for the weak sensor of a smartphone to pick up. I've had the same problem inside a train. If you push the phone against a window, you might get enough signal.

       You mean buildings? Because buildings have windows, much larger windows than a plane or a train. Because some buildings are primarily constructed of materials with low EMF shielding. And plenty of buildings do block GPS signal when you're in a windowless room, or even in a windowed room. I work in a room with floor to ceiling windows and I still lose GPS when I get more than 20 feet from the window.

       You need to understand the issue is not the height, but the speed. GPS location uses 3 different signals from different satellites to triangulate your location. It does this by having the satellite send what time it is by radio. Knowing the satellite is in a fixed geostationary orbit, and knowing their time is correct due to an atomic clock, your phone can do math to figure out where it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that you're closer to the satellites is pretty stupid to. They're 35786 KM away from the earth. 12 kilometers doesn't make a difference. But the speed does, since your phone can't do the math fast enough.
      </p>

       You seriously don't know the first thing about GPS.

       I assume you're talking about me? I'm not disagreeing with him. He just made the mistake of trying to answer your premise (that GPS doesn't work on airplanes) when the premise is false. There's a firmware encoded speed and altitude limit in civilian GPS receivers set by the military, which aren't reached by airplanes. But below that limit, higher speeds still require clearer and more consistent signal than when stationary. If you're stationary in a vessel with no GPS reception, you get no GPS. If you're going 500 mph in a vessel with no GPS reception, you also get no GPS. If you're stationary in a vessel with poor GPS reception, you can eventually get a lock because the software can piece together a triangulation from intermittent signal pickups from multiple satellites. If you're going 500 mph in a vessel with poor GPS reception, the software may not acquire a lock because the distance you've moved between signal pickups is too great for the software to reliably gauge accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's your turn to explain Flat Earth theory, since you seem to be saying different things from dandroid1_0, who is saying GPS does work everywhere (even on a boat in the middle of the ocean) because there's either secret radio towers everywhere or because radio towers transit a lot farther than we think due to it bouncing off of some dome that covers the earth.

       Ok man really. Really man. Not "Powerful" enough to understand signals when high speed? High speed like 800 km/h? Stop it. How do you depict radiowaves in your mind? How do you depict signal receiver in your mind? "Omg i cannot catch those signals because i am very fast like 800 km/h." I can use gps at airport inside a plane ok?

       To an extent. Mobile phones do use assisted GPS, not pure GPS.

       . This is because the GPS in your phone isn't exactly quick. Ever missed a turn, or taken a wrong exit while running google maps? It shows you following the route for a little bit because it's assuming you'll be there. After seeing you haven't, it takes your new position, and takes a little bit to re-calibrate to your new position, plus the route of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a high speed, with only GPS, a mobile phone will have a hard time getting a lock. Yes, in theory it should work well. However some planes do have connectivity issues.

       I used to have a dedicated GPS before I had a cell phone. it was a piece of shit. I had to be outside or in my car while setting a destination, not in my house. Otherwise it wouldn't get a signal. Cloudy days caused signal loss. Driving down streets with tall buildings even caused signal loss. Not having it on my dash, caused signal loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you know your location doesn't mean the actual GPS chip is in use. WiFi, Triangulation, and even data collection can be used to figure out where you are.

       The signals could be bounced off a dome if a dome exists. There is speculation that the U S government was testing the dome during Operation Fishbowl (strange name, isn't?). Science fiction writer Arthur C Clark came up with stationary sstellites, and then voilà, science fact. They could have learned to bounce signals off the dome, and satellites could have been the excuse.

      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, for there to be a dome as a result of an American it would have to be huge, global even. So it wouldn't be a dome, but rather a shell over the earth. But where the fuck do you get that much material? And how did they get it up there?

       I'd also like to point out that every satellite TV and internet company would need to be in on it, since they're paying to launch satellites.

       If the whole point of the space race was for public opinion (it's not like they really wanted the Moon for anything, they don't use it all, haven't been back in decades), then how would look to be the 1st place loser and a sore loser as well, by claiming it was fake? At the time, look how stupid and gullible the public was, so maybe USSR was just as duped. The rockets always arc out of view, and into high altitudes. Do you really think anyone left the van Allen belt and survived in that tinfoil wrapped thing? How about the lunar Module? So many wrecks, explosions and fatalities in rocket and air travel history. What incredible luck that not a single thing went wrong in thst mission, and they went to the Moon and bsck in one try! Not likely.

       You know that people traced the rocket's exact path, right? It's not like anyone lost sight of it ever. Also, the Soviet Union would absolutely have rather shown the United States to be untrustworthy and liars than just let them have a huge victory in prestige. Also, again, given that the Soviets had every incentive to prove them wrong so that they could show the world the superiority of Soviet technology and how the Americans were liars, they would have been monitoring the flights very closely, the whole way through. The Soviets had also penetrated the American bureaucracy thoroughly, and would have known if there was any attempt at a conspiracy, especially one involving literally hundreds of thousands of people.

       Like today, only a handful of people need to know. Anyone who knows and starts making noise at the preposterousness of it gets taken out in a fiery accident, like Vitgil Grissom. Again, think of all the people today who think the Moon Landings were real, even with all the pictures and video and endless anslysis which they did not have in the 60s, and you can see how duped they all were then, governments included.

       Well they sure do buy a lot of hairspray with a bit of that 25 billion they get from us each year. Why would they spray her hair up like that? What a joke. Of the 25 billion dollars per year, they make everything you see look somewhat, but not quite, real, then they pocket the vast leftovers. That's Hollywood production for you. But, just like Hollywood, there are plenty of bloopers...

       the Sagnac experiment, and Airey's failure. Michelson and Morley proved that earth is motionless by measuring light pointed in different directions, but Science declared it false by decree.

        Airey's failure

       is where a scientist proved that the stars move, not the earth moving, by measuring the tilt of his telescope required to see the light of the stars coming in.

       I dont have the time to break this down now but I encourage others to NOT watch youtube videos on these effects, most of them are slanted towards flat earth and leave out a bulk of the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read into it on your own, go read the actual experiments and their results. Aireys and MM are both over a hundred years old and were attempting to find evidence of aether.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sagnac experiment is a really interesting one and we to this day use the sagnac effect in gyroscopic lasers to detect inertia. This does not break special relativity and is worth a few minutes of looking over.

       that because those experiments don't understand relative perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       we have video footage in 4k high definition of sphere Earth from the ISS.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that's not enough to evidence to convince you that Earth is a sphere I don't know what else would or could be.
      </p>
      <p>
       there's also the evidence of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which isn't itself it's own entity, but is a description of acceleration towards a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is accepted due to multiple experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       such as using pendulum clocks at different altitudes and measuring time differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       we have speed test with airplanes too that have time tests too.
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as density and buoyancy that the flat Earthers preach is gravity can be tested and fails miserably because if everything was that, then everything in the water atmosphere etc would simply even out unless constantly mixed. what could possibly be mixing all the matter together?
      </p>
      <p>
       the flat earth movement is nothing more than a bunch of ignorant people using wit to convince other ignorant people of an idea.

       Are you really that stupid? How big is a satellite? Please look it up! Now compare the size of the satellite to, lets just the the surface of earth. Since we are in space it's a bigger diameter but you can have that in your favor. Now point it All Black and try and find 11.000 satellites from the hight of a flying air planer, scattered across the earth.
 Im pretty sure you wouldnt find a single one 😉

       I am that stupid, yes. I won't call you names tho, the programming didn't work out so well on me I guess. Find me a picture that doesn't use a fish eye lens on a 60 mile pic that proves the math, you won't.  What I can link you though are hundreds of independent pictures that show no horizon curve whatsoever, all around the "globe". Call me stupid all you like, I would rather talk about what we "think" we know, otherwise I'd say 'you're a retard because blah blah blah'

       Well, why hasn't gravity done that? What makes it the case that there can be mixing with gravity but not density? Esp when density is also well known and true with gravity.

       How do you account for polaris, the north star, which the stars appear to "revolve around"? This is exactly the type of phenomena you'd see from the axis point of a spinning globe. The way the stars move, the way polaris is fixed, this is exactly what a spinning Earth would produce.

       The stars appear to revolve around above us, as well, instead of the other way around. They have appeared in their paths around Polaris for millennia, never changing despite a constant 600 million miles per hour trajectory through space.

       The night sky could also be moving, as if it's on a giant disk or dome. Polaris would still be at the center, and all the stars would move around it in predictable circular paths, just like we see. You might have to watch animations to understand. This video explains the stars' movement on a flat earth:

       I accept its possibility. This whole globe/flat debate is here because so much of what we know about the universe could exist in either model. There are problems in both models, but from what I've seen, there are far more problems with the heliocentric spinning globe theory, and that's why people are asking questions.

       flat earth theory is too self centered. The axis wobbles, further the sun sets over the horizon. That wouldn't happen due to "perspective" as people claim. If that were the case the sun would gradually get smaller and smaller in the sky until it disappears. This clearly doesn't occur. The Sun remains a constant size throughout the day, from sunrise to sunset. The theory is not observable

       No its not. Watch a boat move away from you when youre on land, it will eventually disappear bottom first as it goes over the horizon. The only exception is very particular circumstances dealing with refraction. You may have noticed the effect when hot pavement looks like its shimmering.

       SR-71 Pilots have mentioned cruising at 2000 knots, although the actual top speed is classified. This is roughly 2300Mph. If a distance of 2300 miles can be traveled in one hour, it would have to accommodate for 667.9 miles of curvature in that distance (2300x2300x8÷12÷5280=667.9) or 1.85 miles every 10 seconds. It would be extremely noticeable and I'd imagine the g-forces would be more than a human could handle.

       I think youre forgetting an SR71 cruises at about 90k feet. Remember curvature calculations do require an elevation calculation. Besides Im failing to see how curvature would be an issue for a plane, just maintain altitude and fly. Can you explain why you mention this and why its relevant?

       Can you explain why you think the G forces from... Acceleration (I guess) would be too much? Where do you think the G forces are coming from and what G force do you think it is and why wouldnt a pilot be able to handle them?

      <p>
       Radius of Earth = R = 3959 mi
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the mass, m, of the object (plane) doesn't change much, and so the net acceleration, a, caused by bending a trajectory around a curve of radius R at speed v is,

       Using purely classical mechanics, the G-Forces generated by a plane travelling that speed close to the surface of the Earth is about 2% of gravity; i.e, ~0.02 Gs.

      <p>
       Since the calculation is dependent on 1/R, if one were to fly higher than the surface of the Earth the G-Forces would decrease. At 3 mi above the Earth (R = 3962 mi) the Gs become,

       Centripetal force, the source any G's they'd experience is given by: F=mv
       <sup>
        2/r.
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       So lets take "v" at at your value of about
       <strong>
        300m*s
       </strong>
       and "m" at the mass of a 727 (since SR71 mass in unpublished), which is
       <strong>
        40000kg
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we divide by "r", which is the radius of earth at
       <strong>
        6.3 million
       </strong>
       meters. We wind up with:
       <strong>
        F=571 Newtons
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at what "1 G force" is on the same plane. 1 G = m
       <em>
        a where a is the gravitational acceleration on earth of 9.8m/s
        <sup>
         2
        </sup>
        and "m" is again 40,000kg. 9.8m/s
        <sup>
         2
        </sup>
       </em>
       40,000kg =
       <strong>
        392,000 N
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the force of acceleration due to earths curvature is
       <strong>
        0.001 G

       Thank you, and I agree, admittedly it all seemed so silly until I actually looked at the evidence. We all have to take our own "red pills" on our own time, and not before. Though, I feel bad for those who haven't yet woken up to the idea of an earth shaped so differently than they were taught, because it's quite a thrill, mind-blowing in fact.

       Those same boats, when zoomed in on with a good camera, can be seen again whole, even though they have "disappeared" completely over the horizon.

       Yes, they really do. Whether the earth is spherical or flat, the #1 proof of a so-called globe earth is that ships disappear over the curved horizon, which is faulty. Since we know now that these ships can be brought back with a camera zoom, we know that they do not disappear over a curve. Bringing them back in a zoom would be impossible if they went over a curve.

       If you pay attention when they unzoom, neither the ship nor buoy sinks below the horizon when they unzoom meaning they aren't past it and the camera isn't bring them back. It just means that camera has a hard time seeing them when they aren't zoomed in.

       No that's what the Earth as a while should look like. A sphere. Because that's the way it will naturally disperse.

       Have you ever seen water in zero gravity? It will always start to form a sphere.

       Nah man, I just thought it was funny that he thought water can't be round. It's a pretty absurd thing to believe. A better example would be a water droplet falling through air. Although no analogy from the scale of every day life is perfect because gravity is responsible for the shape of the earth, whereas a water droplet has that shape because of surface tension.

       Why does it find level? Because of gravity, which pulls it toward the center of the sphere. When does water curve? Literally all the time. Put water in a narrow tube and look yourself:

       A majority of the FE people I have met absolutely NEED to believe it's true due to their religious beliefs.  It allows them to believe that the reason they are being lied to by the governments of the world is because Satan himself is controlling them and keeping the truth from us.  I have a coworker who, no matter the evidence I've provided to him, refuses to believe the Earth is a globe because "The bible says the Earth is flat, and we could never leave the Earth because of the firmament.".  There is no reasoning with them.  They could be taken to space and shown the Earth from orbit, but they would claim they were being deceived in some way or another.  It's absolutely ridiculous.

       It's just one coworker that I know who seems that deep into it.  My friends do not believe FE, and we often discuss the absurdity of it all.  I am in the South East, and there are quite a few people here that are deep religious.  I'm actually not comfortable stating that I am not religious, and telling someone you don't believe in god is essentially telling them "Fuck you and everything you believe".  There are still plenty of people who don't buy into the whole southern baptist lifestyle, but the older generations see us as misguided people.

       Fake.  We never went to the moon, in fact we can't.  The Earth as we know it is a disc traveling upwards through the heavens causing what we know as gravity, but that's also fake.  It's just the force caused by our acceleration through the heavens.  Satellites are high altitude planes, if anything.  Space station isn't real.  Sun travels in a circle around the plane of Earth at 3000 miles above its surface.  The firmament is the barrier between Earth and The Heavens.  Stars are balls of energy pulsing within the firmament.  The planets are the same, but closer to our vision.  I could go on, but it hurts my brain...

       You have to have not traveled overseas to believe in a flat earth. The earth is undeniably massive and the idea of this place being a flat disk is so wild. It also brings on questions you will not get a good answer from a flat earther like. What is outside this dome and is it infinite of finite. If it is finite what is past the finite barier and is that space infinite. What is above and below. Why bother with things like the sun moon and stars that appear to be spheres. If in fact you want people contained onto a platter wouldn't it be better not to give them the impression of a infinite universe around them?

       I don't think your coworker read the bible properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't find it but off the top of my head it says in Isaiah that the Earth I'd a circle, the translation can also be read as sphere. And in Job is says it rests on nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible is a complex, well written bit of allegory it bugs me when idiots misinterpret, take it too literally or misrepresent it. It leads to crusades and Munster rebellions.

       If we exist in a simulation, as various philosophers and an increasing number of physicists have posited, then the creators of that simulation may have not felt the need to extend the architecture of that simulation beyond what we would call Low Earth Orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing from within our simulation would be able to travel beyond a certain point, because there is nothing beyond that point, at least not a reality that we would be able to experience. And yes, this would mean space travel is impossible, because space is not part of our simulated universe. The movement of the sun, moon and other stars and planets is nothing more than a 2d projection on that "gigantic dome". And of course NASA and other space agencies would be very well aware of this limit to our simulated world - it is one of

       And if we are living in a simulated universe, then perhaps the certainty that we are living on a sphere hurtling through space (as opposed to a flat earth) is misplaced and ultimately irrelevant, because we aren't "living", period.

       The "dome" is virtual spherical projection screen which encapsulates our virtual planet.

       The simulated Earth was designed to behave exactly like a sphere, appearing to revolve on its axis every 24hrs, appearing to orbit the simulated sun every 365.26 days. From our intra-simulationary perspective, it is indistinguishable from a real planet (until you try to leave the reservation, so to speak).

       I suspect (our conventional understanding of) physics would deem many aspects of a simulated universe theory "impossible". The laws of physics may actually only apply fully in the universe/dimension which created the simulation that we inhabit.

       Regardless, it's physically impossible for a 2D projection on a dome at LEO orbit to exhibit certain phenomena that we observe.

       Whether or not there is any merit to the simulation theory, the notion that there is a 2D projection on a dome at LEO orbit is still blatantly incorrect.

       Well, if observation of light and matter is subjective at the quantum level, and what you see is, in part, determined by what you're looking for, then what you observe at the other of the scale (the perimeter of our simulation) may equally defy the laws of conventional physics...and/or optics. The simulation designers are not bound by our laws, or by what you think you are obverving.

       The biggest issue with that logic is it allows for limitless rationalizations. How would we even be able to prove we're in a simulation if the simulation is that complete? It's a fun mental exercise for sure but it could never be a valid scientific theory.

       In a multiplayer video game, each player's viewport (i.e. camera and screen) is rendered independently.  For a 2D projected sky to work correctly in that it appears differently depending on your location, it would also have to be rendered independently for each person, meaning each of us would actually have to be living in our own isolated simulations.

       From one persons perspective. The point is that people on different sides of the globe should be seeing completely different skyboxes. The dome shit is stupid. Why make the simulation flat, do you really think simulating a spherical adds more computational complexity than simulating a flat world whose sky behaves like a sphere?

       Do they need to come "from" anywhere? If we're in a simulation, they're just part of the illusion to make us believe there is matter beyond the perimeter. But the true illusion is that there is no matter inside the perimeter, either.

       Who knows, maybe learning the truth of our artificial reality convinced them there was no such thing as God (or Satan)? Why didn't any of the 100,000 individuals working on the Manhattan Project blow the whistle that they were creating a weapon that could destroy all of humanity?

       I see this argument brought up over and over trying to defend statements about why didn't anyone leak something about whatever, and it is always called out as bull.  The Manhattan Project had spies and leaks in it and was not some super secret surprise to the world.  I think the only surprise was that we actually used it on our enemies.  The Russians had pretty good knowledge about what was going on with it throughout it's development.

       It wasn't always that way. I remember first stumbling on the flat earthers in the late 90's or early 00's, and most if not all of them were basically trolls. It was just a few dozen people at the time, and it was almost like an intellectual exercise, like defending the indefensible. They enjoyed trying to plausibly explain away the plethora of evidence that the earth is round. Sure, they played it off as if they were true believers, but they were all winking amongst themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over time they started picking up gullible people who were not in on the troll, and now it's just embarrassing. No doubt that there are many true believers today, but I think there are still plenty who know better but are enjoying trolling the idiots who don't.

       I don't think they were trolls, for the most part. I remember the flat earth society as a group that would challenge people to not accept what they were told. They wanted people to use common sense and their own experience to reach an outcome, rather than just believe what they were told to believe. I think the vast majority didn't believe that the earth was flat, but they wanted to point out all the fallacious reasons that people believed that the earth was round.

       I agree with you that it has turned into a shitshow now. I miss the days when flat earthers were just people advocating that we all needed to do more critical thinking

       I think the beliefs that the idea historically ties to are what cause that idea. But what you were saying about not trusting anyone, I feel like thats starting to be me. At first when I was younger I watched a lot of Jk assassination type conspiracies. That was more supported as being a conspiracy. But now im at a point where I just google anything and then conspiracy after it. I guess its like, well if they are willing to lie about this, why couldn't this also be a lie?

       Exactly. I'm at this point too. I always think everyone has ulterior motives or malicious intent for everything they do. Or that they're completely fake and being paid to push some kind of narrative. I even have a hard time trusting people like Snowden and Assange now because I can't tell if they're compromised. But once you're at this point I guess there's no going back. I don't think we're in the wrong for thinking this way but it definitely doesn't make things easy.

       Most rational people dont. But most rational people can also look at the arguments and understand where the ideas originate. Believe it or not, many of the arguments that the FE crowd make, genuinely apply to both a flat and a spherical model.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO the evidence for a spherical model far outweighs the evidence for a flat earth but that doesnt mean their evidence should be ignored. Infact it may (conjecture obviously) point to a larger sphere than previously thought.

       My favorite is the guy who makes posts asking flat earth questions claiming he doesn't believe but is just curious. Then he will go on defending flat earth and pushing the flat earth narrative extremely hard. Then when people call him out he will say "I'm not a flat earther". It's becoming a daily routine

       Lol. I really do it just because I am curious about it. And I dont believe it either. My mind can entertain and be open to all possibilities without picking and choosing anything to be the real reality. The amount of hostility and attacks that anyone speaking about flat earth or asking questions about the globe earth or just investigating into it gets here seems absurd. Everyone shouts its a psyop and more posts that attack it get upvoted to the front page than there even is discussion about it here.

       They should be. The moon is 400 times smaller than the sun but also 400 times closer to the earth, so the sun and moon should have the same apparent size in the sky.

       How is that not how perspective works? If you take a 1 cm object and a 10 cm object and hold the 10 cm object 10 times further away, under what conditions would the two objects
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       appear identical?

       If they are not on the same plane. Imagine an object 15 degrees to your left, and another 20 degrees to your right. Even though one is technically 10 times further, the angle of view makes the planar distance more or less, using the law of cosines. For things to appear linear in Perspective you'd have to be fully aligned with both objects

       Ummm because one is a deception they can control, kinda hard to keep billions of people in the dark about the shape of their home. Yes, simple physics can determine how far it is. Math does not lie. Finally, they're not the same size in the sky? But even so, that's an idiotic argument. Why does the mountain miles away look the same size as the tree 20 yards away?

       No, they can't do it nearly as well anymore. These people bombed buildings in broad daylight and said planes were bombs.  They say you are a monkey's offspring. They say they are going to colonize a red light in the sky. They say they went to the moon and took dune buggies in suitcases. A camera waited for them to snap a picture of the landing. They say they have bombs that destroy whole cities, and show you video of model train sets blowing up to prove it. The camera is impervious to the blast? Wake up. They show you CGI of a spinning ball over and over. And we believed this shit, all of it, like the fucking morons they took us for. Not anymore, not me. Question everything they pound in. Don't watch the "news". Don't attack the craziest conspiracy theories. It may just be true.

       There's is literally so much evidence but there is one problem... Most people I speak to, I say to them ''how can I prove Earth is flat to you". To which there reply is that they don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can I prove something to you when you don't even know what evidence you are looking for? So many people are quick to point out that you can see ships at sea going over the curvature. But when shown high altitude balloon footage showing a flat horizon then go on to claim that you are not high enough to see the curve.. These people will constantly move away from facts and enforce their own beliefs when you clearly show things that contradict their argument.

       Please explain to me using FE theory the date/time of the next lunar eclipse, and over what part of the earth it will be visible. Heliocentrism does this with stunning accuracy, decades into the future. As far as I know, FE can predict NO future cosmological events. so it is a markedly less stable framework to build a model of the universe out of.

       Its not "inspiration" that keeps someone from doing this, its lack of a viable mathematical model. I mean, with Halleys comet, we have a model and theory that match up with primary observation perfectly. where is the FE model/theory (other than the untestable, evidence free theories claiming its a tiny rocket launched every 76 years/hologram/masonic plot) that explains it thru primary observation? As for the earth spinning, I think precession of the equinoxes (again, confirmed thru primary observation) shows that something is going on..

       Yeah its an amazing feature of our planet and we are lucky to be around while it lasts. In a million years this wont be the case, we are losing the moon very very slowly, she gets a few inches further away every year. Its not impossible its just improbable.

        The Moon's orbit (its circular path around the Earth) is indeed getting larger, at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year. (The Moon's orbit has a radius of 384,000 km.) I wouldn't say that the Moon is getting closer to the Sun, specifically, though--it is getting farther from the Earth, so, when it's in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun, it's closer, but when it's in the part of its orbit farthest from the Sun, it's farther away.

       Tidal drag just affects the rotation which is why the moon is tidally locked.

       They appear similarly sized based on our location and distance between the two from us. You can replicate this by taking two balloons of different sizes and holding them on strings until they are equal sized to your eye.

       Its a natural ice wall because the sun's circuit keeps it away from the frozen edges.

       Okay at least you think it's natural and not manmade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain to me why the sun's circuit would cause this phenomenon? Such a sharp edge? That's not how any heat source I've ever observed behaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly than that you need to explain how the sun's circuit interacts with observed reality. Most significantly: explain a fucking sunset.

       They may very well be, but I know people in real life (well, one person) that actually believes this shit.  Even after I explained to her that I have personally seen the curve of the earth (jumping out of a helo at 3500 agl), she still entertains the notion that the earth may not actually be round.

       Look above in this thread. There was just a guy claiming supersonic flight on a round earth would be impossible because the G forces from the centripetal force would kill the pilot. He did 1 line of algebra to "prove" this, which simple calculated how much curvature would be experienced per second. The actual math:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Centripetal force, the source any G's they'd experience is given by: F=mv
        <sup>
         2/r.
        </sup>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So lets take "v" at at your value of about
       <strong>
        300m*s
       </strong>
       and "m" at the mass of a 727 (since SR71 mass in unpublished), which is
       <strong>
        40000kg
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we divide by "r", which is the radius of earth at
       <strong>
        6.3 million
       </strong>
       meters. We wind up with:
       <strong>
        F=571 Newtons
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at what "1 G force" is on the same plane. 1 G = m
       <em>
        a where a is the gravitational acceleration on earth of 9.8m/s
        <sup>
         2
        </sup>
        and "m" is again 40,000kg. 9.8m/s
        <sup>
         2
        </sup>
       </em>
       40,000kg =
       <strong>
        392,000 N
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the force of acceleration due to earths curvature is
       <strong>
        0.001 G
       </strong>

       Dude, all of the FE math is extremely hand-wavey.

      <p>
       They take a single result from a single experiment and re-interpret it through their own way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half the arguments about plane-flight from one point to another don't take into account that atmosphere moves with Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half of the arguments don't take into account atmospheric refraction.

       The angle of sunlight at the exact same time of the year is different depending on where you are on the surfacd of the planet.

       This x 1000. Also, try doing a long-haul flight between Australia and southern Africa. Qantas has one, I've been on it a few times. If the earth was flat they would fly direct. But it's not. So they fly over Antarctica to save fuel. Pure economics dictates this, and I know that Qantas wouldn't spend millions of dollars a year on extra fuel (and possibly rule out the flight being profitable all together) if it wasn't for the simple fact that the shortest distance between those two points is around the BOTTOM of the sphere, not across it's circumference.

       No it wouldn't. If the sun is a very far way away (like in the round earth model) then the shadow would be the same everywhere. If the sun is close (like in most flat earth models) then the shadow would depend on how close you were to it, but you definitely wouldn't get the same results on a flat earth as you would on a round earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       To illustrate, on a round earth the sun would cast no shadow on the stick at the equator at noon, but if you were at the north pole the shadow would be very long because the light rays would be near parallel to the ground. If the sun was directly overhead on a flat earth it would also cast no shadow but no matter how far you moved away from that point (even if you went all the way to edge of the disk) you would never see the super long north pole type shadow. That's an extreme example, but the difference would be apparent even at normal distances.

       You can do this experiment yourself. Just stand under a street light at night. As you move away the shadow you cast becomes longer.

       Obviously, but the point isn't just to notice that the shadows have different lengths. If you measure the exact lengths, the distance between objects and the angle of the sun in the sky, you can calculate the curvature of the earth. A flat earth and a round earth won't produce the same results.

       I've already disproven this and you're just being stubborn. The angles of the shadows cast are determined by their position relative to the sun in both models. You are merely extrapolating to prove your own beliefs. Tell me, when did you start believing that the earth is a spinning ball?

       There are other planets in our solar system that you can view with a telescope. Its not unusual for a planets moon to become tidally locked (I think its like 20 or 30% of satellites are locked).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wanted you could go watch Jupiter or mars and observe their moons. We can see more than 50% of their moons surface. We can even observe a moon moving behind its respective planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if every planet and satellite in our solar system is a globe what proof do you have that the Earth and its satellite is different?

      <p>
       You first image is again pretty easily refuted. The company I work for rents time on an imaging satellite for topographical stuffs. Look at how warped those continents would have to be for this to work. There is no way that has gone unnoticed by everyone. I mean you think the Japanese would bomb Pearl Harbor in secret but behind closed doors every military is in on this?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your second image, the UN map not showing Antarctica doesnt prove much of anything.

      <p>
       Im not sure how to phrase this more clearly than I have. I have friends who own telescopes that have a high enough resolution to see clear details on planets in our solar system. Clear enough to see them "spin". For example there is a very large "scar" on Mars. If you watch Mars over a long enough time you can see that scar turn away from you. This shows at the very least Mars is a globe and spins.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you get a fancy enough telescope you can see moons orbit their respective planets by going in front of then behind them. This is getting into pretty pricey territory for a telescope but not impossible.

       Im very active on FE subs I understand your map.

       No they were not complicit, they were provoked like I said. Research the Gulf of Tonkin which was a false flag just like 9/11.

       As I have said previously through observation with a telescope you can observe the planets showing us different faces, they do this in a very regular fashion meaning they are globes. You could project a radio signal at the planet and see how long it takes to return to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could use parallax to determine how far planets are. Set up two different viewing points on the planet and then determine the discrepancy between the two results to find approximate distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could finally observe the impact the planets have on the objects around them. regardless of whether or not you believe gravity we know for certain that planets project influence of some kind on the objects in our solar system. Because we have so much data about gravity and can very accurately model these interactions we can  determine the mass and gravitational influence these planets project.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know of a model that can be that accurate?

       'The model works perfectly' - And yet the Theory of Gravity remains unproven. Otherwise give me an experiment or observation which proves mass attracts mass and I'll hand you a helium balloon. Let go of the balloon and watch as raised to the altitude where it's density is at equilibrium with the atmosphere around it. Drop an apple and watch is seek it's density equilibrium, falling through the less dense air around it.

       You see models are not proof. They only model your theory. Ancient peoples were able to predict lunar / solar eclipses, yet no one ever told them to believe the earth is a spinning ball. Yet, I don't believe their models are scientific gospel.

       No, the mechanism is unproven. Even then there are some very compelling theories and it is a matter of time before the mechanism is definitively proven. The model of gravity works fine.

       You cant have density without an attracting force... like gravity. I dont  believe you ever challenged the point I raised a while ago about mixing oil and water in zero gravity, they will not separate. So why will they separate when near a large object with gravitational potential? Helium is less dense but only if there is a force pulling all the gases at an equal rate. You have not explained or given an alternative to gravitation.

       Not many ancient people believed that... At least as of about 1800 years ago. Look up the mayans and their incredibly advanced cosmological calendar. Eratosthenes figured out the circumference of the Earth in 300 BC. The idea ancient people honestly believed that is disingenuous.

       You're absolutely right about me not having a telescope. I had a very simple one as a child and I did use it to look at what I was told are Venus and Mars. However I was never able to actually see anything like

        this

       Consider this: When Newton developed his theory of gravity he was unaware of the magnetic force. Today we know that every body, where it be organic or otherwise, has a magnetic field. Both of our models agree that earth itself has a giant magnetic field with a pole at the north. Magnetic fields are absolutely observable and testable. Even in public schools we revealed magnetic fields by pouring iron shavings over a magnet which then aligns the shavings in a way that outlines the influence of the force which is otherwise invisible. So we can prove that magnetism has the ability to attract and repel objects and energies.

      <p>
       In addition, we see that as in a lava lamp density / buoyancy affects the relative position of the liquids. A hot air balloon controls it's buoyancy to reach a new state of equilibrium at a different altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the forces which we can actaully directly test are explainable through electromagnetism and density (which is really another expression of the electromagnetic force acting on the very small). We only need gravity to prove the theoretical.

      <p>
       Eratosthenes' experiment is pseudoscience and works on both models. Just think about it: Two six foot tall men stand under the same street lamp with no other light source. When the light hits them from the same angle they cast shadows of equal length. When one of them moves away, the shadow becomes longer. What Eratosthenes did was calculate the amount of curve required to cast a given shadow given that the sun is a very far away. He did not prove that model to be correct, he only calculated the curve for that model.

       And in zero gravity what is the density of an unknown object, how would you find it? For objects to separate according to density there must be an attracting force. As I have said before mix oil and water and leave them in zero gravity (Whatever) even though the densities are different they will not separate.

      <p>
       Now consider this. Newton was brilliant but a little nutty. We can prove that magnetism attracts objects of opposite polarity. Lets run a very simple experiment to prove this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Build a box that is EM shielded. These are pretty easy to make. Put an object in the box and measure the objects weight. An item in an EM shielded box behaves the same way as if it werent in that box. This means there must be a force attracting that is immune to EM shielding.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can even take it a step further. Make this EM shielded box a vacuum. So we have no density conflicts and we have no EM therefore the item in the box should be weightless. Is it? No, again you could run this experiment yourself if you had the desire to do so.

       Oh, I already have. I've rather acquainted with them. I could bother typing out the actual argument revolving around sunsets, but I'm tied of doing so and the person I'm talking to just ignoring it. Simply put, sunsets as they are observed cannot occur on a flat Earth. The only explanation is a spherical or cylindrical shape.

       Wrt the pendulum, if you think the initial swing is enough​ to explain the behavior of a Foucault's pendulum, I would like to hear an actual explanation as that seems preposterous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wrt your sunset comment, I'll copy paste myself:
      </p>
      <p>
       The numbers referenced are taken from the flat Earth society wiki, or calculated using those numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flat Earth model relies upon "perspective" to explain the sun and sunsets. I put that in quotes because they just don't understand perspective, yet reference it constantly to hand wave away issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       The common flat Earth model has the sun orbiting in a circle parallel and above the plane of the earth by some 3-4000 miles (it really depends upon who you talk to. There's no real consensus and challenging them on a particular point results in a pivot of the argument)
      </p>
      <p>
       This has several problems. The first being that the sun, being higher than any object on Earth should always be visible from anywhere on earth. At 3000 miles up, and, to put it as low in the sky as possible, a full circumference length of the round earth away (so basically standing on one edge of the earth and looking at the sun above the far edge of the earth opposite you), the sun will still be 6.88° above the horizon, and the angular size of the sun will be .07268°, just the tiniest dot, whereas directly above you, its angular size would be .61°, 8.39% larger, which is slightly larger than the angular size, .53°, listed on Wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second being that because the sun is never below the horizon, if your view isn't obstructed by any foreground object with an angular height greater than 6.88°, then the sun should be visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earthers have a variety of explanations for this, including the sun being a giant spotlight that doesn't shine on some parts even though it should otherwise be visible. As the sun is always a circle, even when setting, this is clearly not the case. Add in the sun still illuminating the sky well after it is no longer visible and the argument just falls apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the shape of the sun being a sphere or a circle, it maintains a consistent size, with some variation for atmospheric effects, and being perceived as larger when near the horizon due to there being something to compare it to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly no self respecting flat earther would accept the results of any cartography expedition, as it is too easily manipulated by whatever sinister forces are responsible for the deception. This is a very simple argument that anyone with two eyes and the ability to apply basic reasoning can understand.

      <p>
       Such a pendulum is merely a ball and socket joint connected to a pendulum. Ball and socket joints facilitate circular momentum. The pendulum is set into motion by lifting and releasing the pendulum, however it is impossible to release it in a 100% straight motion. Over time this results is a slight circular motion. Moreover, pendulums rotating in opposite directions from the same hemisphere.

       'jabronis?' - Love it. Trust me I've had this discussion with people on many subs including those dedicated to debunking the subject. I'm only interjecting here because r/conspiracy is the one sub I still read on this god-forsaken site and I thinks it's hypocritical to denounce the theory since most people here don't even understand what that theory proposes. For instance most people think that you cannot circumnavigate the earth according to the FE model.

       Foucault's pendulums - different pendulums swing in different directions from the same hemisphere. It is impossible to set one in motion without angular momentum. Think about it, it's just a ball and socket attached to a pendulum. You swing it and any angular motion is proof that the earth is a spinning ball?

       Jump on your choice of flight tracker website, and look for flights within the southern hemisphere to destinations also within the southern hemisphere (YSSY (Sydney, Australia)to SCEL(Santiago, Chile) is the most obvious, but I'm pretty sure any flight of a reasonable distance will show it), and look how the tracked data shows the flight line curving toward Antarctica. On a flat earth model, the shortest line between those two points would be North, going over North America.

       Cant have density without a force pulling on it. What is that force if gravity is a myth?

       If I mix oil and water and dump it out into a zero gravity vacuum it wont separate even though the densities are different. They will however separate on Earth because there is a force pulling them down at the same rate.

       Well, I'd say the difference here is that literally everyone can experience gravity on his own. Hell, just jump and watch yourself get pulled donw. FE theory, on the other hand, cannot be disproved without a)some convoluted experiment that is easy to ignore/dispute, b) actually going up into the space and looking down at earth. And since nobody here can do the second...

       Or possibly you experience a different force. Scientist are trying to accurately model it. It doesn't make sense with current models. Not on flat earth or any earth. It's just a miscommunication when you you say you can experience gravity. Something holds us down but smart people are researching it. So you just can't dismiss someone who suggest a different idea. Most likely they are wrong but you don't know for certain either.

       Yeah, but the point is you can't just say "gravity does not exist". There's some force that holds us down(no pun intended), and we call it gravity. It will still exist, even if it caused by completely different reasons that we believe in right now.

       It's that there is a theoretical possibility that electromagnetism and space time could explain gravity. I haven't done the math, I just saw that pointed out one time last week and today. But gravity is a problem to explain, scientist know that and are trying to figure it out. It's doubtful it's that simple but I mean it's worth looking at. Can it be made to work?

       <em>

       be the answer in a few cases but when asked if electromagnetism can simulate what we assume to be gravity thats a big no.

       Build an EM shielded box, we know how to do this. Hell build one as large as a stadium and notice that you are still being attracted to the ground.

       That is an interesting idea, so that helps. But I'm imagining the force running through the earth from pole to pole, that's where the "gravity" force would be so basically the same. So if you're pulled toward the center then does the box effect that?

       Two things to add, whats the focal length of the lenses involved? The distances involved are also misleading. So that apollo photo showing a "small" earth was taken from 200k miles away from the moon itself using (Im pretty sure) standard old school 70mm film, Im not sure about the lens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine that EPIC is nearly 1 million miles away taking a photo of the moon at nearly 800k miles away, the Earth is "only" 200k miles from the moon in that instance.

       It technically is... The center is slightly enlarged from the tidal forces, its not a "perfect" circle.

       About the Neil Degrasse Tyson thing, you are misunderstanding what he means. He doesn't mean it's literally the exact same shape/proportions as a pear. He means if you look at the tropic of Cancer vs the tropic of Capricorn you would see that the earth is ever so slightly wider at the tropic of Capricorn than the tropic of Cancer. It still looks pretty spherical at a glance, because the variance is relatively small, but when you measure it then you do see it there.

       You will argue that every photo shown to you is doctored because they weren't taken by you or the poster. FE's are the same as religious folks. They believe something because it can't be disproven to their satisfaction and everyone attempting to disprove them is using falsified evidence.

        Why does NASA say it's not a globe or sphere?

       <p>
        Because of the combined effects of gravity and rotation, the Earth's shape is not quite a sphere but instead is slightly flattened in the direction of its axis of rotation. For that reason, in cartography the Earth is often approximated by an oblate spheroid instead of a sphere. The current World Geodetic System model uses a spheroid whose radius is 6,378.137 km (3,963.191 mi) at the equator and 6,356.752 km (3,949.903 mi) at the poles.

       I'm not tying to be a dick, but you linked me to a page for a spheroid, which is a model that can be used to represent the Earth. There are a few models for the Earths shape. So if someone tries to prove the shape based off of the model, it can be done. Is that the source of the confusion? If it is then every post in here that's mocking flat Earth needs to have a reality check. You would see that you don't know science, because if you see someone proving a model wrong then it tells you that the model isn't 100% correct but nothing more. So one says flat the other says sphere, both models can't be totally right. There is an academic discipline studying this.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point is the amount of people who mock and call crazy someone when they don't know what the person is even saying. I mean people are saying "round" but flat earth thinks round. So mocking someone and calling them crazy for drawing the wrong conclusion from a model, shows that no one understood the other. I mean who knows what someone could figure out if we did science together.

Top Minds of Reddit / Conpiratard trolling hobby to come here with alts and spew dumb shit like flat earth and exaggerate real concerns into nonsense, like taking 9/11 and twisting it into some hologram nonsense, or taking Zionism concerns and twisting it into blatant antisemitism, or taking weather modification concerns and twisting it into I don't know how contrails work herpa der chemtrail nonsense, or taking specific vaccine concerns and driving the narrative into nonsense backed stereotypical autism stuffs.

       No, you need to align your dish and tune it to a radio signal. A radio signal which can come from a tower, or reflected off the atmosphere.

       That is exactly how em waves work. Various frequencies of electromagnetic waves behave differently in different mediums.

       Rockets are a scam. They are primitive technologies representative of primitive levels of conciousness.

       You guys always seem to dismiss the fact that the globe model has been established loooong before space industry and NASA existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even today space industry is (by far) not the only branch involved in depending on the shape of the earth. What about sailors, cargo ships, pilots, geologists, civil engineers, geophysicists....? They can't be all in it, impossible. There would be more people in it than not, so it wouldn't be a conspiracy anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's say all those people are clearly not in it. To believe in globe earth when in reality it's flat, all of them would have to be fucking stupid not to see how their results differ from reality, every day and in every single detail. And still no one ever raised their voice about it? I think we can agree that's impossible, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I hope you can draw your conclusion from that by yourself. Otherwise I'm glad to help.

       Maybe he had a wide angle lens. A lot of cheap / lightweight / compact wide angle video cameras pointed at the horizon will show a distinct curve. My drone camera looks crazy AF but unless you know what you’re looking at you could easily mistake it as "curvature of the earth"

       Do some research. Do you not realize how high above the earth he would have to be for that kind of curvature? Not even the ISS sees that kind of curvature. Again, I'm not arguing for the earth being flat but for you people (FE and non FE alike) are using shitty examples.

       You cant see the curve from whatever height your drone can fly. Its even debatable what altitude people can/have seen the curve, with numbers ranging from 35,000-60,000 ft. Even at those altitudes its so subtle that its questionable. This is a big supportive argument for at least being open to flat earth as a thought experiment. Theres a lot that we
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       we see because its what we
       <em>
        expect
       </em>
       to see, when in fact we are not seeing it. Part of the FE thought process is the Zetetic Method, which relies on personal observation as opposed to trusting the theories and data previously laid out for us. In other words, most people only "know" the earth is round because its what theyve been taught, but have never questioned or examined for themselves. Its a valuable approach, as we're taught so many lies and manipulated by them. I respect that about FE inquiry. But FE theory is so flimsy and unable to answer certain questions that it doesnt hold up in the end, and I lose respect when members of that community are in denial about that part of it.

       I think the best argument against flat earth is the fact that the Heliocentric model has the ability to predict the future with stunning accuracy. Ask a FE believer to tell you, based on his model, when the next lunar eclipse will be, or the date and time of the next transit of Venus, or even the year when Halleys comet will return.  they have nothing.

       That argument wouldn't work for flat earthers because they cannot describe the mechanism by which celestial events occur. So under a flat earth model, you could have all the same observable phenomenon and that wouldn't necessarily mean that the round earth model is automatically true.

       That's the magic of math though you can create models that work for both. To be fair the heliocentric model has had to admit that the distances involved are much further than when it was first proposed. In fact they've pushed the distances of our sun and the stars back farther and farther to make the model fit correctly.

       I took the time to actually read the entire Wikipedia page, every section, on GPS. It always, and I mean always, leaves room for 100% ground-based positioning. It states ground-based are far superior. Why even use satellites then? Only, I guessed, where ground based antennae are not feasible. So I looked. And guess what! These places, large swaths of ocean, desert, and tundra have no GPS signal! Look at the Malaysia airlines example. Look at the giant tower "masts" along the shipping lanes. There are no GPS or any other satellites in "orbit".

       Except they do. GPS works by reception only. We don't know where planes go because they can't communicate to the outside world. Seriously, go to the coast and get into a fishing boat. How the fuck do you think large shipping liners, commercial fishing boats, or even smugglers, travel the seas? I'll wait. Yes, the stars are an option, but not perfect. And not viable on cloudy nights.

       . The first satellite. It was visible by over 150 watch stations, and even more civilians. Detectable on short wave radio. It managed to do 1440 orbits, transmitted for 21 days, and was visible for 3 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you say plane, it was moving at 29 000Km/h, 8 times the speed of the SR-71 blackbird. and did an orbit every 96.2 minutes.

       What's your explanation to this?

      <p>
       Satellite Internet packages can have somewhat decent speeds. Comparable to DSL. However, the Ping is garbage. Strangely enough, this ping is, somehow, just over the amount of time needed to send a signal ~71000 Kilometers. Half the height of a geostationary satellite's orbit height. Go to any farmer, or small town that only has Satellite internet packages and see for yourself.

       You, my friend, are defending a ridiculous lie, and don't even know it. How can orbits not decay? If they do, how are the space station, and Hubble telescope, being so heavy, to remain at altitude? You are under a spell, and will pull an answer from the same place the Moonwalking Astronauts pulled a Dunebuggy out of. Unless you grow weary of being lied to, and begin to question your handlers. It's not that everyone is in on it, it is that everyone starts life under it - stacks and piles of falsehoods. It takes a while to muster courage to be skeptical. Like I said, give not a shit what fucking shape I live on. But I don't care to be misled, and am suspicious of professional liars like the ISS crew on their harnesses in front of their green screens. I'm suspicious when a continent is off limits. When a plane goes missing so easily in the southern latitudes. When nobody has circumnavigated north-south. When flights only cross north of the equator to refuel and back, never south to north and back. When the U.N. flag 100% matches the flat earth society map. The Antarctic barrier, and all the "southern hemisphere" flight route inconsistencies suddenly make sense. There is much more, too. More of what should be undeniable cause for serious inquiry. Sources matter a lot when, considering the evidence, and the demonstrable intelligence of real people like me who are telling you to wake up. When you see others viciously attack the messenger as if they are Kidnapping and raping kids and whatever the real global elite reportedly tend to do now and in much of history. All I'm saying is, the Earth is flat, based on my own investigation. It began after seeing the ISS is a lame hoax, and endless lies and fake shit from NASA. They insult our intelligence, but get major respect while I am told to commit suicide for broaching this topic from any angle to lend credence to the long-held traditional and orthodox view of all our ancestors. Flat earth is so despised, so reviled, so under- and mis-represented, it should be the first thing for anyone to want to debunk. And if so easily debunked, a map of the Flat Earth ought to be the last thing for powerful, mind-manipulating institutions of the world leaders to struggle against, get emotional about, and edify on their own flag.

       . It is a company that sells remote sensing products. These products collect data and GPS coordinates and then satellite phone that data to a server for logging. That map is showing their remote sensing systems data coverage capabilities. The map you linked is for the GlobalStar data service. There is also another map on that page for the Inmarsat's data service coverage which offers more coverage than GlobalStar. The map you linked in no way demonstrates the limits of GPS coverage to determine your position. In fact, I have been hiking in remote locations where under your assumed model of land based GPA signals reflecting off the firmament dome would still be impossible to receive a signal to determine location, yet I had more than 4 satellites available on my GPS unit and was able to safely navigate my waypoints.

       I've seen no such demonstration so far. I'll also add that being intelligent in no way leads one to come to correct conclusions. The process, the scientific method, is what's important. In fact, intelligent people can be better at convincing themselves of irrational beliefs. So far, I've only seen you try to come to a predetermined conclusion on weak and poorly understood evidence. It looks like you started with a conclusion you wanted, googled it, and found an image that confirmed what you wanted, then your search stopped there with no further critical inquiry. You didn't even take the time to understand what you were looking at.

       So far, you haven't demonstrated it's a ridiculous lie or that you're engaging in skepticism. I've asked in another thread for your best top 3 arguments but haven't heard anything. YOu said you had some scientific and engineering background, so I'm interested in this thread and how you became convinced of a flat earth. But, so far I'm unconvinced that you know what conducting science even looks like or how to be a skeptic. Being skeptical means questioning evidence, but it also means being aware of poor thinking traps humans fall into. You must be aware of logical fallacies and reliance on negative evidence humans are prone to do. So far, you have only offered negative evidence. I don't understand orbital mechanics, therefore flat earth. Negative evidence and a logical fallacy called argument from ignorance. The ISS seems fake, therefore flat earth. Negative evidence, argument from incredulity. I can't travel to Antarctica, therefore flat earth. Appeal to conspiracies. By the way, you don't have to be a scientist to travel to Antarctica, they require many support staff for the facilities that house the scientists to do their work. You could certainly take a temporary job there if you wanted to investigate for yourself. Continuing..., I don't understand how a plane could go missing over an ocean, therefore flat earth. Appeal to ignorance. Nobody has circumnavigated north to south, therefore flat earth. Negative evidence. Flights only cross north of the equator to refuel and back, therefore flat earth. Negative evidence. The UN flag matches the flat earth map, therefore flat earth. Appeal to coincidence.

You're bastardizing science and ignoring simple concepts to take a pre-conceived notion and filling in the blanks around it. You are doing noting but making yourself look bad by not answering questions, or linking sources. You didn't even give a single personal mention to BN, NDT, Elon, etc. But rather bashed the lunar missions and the mars rover.

        All large solid objects in space are round because of gravity pulling mass towards each other.

      </p>
      <p>
       However it can't be a dome. We know that it didn't exist in the ancient times, unless historians are hiding the fact because they to are in on it. And that it couldn't be built, since we'd see it easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also can't just be atmospheric bouncing of signals. since there'd be a lot of dead zones.

       It also can't be ground based since it'd cost a fortune, and would be unusable in the ocean.

       There's actually a really simple experiment you can do to show that Earth is not flat:

      <ol>
       <li>
        Watch sunset at the beach lying down.
       </li>
       <li>
        Just as the last sliver of the Sun fades, stand up
       </li>
       <li>
        See that the Sun is visible again for some half a minute.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The effect is even more pronounced if you quickly run up a hill (or a

       Sunsets + timezones. It wasn't apparent when travel took far longer and there wasn't instantaneous communication to other time zones, but this is the simplest and most obvious demonstration. The flat Earth model does not explain sunsets. It tries, but mostly acts like it has.

       Starts rotating in different directions in the sky.

      <p>
       The fact that days are longer in the south during winters in the north, and longer in the north when it's summer. For that to happen on a flat earth it means the sun would have to light a wider area in winter, and smaller area in summer, not to mention it would have to move from tropic to tropic as it turned as the seasons changed.

       This is much more simply explained by the earth being round and on a tilt.

       I have a friend who believes it, its much more sophisticated then making us look like loons, we already do in the eyes of the general public. I think the psy op has more to do with shattering progress in the truth community, turning like minded conspiracy people against each other. Also they want to see how far they can make people believe in the most unprovable claims. Some people want to be outside of the norm and will grasp onto anything that they feel makes them superior to all the normies cause they have hidden knowledge, its how some secret societies and religions operate.

       The thing is, not all of them are driven by religion. Not even close. I wish they were because it'd be easy to ignore the whole topic then.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a growing number of flat-earthers claims to have revealed "true science" by themselves, although having literally zero experience or know-how in science, because all known science is just NASA fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       And because of their infinite ignorance, loss of reality and Dunning-Kruger they use their "science skills" to prove flat earth with scientific arguments, not religious. Just some examples: Density (no gravity), perspective (curvature), "moon's diamagnetism" (causing tides) and many more... this is by no means a religious approach.

       it is so someone can point as say oh they are a conspiracy nut and thinks the earth is flat.  they infiltrated the true movement to salt the well. Eric Dubay  from yogo instructor to forest dont exist. once he made a rap song it was a little obvious of what his motivation is.  and it is not Truth.   Eric should go find some mma fighter and get in a street fight.  So he can prove these fights never last more than 8 seconds and his eye gouges and bites will be a great defense against MMA.

       In fact, the flat earthers might be good as test cases.  If we could come up with tactics to successfully extract their heads from their asses, we could apply the same tactics to people who religiously cling to the belief that foreign fanatics using only box cutters managed to take down three sky scrapers and the Pentagon budget office.

       OK psy grad student, see my post in this topic i just made. I mean tell me who is clinging to their beliefs? First, if someone sets out to prove the shape of the earth isnt a globe, they can do it, but they can then falsely conclude that the Earth is flat. So when you just read the literal academic discipline of science, you see that it isn't globe or flat, but thats where everyone gets hung up. See what NASA says in my link or read the history of the "sphere earth" and then you will understand.

       <p>
        The expression figure of the Earth has various meanings in geodesy according to the way it is used and the precision with which the Earth's size and shape is to be defined. While the sphere is a close approximation of the true figure of the Earth and satisfactory for many purposes, geodesists have developed several models that more closely approximate the shape of the Earth so that coordinate systems can serve the precise needs of navigation, surveying, cadastre, land use, and diverse other concerns.

        Geodetic data[edit source]
Because geodetic point coordinates (and heights) are always obtained in a system that has been constructed itself using real observations, geodesists introduce the concept of a geodetic datum: a physical realization of a coordinate system used for describing point locations. The realization is the result of choosing conventional coordinate values for one or more datum points.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of height data, it suffices to choose one datum point: the reference bench mark, typically a tide gauge at the shore. Thus we have vertical data like the NAP (Normaal Amsterdams Peil), the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD 88), the Kronstadt datum, the Trieste datum, and so on.
       </p>
       <p>
        In case of plane or spatial coordinates, we typically need several datum points. A regional, ellipsoidal datum like ED 50 can be fixed by prescribing the undulation of the geoid and the deflection of the vertical in one datum point, in this case the Helmert Tower in Potsdam. However, an overdetermined ensemble of datum points can also be used.
       </p>
       <p>
        Changing the coordinates of a point set referring to one datum, so to make them refer to another datum, is called a datum transformation. In the case of vertical data, this consists of simply adding a constant shift to all height values. In the case of plane or spatial coordinates, datum transformation takes the form of a similarity or Helmert transformation, consisting of a rotation and scaling operation in addition to a simple translation. In the plane, a Helmert transformation has four parameters; in space, seven.
       </p>
       <p>
        A note on terminology[edit source]
In the abstract, a coordinate system as used in mathematics and geodesy is, e.g., in ISO terminology, referred to as a coordinate system. International geodetic organizations like the IERS (International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service) speak of a reference system.
       </p>
       <p>
        When these coordinates are realized by choosing datum points and fixing a geodetic datum, ISO uses the terminology coordinate reference system, while IERS speaks of a reference frame. A datum transformation again is referred to by ISO as a coordinate transformation. (ISO 19111: Spatial referencing by coordinates).
       </p>

      <p>
       This could clear up many misconceptions here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The study of geodesics on an ellipsoid arose in connection with geodesy specifically with the solution of triangulation networks.
        <strong>
         The figure of the Earth is well approximated by an oblate ellipsoid, a slightly flattened sphere.
        </strong>
        A geodesic is the shortest path between two points on a curved surface, i.e., the analogue of a straight line on a plane surface. The solution of a triangulation network on an ellipsoid is therefore a set of exercises in spheroidal trigonometry .

       I have never seen it. Some flat earthers have sent weather balloons up there and there was no curvature. If there is no curvature at high altitudes then how can you see it with the eye on ground level?

       In order for the earth to actually be flat, you have to also accept the following:
       <br/>
       Radio waves are phony.
       <br/>
       All forms of astronomy are invalid.
       <br/>
       GPS is some government simulation.
       <br/>
       All forms of space travel are a fiction.
       <br/>
       There are no satellites.
       <br/>
       Air travel is included in the cover up.
       <br/>
       The cover ups go back as far as the great pyramids.
       <br/>
       Pirate logs were all faked when they scouted ports they could see from the mast but not the hull, masking their positions.
       <br/>
       That the earth would be the only flat celestial body in existence unless you believe that all the billions of other celestial bodies are all facing the earth on their flat side.
       <br/>
       Gravity is fiction.

       We can observe that things that are more dense than the medium they are in fall and those that are less dense will rise. Gravity is a model that explains this by attributing it to an invisible force. The reality that we can actually observe directly is that dense things fall and less dense things rise.

       I've been in airplanes and tall buildings.  My eyes don't have fish eye lenses so I'm gonna stick with my own personal observations.
       <br/>
       As far as gravity, you completely missed it.  We can measure directly the magnetic field around the earth that comes directly from the molten nickle core that is our center.  It's spherical.   The same roundness that satellites orbit.  Also keeps the whole moon thing moving around us in a circle, and creates tides.
       <br/>
       But hey, we don't even need to go that complicated.  After dark tonight, message someone in another country.  If it's daylight there, ask yourself how that is possible.

       attack flat-Earthers -- even when they themselves have never conducted an experiment themselves to prove to themselves that the Earth is indeed the shape they've been told it is -- is more worrying to me than what the flat-Earthers believe.

       I'm "the other guy" and I never said i believe the earth is flat... You're making your own assumptions here.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what's very sad with the topic... it can leads to a lot of philosophical discussions but as soon as you say more than "it's bullshit" you're instantly tagged "idiot".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting on how science is sharing traits with religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting on how even scientists are defining their models, sometimes forcing fitting new observations into the current model, and sometimes redefining the model itself, depending on how strong their current beliefs and/or expectations are.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting in how people react to it, because it actually shows that a big "they don't want us to know" conspiracy would totally be doable. (again here, before you make your assumptions, saying it could be possible doesn't mean I think it's actually running right now...)

       the boat example is atrocious. If it drove away in a straight line it would get smaller and smaller until it was out of eye sight. How is that round/flat proof?

       Yes you would. If the boat just keeps going eventually it will be too small to see. If you stand on a freeway and watch a truck drive off (in this fantasy scenario there is no traffic and the freeway is a straight stretch of like 60 miles). After a while you would just not see the truck.

       You lose track and it disappears due to the curvature of the earth. If you watch a boat depart the last part you will see if the mast or sails over the horizon.  If the earth were flat it would just get tiny and disappear.

       Are you?  Go sit at a dock and watch the ships.  You will see masts and sails last before they disappear over the horizon.  Or use binoculars, or zoom on a camera if your eyes are that bad.

       Holy crap are you arrogantly content with your ignorance. There have been many experiments conducted that prove "boats going over the horizon" is simply due to the laws of perspective and vanishing point. When you zoom in on the boat it will always reappear. So much for your B.S. horizon claim!

       I'm not going to send you a million links, if you are sufficiently interested then keep researching this specific topic and see what has been found when people measure it. Only consider sources with actual clear video/picture evidence. You can also go to a shoreline with a camera that has a powerful zoom or binoculars/telescope and perform the same experiment easily.

       The boats will always reappear until you run out of optical zoom.

       That's why the topic is interesting on a philosophical level :) At some point, you have to "trust" science from your own ignorant point of view. This actually makes science share some traits with religions. And that's also why people can start going so mad, it's because you question their "beliefs".

       It's like that oatmeal comic posted here earlier this month about "core beliefs". If you challenge a core belief and the person isn't aware/mature enough to handle it, you will most likely be met with vitriol.

       I actually think all this Flat Earth stuff is kind of interesting. It would mean we have all been lied to as a species by a select group of people. Who are these people? Why did they deceive the planet? If you analyze the topic it does lead to some interesting introspection. Again, I believe our planet is round, but that's why conspiracy is fun.

       I encounter more &amp; more evidence every year which suggests there is a known history for our planet that is being hidden by a small group of powerful humans (my eye is currently on the Vatican); that was hidden a long time ago and replaced with population-controlling religious texts.

       There's also no official code of ethics for science to keep people from falsifying experiments/results knowing that essentially nobody is likely to check their work (nor could we really expect that all scientists would follow the code even if there were one).
       <br/>
       A good example being the
       <em>
        "cannabis kills brain cells"
       </em>
       experiment.
       <br/>
       For decades we believed (and our schools taught) that cannabis kills brain cells. The reality is that the experiment involved forcing animals to breath so much cannabis smoke that they simply couldn't breath air; they couldn't get enough oxygen so brain cells started dying.
       <br/>
       For decades nobody bothered to re-conduct the experiment or even check how the experiment was conducted.
       <br/>
       There truly is a new religion forming with universities and other 'trusted' organizations of the mainstream academic/scientific communities serving as the divine institutions, and anyone with a white lab coat and a degree in some field of science as an ordained priest.
       <br/>
       I regularly come across college kids who get angry and call people 'anti-science' for even simply questioning certain things that they've been told are facts by the divine institutions and the white coat priests.
       <br/>
       Just as Christians assumed their black-robed priests were right because they were guided by god, these college kids assume their white coat priests are right because there's some uncorruptible ethical organization somewhere making sure all of their experiments and results are legit.

       "In 1901, Henry Yule Oldham, a geography reader at King's College, Cambridge, reproduced Wallace's results using three poles fixed at equal height above water level. When viewed through a theodolite (a precision instrument for measuring angles), the middle pole was found to be almost three feet (0.91 m) higher than the poles at each end.[10][11] This version of the experiment was taught in schools until photographs of the Earth from space became available.[12][13]"

       The point of my comment was to tell that it's not THAT easy to be sure of it for the lambda ignorant average joe. Even his legit experimentations could lead to fallacious results due to some more ignorance (atmospherical refraction, duh).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, at some point, and from the average joe point of view again, you have to "believe" in science which makes it share some traits with religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's part of why people can get so mad on the topic, because it questions their core beliefs and they don't really have tools to defend themselves besides "it's like this" or "everybody knows this".

       A sunset or sunrise, how doesn't this happen on a flat Earth? If the sun was dangling directly above my head at noon, and at my sunset it's dangling above someone else's head at their noontime, how do I lose sight of the sun below the horizon? The earth itself is blocking the view of the sun, not just because the sun is no longer pointed at me like a flashlight. If it was a flats earth then sunset would be like an eclipse, where the sun disappears while above our heads, not below the horizon.

       In the video you have the earth curving, but the capsule in the same spot does not. Funny thing, at 45 seconds there IS still a curve. It is small, but still noticeable. If you look at a portion of video from outside with the same width it looks the same.

       I have seen people on youtube perform flat earth experiments. They proved that they don't understand the concepts they are using to prove the earth is flat. There is enough evidence to conclude without any doubt that the earth is round without wasting money and time on some contrived "experiment". And in fact no on, not even you, performs experiments on everything before coming to a conclusion.

       I own a telescope. I can point the telescope at the planets in my solar system. By observing those planets I can observe them not only rotating and therefore showing me that they have multiple sides and arent flat but also that their satellites move in front of then behind their respective planets.

       One time I wondered if Earth was alive and sentient, in the sense that we are alive and sentient, maybe even more so.  And we and everything else on earth were "cells" on the earth.  Kind of like how our own cells don't know that we are alive, and we don't know if they are sentient, because we don't speak the same language.  And you know how our cells use nutrients from our blood to live?  Well what if oil was really Earth's blood, and we are sucking it up and killing Earth by hogging all the blood.  So my point is,  maybe we don't know what combusts in our car, not fully anyways.  Really, we know so little.  We like to think we are smart and "awake", but I think we are all relatively.... dumb.

       That response is the definition of new age fluff. You are choosing to believe something that by your very definition is impossible to prove or verify to any amount. It brings nothing to the table and takes away from an actual conversation.

       I didn't say I believed it, just thought it was an interesting thought I wanted to share.  If somebody told me "hey, Tylenol isn't what you think, it actually damages your nerve receptors making them less sensitive hence why the pain goes away"  I would be like "whoa, I wonder if that's true, how can I know for sure?"

       I disagree,

      <p>
       Research papers (should) include enough information for you to repeat the experiment to achieve the same results. A lot of science is repeating experiments to prove accuracy. There is nothing stopping you from repeating any experiment you want. The fact that you don't is not a knock against the conclusions drawn.

       Right... but if i haven't repeated the experiment, then the "facts" are really just second hand information, and not "knowledge" that I possess.  I'm aware that some people take experiments as 100% fact, but I don't accept that.  There are errors, misdrawn conclusions, confirmation bias, ulterior motives, etc. to take into account.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I am saying is that what we think we know, we don't know for sure.  A lot of the "facts" from the past are known to be false now.  What makes this day and age so special?

       The mass repeatability makes this day and age so special. You publish a study and 3 or 4 other groups of people are going to try and replicate it HOPING for failure.

       Again, they way you talk is simply not how you live your life. You take for true 1000's of little pieces of science as fact. You are using a computer, yet I am pretty sure you havent "conducted an experiment" showing how electronic memory works, or capacitance.

       Your argument makes no sense.  I don't care to prove  how a computer works or whether the blanket I sleep with is woven one way or another or if my 2-1 shampoo simultaneously washes AND conditions.  I just think that claiming to know everything "cuz science said so" is naive.

       Yet you know this via science. If you light a piece of paper on fire to see if paper burns you have done a scientific experiment. Science is merely the method to acquire knowledge. Your problem (imo) isn't with science its with scientists.
      </p>

       If I light a paper on fire, I then know for sure that paper can burn.  Do I then know everything there is to know about paper burning? No.  Is it possible that in some conditions, paper doesn't burn? That certain kinds of "paper" don't burn at all?  i don't have a problem with science or scientists, I just think people should be more humble and admit that they don't know everything about anything at all, and probably never will.

       erh...I should of been on top of this sooner. When did this conversation go to science knows everything? We don't currently know everything, but that doesn't mean we cannot know anything. (god thats a weird sentence)
      </p>
      <p>
       This all started with the weird "oil is the blood of the planet" comment. If you have no evidence of your thesis, then your thesis is meaningless is it not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Science, usually, attempts to answer a specific question. If your question was does paper burn, and paper burns, then you have answered your question. If I write a paper saying that and you read it, I believe you shouldn't dismiss it without reason.

       Why do people need to do their research, when it's been proven time and time again? You can see it in nature, as I just said in another comment, look at a sunset, you know that the horizon of the earth blocks the sun from your view, you can visualize how this works on a spherical model, as the earth rotates the side away from the sun loses light. Try doing this on a flat plane and tell me how you replicate a sunset while also providing light to another location, it just doesn't work. My point is we've been told the earth is round because it is, and anyone can see it by just using logic. The earth was once considered flat, but then some smart started to realize that a flat Earth just wasn't consistent with their observations in nature. If someone tells me I'm a sheep because I believe what I'm told versus investigating myself then I do find that offensive. I'm sure there are people who do believe the earth is round because that's all they've ever been told but couldn't prove it, but that doesn't take away from the fact that smarter men than I have proved it, and it's very easy to prove myself. It's like knowing the spoiler of a movie before watching it.

       how do you know the oceans are more than 1000 feet deep? I mean, the only people who have been down to the supposed "Bottom" of the sea are: 
1. The US Navy, a government agency that lies to us on the daily
2. James Cameron, a Hollywood special effects genius known for cleverly recreating underwater events.
See how this works?

       Plenty of people do have everyday experience that indicates the Earth isn't flat, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       People point a satellite dish into the sky and received a TV signal from a geostationary satellite.
      </p>
      <p>
       People flying to multiple continents end up back home having only flown West or only flown East.
      </p>
      <p>
       People visibly observe the ISS pass over them repeatedly on a consistent schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, when these points are brought up, flat-Earthers tell you your personal observations are deceiving you due to a bigger conspiracy at play. Satellite dishes are actually pointing to a giant, somehow invisible, tower, that's actually as tall as a satellite would be flying. Airlines are in on the conspiracy for some reason and the flight paths are fake. The ISS is just a drone flying on repeat/holographic projection.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point, you might as well just believe you're in a vat connected to the Matrix, given how unreliable you have to believe the world around you is to be a flat-Earther.

       people attack antivaxxers and 911 truthers just as furiously
      </p>
      <p>
       a good lesson to learn from this flat earth thing is to step back and reevaluate just how open minded you yourself are.
      </p>
      <p>
       im not saying you need to believe in everything, but if anyone reading this jumps on flat eathers and thinks to themselves how ridiculous it is to believe in it they need/should also step back and realize that feeling they just experienced is the same one people who think antivaxxers or 911 truthers are dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       on the flip side, if you believe in a conspiracy that others think is crazy maybe also step back and at least educate yourself on the reasoning behind why people believe in one thing or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally dont believe in the flat earth, but I find the reasoning behind the theory extremely interesting/intriguing even if it requires some leaps to work (global conspiracy, etc)

       They do genuinely believe it, but what you really need to look is the growing antiestablishment world trends. I think most people are convinced at the moment that most things are a conspiracy because of distrust of major political parties. In the last 15 years their has been a web of lies and deceit woven through the fabric of our society which makes it only logical for an increased skepticism of absolutely everything the government has ever told us. Is it an absurd view? Yes, but I can't say I completely blame them with the amount of misinformation generated in the last 5 years alone.

       Flat Earth is a proxy battle for those who doubt mainstream sciences storyline.  It's like a catch-all term.

      <p>
       My hunch is the Flat Earthers know the theory is ridiculous... as ridiculous as what mainstream science hides, obfuscates, lies about, etc.

       It's not so much to prove the earth is flat, but to show science is suspect, hiding things, manipulating truths, etc.

       The cold hard truth about something like flat earth, if we apply the same intellectual standards to it as we'd apply to something like 9/11, is that we simply cannot dismiss it out of hand because we
       <em>
        simply cannot refute it for sure
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what keeps the debate going. I don't believe the earth is flat, but I also can't prove that it isn't flat.  The only information we've ever been given about the world around us has come to us ultimately via governments. Governments cannot be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only group with the ability to know for sure by sending a craft high enough to end the debate forever--say 100,000 miles, are governments. Is there a reason for that? I don't know, but neither does anyone else among us.

       Yes you can. Fly from Los Angeles to Japan and Germany in one direction. If the Earth is flat you won't be able to do this unless you can fly past Japan and back towards the States.

       That's not necessarily true either. Anyone with sufficient funds can send a rocket of whatever sort out of the atmosphere. It's simply that the vast majority of people with that amount of wealth either don't subscribe to the flat earth fallacy or don't care.

       This is a very fair and level headed response. I wish we all could think this way, as it would stop the divisiveness and ad hominem attacks from both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       I entertain both theories and can see how they both could work, but I'm reluctant to fully subscribe to either until I go into space myself. If that makes me an idiot, so be it. IDGAF.

       It really is odd. People get SOOOO mad every time someone brings FE up its like someone fucked their wife. And just because it's stupid? Really, really odd response people have regarding it. Plenty of other ridiculous things are talked about without this much constant anger. It's really odd and unexplainable and it happens in every single FE thread.

       See when the topic gets derailed because of the nature of the topic itself?  When people start resorting to calling people idiots and nothing gets discussed or dealt with at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is part of that intention.  Entirely a waste of time.  Talk about the association of the topic and soon the topic is debated and the spiral starts again, achiveing exactly what it is supposed to.  Disruption and delays in the transfer of real information between people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still believe flat earth is not a real conspiracy, its a belief and it would need to be proven in any capacity before it could be regarded as a conspiracy to keep us ignorant of X or Y, and as such it shouldn't be allowed here.  Mostly because there is zero science behind it, but clearly used as a tool to do exactly that, make the entire group it comes into contact with look like fools as well.  Guilt by association.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should have their own sub by now and can discuss the crap out of it there.  I proposed that a while ago and was attacked for wanting "censorship" but that's not what this would be.  Obviously I can't actually prevent people from thinking its real, but I don't believe it should be here at all.  They can have their time in another sub and people can go to them if they like.  It is
       <em>
        NOT
       </em>
       a conspiracy.

       Siiiiiiiiigghh.... Okay flat earth can easily be debunked. I agree with you op, there are true conspiracies that are being discredited because of flat earth insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to sea school about five years ago, so that I could acquire a 100 ton masters license. I was successful in acquiring my license. While I was at school, we had to learn about all aspects of navigation. One of the things we learned was about the curvature of the earth. We had to be able to determine the distance of a vessel on the horizon. We did this with this equation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.boatsafe.com/nauticalknowhow/distance.htm">
         1.17 times the square root of your height of eye = Distance to the horizon in nautical miles
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For an example, say I'm in the wheel house of a vessel, and my height of eye is around 20 feet. That would put any object on the horizon, approximately 5.2 nautical miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone can try this.
Also we reside in a simulation, but the earth is spherical in shape in this simulated reality.

       I mean, it does look curved to me. There are also very noticeable arcs in the color gradient from the sun. If it was flat they would be linear gradients.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, because even in the video it looks curved, I paused the video and took out a piece of paper. I put it level with the center of the video at the edge of the horizon. The earth did not line up with the paper man. It was below the edge on both ends of the paper. Not a h get amount but enough to suggest it is in fact arced.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like you chose a bad video or something because this wasn't conclusive at all. It actually showed the opposite.

       Dude that video is complete bullshit. It's edited for one thing, and then you have to trust what the youtuber's claim to how many miles away the vessel is. Also, the camera being used is absolutely horrible. I'm so sick of this disinformation. I have spent countless hours looking at vessels traveling towards me and away from me. When navigating a boat, I use my binoculars constantly. Day and night, (they help tremendously to tell what the lights in a vessel are and help when navigating a channel, no matter the time). When looking through binoculars you can still see a vessel on the horizon disappearing or appearing according to which direction they're traveling. I have seen this hundreds of times. If you're getting closer to a vessel, fist you see the mast, then you'll see the house, then finally the hull and entire vessel come into view. So, I'll drop another mic here. I don't believe the earth is a sphere, because of what science tells me. Although I do trust many things that science has taught us. I know the earth is spherical in shape, because I have witnessed it first hand many many times. You could do the same test yourself. Go to your nearest body of water, get some binoculars, pull out your trusty smart phone, pull up the GPS, figure out how far you are from any object on shore and convert it to nautical miles, travel until the object is on your visual horizon according to your height of eye, figure out your height of eye, take the same smart phone you are holding, figure out the square root of your height of eye, multiply that by 1.17, match that with  A GPS distance, and shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit THE EARTH! IT IS A ROUND!

        Why do you have to start a pendulum? If a swaying pendulum proves a revolving ball earth, there should be no stationary pendulums. In any event..

       Holy shit, that first video is hilarious. The guy draws a straight line from Taiwan to LA on the globe and uses that to start his analysis. That's not how the shortest path works in spherical geometry and it's not how planes fly.

       Show me what is wrong about the lines on the globe that he drew? I mean he drew a logical line from one point to another on a round globe model (doing this already introduces natural curve vertically which is the only curve that matters when flying in a straight line from point a to point b). Please demonstrate how he should have drawn the line if he did it incorrectly. Also explain why the flight paths work out perfectly on a flat Earth map. Thanks!

       See, this is the problem. You are making assumptions with a complete lack of knowledge on the subject (spherical geometry), and you are being will fully  ignorant. It's not hard.

       Googling 'Taiwan to LA flight path' contradicts every assumption the guy makes.

      <p>
       The shortest path on a sphere is not the straight line that we typically think of.  Marking two points on a globe and then drawing a line from one to the other is not the shortest path.  The shortest path is always an arc.

       How can you chose to ignore such obvious facts when forming your view that the earth is flat?  That's what I don't understand.  I'm sure I could debunk those other videos you posted, but when you start off with something so completely devoid of the truth, I lose all motivation.

       I followed this crazy thread from some post somewhere off the front page. I'm curious, I thought the arc was it literally flying up into the air. Why do the planes fly north? I know that from EU to USA some airlines have direct flight access while others go over Canada and the flight took like two extra hours. So I don't see the arc benefit in speed.

       Sure we can have a debate about NASA but a flat earth would require millions of people to be in on it in some fashion. All space agencies, all aeronautical engineers, most boat captains, all the worlds armies, shit even the guy who punches in the numbers to calculate how much fuel your plane will need, all astronauts, all astrophysicists, anyone involved with satellite manufacture, same with any kind of hardware designed for space, the list goes on and on.

       Yeah sure the moon landing could be far more controlled because what are you going to do? Go to the moon and check (this is an aside from the mirrors humans left there, you could for a fairly nominal price bounce a signal off of it)? But we lilve on this planet and no one has ever seen this ice wall? No one has ever shown me a guy eating fish and chips smoking a fag talking about fanny on the shores of the UK from NYC.

Do you really think a HDD is spinning at 7200 RPM with a read write head floating 1/10 the width of a  human hair above it in a completely clean sealed case reading on and off states so fast that we cant comprehend them?

       I can see how it could sounds dumb to someone who doesnt understand how it works. Circumnavigation is possible by traveling due east or due west from any point on a flat plane. This means the equator is not a straight line but a circle.

       while i do agree, (they) do try and do that, i believe the pyramids. The way they were built, the math that they tell, the precession of the earth that tells how old they are.  Proves more than what nasa has said. History being hidden, i can believe that. Earths been round to a lot of people for a long time, much before nasa. Using religion and the earth is flat because of divine providence of god is better form of control i think than massive conspiracy about space.

       No, the strongest form of mind control is the one everyone believes in, not merely the one they are forced to believe in. There really is a huge massive conspiracy to hide what every religion has been agreeing on as truth.

       It started with me watching youtube videos detailing the lack of curvature from weather balloon footage going over 100,000 feet in the air. That was my start down the rabbit hole. I tried researching and disproving flat earth proofs but I failed. It wasn't long after I figured out that they were trying to make religion look ridiculous, trying to distance us from the truth, from our Creator.

       Removed the insult only because I remembered it violates a rule. And that is not at all what I was talking about. I am talking about flights that do NOT land at Antarctica (obviously). Look up a map of commercial flight paths, none of them are allowed to fly above or too close to the south pole - it is a part of the Antarctic treaty.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, here are a couple of videos proving that flight paths make more sense on a flat earth map than the Mercator Projection that everyone subscribes to:

       There is no reason to its not a viable flight path. There are parts of the ocean where planes dont fly, do you think they are also hiding things there?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for how flights work on FE I recommend look up how they calculate fuel consumption for flights. The calculation literally involves curvature. Do you think that no one ever has noticed these calculations are wrong? Not a single flight mechanic, airforce pilot, member of the ground crew, logistics officers, oil companies have ever noticed this formula is incorrect.

       That they set up a ceremonial south pole and you can't visit the real one? It's funny that you are telling me that I am lying when I am literally repeating the mainstream narrative to you. If you don't want to investigate for yourself like I did, I am fine with that; just know that I am not going to research everything for you and spell it all out.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is even an explanation for why you can't visit the real south pole. I won't share it because it is a lie and I don't want to accidentally mind control you. If you do come across it in your own research, just know that it is most definitely not true.

       Those would be giant ass glaciers that cover most of antarctica. An easy to prove this isnt an ice wall is to sail with the "ice wall" on your left and keep doing that. If you come back to your original position you now know you just went around a big island.

       People have been programmed to believe the truth is dumb. Brainwashed from childhood, separated from the truth. NASA is a psyop and their job is to make you believe the Earth is an insignificant little speck of dust in the universe, and that all of this is by chance; no place for God in this worldview. The truth is that Earth is flat, motionless, and the center of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bedford levels experiment proves that oceans do not curve around a globe. Michelson-morley experiment proves Earth does not spin. Airys failure proves its the stars that move, not Earth. Sagnac experiment disproves special relativity. CMB radiation proves geocentricity. But they won't teach you these experiments in school. Instead they'll teach you the big bang theory, theory of evolution, theory of gravity - and they teach these theories as facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of us flat earthers wanted this shit to be true, because it makes us look retarded. I thought flat earthers were morons too, until i watched some of their videos and realized they make great points.
       <em>
        ALL flat earthers start out trying to disprove flat earth
       </em>
       , but the more one investigates, the clearer the deception becomes. Be skeptical of everything you see, even me. Good start down the rabbit hole would be Eric Dubay's 200 flat earth proofs video. Or just swallow the blue pill and forget about what i said.

       That's exactly what they want you to think. That is disinformation. Curvature is undetectable. There are an endless amount of images and video showing that the 8 inches per mile squared curvature simply does not exist.

       Which is exactly what these astroturfers and NGOs who pay them are trying to discourage - by attacking the anonymous internet user's pride so that they won't want to look into flat earth, they won't want to be that kind of person that is criticized for such a silly idea that can be debunked very easily... they don't want to give themselves to it or risk adopting it out of fear of social rebuke.

       NASA contains the same letters in SANTA but without the T. It's because Santa is saint Nicholas and created CHRISTmas. Therefore Santa is god living in the north pole controlling the rest of the flat earth.

       You simply haven't seen the evidence I have. Whenever there is a false flag shooting or any other BS fake news story, there is numerology encoded within the names, ages, number of victims, etc., every time, without fail. You don't have to believe in black magic and all that shit for it to be true; the point is that the elite believe in it very much.

      <p>
       The worst conspiracy theorists are those that let their beliefs decide how they view facts rather than letting facts decide their beliefs. Flat earther's are among the most guilty of this.

       What you are saying makes sense, but I'll say something I've said a couple of times in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories can be dangerous, never stop living your own life and hanging out with the people you love, never mix the conspiracies with your own reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, even if you are reading that the world is weirder than you thought, don't forget your reality is your loved ones and the activities you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you feel conspiracy reading is becoming a full time job, stop and look for an activity that will help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I picked up boxing and been doing it for the last couple of months, now when I get pissed for some conspiracy I take it out in training and come home with only love for my family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe some people fall deep into the rabbit hole and it's very hard to get out of there with a sane mind if you don't work in understanding your own reality.

       You just described my friend to a T. He moved to California to be closer to a famous conspiracy theory guy and actually had lunch with and everything. He's either at work or he's at home researching conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I'll call him because I'm into conspiracies too but I'll be like "hey what do you think about (insert current event)?" And he will have no idea what I'm talking about because he's so deep into whatever hes studying and he's scared to tell me much but he'll say "look I know you think I'm crazy but the earth is flat and I've been studying the color orange A LOT....Oh I've already said too much...Nevermind". He nervous his phonhknes are tapped and they're watching him because of his research.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel bad for him but shouldn't because he's doing exactly what he wants.

       Wish my dad shared your view on things.  He was laid of recently and suddenly believes in flat earth, knows when the second coming of Christ will be (down to the day), and thinks that all of the presidents have descended from King John of England. It's not so much WHAT he believes, so much as that he has gotten very strange and argumentative and otherwise disengages from family.

       Didn't want to believe it at first, the conspiracy just seemed to far fetched. After looking into it though there are compelling arguments, the big one is that there is no observable curvature anywhere unless you are Nasa. Its also funny that almost every Nasa submission on this sub is downvoted very quickly. They are full of shit

       When I think conspiracy theorist I automatically go to flat-earthers and lizard people. I can see why that makes people distrustful when they hear the word 'conspiracy'.

       I can understand disagreeing in the comments on a flat earth post, but is making a thread simply to shit on and ridicule people who believe in a niche conspiracy really the kind of thing we should encourage around here?  There is a difference between disagreement and mocking condescension.

       This. I'm not a believer in the theory, but am always disheartened when these people get destroyed in any comment section. It's the same exact way 9/11 truth seekers are treated and it's eery. Which either means there's something to it or it's the bullied bullying their "lessers."

       It feels like a 3 letter agency test run to see how easy it is to get a certain percentage of stupid people to believe in something completely bonkers.  If they can convince enough people to believe something so ridiculous, it shouldn't be so hard to convince them of something much less contrived and much more profitable.

       I feel the same way about the loudest, most visible 9/11 truthers that insist on saying the planes were holograms or there was nobody on the planes. The real scandal was the connections between the leaders at the time and the perpetrators, or the suspicious failures in security surrounding that day, but the "9/11 never happened" people were always there to derail the discussion

       watch the links, do the scientitic experiments your self (8 inches per mile squared) and you will see how easy it is to prove the earth is 100% flat. I would have never thought i would ever say something lie this, but if you actually look at it with an open mind (and with good understanding of the globe model) you will see it immediatly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attack on Flat Earth is very huge and organized, there is a good reason for that. Majority of Flat Earthers are NOT religious not cases, most of them examined the evidence themselves and were forced to accept that it shows the earth to be flat. This does raise the possibility of a creator (for me as well even though i was one of the biggest evolution and globe earth fans out there) but non of the thousands of flat earth friends on facebook i have will tell you its the same creator in the bible or quran or whatever. Only a few flat earthers do so because "the bible says so" and those are not better that people who blindly believe the globe with out investigating it first.

       What if there are paid trolls from the FBI and CIA and NSA. And websites started getting too close to the truth on some issue. Aliens, global bankers, Mk ultra, who knows.

       There's a clear difference tho, with conspiracy theories like 9/11 for example, you get people with degrees in engineering supporting the conspiracy, you don't get that with flat earth, it sounds like most of them haven't even finished high school, never mind going to college. I think/hope that people will be able to recognize the difference, at least between these two conspiracy theories.

       They are, man. The shilling
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       go that deep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been spending a lot of time studying human psychology lately, as a means of understanding the psychos that run the world. We've heard several times that TPTB are, literally, psychopaths. Narcissists, sociopaths, beings who live through the paradigm of ego, rather than heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you really start to understand a narcissist, and how wickedly they perceive reality, it makes sense that TPTB tend to be "leaders", child rapists, and satanic occult worshippers. Bear with me, I'll make my point in a second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are they leaders? They have the uncanny ability to manipulate. Within the consciousness of a narcissist is a profound ego. The ego isn't just the bad aspect of the mind, which many people believe. Rather, the ego is the entire mind, itself. The ego is the thought mechanism, or the thing for which thought is thinking. An imprint, if you will, on your conscience, through which your mind makes all of its decisions for 'you'. TPTB are narcissistic, meaning they cannot relate, empathetically, to humanity. They only live for the self. These kinds of people can often find themselves in positions of power
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       they are such profound liars. To live in a materialistic world and to have a narcissistic ego is almost always going to put that particular person on a greedy, self-centered path. And how to we make money in this world without being naturally gifted in the arts or math or whatever? You have to be able to manipulate.
      </p>
      <p>
       A narcissist is someone who, for example, has a girlfriend that he wants to have sex with. Yet, his girlfriend isn't in the mood. Rather than thinking, "Oh, that's cool. No big deal. Maybe another night," a narcissist would likely pretend that he is
       <em>
        totally cool
       </em>
       with being not given what he wants. Yet, on the inside, he is fuming. He might, then, choose a TV show for them to watch that has a bunch of sexual themes in it, so as to turn her on. Or, he'll make subtle sexual jokes as a means of just getting 'sex' on her mind. He'll suggest that they give each other massages and subtly let his hands go to the more sensitive parts of her body. And if she catches onto his intent, he will be triggered and insist that
       <em>
        she
       </em>
       is losing her mind. I only know this so intimately because one of my own parents was a full-blown narcissist.
      </p>

       These people are also participating, incessantly, in manipulative thoughts. We can think of thoughts as electric impulses, either positive or negative. So, if you spend an entire life as the manifestation of manipulation, you are spending an awful lot of time in the 'dark' thought spectrum. Consequently, it makes sense to me that such people develop the most wicked obsessions, like pedophilia. Pedophilia is a turn on for pedophiles because, deep deep deep down, they are getting off to the concept of raping innocence. That's why it's so fucking mind blowing that society is slowly embracing the idea of normalizing pedophilia. There is no more wicked crime. It's demonic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads me to why these mf'ers must participate in demonic occult activity. 'The Devil' might not exist, but the manifestations of negative energy certainly do. And because these sickos have chosen the dark path, consciously or not, they are drawn to the ultimate forms of evil. Some people can awaken out of narcissism by realizing that, their entire lives, they have put all their energy into participating in negativity and participating in 'the self', rather than other. Most narcissists aren't even conscious of their wickedness, like my own parent, because it is so authentically who they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the reason I write this all, is really just to open peoples' eyes to the fact that, because TPTB
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       narcissists and psychopaths, they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       hugely clever. They know how to manipulate. They understand human body language and what humans are likely thinking based on how they look or move. They know what we love. They know what we hate. They know how we think. They know what we probably
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       think. And because of that ability, they feed us somewhat convincing theories -- not saying Flat Earth is convincing to the common intellectual, but it seems plenty of people have bought in hardcore -- that they know will spread like wildfire as a means of putting us off the path of truth.

       Unless you expect each satellite to lunch with a selfie stick I'm not really sure what the hell you're actually looking for. Pictures of satellites on Google Images are all promotional artwork and are not being presented as actual photos of the satellites in space. The satellites are typically launched by a rocket without any direct human interaction once it is in space, so of course there are going to be very few photographs of them. However there are photographs of satellites taken from space

       I think it's some sort of CIA experiment. They throw a completly opposite idea of what science etc. tell us and see how far it goes when they create fake evidence and publish it online. As a result there is people who believe it and will fight for it online 7/24 and people who has question mark in their minds and group of people who tries to explain but can't make them understand.

       Flat Earthers  rely only on senses. Especially vision. Our senses are dull compared to many animals. They don't believe in science. So that would mean all tests for proof would be denied by them. Principals of Pyhisics and other sciences would of course be denied. However no can deny optical illusions exist. If a flat Earthers would agree that senses alone cannot be a proof of a flat Earth. Then maybe they would agree that it's possible for the Earth to be round. 
Also do the sun, moon and other planets exist? Or are they illusions in the night sky.? Are they round, rectangular or otherwise? 
Is earth the only flat Planet?

       This has been my thought on Alex Jones (and the like) for some time. It almost seems like those people see conspiracy theories in EVERY THING to the point it almost seems like they want to discredit the real conspiracies. Sometimes bad shit happens and sometimes when that bad shit happens some people take advantage (to the point it looks like it was planned even).

       I know "flat earth" sounds silly and dumb at first glance.  And that's exactly what I thought.  It sounded so dumb on its face, I had to see what the hype was about, you know, so I could troll these flat earthers.  If you have a couple hours to spare, I highly suggest taking a look at this 12-part youtube series here (
       <a href="http://enclosedworld.com/videos.html">
        http://enclosedworld.com/videos.html

       I ain't gonna click on that link because even though I currently believe the earth is round, I could well be convinced otherwise if I watch a video presenting only one side of the argument. If you showed me a YouTube video telling me I'm actually a pink bunny I swear I could believe it. What I want is two experts having a discussion and presenting evidence. One of whom will invariably win. Neil Degrass Tyson springs to mind. I dunno who would be the debater for the Flat Earth side.

       Right yeh I overlooked that. But I've still never seen a Flat Earther pwned because they always bring up some other shit. I guess that's the nature of a FE's conspiratorial personality, but I don't think they would get away with it in real life with Neil DT.

       I personally think the problem is rather simple.  People by and large do no understand science, it is a methodology, a way of understanding.  It is extremely unlikely to achieve anything with a mindset of disproving concepts or uncovering the truth.  Science is a methodology of observing reality, attempting to explain how things happen, testing our ideas rigorously, allowing others to have all of our information and ask them to justify our results.  People have achieved so much since adopting this methodology, those that do not are bound to continue arguing over long settled issues such as the shape of the planet.

I'm surprised how many people who acknowledge False Flags still believe in the Moon Landing.
I'm surprised how many people who acknowledge the Moon Landing was fake still believe in pictures of the Earth from Space.
I'm surprised how many people who acknowledge the pics of Earth from Space are fake still believe in the spinning ball globe.

       No sign of curvature or movement of the Earth from any legit source. Yeahh people are stuck to the underside of a ball by gravity without feeling any different. Ayyy now that's the real ridiculous thing to believe.

       Flat Earthers are a toxic echo chamber, but that can be said about most any conspiracy theory. I've been banned form r/theworldisflat for commenting on another forum about how weird flat earther's are. The group as a whole stomps around and yells about how no one can prove  'x' 'y' and 'z' then ban someone for attempting to explain.

       Anyone who has taken a transatlantic flight can tell you that they have clearly witnessed the curvature of the Earth by looking out the window.  On long flights, the altitude is high enough that you can see the curvature clearly.  Of course you can't see it when you are at surface level.

       I enjoy talking about conspiracy theories and many have valid reasoning, but the Flat Earth Theory is just plain ignorant.  There is SO MUCH scientific proof that debunks it.

       idk, my father is a flat-earther, one of the smartest guys I know, I just think he has trust issues (which actually leads him to be a big-time believer in conspiracies). He isn't 100% on the flat-earth, but until he actually goes to the moon, idk if he'll give up the argument. Also, it's kind of a good brain exercise and a good way to learn about science haha. I myself am very opposed to the idea for many reasons, but I honestly think it's a temporary thing he'll eventually come to his senses about.

       It was around, but with all this the DNC/Hillary/Bernie, Wikileaks, Pizzagate, and George Webb.  They're trying to smear everything by grouping in the flat earthers in there and supercharging them.

       Rogan probably got a lot of flat earther attention after his Alex Jones podcast.

       Honestly flat earth would be greatest, most powerful conspiracy, and have the most amount of people who was in on it, if it was true. And of course in the flat earth conspiracy there are some that goes off the rails that state when you are in the air, you don't fall down due to gravity but because the earth is rising; to the ones that could almost make sense like the ability to see beyond the curve with a powerful telescope.

       Similar theory regarding quite a few major modern 'activism' efforts:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The rejection of reasoned argument
       </li>
       <li>
        Demands for increasingly extreme social concessions
       </li>
       <li>
        Large-scale responses including violence in reaction to extremely statistically marginal problems
       </li>
       <li>
        Increasingly hostile 'arguments' which typically rely on peer corroboration, abuse and slander
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       are getting too systematic, too precise, and too hypocritical (demanding 'tolerance' while refusing to give it, and redefining words like 'tolerance' to mean acquiescence) to dismiss by ascribing it to genuine human ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we looking at an organized crime effort to terraform our society and shift the thinking of the public via complicit personnel?  Why or why not?

      <p>
       <em>
        &lt;prepares for a torrent of downvotes&gt;
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus: If this kind of effort is an organized conspiracy for subversion, it's comparatively new for it to be making such drastic attempts to cause direct results - conspiracies usually prefer to remain subtle, hidden and therefore undetected.  The risk of exposure would still be formidable to it, and could induce it to back down.

       Are you saying FE believers/theorists come here just to make you all seem crazy... You know, a lot of people probably got turned to that theory from this sub, because you know, it's been shared here since before I subscribed to this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And like someone else said above, why are there so many anti FE and no pro where Earth posts? See like that theory really gets to people. These posts always sounds like an outsider talking to a conspiracy theorist, you just say it's crazy and that we need to accept the truth. I'm Still doing research on both FE and Sphere Earth, seems like you've done one and refut the other.

       Sure we are a species that likes to imagine and come up with theories but when you can easily get on an airplane and go up 30k ft in the air and see for yourself, there really should be no Flat Earth believers.

       I was also quite upset to see Shaq posting about the earth being flat based on him driving from coast to coast or whatever. I don't know if it was him trolling or him being serious but the number of people that follow his social channels, he should be more responsible with what he posts.

       It's simple, have you ever seen with your own eyes the earth? I mean did you launch the rocket and controlled the satile? You believe because somebody told you... People that believe in the flat Earth believe because they don't trust the source of the information.

       You would ask for me giving evidence. So shouldn't you let the flat earthers come with evidence? Haven't the flat earthers got any motives (like religion), they haven't seen it either, so on what basis do they claim they do have the knowledge and autority to say something. 
Flat earthers  haven't given any proof. The most they have done is state that some prove of a spherical earth can also be seen when it is flat. Never have they proven that the earth is flat. They wring themselves in all kind of awkward positions, to hold on to that view. Sure I can believe individual arguments, but if you zoom out and see the total picture vs. the earth is round, you should be able to see that the earth is round (a sphere that is).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the picture of the actual edge of the world? Nowhere. We can say it is being hold back, we can also just think objectively here and conclude there is no photo because there is no edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a difference between not trusting someone and distrusting them per definition. I think anyone who is aware of the fact that people can lie to other people, has to do it's own factfinding. That doesn't mean if the government says the earth is round you have to believe it is square or flat untill you see with your own eyes it's a sphere. That's just stupid. Also, the government has nothing to do with this, because it's been centuries that great thinkers and scientists have found that the earth is a sphere.  Back in the days the government hang people that said otherwise.
That being sad most flat earthers are religious people. If there is anything that shouldn't be believed because of the reasons you adressed it's religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believing in conspiracies, not trusting someone because they have autority, and finding the truth on your own is a good thing, but to much of a good thing, distrusting per definition and letting emotions come into play and you've got yourself a flat earther.

       And by your logic... There where even more scientist and thinkers before the ones that say it was a sphere. You don't need to see something to believe in it, you need to" trust ".... Again that's the key word is trust they don't trust in the history they don't trust in what they are been told... Tell me how do you know what happened in the past? Example: Tell me are you 100 % that Shakespeare even existed and that his books where not ghost writers? If you control history you control the present and if you control the present you control the future.... The reast what you said is just a rant.

       By my logic, there was a time when nobody knew anything. Then they knew how to make telescopes, and they started to learn more about the world and what's around it. This is not trust, that's something different, because with trust, you shouldn't question, you shouldn't think. I can think and question, and know for sure that the earth is a sphere. As I stated, you're talking with emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
       How are you sure you're not in a simulation, and all history, all your memories, everything is just a part of that simulation, that never even happened. There are some interesting theories about that. I think we can never be fully sure about anything. That doesn't mean the opposite is true, because we don't know that either.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are reasons to believe (atleast) a part of Shakespeare's writing is not his. So no I am not sure.
I fear I'm not going to convince you, and that's okay. Atleast we could exchange our thoughts.

       Ok I can tell the size of the IQ I am talking to by your first sentence... You are dismissing thousands of years of philosophy and technology up until the invention of telescope.....   Let me tell you something, if you go back in time back to Roman time, or even way back to sumarían time you would find that culture , government are pretty much the same as we have now ...  You have rich and powerful and you have slaves (like now) so for you to say nobody knew anything is saying that now we are far superior as a society than back in Roman time, but if you look at it we are pretty much the same , yea we got iPads but we act and have the same social structure and struggles as somebody form that time.... Now on to the question... Do you trust the sources of information. Yes or No

       No that's not fair. You're taking my statement far too literal. But I have to admit it was oversimplefied. There have been great cultures with great knowledge. However, knowledge is not a cumulative thing, knowledge can be lost. The point I tried to make is that both sides of the argument have been supported by autorities, nothing more. 
I never stated social and societal structures where different back in the day, hence also my statement that people were hung because of their opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is trust? Some say the earth is a sphere, and others say it's a disc, if i don't trust both of them, does that mean I can't think the earth is a sphere, nor that it is a disc? If I trust noone, does that mean I can't have an opinion? Can I only believe in what I have absolutely seen myself? If that's the case, how much farther have I come than the first men?
      </p>
      <p>
       The discussion depends on the definition of trust. Does trust mean you choose to believe something that you have not seen with your own eyes, or does trust mean that after all information, and the structures around it have been analysed, I choose to accept an explanation as the truth (untill there is reason to change that view)? Thruth and trust, even the words are similar. What do we absolutely 100% surely know? There have been many interesting discussions about this. (Will search for a link in a sec)
      </p>
      <p>
       I trust no autority, but I trust some information, because we all do, we have too. Does that mean I will never be 100% right, yes it does. But when you know nothing, how many percent right are you? I do always interpret information, weigh the motives, see why they could be wrong, so I never take anything for a fact because someone said so. But in the end I have to choose something, and then we come back to wether the earth is round or flat.

       Flat Earth is a psy-op since it suddenly appeared out of nowhere, when the subject of a secret space program was getting more and more attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nasa lies to us because they're the public distraction from the secret space program. We already have contact with several ET species it seems. Some seem to be good and others not so good.
      </p>
      <p>
       The secret space program has advanced technologies and might even be able to travel faster than light.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this info is way too shocking for people to take in, that's why they need to create diversions. They cover up Nasa's lies and mistakes by creating an association with the silly idea of a flat earth.

       I think a far more simple answer is that the flat earth movement was started/ignited by the religiously inclined.

       That's besides the point. I'm willing to entertain the possibility that there are more nonreligious people who believe in flat earth than religious people

       Just to be clear, I'm not saying Nasa is setting up flat earth as a psy-op but the black budget military industrial intelligence complex is.

       Maybe you're right, but I can only share my observations and I have followed UFOs and the secret space program intensely for quite a while now.

       It's simply this: We know the size of earth and with trigonometry we can calculate the curvature. Yet when we look there is no observable curvature.

       Up to a couple of years ago I thought the whole UFO-thing was a bunch of nonsense. I was very wrong. There are many high-ranking witnesses that have come forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good starting point would be to check the Disclosure Project on youtube:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClhNHIEPCKE">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClhNHIEPCKE
       </a>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud49Gh9yYLs">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud49Gh9yYLs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when it comes to the secret space program, I would advise to see lectures by Richard Dolan:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buNCOlB-HeM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buNCOlB-HeM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another great vid to watch is about the Fluxliner advanced propulsion aircraft:

       This subreddit is constantly being manipulated. Anyone ever notice how when a thread blows up to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , the top posts are almost exclusively with a crazy number of upvotes debunking whatever the thread is in reference to? You could say 'well it's because all of Reddit is seeing it now and they're coming in', except that shit rarely happens with any other subreddit like, say,
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/CringeAnarchy">
        /r/CringeAnarchy
       </a>
       , etc. Their communities downvote people they would regularly disagree with, but somehow in this subreddit, the exact opposite happens. Almost always.

       With the state of the conspiracy sub with Trumpists and Russian bots, there would be no need my friend. It already looks dumb as shit. The Conspiracy movement now props up the US government and acts as it's propaganda arms. If you were to tell me that in 1995 I'd laugh my head off at the idea that the conspiracists would be protecting the US government and attacking its political enemies for it.

       The hatred for the flat earthers is a tad dramatic in a special strange way. Almost coordinated lately. Just the shouting down of often polite FE users doesn't pass the smell test with the increased frequency. There is a reason as many people believe it as there are . I'm unsure why it's still a phenomenon but it is and shall remain.

       I feel exactly the same with how you feel u/outbackdude. Everytime I see people (A.I.bots?) posting about flat-earth, with the feverish/fervent way of how they try to push their logic, it made me feel there was a hidden agenda, which was to discredit &amp; make everyone who talks about conspiracy theories look dumb or lunatics.

       I believe it and I'm not an idiot. I'm a physicist, with some well publicized innovations. I have engineering credentials, and a science education. I taught science before becoming an Inventor now running a successful startup. I don't think that this matters, because I had all that years ago. I recently became a believer in that flat earth thing. It is reviled. But if you investigate it with an honest and open mind you will see that it has merit.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could I have not seen it before? It is so obvious that everything about space has been faked. If you don't see that the ISS is a hoax you are under some serious hypnosis. It's a laughable, poorly executed fraud. Rockets fall 100% back down in 10 minutes after being launched, you can see it with your own eyes. Satellites are not real, look into GPS. I investigated it. Every single contention regarding flatness and an impenetrable firmament above has proven out. I investigated for myself, you should investigate for yourself, but most of you won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I searched for NASA's official pictures supposedly taken as real photos of the ISS. Then I examined it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did it again and again. Fake shit, lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Space shuttle? Fakery. Fucking look at it you guys! Snap out of their fucking spell! They lie right in your face and you eat it up. I did too, but now I'm ashamed I wasn't a flat Earther before now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Space, satellites, optics, everything is fakery and managed to hide the flat earth, and firmament.

      <p>
       Wake up.

       It's as if some witchcraft has put a spell on us. Only a few of us can actually break the spell. The mind control from birth is some powerful psychological warfare.

       Change back? Why would I want to? Money, to lie about it? I don't give a fuck what shape the earth is. I don't fucking care which is true, and I assumed what I was taught was correct. Some things never added up or agreed with observation data. I know now, in part, why thin explanations and theories were developed.  Far-fetched and contradictory aspects of these theories had always bothered me, like a thorn in my side. Not anymore, and let me tell you it feels great!
      </p>
      <p>
       I do care that this huge lie is duping nearly every person. We're taken for fools, and it's damn obvious that space, NASA as a whole, satellites, rockets, galaxies, stars, planets, Moon landings, Mars rovers, and all this stuff is made up.

       LMAO. Like the other guy said, getting a patent doesn't mean anything. This is just hilarious, finally I'm lolling really hard. And it really triggers me because of a personal experience:
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew a guy personally, jobless and uneducated, who thought to have a great idea (although it wasn't) and even he got a patent. I saw it. He had to spend some thousand dollars for it; money he didn't have, so he borrowed it from friends. Couldn't pay it back, of course. Because his patent and his idea turned out to be worthless nonsense. Much trouble with his friends followed. Still jobless, btw, but working on the next big thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much on having a patent, Mr. "physicist". But at least I understand why you call yourself a physicist: As the known science is all fake, you watched some YouTube videos with "true science" so it's legit to call yourself that way. Newton, Einstein and Galileo can consider themselves as debunked, no doubt.

       What is your evidence? Why wouldn't the earth be a sphere? How do you explain gravity which would form the earth into a sphere like all the other planets? Have you ever looked at any of the planets through a telescope? They are spheres. Look at Jupiter for example, it is plainly simple to discover with a cheap telescope that it is a sphere orbited by moons. We know gravity exists, why wouldn't earth's mass be pulled into a sphere like the other planets? Why is there a conspiracy to hide a flat earth? For what purpose?

       This is all too big to just disclose to the people, this secret is too explosive. That's why they lie to us, they're not lying because the earth is flat.

       And the earth is not flat or a globe or sphere. According to NASA and science. If two people don't start by acknowledging that much, then they totally misunderstand each other and hence conclude they are a psyop or insane. The whole conversation is built on proving or disproving a conception that neither one of them is really asserting.

       You know... this is the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've watched some of the videos, and the question I ask myself isn't "is it flat" or "is it round" but rather "what can I actually believe?"
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe I am nuts for even asking the question, but goddammit, I cannot prove it either way, I am here on this earth, and will possibly never get the birds-eye view to prove this argument either way.  Some of the youtube arguments for a flat earth are pretty convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tough thing is that we are so deeply entrenched in our beliefs (whatever they may be) that we have a VERY hard time seeing any other possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this thing is flat.  Maybe it's spheoroid, maybe it's not at all... I do not know, I may never know.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while I don't claim any sort of genius status, I am no idiot.

       What do you mean by that?  Anybody can go there.  It's not like someone's waiting to check your passport.  If you had the money, time, and resources what would stop you?  Are the Antarctic police going to arrest you for wondering around a giant, barren, uninhabitable rock?

       The majority of the 12 Guys that think the earth is flat don't even know about Reddit.

       And even better, the majority of flat earthers on Reddit are trolls.

This theory has been popping in and out of your life for a couple years now, and it won't go away because it's not a psyop: the solar system model we all learned in grade school is false, all those propaganda movies you love, false. The only psyops are the ones trying to slow you down, like rappers or dumb athletes scaring you away. The globe model has a ton of flaws, even what's in my history doesn't cover half of it. This is the truth that, if spread, would make a domino effect that reveals the rest of the crazy world we're in. The implication of the sun going around the circular Earth (reality) instead of the

       <del>

       pear-shaped Earth going around the sun is that God must certainly exist, and as you may know, lucefrion satanist psychopaths rule the "planet"

       I work with a flat earther.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically the reason he doesn't believe in a round world is his distrust of government. He thinks the moon landing was fake. He thinks the Hubble and ISS are not real and the images and information is just to keep people complacent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically he believes that there is no way we went out to space, so we just cannot know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanna keep asking, and other planets are round but we flat?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you drop a drop of water what shape does it form? A flat plain or a round drop?
      </p>
      <p>
       He just doesn't trust science and government. He also believes in the "link" between vaccines and autism. So I mean he kinda is lost as fuck just with basic things.

       Actually he isn't lost. Have you actually looked into any evidence on the topics mentioned? Have you done any research yourself or are you just parroting the popular beliefs that you have held all your life?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is plenty of evidence that you can verify yourself that will make you realize that everything authority figures tell you to believe actually has many holes in it when presented with actual facts.

       My answer to your plane question would be because the navigation systems (GPS) are based off of flat earth coordinates. So if you set the plane automatically on a course to fly "around the earth" it would actually be taking you in a very large circle but the turning would be too slight for you to perceive at that large of a radius.

       It's really not that far fetched. We know false flags started the Vietnam war, US forces stopped at the Rhine to allow the Soviets into Germany to form their wall and rape Berlin, JFK was killed by mob/CIA collision, 9/11 was known of in advance, Saudi collusion, Hillary Clinton allowed people to die in Benghazi and rigged the DNC, these are all real "conspiracy theories". Flat Earth is simply a false flag of ridiculousness.

       So you are half right. But the other half is that people's consciousness interprets the universe differently and that is ok. So even tho in your world (and mine) these people are insane overall it really doesn't matter. Allow people to be where they are. Tolerance is the key; people should be allowed to be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now when people try to impose themselves on you that's differnt; they need to allow you too be a "sphere-earther." that's the same courtesy you should give them.

       Sure fair enough I'll buy that. That's why i said half right. I've just felt recently that lots of people have been intolerant. I think that's a part of the centralized power structure. We need more decentralization and more tolerance.

       I truly believe the only reason people believe the earth is flat is because of the fake moon landing thing and NASA in general. At least that's the only thing that made me question it at all. At this point I think the answer lies somewhere in the middle...

       Two things wrong with that methodology.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, 15,000 might sound large to you, but given there's over 454 thousand conspiracy subscribers, that's about 3% of the subscriber base, not counting the same person posting twice or other people quoting them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the first result when I did a search presented me with:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why I changed my mind about Trump; I once believed him during his campaign. Now I realize he's a lying thief, a conman, just like the Presidents before him.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So the first result is basically saying I "changed my mind" to believing the fucking obvious. This is not a very convincing metric of measuring how often evidence and rational arguments changes people's minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you've presented is a metric of how fickle and/or gullible people can be.

       Physics. a theory, formulated essentially by Albert Einstein, that
       <strong>
        all motion must be defined relative to a frame of reference and that space and time are relative, rather than absolute concepts
       </strong>
       : it consists of two principal parts. The theory dealing with uniform motion (special theory of relativity or special relativity) is based on the two postulates that physical laws have the same mathematical form when expressed in any inertial system, and the velocity of light is independent of the motion of its source and will have the same value when measured by observers moving with constant velocity with respect to each other. Derivable from these postulates are the conclusions that there can be no motion at a speed greater than that of light in a vacuum, mass increases as velocity increases, mass and energy are equivalent, and time is dependent on the relative motion of an observer measuring the time. The theory dealing with gravity (general theory of relativity or general relativity) is based on the postulate that the local effects of a gravitational field and of acceleration of an inertial system are identical.

       What surprises me is that those claiming to have eyes to see still believe the oldest lies from the founders of modern Scientism. The argument isn't about the shape of the earth, it's about who is lying. In the end, there are two scales: the truth, and the popular opinion. Why does everyone we claim as conspiracy theorists to distrust love the globe there, this should raise red flags. The Flat Earth society is a conspiracy in and of itself, full of shills to take away any credibility to questioning the shape of the earth. It's a classic tactic. We as human creatures hate being outside of the crowd, even if we know something is off. That's why one will agree that 2+2=5 if enough people sway them that way and shun those who disagree. It gets passed on and eventually becomes tradition. Upon evaluation it can easy be seen to be false, yet the generations that believed the lie will have too much cognitive dissonance to see they are pushing an emotional reaction onto something and will result in the backfire effect. Globe earthers usually end up in the bin of the backfired.

       No, what I said is just because the majority believes it does not make it true. You must examine every belief you hold for yourself, not take the easy way out and assume because most believe it then it is true. If you are satisfied with what you find upon further examination then it may be incorporated into ones worldview, otherwise, it must be thrown out.

       Globe theory has no evidence. Just start off with nasa images of earth and go from there. Earth is flat. There is no curvature. Sorry to say it but we have all been duped!

       Also "that guy in history said that thing" isn't an argument because TPTB control the history books too. If you're in love with outer space you'll have a lot of cognitive dissonance, but I'm sorry to break it to you: it's the sun that moves around us. Check comment history

       I think that's what the Trump-Russia conspiracies are for. Actually, now turn on the X-Files theme, but what if all of this Trump-Russia disinformation is actually being spread by the Trump administration to further confuse and discredit the media. Nothing will come of it and then even more of the people will get behind him in dismantling the 4th Estate.

       I thought so too until I looked into all of the evidence. Don't just believe in anything in the world today unless there's evidence backing it up. We truly are living in the age of deception.

       I heard about flat earth a couple years ago and was in shock.  Hollow earth shocked me even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's that crazy though, because REALLY the only thing we have that "proves" the earth's shape is.... well nothing.  There really isn't any definitive proof either way.  I could be wrong.  Pictures don't prove it to me.  Neither does Erastothenes or NASA or seeing the curvature because I've never seen it and I've been on a sailboat in the open ocean, I've climbed a mountain in Hawaii and seen only flat water,  I see ocean every day and it looks level, water is ALWAYS level on this earth, isn't it?  Why don't the stars move more? How do they know the universe is expanding? At what point can I actually see the curvature?  I live on a tidal estuary, what experiments could I do to find out? Can I check the levelness of the water at high tide sighting down the water at a predetermined location 100 yards away and find out? Or would that be a mirage as well?  Sigh.  I'm just tired of being told "it's true cuz scientists."  As if scientists and science have never been wrong.

       I'm starting to think living on the coastline of an ocean/gulf gives a person better perspective to see the "flatness". I have a place on the Gulf of Mexico and I'm with you. It's called

       Why are you so concerned with how people view you? Are the Flat Earthers harming anyone? No. There not the ones personally attacking people left and right. They just want a place where they can have free discussion. Again, people here are too concerned with how worldly they appear?

       This is a conspiracy subreddit and people belief we've been lied to with our origins and where we live. I'd say good people should be allowed to be themselves. No harm no foul. Better than harassing people who are trying to make a living with conspiracies some know to be true.

       The formula for curvature is simple and can be tested by anyone. 8 inches per mile squared. There are independent observers recording their observations of no visible curvature all over the internet. A lot of these can be verified without you even having to travel to the specific location. Start here:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=flat+earth+no+curvature">
        https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=flat+earth+no+curvature
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can perform many of these experiments yourself by simply calculating the curvature that you should be seeing in a distant object, then attempting to observe and measure if it actually exists.

       not a single piece of that is true or accurate. Just because NASA might fake some shit to make pictures look good or create a flashy website, does not mean that nothing has ever left our orbit. Why should satellites and ISS melt where they are? Do you truly believe that satellites dont exist? How does Direct TV work? GPS units?

       Just think about how many hundreds of thousands of people around the globe would all have to be in on it, every single government, every scientist, every space agency, every company claiming they put satellites into space, aerospace engineers, private companies like Space-X. The Russians, Chinese, Japanese, English, Australian, U.S... all on the same page, all agreeing to keep this lie going... and for what purpose?

       I think the best argument against flat earth is the fact that the Heliocentric model has the ability to predict the future with stunning accuracy. Ask a FE believer to tell you, based on his model, when the next lunar eclipse will be, or the date and time of the next transit of Venus, or even the year when Halleys comet will return.  they have nothing.

       Ive heard this one before! So the upper atmosphere is actually really hot, way hotter than one would think. Like 2500C in the thermosphere where the ISS sits. What you are forgetting is how little gas there is.

       So if you have a handful of molocules per square foot even though they are at a high temperature there isnt enough of them to feel it.

       It would be like having a grain of rice 2500C and tossing it in with sand. The sand wont rise to 2500C

       high up when they take a photo its only of a very small part of the earth so after a dozens of passes the satellite has piece by piece taken photos of the whole planet. Now the clouds wont line up because they are in motion so they edit them to give the best images possible and never once have they lied about it being edited.

There is enough evidence to conclude without any doubt that the earth is round without wasting money and time on some contrived "experiment". And in fact no on, not even you, performs experiments on everything before coming to a conclusion.

       I own a telescope. I can point the telescope at the planets in my solar system. By observing those planets I can observe them not only rotating and therefore showing me that they have multiple sides and arent flat but also that their satellites move in front of then behind their respective planets.

       Two things to add, whats the focal length of the lenses involved? The distances involved are also misleading. So that apollo photo showing a "small" earth was taken from 200k miles away from the moon itself using (Im pretty sure) standard old school 70mm film, Im not sure about the lens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine that EPIC is nearly 1 million miles away taking a photo of the moon at nearly 800k miles away, the Earth is "only" 200k miles from the moon in that instance.

       Sunsets + timezones. It wasn't apparent when travel took far longer and there wasn't instantaneous communication to other time zones, but this is the simplest and most obvious demonstration. The flat Earth model does not explain sunsets. It tries, but mostly acts like it has.

       Why do people need to do their research, when it's been proven time and time again? You can see it in nature, as I just said in another comment, look at a sunset, you know that the horizon of the earth blocks the sun from your view, you can visualize how this works on a spherical model, as the earth rotates the side away from the sun loses light. Try doing this on a flat plane and tell me how you replicate a sunset while also providing light to another location, it just doesn't work. My point is we've been told the earth is round because it is, and anyone can see it by just using logic. The earth was once considered flat, but then some smart started to realize that a flat Earth just wasn't consistent with their observations in nature. If someone tells me I'm a sheep because I believe what I'm told versus investigating myself then I do find that offensive. I'm sure there are people who do believe the earth is round because that's all they've ever been told but couldn't prove it, but that doesn't take away from the fact that smarter men than I have proved it, and it's very easy to prove myself. It's like knowing the spoiler of a movie before watching it.

       how do you know the oceans are more than 1000 feet deep? I mean, the only people who have been down to the supposed "Bottom" of the sea are: 
1. The US Navy, a government agency that lies to us on the daily
2. James Cameron, a Hollywood special effects genius known for cleverly recreating underwater events.
See how this works?

       while i do agree, (they) do try and do that, i believe the pyramids. The way they were built, the math that they tell, the precession of the earth that tells how old they are.  Proves more than what nasa has said. History being hidden, i can believe that. Earths been round to a lot of people for a long time, much before nasa. Using religion and the earth is flat because of divine providence of god is better form of control i think than massive conspiracy about space.

       Plenty of people do have everyday experience that indicates the Earth isn't flat, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       People point a satellite dish into the sky and received a TV signal from a geostationary satellite.
      </p>
      <p>
       People flying to multiple continents end up back home having only flown West or only flown East.
      </p>
      <p>
       People visibly observe the ISS pass over them repeatedly on a consistent schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, when these points are brought up, flat-Earthers tell you your personal observations are deceiving you due to a bigger conspiracy at play. Satellite dishes are actually pointing to a giant, somehow invisible, tower, that's actually as tall as a satellite would be flying. Airlines are in on the conspiracy for some reason and the flight paths are fake. The ISS is just a drone flying on repeat/holographic projection.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point, you might as well just believe you're in a vat connected to the Matrix, given how unreliable you have to believe the world around you is to be a flat-Earther.

       Dude, all of the FE math is extremely hand-wavey.

       They take a single result from a single experiment and re-interpret it through their own way.

       Half the arguments about plane-flight from one point to another don't take into account that atmosphere moves with Earth.

       Half of the arguments don't take into account atmospheric refraction.

       The worst conspiracy theorists are those that let their beliefs decide how they view facts rather than letting facts decide their beliefs. Flat earther's are among the most guilty of this.

       people attack antivaxxers and 911 truthers just as furiously
      </p>
      <p>
       a good lesson to learn from this flat earth thing is to step back and reevaluate just how open minded you yourself are.
      </p>
      <p>
       im not saying you need to believe in everything, but if anyone reading this jumps on flat eathers and thinks to themselves how ridiculous it is to believe in it they need/should also step back and realize that feeling they just experienced is the same one people who think antivaxxers or 911 truthers are dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       on the flip side, if you believe in a conspiracy that others think is crazy maybe also step back and at least educate yourself on the reasoning behind why people believe in one thing or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally dont believe in the flat earth, but I find the reasoning behind the theory extremely interesting/intriguing even if it requires some leaps to work (global conspiracy, etc)

       The signals could be bounced off a dome if a dome exists. There is speculation that the U S government was testing the dome during Operation Fishbowl (strange name, isn't?). Science fiction writer Arthur C Clark came up with stationary sstellites, and then voilà, science fact. They could have learned to bounce signals off the dome, and satellites could have been the excuse.

       Me too. I get called a shill all the time for pointing out the house of cards that pizzagate is, but sadly I don't get a cent for it. You'd think that the Government would be able to spare some cash for me, considering all the millions of dollars it must spend annually maintaining its coverups of 9/11, Sandy Hook, pizzagate, JFK, Roswell, Dulce, the moonlanding, alien abductions, the Illuminati, shape-shifting reptilian aliens, etc, etc. I mean, we must be talking hundreds of dedicated in-house employees, as well as the staff at other organisations such as NASA, FEMA, and NIST who have to be bribed. Then there are the resources dedicated to tracking the people investigating the coverups and murdering them, and the cost of paying people to post criticisms of conspiracy theories on the internet.

       Exactly. I'm at this point too. I always think everyone has ulterior motives or malicious intent for everything they do. Or that they're completely fake and being paid to push some kind of narrative. I even have a hard time trusting people like Snowden and Assange now because I can't tell if they're compromised. But once you're at this point I guess there's no going back. I don't think we're in the wrong for thinking this way but it definitely doesn't make things easy.

       I imagine a lot of it is various intelligence agencies who have a guy just say some dumb shit on different forums and on facebook for about 20 minutes a day. All you really need are a few instigators and then herd mentality kicks in and real people continue the work for you. Same thing with paid protestors. They're not paying thousands of people to riot. They're paying one or two guys to break a window and then the rest happens on its own. All you need is the catalyst.

       There are a lot of things that only work on a round earth and not a flat one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starts rotating in different directions in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that days are longer in the south during winters in the north, and longer in the north when it's summer. For that to happen on a flat earth it means the sun would have to light a wider area in winter, and smaller area in summer, not to mention it would have to move from tropic to tropic as it turned as the seasons changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is much more simply explained by the earth being round and on a tilt.

       In the video you have the earth curving, but the capsule in the same spot does not. Funny thing, at 45 seconds there IS still a curve. It is small, but still noticeable. If you look at a portion of video from outside with the same width it looks the same.

They know enough people accept their master's word, and will fight tooth and nail to defend that word against all common sense and their own observation, even if it changes back and forth. In fact, it's the other way around,

       I would also argue that with a little research into PCBs and how they function you could understand how it works without fancy technology. You can perform an experiment and see if the result at the end is what we would expect if an electron moves across the board.

       Bond's statement is true but doesn't apply to airliners because the GPS speed limit is mach 2. They don't work in airliners because GPS signals don't penetrate the body of an enclosed metal tube well enough for the weak sensor of a smartphone to pick up. I've had the same problem inside a train. If you push the phone against a window, you might get enough signal.

       About the Neil Degrasse Tyson thing, you are misunderstanding what he means. He doesn't mean it's literally the exact same shape/proportions as a pear. He means if you look at the tropic of Cancer vs the tropic of Capricorn you would see that the earth is ever so slightly wider at the tropic of Capricorn than the tropic of Cancer. It still looks pretty spherical at a glance, because the variance is relatively small, but when you measure it then you do see it there.

       You need to understand the issue is not the height, but the speed. GPS location uses 3 different signals from different satellites to triangulate your location. It does this by having the satellite send what time it is by radio. Knowing the satellite is in a fixed geostationary orbit, and knowing their time is correct due to an atomic clock, your phone can do math to figure out where it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that you're closer to the satellites is pretty stupid to. They're 35786 KM away from the earth. 12 kilometers doesn't make a difference. But the speed does, since your phone can't do the math fast enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seriously don't know the first thing about GPS.

       That is an interesting idea, so that helps. But I'm imagining the force running through the earth from pole to pole, that's where the "gravity" force would be so basically the same. So if you're pulled toward the center then does the box effect that?

       Right... but if i haven't repeated the experiment, then the "facts" are really just second hand information, and not "knowledge" that I possess.  I'm aware that some people take experiments as 100% fact, but I don't accept that.  There are errors, misdrawn conclusions, confirmation bias, ulterior motives, etc. to take into account.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I am saying is that what we think we know, we don't know for sure.  A lot of the "facts" from the past are known to be false now.  What makes this day and age so special?

       Well, capitalism has a few things to say about "human resources" too...
      </p>
      <p>
       But more importantly, I think you're missing something out of your western values. They contain
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       individualism and democracy (group/collective decision making and action). The entire history of "Western" thought is a balance of the two (traditionally traced to ancient Greece at least), you can't leave out the group/democracy part.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will give you that the individual is sacred. Now, you can follow it with "the law of the jungle is the only law", money-talks, might is right etc (these are the only alternatives to popular law and democratized power) then I'm saying you've​ walked off the "western culture" reservation just like half of the right wing of the USA are trying to do.

       No that's not fair. You're taking my statement far too literal. But I have to admit it was oversimplefied. There have been great cultures with great knowledge. However, knowledge is not a cumulative thing, knowledge can be lost. The point I tried to make is that both sides of the argument have been supported by autorities, nothing more. 
I never stated social and societal structures where different back in the day, hence also my statement that people were hung because of their opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is trust? Some say the earth is a sphere, and others say it's a disc, if i don't trust both of them, does that mean I can't think the earth is a sphere, nor that it is a disc? If I trust noone, does that mean I can't have an opinion? Can I only believe in what I have absolutely seen myself? If that's the case, how much farther have I come than the first men?
      </p>
      <p>
       The discussion depends on the definition of trust. Does trust mean you choose to believe something that you have not seen with your own eyes, or does trust mean that after all information, and the structures around it have been analysed, I choose to accept an explanation as the truth (untill there is reason to change that view)? Thruth and trust, even the words are similar. What do we absolutely 100% surely know? There have been many interesting discussions about this. (Will search for a link in a sec)
      </p>
      <p>
       I trust no autority, but I trust some information, because we all do, we have too. Does that mean I will never be 100% right, yes it does. But when you know nothing, how many percent right are you? I do always interpret information, weigh the motives, see why they could be wrong, so I never take anything for a fact because someone said so. But in the end I have to choose something, and then we come back to wether the earth is round or flat.

       Up to a couple of years ago I thought the whole UFO-thing was a bunch of nonsense. I was very wrong. There are many high-ranking witnesses that have come forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good starting point would be to check the Disclosure Project on youtube:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClhNHIEPCKE">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClhNHIEPCKE

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud49Gh9yYLs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when it comes to the secret space program, I would advise to see lectures by Richard Dolan:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buNCOlB-HeM">

       The shortest path on a sphere is not the straight line that we typically think of.  Marking two points on a globe and then drawing a line from one to the other is not the shortest path.  The shortest path is always an arc.

       How can you chose to ignore such obvious facts when forming your view that the earth is flat?  That's what I don't understand.  I'm sure I could debunk those other videos you posted, but when you start off with something so completely devoid of the truth, I lose all motivation.

       I would say that the stars provide evidence that our planet does rotate.. but that is only if you believe that the stars arent just some illustration on a dome, but are physical objects which sit millions of light years in the distance

      <p>
       Such a pendulum is merely a ball and socket joint connected to a pendulum. Ball and socket joints facilitate circular momentum. The pendulum is set into motion by lifting and releasing the pendulum, however it is impossible to release it in a 100% straight motion. Over time this results is a slight circular motion. Moreover, pendulums rotating in opposite directions from the same hemisphere.

       This is one of my main issues with FEers. You really believe the Earth is flat but you dont put forth a single ounce of effort beyond youtube videos. If you really believed this you would at the very least get a damn telescope.

        The reason I'm asking for your first-hand video or photo is because I while I plan to conduct this experiment myself, I think you may be able to do it sooner and I actually do trust you to post authentic evidence if you can obtain it.

      <p>
       Just to get this straight. You are asking me for personal video of the planets, of which I told you I dont have the ability to do, and you dont trust any other images or sources out there but you will trust me... Dude this makes no sense. Get  your own telescope, do your own research. Im not here to hold you hand, all I can do is share the knowledge I know.

        No. Density is merely the amount of compactness in a substance.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And in zero gravity what is the density of an unknown object, how would you find it? For objects to separate according to density there must be an attracting force. As I have said before mix oil and water and leave them in zero gravity (Whatever) even though the densities are different they will not separate.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Consider this: When Newton developed his theory of gravity he was unaware of the magnetic force. Today we know that every body, where it be organic or otherwise, has a magnetic field. Both of our models agree that earth itself has a giant magnetic field with a pole at the north. Magnetic fields are absolutely observable and testable. Even in public schools we revealed magnetic fields by pouring iron shavings over a magnet which then aligns the shavings in a way that outlines the influence of the force which is otherwise invisible. So we can prove that magnetism has the ability to attract and repel objects and energies.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now consider this. Newton was brilliant but a little nutty. We can prove that magnetism attracts objects of opposite polarity. Lets run a very simple experiment to prove this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Build a box that is EM shielded. These are pretty easy to make. Put an object in the box and measure the objects weight. An item in an EM shielded box behaves the same way as if it werent in that box. This means there must be a force attracting that is immune to EM shielding.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can even take it a step further. Make this EM shielded box a vacuum. So we have no density conflicts and we have no EM therefore the item in the box should be weightless. Is it? No, again you could run this experiment yourself if you had the desire to do so.

        In addition, we see that as in a lava lamp density / buoyancy affects the relative position of the liquids. A hot air balloon controls it's buoyancy to reach a new state of equilibrium at a different altitude.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A lava lamp will not work in zero gravity (whatever). So lets put a lava lamp in an EM shielded box, what happens when the attracting  force is removed?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        All of the forces which we can actaully directly test are explainable through electromagnetism and density (which is really another expression of the electromagnetic force acting on the very small). We only need gravity to prove the theoretical.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No you do not understand even EM. Why arent magnets heavier than other metals of the same density? Show me anywhere where there is a model of EM that models our solar system. Seriously if you are so certain this exists then show me where you found your evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can give  you volumes of info on how gravity works, its all right there for you. You cant say the same about EM.
