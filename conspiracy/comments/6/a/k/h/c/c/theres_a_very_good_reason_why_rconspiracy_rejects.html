       Because it's pushed almost 24/7 by the mainstream media, is widely known and accepted by much of society, and makes no sense even as a theory (i.e.: what is the difference between what Russia has alleged to do and what all other countries and corporations do, what's the difference beyond being butthurt about Hillary losing and wanting a bogeyman to explain it)?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a huge segment of society accepts something as true, and the vast majority of society is at least widely aware of a theory, it's hardly the sort of thing to discuss here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you're "pushing" the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: As for the theory, it may very well be true that Putin worked with Trump.  So what?  The Clintons have worked with foreign countries to intervene in American politics for years.  What is the theory of what Russia did?  Some internet trolls?  A hack of real emails?  What's the actual scandal?  Like if the conspiracy was proven, what's the scandal in context of the fact that Trump's opponent was doing the same stuff with other countries.  Why do we care, unless we desperately hate Trump and want some sort of narrative to explain his existence in a moralistic way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, r/conspiracy doesn't care about this because it's all over the press.  Yeah, the press reported on Nixon.  They did NOT dig into the Chennault affair or the break-ins at Brookings.  Think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump being owned by the Rothschilds and on the same team as Hillary is a good conspiracy.  Being owned by Israel is a good conspiracy.  The press won't touch either idea.  But r/conspiracy doesn't need to rehash what's already on the front page of r/all, r/politics, etc etc on a daily basis, IMO.

       It also has a lot to do with the phrasing of the narrative they were trying to push.  They attempted to push HACKING in an effort to make Trump look like an illigitimate winner.  They were hopeful that if they used HACKING vs INTERFERENCE people would assume that actual voting ballots were tampered with which is obviously not the case.  The narrative falls short when most people realize that "hacking" simply means that the DNC server was hacked, emails were released that MAY HAVE swayed voters away from Hillary (which is not likely to a degree justified of altering results).
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate it still unreal that people are more concerned with WHO leaked information and could care less about the content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention nobody cares how the US is constantly interfering with foreign elections.

       From Clappers mouth.

       As you know, the I.C. was a coordinated product from three agencies; CIA, NSA, and the FBI not all 17 components of the intelligence community. Those three under the aegis of my former office. Following an extensive intelligence reporting about many Russian efforts to collect on and influence the outcome of the presidential election, President Obama asked us to do this in early December and have it completed before the end of his term.

       No it's not. Clapper testified that three agencies (NSA, CIA, FBI) produced the intelligence report saying they were "confident" Russia interfered in the election. The other 14 agencies just piggybacked on top of that report, but they didn't perform any independent analysis.

       Could be. Rally the opposition by catering exactly to what they want ("Hes an outsider" "Hes going to drain the swamp!"). Massive media campaign against him polarized the country like crazy and made his supporters much more loyal, to the point that they look the other way whenever he does anything. Gets elected, tows the deep state line. Personally don't think this is the case, he actually is an outsider, hes just being manipulated in other ways now.

       However, in reference to the "Russian Hacking" of the election, that was not the CIA. That was Seth Rich (dnc leaks at least) and Podesta was the victim of a phishing email.

       You have to realize people have been conditioned since they were kids to take what the MSM says as truth. Most people are unwilling to accept that they lie and push narratives and are owned by one of 6 corporations, all who have an agenda. We criticize state run media in other countries, but we have corporate run media here. How is that much different?

       Independent media. Not corporate owned. There are many lists online. Check all of them out and see which interests you. Also, most people only read news that fits their partisan leaning. Read news from both sides. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle.

       I also highly recommend the Corbett Report. Every episode is completely sourced.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree that the MSM is completely useless. There are great journalists working for CNN, BBC, etc., but their stories are usually pushed aside in favor of corporate interests. Corbett actually acknowledges this, and a lot of his research comes from these very same outlets, such as the BBC (which he jokingly calls the "Big Brother Corporation"). There are a lot of conspiracies talked about in the MSM, but
       <em>
        no one connects the dots
       </em>
       . So you have these great stories here and there that are completely usurped by propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that The Intercept, Truthdig, and Global Research are all great outlets. The Guardian also has surprisingly good investigative pieces, but it is also privy to MSM propaganda.

       If you can understand what the MSM's narrative is and what they are willing to lie about, you can actually use the MSM as a barometer for the truth. I.e., if the media is trying really hard to push a story that perfectly fits their narrative, but doesn't make logical sense, odds are it's a lie.

       You're implying the media environment is in any way competitive. 90% is owned by 6 corporations, it's an oligopoly that uses monopolistic barriers to preserve their status.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue that the interests of ownership among the 6 is much more alike than different.

       This is what happens when news journals agree to ignore newsworthy events that the whole world is aware of and large swaths of the world care at least a little bit about. I don't mean PG, I mean the Podesta Leak. It wasn't covered, and we got pizza gate because of it. Imagine if the media just decided not to cover the World Cup at all. So many people would lose their heads. This is what is happening.

       You can still get some of your news from MSM, in fact you should.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick is to learn how to filter out the opinion. Lend greater weight to the
       <em>
        facts
       </em>
       in any given source, and take any commentary by the presenter with a MOBA sized grain of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each time a particular story interests you, find as many different sources on that article as you can. You'll discover that what you're actually looking at are secondary sources, and you'll recognize a shared primary source between different news sources. (I.E., several articles about a topic source a book that came out recently about that topic, the book is the primary source, the articles are secondary sources)
      </p>
      <p>
       Over time, you'll find that different outlets have commentary that is more in line with your thinking based on having read a wide variety of sources. You'll find yourself gravitating to those sources for a period of time. That's okay. Your opinion will likely change over time, and different sources will be more appealing to you for different reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for specific sources:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Reddit. This subreddit, the sidebar subreddits, and numerous other corner subreddits have great discussion. Avoid the defaults.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         YouTube. Subscribe to people you find yourself watching more than 1-2 videos from. Explore related videos, etc.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         4chan. Garbage heap, but breaks a lot of things first. /pol/ for politics, /x/ for paranormal/UFOs
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Facebook (avoid if you can): If you have one, and like many people can't really drop it because it's your main contact to old friends, use it to 'Like' pages. Use optimal privacy settings (I.E. set all posts to 'friends' instead of 'global'). There are plenty of reasons to hate this place so if you aren't signed up, don't. But for the people stuck there, there are lots of good pages to 'Like'.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Absolutely Not
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Television. Turn that shit off. The ads fuck up your brain. Any relevant clips can be viewed on YouTube. You'll thank me once the brainwashing wears off.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Also, be aware, that on the internet, especially on Google/Facebook/AT&amp;T, you are always being tracked. Use screen names, proxies, etc.

       Those are all just mediums to host information. I'm not sure what your incredulity stems from, because YouTube and Reddit both have incredible content. Of course there's a lot of bullshit, but that's where fact checking comes into play. This sub in particular has has a lot of amazing, well-sourced posts. YouTube also has sources like the Corbett Report.

       To be fair, I see news on 4chan before it's anywhere else, often with live video that never shows up on news stations or its heavily edited. Seeing an event raw and uncut is is a lot bette than media spin.

       You can still read MSM, but parse out any editorialized context and speculation. Most articles could be summarized into "x happened", but they instead pad it with "context" to make it feel like a tale and speculation about where the tale goes next and why you should care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reduce news to JUST the things that happened and fill in the rest yourself. Other people's opinions aren't worth the weight they are usually given. Opinions, regardless who they belong to, are simply opinions. There are some people who may be more or less informed on a topic, but that almost NEVER means you should just assimilate or dismiss them because of this. Opinions are always subjective, so new perspectives are always more valuable than consensus. I will always value a unique perspective over a popular one on almost any topic.

       They often dabble in both editorialized context and speculation though.

       There is no outlet that doesn't add those additional flavors to their articles, because most people wouldn't read a sterile list of events.

       Lol. It's called developing critical thinking skills and being skeptical while open minded of any and all claims from anyone. If you cant build that foundation first, where you look for information doesn't matter. As for WHAT to look for when Newsing yourself, i suggest topics of personal relevance first, and then investigate the claims of people you regularly associate with. From there being hoomed on the news is about as brainwashy as going to church every day if your not careful.

       Also, international media is okay.  While some German press is likely controlled by CIA, and BBC is also government controlled, sometimes the fact that it is written for a different audience means they discuss facts you don't encounter in America.  In essence, media's job is to spin a message, not necessarily to cover up facts.  So different audiences get subtly different messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also Russian and Iranian propaganda media, but these despite possibly including a lot of bad info definitely give you the other side of the story, and then you can sort out for yourself which details are probably true.

       I can't stand Trump, or Clinton for that matter, consider myself pretty far left-leaning for the most part, and can see the 'Russia interfering in our election' theory is bullshit. It amounts to partisan and CIA propaganda used to deflect attention from the very content of the DNC e-mails and their implications (a rigged primary), further exploited by the CIA and intel community in order to manipulate the left into blaming Russia for all of their problems, much of them created by that very community and our own government.

       Because it's stupid and a waste of time. The mainstream media should be more concerned with the content and not the source. That's the only logical thing to do. The content of the emails have to do with US politicians. If the mainstream media is pushing the narrative that the Russians are the bad guys and not our own US politicians, then yeah the average person should put 2 and 2 together. The contents of the emails. I have a power through it illegal activities committed by US politicians. It's not illegal to talk to somebody if they're Russian.

       It's 2017. Hacking is everywhere. The 12-year-old kid with a smart phone can hack. What's so bad about the Russians hacking the DNC emails. Superpowers hack all the time. Just because you don't hear about it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. In most cases it happens and you don't hear about it. It just so happens this time the American public got to see emails of their own US politicians before an election. So if they are the ones that hack the DNC , what did Russia do wrong? I would rather see what my politicians are lying to me about then try to dig down some rabbit hole about how somebody exposed the lying politician.

The amount of clandestine military actions, election overthrowing, political assassinations and fuckery that the United States military and intelligence community is responsible for over the last hundred plus years would make you puke with horror.

       Also, people here seem to be hinging on "hacking" which isn't even the real problem here. The problem are direct ties to Kremlin money and power.

       Yeah, and that's because the rationale for this investigation has changed every single time their shitty theory gets shot down.  It's been eight plus months of these accusations and literally zero hard evidence coming out in support of them, including even James Clapper (Obama's IC Boss Daddy) admitting that there's
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       evidence of collusion.  And that's because the story is a fat fucking nothingburger and a charade to push a war for hegemonic dominance.  It's political theater designed to cover up real crimes exposed by WikiLeaks during and after the election, and to save face because they got behind a disastrous campaign and candidate and can't handle the loss.

       I wouldn't expect evidence during an investigation, that's how the US has always worked. Hell, Nixon was in the clear until the very minute he wasn't. But the cover up at the White House is clear to anyone paying attention.

       If you're looking at it from another side of the lens, you could also see it as Comey being the only person obstructing investigation into Clinton and her Clinton Foundation or the nationwide pedophilia rings, or the fact that he was ridiculously incompetent in the first place and should have been fired months ago for not only refusing to bring charges against Hillary Clinton that were more than justified, but for continuing to help undermine the Trump Administration with bulshit accusations based on shaky evidence bolstered by the source of the claims - in this case, the head of the FBI Director Comey continuing an investigation that has after 8 months of continuous rampant speculation and fear-mongering produced exactly
       <em>
        jackshit
       </em>
       of hard evidence.  But the truth is probably somewhere in the middle and you're definitely still overestimating Russian influence in our politics when you should be looking at Israel's influence a whole lot more, as that has actual credible proof and evidence supporting it going back

       Oh no, he deserved to be fired. But, the timing is pretty much proof that Trump is corrupt and Comey's people were getting close. They did issue subpoeneas for Flynn after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Senate Intel Comm also issued it's first subpoena since 9/11 and the Senate's first since Nixon. This is a big deal.

       Yes the timing is definitely shady for sure, but you also have to realize there's a lot of things going on behind the background that are not being reported on that certainly could have had an impact on why Comey was fired, as we all know it was definitely for unofficial reasons.  What we don't know is what those reasons are.

       Israel is involved in
       <em>
        plenty
       </em>
       of domestic affairs.  There's a reason AIPAC wields a ridiculous amount of power in Congress, just like there's a reason why tons of Mossad agents were routed out and arrested in the months following 9/11 for suspected ties to the plot itself, and why mostly everybody of importance tied to 9/11 in the profiting of the attack was a Zionist, Israeli politician or dual Israeli citizen working in the United States government or with the neoconservatives of the Bush Administration.  How about the five dancing Israelis (two were Mossad agents) that were captured on the day of the attacks and then let go, then appeared on Israeli national TV and admitted that they were there to "document the event"?   Why would Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly state that 9/11 was a great day for Israel?  What about
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       domestic abuse?

       I'm fully aware that Putin is basically a mob boss that owns Russia.  But again he's really no different or any better or worse than any of our Presidents, it's whatever country you're born in and whatever propaganda you're fed.  These people ultimately all eat at the same tables and do business together regardless of whether they are official enemies or not. What people fail to realize is that there are no good guys in this.  Trump and Putin are two people looking out for their own interests and whatever is going to make their country the strongest.  The fact that both of them are strong nationalists is actually a good thing for us, collectively.  I'm just solidly in favor of diplomacy and good relations with the only other country that can destroy us, for pretty common sense reasons.

       The big story is Russia is trying to influence foreign governments for their own self interests. (US would never) This is news to you? The cold war is an economic and production competition basically. Are you saying we are competing with foreign countries in these categories?  What a scoop.

       Because these are two superpowers. America interferes in elections in other countries all the time. It's harder for the US to influence the Russian elections. And even if the Russians hacked the DNC emails, they didn't do anything except for give the American people more information about the politicians that they are about ready to elect.

       I'm saying it doesn't matter. What's so bad about Russians hacking the DNC emails? Super powers hack all the time. It's just that most of the time we don't see it. This time we got to see it before an election. If anything you should say thanks.

       I imply that it's bad. I also imply that it is the norm. I'm not gonna go to war with Russia because they exposed emails of US politicians before an election. You should've already known the things in the emails but you don't. If you want to persecute hackers you better clear your list of things to do. If you don't want people hacking you, use more precaution.

       I don't think you are. If you were you would speaking out against provable corruption everywhere. Instead you push a conspiracy with zero hard evidence and chose to brush aside facts. Give me a link to a post or comment of yours before the election, when she still had a chance to become president, where you voiced your concerns this much about where the $2billion for her campaign came from. Though you can't because they both don't exist and you created this throwaway so you wouldn't be subjected to your own hypocrisy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There hasn't been a single official document presented to the public to substantiate the collusion clam. In fact quite the opposite, both Comey and Clapper testified before Congress that there was ZERO evidence to support the claim.

       I will tell you that I think she's a corrupt piece of shit, that tried to avoid FOIA laws, is extremely incompetent with computer security and classified documents, and is beholden to Wall Street and donors.

       Side note: the last administration politicized neutral agencies like the FBI, IRS, NSA, CIA, DOJ, DOE, to the point that the general public has lost faith in them.  Comey gave Bill Clinton a pass on pardoning Mark Rich, one of the FBI's top ten most wanted at the time.  Andrew McCabe's wife was given $750k to run a campaign by a Clinton loyalist.  If you believe there is nothing political about the "investigation" then you're more naive than you let on.

       Piece of advice, you shouldn't assume things. I read the article. CNN can print whatever they want about Clapper saying whatever he wants.  The FACT remains that UNDER OATH, in front of CONGRESS, he testified that there was no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no argument other than to link to an outlet that we know for a fact colluded with the Clinton campaign.  I'll take congressional testimony over a corrupt rag any day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could link to all of the articles about the new book by a Clinton insider claiming the Russia narrative was spun on election night.  But that's not provable evidence is it?  Like CNN clickbait articles are not provable evidence, and shouldn't be used in a serious discussion about accusations of the highest magnitude.  Try again.

       Notice how whenever they push that narrative they're purposely vague. It's always 'russia hacked/interfered/influenced the election.' They rarely go into any more details than that.

       Unfortunately, the foundation of the entire Russian hacking narrative was
       <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf">
        this thing
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Professionally speaking, it is shit. Using that as a foundation for attribution is bush league and fails to point to any actual "evidence". Furthermore, the source code has been available for some time so no speculation about the spooks having tools to populate malware with patterns used by other groups is required.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a comparative example,
       <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-OPM-Data-Breach-How-the-Government-Jeopardized-Our-National-Security-for-More-than-a-Generation.pdf">
        here is a 110M PDF that details the investigation of the OPM breach
       </a>
       . The Chinese did that one but everyone seems to have forgotten that there are other countries in this world other than Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without a technical foundation the stronger narrative is that Russia is a cover for mass-internal surveillance of political opponents.

       all right well lets start there then "expand the investigation" how could we argue against that? Here go get the servers they haven't let the fbi look from crowdstrike, then we can get to the bottom of the russian narrative when we find their paws all over those servers.

       was talking about. Honestly, I didn't even read those links. He made a claim that he's a "professional researcher", and I call bullshit.

       If it were an ad hominem attack, I would have said "your argument is bullshit because you aren't a professional researcher". I never made that claim. Like I said, I haven't even read his links. That's why it isn't an ad hominem attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really care. But I don't think he's a professional researcher, and unless he's going to prove it somehow, he shouldn't go around trying to bolster his credibility by claiming he is.

       Ad hominem would have been you attacking him in response to his original idea, but you were attacking the very idea that he was a professional not that he did or did not know what he was talking about.

       As I said, the evidence stands on it's own so trying to slide the narrative towards me with personal attacks leading to  "he won't dox himself so he's lying" isn't going to be an effective strategy today.

       I don't have questions about the blog. My point is, any idiot can link to a blog. You claim to be some professional researcher with 20+ years of experience. I just want clarification as to whether you mean you are a professional "researcher" or if you just mean "I read a lot of blogs".

       I'm not even following whatever topic you were talking about. You claim to be an expert, I want proof. I can link you to a paper on quantum mechanics, that doesn't make me an expert in physics.

       As I said, it doesn't matter. The links I provided stand on their own. This business has no room for posers. You either come through with the data or you STFU.

      <p>
       Without getting technical, the reason for this is that you must be able to define it is that you must automate everything. Attacks are automated and thus response must be automated. This also means automating the accurate recognition of an attack and that isn't happening manually either...

       Again there needs to be some actual evidence of Russian influence in the White House because there has been no hard evidence and only a bunch of conjecture and political shit-flinging so far.  Now if you want to look for Zionist / Israeli influence in the White House,
       <strong>
        look who's fucking the Presidents daughter that literally shares his room with Bibi Netanyahu
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian conspiracy is fodder for the idiot sheeple to rally the public to a frothing madness against both Trump (for having the audacity to beat them in 2016) and Putin (their boogeyman that triggers the left) so when the bottom drops out underneath the USA and Western world from banker fuckery, it will be blamed on the BRICS nations and their affiliates, and the public will explode and demand vengeance.  Yay, the elite get their World War 3 like they wanted!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know what the real conspiracy behind Trump is, look no further than Jared Kushner himself, Cadre and Lucent Technologies.  It's no accident that Kushner bought 666 5th Avenue for a record-breaking $1.8 billion dollars.  He is the true puppet master behind Ivanka and Trump.

       Trump has made every effort to stop the Russia investigation and he and his people have lied to the American people so many times about communications with Russia (some have lied under oath and broken the law, one of those people is the AG) or anything related to it. Also Trump tried to stop the info about his BS by clearing house at the CIA. That didn't work. Then he tries to fire the FBI director because he wouldn't stop the investigation! Like... it is staring you in the face and you won't believe it.

       He called it a waste of taxpayer dollars and a distraction, which it is.  Flynn lied about his ties to Russia and that's been proven.  Sessions did not lie under oath and that has been conclusively proven.  What house did he clear at the CIA?  More importantly do not understand what the CIA actually does?  Comey deserved to be fired a million times over and both sides hated him for entirely different reasons that were both legitimate.  You sound like you're buying into a lot of partisan rhetoric and not looking at the Hard facts which is that there was no hard evidence or proof of ties between Trump and his campaign or Russia.  James Clapper himself even said this less than a few days ago, and he was in charge of basically every major intelligence service during the Obama Administration.

       I hate the CIA with all my being, but they had info about Trump's collusion with Russia but because they are a foreign agency, they couldn't do anything. Obama knew as president and ordered them to turn over everything to the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you remind me of all those people that downvoted and the mods that deleted the thread here about the secret meeting between trump and a russian agent caught on camera at an airport late in the primaries. Yet you were probably the same kind of person to call out and upvote the post about the meeting bill clinton had with the Obama AG.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corruption runs deep in washington. Right now Trump is president and he is the center of this corruption. This is a huge conspiracy. Hell, throw in the isreal shit and deep state shit. Trump loves the shit out of Isreal, and he also had a weird meeting with Kissinger the other day that wasn't on the public record. Trump also has started selling weapons to terrorists, so there is that angle too. Corruption central and well beyond the obvious firing of the man investigating him.

       Curious as to when you heard this? I listen to NPR on my morning commute and cannot imagine this being said. They were in the bag for Gorsuch, and they have multiple GOP members on pretty frequently.

       Why would being in the bag for Gorsuch be surprising? Gorsuch was confirmed unanimously by the Senate to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, receiving the full support of Democratic senators at the time, including Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton.  So it sounds like NPR was being consistent while you and the rest of the media are utilizing the 2017 democratic talking point of "Gorsuch is the worst! He's a fascist!"

       You're implying that they made a blanket statement, which I've personally never heard them make. All of their shows are based around open forums. So, just let me know when you heard it and I'll look it up.

       Oh, is that what I said? It's funny how not liking to be enraged over stupidly while I'm driving is suddenly listening to only the right.
      </p>

       I try to listen to the right too but, again, I can only listen in short increments. News flash: I hate the GOP as much as the DNC and have never been a republican. I'm guessing you most be a liberal or, more accurately, a neoliberal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I'm always hoping to turn the station to laugh at both sides but then once either side raises my blood pressure (while driving, I might add), I turn it off. There are other things to listen to: music, books on tape, language programs, podcasts like highersidechats, red ice. Jesus, dude, there's a wide range of interesting material to listen to outside of talk radio.

       Well now, we found where we're in agreement. I used to listen to NPR a lot. Thinking that Bernie may have been on the level and NPR giving him the Ron Paul/distain treatment was the first gut punch that it took for me to realize they weren't as neutral as I had thought. I was so naive to think NPR would be different from the rest of the MSM.

       For the record, I never disagreed with you lol. Honestly, I think we're stuck with it. There's no way the left is going to vote 3rd party in 2018 and 2020. If anything Trump's election pushed that divide even further apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I think more people are open to the idea of allowing more than one party, and realize that our system is antiquated. So in that respect, yeah, you're probably right that raising awareness is the only way. I voted Gary Johnson in the last two elections...

       I suppose you're right-lol. Sorry to be so defensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's great the libertarian party is on the ticket in all states but I worry about voting third-party now because I'm paranoid they'll be more likely to steal the third-party votes. I can't believe how badly the third parties did this election, really disappointing. They couldn't have done that bad, right? But tptb are going to continue to keep them lower than 15% in the polls and out of debates and off any form of media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the problem I had the last election: both third party candidates seemed like controlled opposition. So it seems the entire system is corrupted and even if a miracle happened and an honest POTUS was inaugurated, the deepstate would still take over the presidency through the carrot or stick method of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lean libertarian myself (I only liked Bernie 'cuz I thought he was well-intentioned and honest) and normally would vote libertarian but didn't because of Gary being a total sellout. Gary and Bill endorsed HRC before the election, hurting their chances, and even called her a "wonderful public servant."  Then Jill had recounts w/more funding than she could get as an actual candidate, all after she got what she wanted w/Hillary not being the president. So it just leaves you thinking that third parties got co-opted and that the entire thing is all for show and I'm wondering if I'll even bother voting anymore. All we get is more of the same every damn time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't know what to do. So many problems need to be fixed, it's overwhelming but I remain somewhat idealistic that if enough people wake up to the sad reality, it can then be a catalyst for change. But even that seems pretty unrealistic, although not impossible and I suppose a good goal to strive for. Politics got so divisive this election, orchestrated by tptb who don't want us united, and now I need to work on improving my tone and trying to find common ground w/my least favorite people: neocons and neolibs.

       In CO, GJ got 5%, and in Utah, Evan McMullin got 21%, which is astronomically higher than in 2012. So people are def waking up to the system and it's problems. But, I think you're generally right that the 3rd parties have little chance of catching on anytime soon, at least to get into the actual debate phase. Trump/Clinton really put that to grinding halt, especially with Trump winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll vote for Bernie if he's alive at 79 and running, and I would have voted for him in 2016, but the DNC fucked that up bad. Oh well. It is what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, we could all work on our tone. I think everyone is frustrated and pissed off about where things are. People cling to ideology in this country, which is fine, but problems just continue to mount and people refuse to budge on their beliefs. Many of us seem pretty flexible. We know the healthcare system is fucked, we know the 1% gets everything, we know about the corruption, we know we need to make things right... But, we just don't seem to agree on the how.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversations like this give me some hope though. We're all just trying to figure it out, and we're all gonna have to keep talking it through.

       Alright so here's my conspiracy theory that stems back to Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin take Crimea, sanctions are put on Russia, Russian economy suffers due to sanctions. Check a GDP graph and you'll see in 2014 there's a big drop and its only getting worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia wants sanctions to end. United States is the main country putting sanctions on. This leads to Russia wanting a pro Russia or Russia neutral leader as the president. Clearly that wouldn't be Hillary.

       Rex Tillerson is our Secretary of state. Ex ExxonMobil CEO with a big stake in the company obviously. He directly benefits from laxxed sanctions on Russia due to the fact that they have vast potential for oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump attacked Syria in defense of "chemical weapons" which led to "tensions rising" between Russia and US. They both look good if they end the war in Syria over "peace talks" that end Russian sanctions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the end, it's a conspiracy theory.

       Basically in a nut shell, Hillary emails is the evidence of influence on U.S. elections. If that's the evidence, I'm glad Russia is our ally and The Clinton oligarchy has been diminished.

       I have a question, a serious question setting all politics and conspiracies aside for the moment: would we stand a chance against Russia, and on what terms? Im not suggesting we would lose, but the common US citizens view is of a backwards poor  wanna be american Russia and holds US as an unstoppable military force. I know we have the most nukes, battle cruisers, and the top tech, but what does thay mean in the scheme of things against Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate the idea of war with Russia (or anyone for that matter). I feel like our cultures arent that different, and theres no reason we shouldnt get along. If my country was being attacked, i would defend it to the death. Id just never see myself going onto foreign soil to attack someone. How wouls russias people feel? How would they see us. How is the media successfully painting them as a technologically advanced yet equally insane/stupid version of north korea?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its astonishing that clinton/supporters want a war with the other great power at all, especially when liberals claim to be so against war. I also realize the whole bipartisan thing is bullshit, but something has to be up with the trump pure hate train. Since before the election, my reddit and facebook feeds have been flooding nonstop with trump hate.

       We would not stand a chance on russian soil. Russia wouldn't stand a chance on ours. That's why hillary was trying to force an engagement in syria. We're far better positioned in the middle east than asia.

       I believe we are superior to Russia on all matters of war, but that's beside then point. Why are our elected officials acting like kids, tit for tat, childish games. Do we want a better America or not? Are we going to be bitter about losses or move forward? These are the questions that run through my head.

       There will be no war but only loss of energy arguing BS. Maybe that's the plan from the start, I don't know, but it's BS non the less.

       This isn't vague reasoning? "what other countries and corporations do?" Give me a break! The House, Senate, and FBI wouldn't be investing time if it weren't a serious issue. A vague and indescribable one unless you have hours of time perhaps, but a serious one nevertheless.

       I personally believe in the Russia narrative, and that the current president, or at least his advisors, engaged in some shady shit with Russia to help win the election. But don't take my word for it. I'm gonna post this comment from
       <a href="/r/AskTrumpSupporters">
        /r/AskTrumpSupporters
       </a>
       , which goes over the most important parts concisely.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First, it's pretty much confirmed that Russia meddled into the election. They hacked the DNC servers and released damaging emails at opportune times to favor Trump over Hillary. They did not do the same to the RNC. Either they tried to and couldn't, didn't want to, or did and didn't get caught or release anything. Russia did the exact same thing this past week in the French election. Russia also produced a lot of real fake news and propaganda to sway the election for Trump.
       </p>
       <p>
        The thing is, did Trump know about this at the time? Did he aid them or even give them the thumbs up to do all this? Any of that is likely highly illegal. It's not confirmed but there are a lot of circumstantial evidence that he (or at least his administration) did know and "colluded" with Russia to hack the DNC.
       </p>
       <p>
        Flynn is the first confirmed illegal act. Before Trump's inauguration, Flynn violated the Logan Act and spoke to Russian diplomat about the sanctions President Obama placed on Russia. This is a violation because at the time, he did not actually hold a position at the WH yet. There is only one president at a time. But what's worse, he lied to Pence about it who then turned and told that lie to the media about it. Then recently it turned out that he took money from Russia illegally. You can't be a retired general with clearance and take money from a foreign aid. But most alarming is that Flynn's connection with Russia seems to be really strong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yates warned Trump about Flynn. Obama warned Trump about Flynn before he was even hired. However, did not fire him and Flynn kept his clearance until the media found out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sessions also lied under oath about never meeting with the same Russian diplomat during the election but then met with him twice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Turns out many of the Trump administration has been meeting with Russians in foreign cities even during the election.
       </p>
       <p>
        The unconfirmed dossier from an MI6 agent says Russia has dirt on Donald both financially and personally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump won't release his tax returns which would shed some light on his dealings with Russia. (But not all).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump rarely attacks Putin on anything but seems to attack everybody else.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump has questions NATO and called it obsolete. NATO was originally formed to protect against Russia, and is still seen as anti-Russian.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump originally stated he wanted to work with Russia on fighting ISIS and not attacking Assaad. He has since turned on this issue and has attacked an airfield in Syria but it practically did nothing other than a show of force.
       </p>
       <p>
        NOW, Trump fired the head of the FBI who was investigating the collusion. His timing and reasoning is EXTREMELY suspect.

       Yeah, the burden of proof for proving Russia meddled is high while the burden of proof on who they blame Seth Rich's death on is low. That's why I can't take anyone here seriously.

       Sure it could be. But inversely couldn't this argument be abused as a way to make allegations without any proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like throwing someone in jail for theft, then when someone asks how you know they did it, arguing that you can't tell them because if you told them then every thief would know and you wouldn't be able to stop thieves in the future.
      </p>

       When did we start throwing people in jail for crimes we cannot objectively prove they committed?

       This is sort of made an indisputable claim, because the basis of my argument is that we would never know if they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, to not simply escape the question one possible example is 9/11, more specifically the 28 pages that were declassified about a year ago.

       I agree with you that assigning blame is different than a conviction. However, in this instance peoples' opinions are being swayed by claims that have no evidence to support them. In a Democratic society I feel this is a large part of making a conviction, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of a jury, when they have made their opinion on a case they make a verdict. If guilty, there are repercussions. The verdict should not be based on unverifiable evidence, and it normally never is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially I'm saying that Americans are the jury in this case, their opinion is being swayed by unverifiable evidence, which in my example would ultimately lead to a verdict. The repercussions in this case would be future voting behavior.

         George Tenet said "slam dunk." The administration and intelligence community was staffed with yes-men and people who were already on board with the larger plan to attack Iraq that had been planned since

       The larger agenda always goes through regardless of whatever Administration is in power.  In this case, Iraq was the second of 7 planned targets that were picked out for war immediately following 9/11, and even earlier if you read the Project for a New American Century papers.  Rest assured the administrations made sure they staffed the IC with loyalists and other neoconservatives/neoliberals that would go along with things smoothly.  Vietnam War in general was part of a larger effort to fight proxy wars against Communist Russia and China while Rockefeller factories created weaponry to kill American GIs and created the drug trade in Southeast Asia to ship it back to America with the military and destroy our communities from within.  9/11 was part of a larger pretext to create a global war on terrorism to use as an excuse to invade and replace the last remaining sovereign nations that resisted the banking cartels, globalism or the will of Washington, London and the Vatican's New World Order.  The various ICs of the world (at the leadership levels) are mainly tools of the elite who spy on the public, keep their politicians in check via blackmail (honeypots, pedo/Brownstone op), death threats, bribery, slander, defamation, assassinations, whatever.

       These are the claims I've got from this article, not saying that these are the only claims, I may have misread or misunderstood some parts of the article;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Justice Department’s indictment of five Chinese hackers noted that they worked 9-to-5 Shanghai time and took an hour off for lunch, while previous FBI scrutiny of a group of Russian hackers concluded that they worked Moscow hours and paused for Orthodox Christmas
       </p>
       <p>
        ...there’s strong substantiation not just of the reuse of tools and techniques between operations, but also of the reuse of hacking infrastructure. It seems the same computers that were used to break into the DNC were also used against other targets, such as the German Parliament — all cases attributed by a variety of investigators to Russia. The computer security community has been following these particular Russian hacking groups for years, and the DNC hack easily fits the pattern.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't read much into the work hours argument at its face, but coupled with the 2nd quote I provided it certainly raises suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       My criticism though is that these arguments are hearsay. Show me
       <em>
        proof
       </em>
       of these claims instead of just someone
       <em>
        making
       </em>
       the claims. Once that happens I (and I'm sure many others) will start to see your side of things, but as of now we haven't seen any objective evidence.

       The Russians definitely sided with Trump/Republicans during the 2016 election. That doesn't mean Trump or the Republican party conspired with Russia to hack the DNC. I mean maybe they did, but other than support for a hugely superfluous military industrial complex residing in each country, I don't know what Republicans have in common with Russian officials. Got any ideas?

       The FBI is executing a search warrant on a GOP fundraising company as I type this. Reportedly its part of a RICO money laundering case involving the highest GOP pols. Given that just yesterday the Senate committee on the Russia thing requested stuff from the agency that monitors money laundering...

       That was when the whole "it's the RUSSIANS!!" Came about. Basically the MSM was getting balled out for not covering the leaks/emails/contents. So they invented a way to cover all hacked emails/leaks by blaming it on the Russians and thereby they cover their asses and also obfuscate the contents of whatever was reported. It's all total bullshit.

       Yeah, which is one of the many reasons you shouldn't do it, in addition to the fact that it makes you look like a tool because it clearly illustrates you have no

      <p>
       I was going through the posts today on the front page of Conspiracy, and once again, it's filled with replies that are angry, condescending, and thread derailing while only offering opinions, not fact. Opinions are perfectly fine! But lately they have been stated while being a condescending jerk. If you didn't agree with the stated opinion, you were basically an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The politic threads are over powering everything. 
There is an actual thread with a conspiracy that just happened to be politic related, but does not involve "Russia is world killer" narrative and of course, it was derailed immediately.

       If anything, replying to threads more often lately, with my one &amp; only account, it is teaching me that I really shouldn't care when my karma drops lol.

       Right?  In all the years I've been on reddit, this is the only place where my karma has ever nosedived.  At first I was really surprised and offended, especially because I'm never hateful or overtly rude. But it's an entirely different ballgame in this sub, so I don't even pay attention to my karma anymore.  It's nice.

       Part of the issue is that a lot of people (including myself at one point) disbelieve the Russia narrative purely because they love Trump (which is what the deep state wants you to do; use emotion, not logic).
      </p>
      <p>
       Its important to realize that you can dislike Trump AND use some logic and realize the fallacies with the Russian claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, all you need to do is picture yourself being in the driver seat.  Ask yourself, "if i had all of the money and power, and I could harness all of the intelligence agencies, how would I unequivocally solve this problem?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And then ask "why aren't THEY doing that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they aren't trying to solve the problem - it is a totally manufactured argument to get you emotionally invested on either side

       For me, the hypocrisy is pretty funny.  Hillary was firmly in the pocket of the Saudis, UAE, and their cohorts through the Clinton Foundation.  But the democrats are kicking and screaming about a possibility of influence by a different foreign power (and the influence, if any, is far more vague than the "worst-kept secret" Clinton Fkundation stuff).  It goes to show what emotion will do - no one cares about the principle as long as your "side" was the beneficiary.

       Precisely - for the longest time, I was logically blinded by my emotional disdain for Hillary - but when Trump won, I never really felt satisfied some reason - so I kept digging.  And now, I feel like I can see the bigger picture and I have a better understanding of the game that they're playing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the way to win the game isn't just to sit back and analyze their moves - the only way to win is to take initiative to imagine a world that you would prefer to live in; and then gain the educational and technological prowess to make it happen

       Or, at least understand that the game is afoot and play it the best you can.  Remember, you don't have to beat the elites to live well, you just have to beat the other 80%, which, quite frankly, is t all that tough.

       I see this all over the place (not so much since the election) and the general idea seems to be that since governments donated to the CF there must be something nefarious going in.
That's as specific as it tends to get.

       Russian company Uranium One's chairman frank Guistra donated $2.5m to the Clinton foundation while Hillary was sec of state. At the same time, Bill was paid $500k for a speech to the bank financing Uranium One.
      </p>
      <p>
       Uranium One was given control over 20% of US uranium. Since uranium is a strategic resource with national security issues tied to it, the deal had to be approved by the Secretary of State. Hillary Clinton approved the deal and sold off a fifth of our uranium.

       First of all, the sale itself isn't the issue, the corresponding donation is the issue. Trump may be making the same sale, but the House Of Saud didn't donate millions of dollars to him. He did it for free, which is in some ways worse, some ways better (and I hate the guy.)

       Secondly, it's because it is one instance of quid pro quo in a decades long history of the same.  Part of that is politics, but again, the Clintons take it to a whole new level.

       Hillary apologists trump card is always "What about Trump he's so much worse!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary has decades of history. Hillary and her cronies in the DNC lied, cheated, stole and rigged the primary from Bernie.

       It was her turn! ;(

       Yeah, you'll have your die-hands on both sides.  I voted Trump for his policies and anti-left anti-SJW rhetoric.  I was hopeful he wouldn't turn out to be corrupt like the others, but I guess we'll see, and I'll reserve judgment until we know (if we ever do).  When accosted by Hillary supporters, my go to line was "I know Hillary's crooked, Trump might not be, and even if he is, the difference comes down to who you like from a policy standpoint".

       6 year ban on congressmen returning as lobbyists, pushing a constitutional amendment for congressional term limits (laugh, I know, long shot), extreme vetting of new immigrants, deportation of illegals, renegotiating NAFTA, terminating involvement in Trans-Pacific potential agreement, allowing the keystone pipeline, etc.

       I never got the immigration stuff, Obama deported more illegals than Bush and increased the vetting process, along with a legal immigrant has not committed a terrorist attack here anyway, didn't see Hillary backing away from any of that. It always felt like a hot button issue that never even needed much attention.

       By science, I assume you mean climate change. Few folks disagree that climate change isn't real and most will concede that it might even be human created. The part that doesn't fly is the solution
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       involves giving money to some other humans that don't know how to fix it either. For some reason they all seem to be similarly affiliated also.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be fooled, 'climate change' is a multi-billion dollar growth industry and like any other industry they are going to churn out whatever propaganda that supports their end game. As usual, normal folks are caught in the middle with incomplete information and being manipulated by both sides.
      </p>

       Good rule in life is that it should be a big warning sign when the primary recruiting slogan is "you're stupid if you disagree".

       For the environment, I'm looking forward to the EPA going back to focusing on the obvious stuff; anyone remember what a

       Unfortunately I don't have time to go into a climate change lesson, but if you do your own research, good for you. And don't be fooled, fossil fuel is a billion dollar long standing industry wanting to churn out whatever alternative facts to keep it alive. I work heavily in sciences and pay attention as closely as I can to these things.

       This is kinda ironic, really, their funding is getting slashed left and right and you're looking for them to fix MORE things. Why don't you look at where that money is going? The defense and weapons industry. Like always. Clean water is something we have had for a long time, local city government knows how to fix Flint, so why don't they? As your link even said...the EPA seems quite busy already cleaning up our toxic messes.

       There's a local quarry by me, awesome little place. Nice little wading area, a 30 foot rock to jump off of, plenty of places to sprawl out. It is a real melting pot there too; hippies, bussinessmen, rich, poor, black, white, asian. Everyone goes there because it is so close to downtown you can make it there from the local college and back in-between a class, or lunch break. Dogs come along, some people grill out, swim, drink, do drugs, pretty much whatever is good as long as you aren't an ass hole to others. Now on the far end, there's a massive ledge, hundreds of feet from water to top of the cliff. The only way to get up there is by driving along a back road and of course there's a million and a half "do not jump" signs located up there, everyone I ever talked to at that quarry says somebody tries to jump up and every single time dies because there's old mining equipment below the surface where if the impact doesn't kill you, a broken back and inability to swim will. You can't get away from hearing this, sit anywhere in the quarry for 10 minutes and someone will bring up a death that happened recently from someone jumping off. It is a well known fact you should not jump off the top of that cliff, or you will die.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what happened a few weeks ago. Someone went up to the top, jumped off, and died.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes trying to out think everyone else is as stupid as it sounds.

       A conspiracy is a conspiracy.  This isn't
       <a href="/r/HiddenConspiracy">
        /r/HiddenConspiracy
       </a>
       (huh, that's a real sub).  So even if it's a "mainstream conspiracy", I still want to know how and why the dots connect.  Once we all know that, we can move on.  Until then, I think it's lame to claim it's not worth exploring for
       <em>
        any

       reasons.

       How is it a straw man argument? The OP clearly said that this is something that's "hardly the sort of thing to discuss here. Unless you're "pushing" the narrative."
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, flat earth, alien visitation, etc. But Trump-Russia, that is where we should draw the line for what shouldn't be discussed here?
      </p>
      <p>
       I say to hell with that. Trump-Russia is a conspiracy and should be allowed to be discussed within a conspiracy subreddit without being accused of pushing a narrative.

       So are Neomccarthyists with this russia shit. The difference is only one of these narratives is also being pushed by the mainstream media.

       The trump russia one - which means there are plenty of places to discuss it outside of here. The value of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       to me is that one is allowed to express ideas not promulgated by the news media 24/7.

      <p>
       If the narrative you are pushing is also backed by corporate media and mainstream politicians, its probably bullshit

       Anyone who has read the so called evidence knows it is all hot air. The joint intelligence report with handwaving about bears and calling Russian Times reporting on US police violence and the pitfalls of the two party system, literally hacking the election. Or the totally debunked Hillary funded CrowdStrike, the only humans ever to inspect the hacked DNC server, report waving its hands about bears again, then the attempt to save it with a report ThreatConnect (Fidelis) trying to fix the debunked parts of the CrowdStrike's hand waving. It all started with the exposed as fake piss dossier long before the election. Now that it is almost a year old FBI investigation, it seems thoroughly debunked. There just is no evidence.

       Them not releasing it yet doesn't mean there is nothing. Why would the MSM find out all the evidence? The FBI hasn't even gathered all the evidence yet. They are raiding multiple businesses connected with Trump and Russia today, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do right wingers keep screaming for evidence? It's how investigation works, you fucking investigate all the ties before you start telling everyone about facts and evidence. They sure do seem to have plenty considering it is still ongoing and escalating.

       It's all a distraction. The MSM spends an entire week talking about some new irrelevant update in the story.

       Does anybody think this shit is genuine? If it was genuine do you know how easy it would be to get to the bottom of whatever illegally happened and then impeach Trump?

       The media covers sone quote from some irrelevant person for an entire week and people eat it up. Meanwhile in that same time period we have spent billions and killed a few hundred innocent people in other countries. Let's keep talking about November 8th though.

       Former-ish Trump supporter here. I have been brainstorming with my super liberal mother about the situation. We think that those around Trump have had the dealings with Russia, ensuring victory at all cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether Trump himself knows of it, we are unsure, but we would be surprised if Russia hadn't tried to do so. For some perspective, I have no doubt the US does the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I am a strong strong supporter of the idea that the DNC leaks were the work of an insider. Based on the process and fingerprints involved in the leaks. Overall motive: we think the Russians did it because Putin hates Hillary (almost more than I do lol).

       This seems pretty likely at this point. Who knows if Trump was actually involved, but there's an obvious cover-up going on.

       Because it is still developing.  This is all under a year old, really.  Trumps relationships become more and more apparent every day and every time he says/does anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on how you choose to look at it, we're wayyy beyond "Russia hacking the election".   A better title would be "Possible traitors in the White House that have sold out the American people, complete with paper trails and money trails."

       It's still a conspiracy theory, as it hasn't been proven yet, but one would think on a Sub like this, that LOVES to dissect every little fucking thing, and even create shit where it doesn't exist, one would think that this sub would be ALL OVER this shit.  There's so much red tape that can be pulled out, it's almost shameful that this particular sub isn't having a field day with a global conspiracy like this.  It's depressing that all that ever gets brought up is stupid shit about vaccines, Hillary, and a couple people who have died under "mysterious" circumstances.

       Lmfao! Where were you the last 8 years?  Fast and Furious, Tea Party targeting by IRS, exchange five terrorist generals for one deserter, pay billions to Iran in cash to get around sanctions, arming al-qaeda in Syria, over throwing Ghadaffi for no reason... I could go on and on about traitors in the Whitehouse selling out the American people with paper and money trails.  Get over yourself and learn some CONTEMPORARY history at the very least.

       I asked where your outrage was when the last president was proven to have abused his power and commited treason.  Seeing as how you're accusing the current president with ZERO proof, I brought up the last president whom we have tons of proof on, I'd say that's relevant.

       How can I have a discussion with someone who parrots the TV without a thought of their own?  You are unwilling to acknowledge that there is no evidence Trump colluded with Russia even though Comey and Clapper both said there was none.

       Running guns to cartels in exchange for cash to continue black wars is treason.  Exchanging a known deserter with no use for five high ranking, extremely dangerous generals is treasonous.  Going around sanctions put in place by Congress and sending BILLIONS OF US DOLLARS IN CASH ON PALLETS to Iran is treasonous.  I could go on and on but you don't understand what treason actually is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You armchair political scientists have no grasp on reality. You ignore FACTS that directly affect the global landscape and cling to BS propagated by a corrupt media with nothing more than hearsay that does nothing more than divert your attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me what hard evidence of "shady shit" do you base your argument on? The false claim that "17 intelligence agencies agree?" Even though they include the DoE and Coast Guard, and not a single one of them released an official statement in the matter?  That Manafort and Flynn had Russian dealings, and the moment Trump found out he got rid of them?  The FACT that both COMEY and CLAPPER both testified before CONGRESS that there was ZERO evidence of collusion? That after more than a year's worth of data collection and investigations there hasn't been a single shred of evidence presented to the public, other than by the private company with strong ties to the Clinton camp whom the DNC brought in over the FBI under Obama; who by the way have had to come out with major retractions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But none of these FACTS matter do they because you FEEL good listening to Colbert and Maher and laughing at the Cheeto Drumpf?  Forget about Obama's extrajudicial drone striking of American citizens, let's spin Drumpf trying to do something Muslim countries do into somehow being anti-Muslim.  Let's forget about Clinton brokering the Uranium One deal to sell 20% of our uranium to Russia (total coincidence her campaign manager had 75k shares in the company) and spin Drumpf wanting to go the peaceful route with Russia into him somehow both working for Russia and also wanting WW3 with Russia.

       "Possible traitors have sold out the American people". In what way?

      <p>
       Bill Clinton did policies that hurt the economy but got him lots of money from China.  Hillary took money from gulf states to start terror wars in the Mideast in which soldiers have died.  Who's the traitor?

       I'm only saying, what exactly is it that these trump "traitors" have done?  There never seems to be an answer to that, which is why I called it a stupid theory.

       It's interesting that some people want to shut down the investigation.  Let's protect God-emporer at all costs while he plays golf and laughs at the plebes defending him.  Let the investigation play out and let the chips fall where they may.  Firing the 3 people who are investigating is pretty damn suspicious not to mention Flynn asking for immunity.

       The Panama Papers prove the Podesta has a financial relationship with Russia. He submitted an LD 1 disclosure form to Congress after the leak that also proves this connection. Money pours out of Sberbank, into RAS Corporate Services, through Troika Dialog and into Podesta's pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is just one avenue of payment. Still off the books and as of yet unreported is the arrangement to hide shares of Uranium One in Joule, and then give 100,000 shares (25,000 per year) to Podesta into his daughter's company, Leonidas LLC.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just a slice. The Clinton Foundation worked with Kazatomprom CEO (who was later arrested) and was paid millions for arranging a obfuscation scheme with Frank Giustra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frank Giustra got Kazatomprom uranium and put it in Uranium One. Then, he shut down Uranium One, sold all its assets to his canadian mining firm, then changed the name of his mining firm to Uranium One.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is now Uranium One is actually not at all what the original was. Keep in mind, their quarterlies are published. The amount of money involved is staggering.
      </p>
      <p>
       What no one is looking into is this deal and how many US politicians got paid. It was likely both sides of the aisle and it was likely hundreds of US officials who profited from this deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real Russian investigation is right there, but no one is looking into it because the news wants everyone to think Trump is the one who is doing these things.

       Pro-tip.... he's not. Not that I trust Kushner any further than you can throw him, but we already know who sluts out for Russian rubles and it mostly consists of Democrats and people surrounded by convicted pedophiles.

       Spot on. There's so many examples like that of corruption and collusion where the evidence is already public and easy to connect. We even have a lot of it in their own words from wikileaks emails.

       The media attacking him is the main reason so many of his most ardent supporters still believe a thing he says.  The media is part of the military industrial complex and I don't think they have any problems with Trump other than his seeming reluctance to go against putin.

       You can reject the "Hillary lost because Russia Hacked the Elections" narrative and still be concerned that our government officials are receiving bribes from foreign officials and agencies. You can be pissed off with the Clinton Foundation receives donations from Saudi Arabia among many other countries, and still be pissed off that Michael Flynn is accepting money from RT, Turkey, Ukraine, among others.  The real conspiracy here is how posts like this only serve to further the divide because they appeal to partisan politics. It is OK to hate both the Democratic and Republican parties. Because ultimately they are one in the same, they are both the Corporatist Party. Simply rejecting anything the MSM says, and automatically believing whatever the opposite of the MSM says is far too simplistic of an approach for overly complicated situations. Its like saying everything RT posts is the truth because its the opposite of the American MSM rhetoric. Both are propaganda. Simply believing the opposite of propaganda doesn't guarantee that what you believe isn't propaganda. Finding the truth requires complex thinking, reading between the lines and constantly searching for facts and evidence. If you stray too far into partisan politics you'll end up confused and your arguments will be illogical.

       Suddenly in the past hour, the top comments in a 10-hour old thread are all by the same people tagged with the same red 'libtard' tag despite all the actual information in the thread.

       Tagging names is the best thing that ever happened to reddit. Always the same accounts, always the same story, always the same wording, moving as a pack, mass voting, always the MSM narrative...I guess I should be thankful it's so obvious.

       What have I said would lead you to believe I am pushing an "MSM narrative" as you say? I trash on both sides equally. Last I checked saying that both the Democrats and the Republicans are no different, and are essentially the same Corporatist Party is nothing you would ever hear uttered on a single American MSM news channel ever. I have no agenda, I have no invested interest is trying to manipulate and persuade people. This is how I view the world, this is how I look at politics, I treat both sides as they truly are. This is not the kind of discussion you see on r/politics or r/news etc and that's why Comey and Trump's various other antics get discussed on this sub, for a fresh different perspective, where lots of people recognize that partisan politics are bullshit and are the reason we keep fighting among ourselves.

       the source from the Russian narrative came solely from Clinton's camp and is heavily pushed by Clinton controlled media outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there are very REAL links between Clinton and Co. and Russians and probably not the kind of Russians Putin would like.

       It's not about "Clinton controlled media outlets" covering for Hillary's possible connections with Russia. It's the people that control Clinton and both parties pushing this Russian/Republican conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russians didn't do anything to expose Trump, so clearly they're in bed with Republicans. The question we should be asking is the one the media won't ask: what interests do Republicans share with Russians?
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be as simple as needing an excuse for Hillary's loss other than Hillary's vote for the Iraq war. This is a military conspiracy, like all political conspiracies.

       Jesus Fucking Christ. Accusatory and sophomoric aren't in the least contradictory. What point are you trying to make apart from trying desperately to sound intelligent?

       Yes I'm someone who didn't vote for trump, and don't support trump now, but I also don't support the establishment, and this Russia narrative is a fever dream from the establishment. Just think about how much they try and string together, Bernie bros apparently didn't like Hillary because of Russian propaganda, the GOP primaries co-opted by the Russians also, and I guess the Russians were the ones who told HRC too focus media attention on trump, the Russians did brexit, the Russians almost got Le Pen elected, the Russians are Wikileaks, the list goes on and on, and IMO it's designed to keep people from focusing on the real issue, the executive branch has way too much unchecked power, and the administrative state has turned the rest of the republic into a joke.

       My issue with the Trump-Russia narrative is the first bit - the modern American government wants to push Russia as the villain for doing the things that they do themselves internationally via the CIA and locally via the FBI. If we are to hold Russia accountable for hacking and attempted manipulation of the voting process, then we must hold the CIA accountable first, as they have a longer and bloodier history of it. American exceptionalism cannot be the rule when it comes to international diplomacy, as it will be actively protested by any legitimate foreign government by principle - and when that is not the case, the CIA usually ends up being involved, as revealed decades later. There is a good reason Iran is suspicious of the American government, and all people have equal right to hold these suspicions.

       Consider that they include in the official report these 2 examples of RT propaganda :
      </p>
      <p>
       Fracking
      </p>
      <p>
       US Third Party candidates
      </p>
      <p>
       Fracking has been widely covered by american media outlets and scientific studies have found countless dangers that are all well documented.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not propaganda just because RT aired it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third party candidates?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Shouldn't this be the other way around in that US MSM outlets not giving adequate coverage are ultimately guilty of propaganda by not giving these people air time?

       Same with Grab the pussy... They had the grab the pussy tapes for a long time and strategically conspired with the debate moderators and Hillary to try to ambush Trump.  That's all on record, verified, proven and is a clear example of outside forces attempting to influence the election.

       The media outlet, and whoever owns it is the outside force... And I'm not upset.. why would I be upset?  They provided an outlandish example of how not to behave during a presidential election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media outlet, likely a clinton backer, held on to the tape and coordinated with the debate moderator so as to open the debate talking about it and trying to pull some gotcha bullshit on trump.  They didn't realize that you simply don't gotcha the trump though.

       I think what the investigation will show, and what takes down Trump and his cronies, will be the business deals made prior to being elected.

       This probably wont get much visibility since I'm 6 hours late, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was a tie in. If anybody gets a chance, find the "putin system" video online. It goes into detail about the disinformation campaign they started in Russia and how effective it was. Basically, so much news from both sides that people just give up on trying to understand whats right and wrong.

       I think it's crazy that people will complain that Hillary lost because of the Russians, but they do not care at all about what was exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was a Democrat I would be less bothered about the Russians and more bothered that the Democrats basically rigged the Primary making it impossible for Bernie Sanders to win.

       Honestly when did r/conspiracy being Trump bots. Wtf happened to this place. How does Russia colluding to make an absolute moron president to the worlds superpower in order to throw that country into chaos? How does Russia putting inside men around THAT moron in secret in an attempt to drop sanctions placed against their country? Russia is actively attempting to expand their territory, in what many believe to be a real life attempt to reform the Soviet union. How the FUCK does the one major conspiracy result in r/conspiracy being a group of shills. Are you serious guys.

       It's because they're pushing 24/7 with no evidence ane every major shill like Stephen Colbert is spouting this shit daily. If it's true who cares, go after Trump, it's just the constant accusations without the slightest proof, even just a single email, that make it stupd.

       Devil's advocate, some conspiracy theories are true, and some (even smaller portion) are actually revealed to be true (Watergate, for example). When a conspiracy ends up being proven by an entity like the FBI (I am NOT saying that is the case for Trump right now), the MSM will inevitably pick it up in droves. So if what you're saying is true, that conspiracy would cease to be valid for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Essentially you are advocating for suppresssing truth just because the MSM covers it. In that case, you are just as much as an unthinking pawn as someone that universally accepts the MSM truth.

       The attitude towards Russia of being a scary evil empire is Cold War 2.0 fearmongering and propaganda.  They want us in a war because they will make a final killing on profits, and a very literal killing of the human population so they can have their reset because they fucked up again and we're getting too close to the truth of things again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that these people pushing this idiot US v Russia narrative are psychopaths that
       <em>
        create
       </em>
       the conflict and directly profit off both sides.  They would be happy if the vast majority of us were dead if they could somehow profit off of it. They are murderous warmongers, moralless scum devoid of empathy, Saturnic cultists and eugenicists, true demons in human form.  Russia is Enemy #1 because Putin and his government directly oppose these individuals on many levels, he has undermined their globalist agenda severely, and he's pretty much the only world leader who has succeeded in doing this.  Trump may have tried to fight the tide for a little while, but it's pretty clear he's either been tricked into carrying out their agenda, or he's been a "company man" the whole time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being, it will always and has always been up to
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       to put a stop to this bullshit push for war.  That's because these puppet fucks will
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       do it.  They love war.  None of them have our interests in mind unless it becomes expedient for them to do so.  The best way to do extricate yourself from their control is to completely stop participating in their system as much as possible, become self-sufficient, take charge of your life and do whatever it is you love doing regardless of whether it's making you tons of fake fiat money.  Stop watching their TV shows, talking heads and programs, and learn to parse information and discern opinion from fact.  Go on YouTube and Reddit and other information centers and look for people who have similar views and resonate closely with the truth, see where they got their info from - follow the sources.  Avoid any of the left-right paradigm and their partisan talking points, because it is all misdirection to keep you at each other's throats masquerading as "political discourse".
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump Russian narrative is beyond stupid and soaked with hypocrisy.  This ridiculous outrage at
       <em>
        completely unproven claims
       </em>
       of Russia meddling in our election don't even have a shred of proper sourcing, almost completely relying on speculation, conjecture, political bias and the Pissgate dossier that has been discredited up and down by even those on the left.  Russia probably technically tried to help hacking efforts to embarrass the DNC and specifically Hillary Clinton, if anything because
       <em>
        she was directly threatening to go to war with them
       </em>
       .  It's a matter of basic self-preservation to support the guy who wants stronger ties and no war, isn't it?  Isn't that basically what Donald Trump has been saying the whole time, that it's a good thing for Russia and the United States to be allies considering we're the only two countries that can pretty much
       <em>
        wipe out all life
       </em>
       on the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Spying is intelligence 101.  This is basic statecraft between almost all nations, spying has always and will always be a thing.  There's nothing really significant about Russia doing this that can't also be attributed to the Chinese or Israel, where the ramifications of their spying was
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more severe.  The irony is that this narrative is being flogged past death while the vast majority of Americans continue living in extreme ignorance of our own history of interference worldwide (past and current), or they're just bald-faced hypocrites and jingoists that thanks it's okay when America commits crimes and atrocities but is just
       <em>
        shocked
       </em>
       when anyone else does it in return.

       It looks like the reason Russia wants Republicans in power is because Russia supports Assad in Syria, and the U.S. needs some political reason it can't topple Assad so the military industrial complex can endlessly fund/propagandize/profit off the quagmire in Syria.

       Why? Because it's on the MSM? Who cares? So was 9/11 and the Commission. So was Jade Helm (now debunked) so were Hillary and her Emails. Hell, even Pizzagate was on the MSM. Bill Clinton was, Nixon was, Susan Rice was...
      </p>
      <p>
       So why aren't we allowed to talk about this here? Seems like the foxes are guarding the hen house. We can talk about Hillary, Bill, Flat Earth, 9/11, UFOs, whatever dumb shit 4chan posted last night, Macron's Emails (an obvious attempt to sway narratives)
      </p>
      <p>
       But, why can't we talk about Trump and Russia? There's not even a single breakdown on this sub about a real conspiracy, one that is going on non-stop and infiltrating the lives of every single American.
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems extremely shady. Why is it that anytime someone posts something about Trump, it's killed in /new/? This happens immediately. People are sitting there waiting to downvote anything that paints Trump in a poor light.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like this sub, and I miss how it used to be... When it hated both parties, and was open to talking about whatever. Now though, it's quite clear that certain users are trying to kill the narrative. The real question is, why?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you guys don't want to talk about it, you're free to stop participating. Otherwise, it just seems incredibly suspicious.

       What's kind of weird is that almost everything you are talking about gets next to no play in the MSM. I mean, even your first point regarding CambridgeAnalytica and AggregateIQ is considered to be some fairly inside baseball.

       Ty. I'm not really surprised by the silence tho. It's clear that the Jackasses don't wanna piss of the Swamp Drainer-in-Chief right now, so they're content to play long-ball and stretch out any investigation 'til 2018. They need an independent commission, but the GrandOl'Pretenders know this and will not just hand it to them. Has to be a tit-for-tat. If Jackasses insist on keeping the Russian flame alive, then the SDiC's new FBI pick will reciprocate by re-opening Hillary's wounds. Neither side has anything to gain but everything to lose. The SDiC and his MSM trumpeteers are now gonna attack from the flank with his newly executive-ordered

        Voter Fraud Commission
       </a>
       and focus on how Jackasses defrauded their own base. Meanwhile, the Jackasses and their MSM megaphones will ignore the feral Elephant crap and slowly settle on some forward-looking narrative that involves censorship of fake news and a tough posturing vis-a-vis the Russian Bear. The Jackasses will go along with this because, well, they're jackasses, and they're gonna ignore the herd of pink Elephants that have taken over the living room rather than talk about a revolution on the Animal Farm.

       I generally agree with this. However I still feel like we must always question both sides's intentions. Just because the West has been proven to be corrupt beyond measure time and time again, doesn't mean Putin or the East in general are saints. They are also likely looking out for their own interests.

      <p>
       And I keep seeing people here say "Show me the evidence!" evidence which is being tracked down and not made public....but these same people use an email about cheese pizza to say it proves hillary raped and ate babies in a basement of a pizza place (which was suspicious because you could play ping pong there and kids were allowed).
      </p>
      <p>
       SMH - I don't understand the way all this shit works. A real conspiracy about collusion on multiple fronts going on and we should ignore it and talk about hillary instead because the news is covering it. Seriously, shit makes no sense - unless you look at it as people loyal to trump wanting to protect and deflect.

       But most here say the media is always lying so they aren't ever telling us anything (unless it is something we want to hear, then msm media is used and is ok for that story).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not trusting them in a broad manner is different than whether or not you believe what they are saying. I know there is an investigation because I watched hours of it live. I also saw the msm boil that down to an article (don't own a tv so no idea what the idiots are saying on the air).
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been caught lying, lost their jobs, etc and if anything, the media hasn't dug deep enough. Which is where I would guess people here would come in.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that won't happen because many here are controlled by the donald and do not want to see more information on it all, they want less.
      </p>
      <p>
       All those values and ideals they claim to hold are trashed for one man. And it looks like the same is true of the values of people in a conspiracy sub. They will ignore for one man and try to tell others not to do so as well because it is a waste; all the while preaching the earth is flat and run by reptilian overlords like hillary who uses the human race to produce children to use as pizza toppings.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you ignore a real conspiracy happening today because you love one man so much, you aren't someone who cares about conspiracies - you are just loyal to a rich man from a tv show. And shame on those who are like that.

       I have been on this sub since almost the very beginning. I agree with you, and I have held your own viewpoint on this particular paradox that this place can often find itself in regarding the MSM and what is news that should or should not be posted here. One thing that cannot be done however, is to have anyone but the users define what conspiracies are up for discussion and have value.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part your issue has never had to be seriously discussed outside of modmail and IRC because, in general, the fallback and "out" for people is the sub's base cultural value of no-censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, the current makeup of the moderators and the bulk of the user base is pro-Trump, but mostly in the sense that  there was an overwhelming Hillary Sucks sentiment that a very few took to actively backing Trump. Mostly people here just couldn't stand Hillary and the neo-liberal branch of the oligarchy that she was a servant of.
      </p>
      <p>
       That core of the longtime users of this subreddit try not to fall for the partisan stuff because they see it for what it really is, a means of dividing the population to keep them bickering amongst themselves over shit that they just do not have any control over, and, of course, a means of controlling wealth and power. The illusion of our current political system and The Powers behind it, to many here,
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       the real conspiracy.

       I think the distinction is this: everyone agrees Russia influenced the election (at evidenced today at the intelligence hearing) through very obvious and illicit means - and obviously in favor of one candidate.  This isn't debated stuff anymore - it's also never going to be justification for overturning the election results ... I don't think any sane person believes any of this is going to somehow 're-write' the election ... it's over, Hillary Clinton lost, 'liberals' get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, that isn't what the investigation is about ... the one being conducted by the FBI and both chambers of Congress concerns collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia before and during the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the implications, I prefer not being a Russian; if I did, I'd move to Moscow.  The idea that he can't even be investigated is what will drive people into the streets.

       What do you mean prefer not being Russian?  Are we going to become Russian because Trump people spoke to some Russian people once.

       How would you know if collusion took place before the investigation is over?  Why would you demand the end of an investigation that supposedly going to 'clear' Donald Trump?  Why do conspiracy theories about what the "Clintons did" factor into the current FBI investigation into the Trump campaign?  If Russia is full of good guys who have just been misunderstood - why is the investigation being stalled by Donald Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       The conclusion hasn't been made - but it will be after an investigation (sound like law enforcement?  Welcome to the FBI).  Nobody is interested in scuttling the investigation anymore - not even Republicans.  "Clinton" theories just aren't going to get it done anymore.  Innocent people don't fear investigations.

       Who are responsible for preventing the US elections from being hacked?  You certainly cannot blame the Russians.  I think it was not the Russians.  It was the Dems election to win, and they threw it away due to their own arrogance and incompetence.  If you look at the media coverage on election day, the Dems were already celebrating by noon.  The whole Russia narrative did not come about until they lost.  Then they needed someone else to blame, anyone, but themselves.

       There is mounting evidence of widespread knowledge of the illegal money being funneled into GOP campaigns, so yes, an entire political party - not just a couple of a 'bad apples'. Is everything proven? No, it's conspiracy theory.

       Its hilarious how most people fail to point out and realize it was two separate "hacking" events. The DNC hack happened, someone hacked it and the "russian" footprints/fingerprints were found there. No one has explained who hacked Hillary's private server except the FBI. The FBI investigation of the DNC e-mails was basically making conclusions based on the Crowdstrike report. They did not have physical access to the DNC servers as stated by Comey himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual damaging e-mails all came from the DNC  e-mails regarding the election fraud and the DNC primary collusion. The Podesta e-mails were was done with a phishing e-mail and totally separate. They have conflated and merged these two events to make it seem as they were both perpetrated  by the same person. For gods sake the emails have different domain names yet everyone hears "hacked the election" and lumps all the e-mails together. The brainwashing to make everyone argue about e-mails and where they came from instead of the contents, has worked perfectly in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is made clear in the first few pages of the official FBI documents released at the FBI.GOV archives of the Hillary private server investigation that it was hacked by at least five state actors. That alone clearly states that she had classified information on a private server that was hacked! A crime in the USA and that is what everyone was screaming. She got let off the hook because the government didn't want to admit how much of our secrets were made available to our enemies/the world. And speculatively, I believe it was much more than that. I am sure once it was hacked,(Hillary's server) that someone leaked how to get in and those people who grabbed those contents were the ones who were getting vanned, at least the ones in America. But this is just speculation on my side.

       Pedogate stems from the Podesta e-mails and not the DNC e-mail release. But you'd be hard pressed to see anyone separate these two incidents when debating the topic. Crowdstrike was caught lying in their Ukraine report, so why is it so "crazy" to believe their Russian hacking report might have some errors too?

Fast and Furious, Tea Party targeting by IRS, exchange five terrorist generals for one deserter, pay billions to Iran in cash to get around sanctions, arming al-qaeda in Syria, over throwing Ghadaffi for no reason...

       Spot on. There's so many examples like that of corruption and collusion where the evidence is already public and easy to connect. We even have a lot of it in their own words from wikileaks emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is anything being done about it? How can anyone take the Russian narrative serious when easily provable corruption like that is ignored? It's all political theatre they're feeding to us, so far.

       Yeah, Trump is the government, although he's only had 26 confirmed nominees out of 530! The rest are Obama holdovers, so yeah, Trump is really wielding the power of the government. 🙄

       I'm fully aware that Putin is basically a mob boss that owns Russia.  But again he's really no different or any better or worse than any of our Presidents, it's whatever country you're born in and whatever propaganda you're fed.  These people ultimately all eat at the same tables and do business together regardless of whether they are official enemies or not. What people fail to realize is that there are no good guys in this.  Trump and Putin are two people looking out for their own interests and whatever is going to make their country the strongest.  The fact that both of them are strong nationalists is actually a good thing for us, collectively.  I'm just solidly in favor of diplomacy and good relations with the only other country that can destroy us, for pretty common sense reasons.

       "Possible traitors have sold out the American people". In what way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Clinton did policies that hurt the economy but got him lots of money from China.  Hillary took money from gulf states to start terror wars in the Mideast in which soldiers have died.  Who's the traitor?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm only saying, what exactly is it that these trump "traitors" have done?  There never seems to be an answer to that, which is why I called it a stupid theory.

       This is what happens when news journals agree to ignore newsworthy events that the whole world is aware of and large swaths of the world care at least a little bit about. I don't mean PG, I mean the Podesta Leak. It wasn't covered, and we got pizza gate because of it. Imagine if the media just decided not to cover the World Cup at all. So many people would lose their heads. This is what is happening.

       The Russians definitely sided with Trump/Republicans during the 2016 election. That doesn't mean Trump or the Republican party conspired with Russia to hack the DNC. I mean maybe they did, but other than support for a hugely superfluous military industrial complex residing in each country, I don't know what Republicans have in common with Russian officials. Got any ideas?
