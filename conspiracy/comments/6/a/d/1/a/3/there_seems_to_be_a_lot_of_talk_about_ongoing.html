        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For example, I found this article from CNN (May 10, 2017):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/grand-jury-fbi-russia/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/grand-jury-fbi-russia/index.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>&quot;Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records, as part of the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in last year&#39;s election, according to people familiar with the matter. CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>The subpoenas represent the first sign of a significant escalation of activity in the FBI&#39;s broader investigation begun last July into possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>The headline mentions &quot;Russia&quot; -- turns out the article is about it&#39;s about former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (who was ready to investigate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5qfd7a/the_youtube_post_of_ryan_oneals_proof_that_james/dcyuiuu/"><strong>#pizzagate</strong></a> -- not a coincidence, in my opinion).</p>

<p>As for Trump&#39;s involvement, all I see is an assertion that some investigation began last July (2016) -- nearly a year ago!!  But I am not able to find any details... or even if this &quot;investigation&quot; exists.</p>

<p>Please source your comments -- most helpful.</p>

<p>They mainly paint him as a slightly disturbed individual who lapped up any internet conspiracy theory and tweeted about it without checking any facts.</p>

<p>It looks like Reines and Clinton trolled him after he got fired by posting dominoes job links. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not looking for &quot;details&quot;.  I am looking for some specific reference by a credible &quot;source&quot;  that there is an investigation.  </p>

<p>(e.g., House leader announcing the initiation of an investigation into Trump&#39;s ties to Russia, would do just fine)</p>

<p>Are you able to provide one ?  All I can find is main stream media innuendo -- like this Washington post article:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/comey-misstated-key-clinton-email-evidence-at-hearing-say-people-close-to-investigation/2017/05/09/074c1c7e-34bd-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html?utm_term=.57c564229eb4">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/comey-misstated-key-clinton-email-evidence-at-hearing-say-people-close-to-investigation/2017/05/09/074c1c7e-34bd-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html?utm_term=.57c564229eb4</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>&quot;The startling development comes as Comey was leading a counterintelligence investigation to determine whether associates of Trump may have coordinated with Russia to interfere with the U.S. presidential election last year. It wasn’t immediately clear how Comey’s ouster will affect the Russia probe, but Democrats said they were concerned that his ouster could derail the investigation.&quot;</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Not investigating Trump -- only Trump&#39;s &quot;associates&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>What &quot;probe&quot; ??  Has Comey ever said &quot;there is a probe into Trump&#39;s ties to Russia that I am leading&quot; ??</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>At the initial &quot;Russian interference&quot; public hearing, Comey said that in addition to that stuff they were looking at whether or not there was &quot;coordination&quot; between Team Trump and the Russian efforts, for the first time publicly confirming of the long-standing FBI counterintelligence investigation, and that it <em>does</em> include Team Trump activities. Of course this doesn&#39;t meant there was &quot;coordination,&quot; that is what&#39;s being intvestigated. Not per media speculation but the FBI director&#39;s disclosure. </p>

<p>I have to assume it was at that point that Trump wanted him gone, this notion ebbed with Comey&#39;s hearing last week (which included posed hypotheticals about RICO orders, grand juries, money laundering through real estate, usage of shell companies), and which Comey seemed to take very seriously. </p>

<p>It&#39;s rumored that a Monday eastern district of Virginia court preceding which produced the Flynn-related subpeonas was attended by Comey himself, followed by the Yates/Clapper hearing, then Comey is fired out of the blue. </p>

<p>Referenced here is Claude Taylor, former Bill Clinton WH staffer who claims to have DOJ contacts, the rumor that Comey was there on Monday is courtesy of him and corroborated by Republican Rick Wilson. </p>

<p>Taylor has made many speculations in the past months, among them the existence of a RICO case (as yet unconfirmed) and a FARA
case (Foreign Agents Registration Act), which appears to be what this Flynn matter is all about, so he was right about at least that one. </p>

<p>Not sure I believe the whole thing, so grains of salt all around. Thus churns the rumormill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s essentially CIA misdirection because the DNC primary was illegitimate. Instead of the peoples candidate we were force fed Clinton vs Trump in an insane battle that Clinton should have &#39;won&#39;. So now they are lying about some &quot;russian&quot; conspiracy to distract us from the fact that corporate donors have destroyed our democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious, how exactly does Flynn taking money from a foreign power and not disclosing it get us all the way to manipulating the outcome of an election? I don&#39;t understand how these 2 ideas got into the same room. I thought Russia hacked the election?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First Obama said nobody has ever hacked any election, then H lost and they could hack an election. Pissgate appeared and it&#39;s all media from this point on and everybody is compromised by the Russians except if you where part of the prior administration then you could talk with Russian diplomats and not be compromised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary herself received millions from Russia during her Uranium one graft deal, but there is a deafening silence with regards to that.  Even worse however, is the fact that her aide,  John Podesta received money from the Kremlin itself in order to lobby for Russian interests!  it doesn&#39;t get any more compromised than that folks.</p>

<p>It appears to be a Hillary strategy to accuse her opponents of the same criminality she is engaged in.  My personal opinion is that Obama promoted the Russian ties thing as an excuse to justify spying on political enemies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama&#39;s team, or the Deep State if you prefer, decided to spy on candidate Trump and his team. The Russia angle was just the needed excuse used to get the required warrants. They didn&#39;t find anything or they would have used it. Once Trump unexpectedly won the election they needed to hype the supposed Russia collusion story so they could use it as their excuse for the spying which they knew would eventually be exposed.</p>
