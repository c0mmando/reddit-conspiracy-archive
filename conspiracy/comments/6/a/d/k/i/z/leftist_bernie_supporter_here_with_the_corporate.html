Dear corporate, you may take control of my TV addicted elders, you may buy your way to the front page of the internet, but you can never manufacture my consent. I reject your authority, and I encourage others to do the same. Read alternative news sources: socialist rags, business news, libertarian blogs, or write your own critiques of corporate news. I&#39;ll read it. But I will not entertain the idea that CNN/FOX is honest.</p>

<p>Why do you think Trump and Sessions flip flopped on Comey? </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, Jeff Sessions said James Comey &quot;had an absolute duty&quot; to tell the public about a criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton&#39;s emails. Five months later it was one of the reasons cited for firing him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be a mistake to think that this now means Trump is going to prosecute Clinton for her crimes. So why the change in position? Probably because Comey was still playing the whole &#39;Russia&#39; thing, which is just a campaign to distract us from the illegitimate Democratic primary, which gave us Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think any kind of Russian involvement could be used to sell the whole &quot;Russia hacked the election&quot; message. In reality, Russia is a big place with a lot of connections to the people involved in U.S. politics. It probably would not take a lot of effort to connect Trump to someone in Russia with just a couple hops on his web of contacts. That does not mean the Russians can elect whoever they want. That doesn&#39;t mean they are in control. Did they influence the election? Maybe, but only by exposing the Democrats for what they were. And we don&#39;t even have proof of that. Assange even alluded that it was an insider leak that provided the emails. Did Trump&#39;s staff have conversations with the Russians? Maybe, but what does that mean?</p>

<p>This whole Russia thing is overblown. I think the fact that Trump&#39;s staff tried to hide some of these conversations looks bad for them, but what about these conversations and meetings is controversial? It&#39;s not like Hillary didn&#39;t make deals with the Russians... she sold them 20% of the U.S. uranium stockpile. Unlike anything I&#39;ve heard about Trump&#39;s involvement with the Russians, that actually seems controversial.</p>

Many people attribute this to the russian investigation, which I believe is nonsense and distracting. I also don&#39;t think he will go after Clinton.

    <div class="md"><p>That has to do with what Chomsky termed &quot;flak.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;flak&quot; refers to negative responses to a media statement or program. The term &quot;flak&quot; has been used to describe what Chomsky and Herman see as efforts to discredit organizations or individuals who disagree with or cast doubt on the prevailing assumptions which Chomsky and Herman view as favorable to established power </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, it&#39;s concerted efforts to manage public information. Business organizations regularly come together to form flak machines, and the more powerful the organization, the more flak they can produce.</p>

<p>In this specific case, a prime example is what happened to Ben Swann. On his segment &quot;Reality Check&quot; Ben offered a very reasoned and level-headed description of the pizzagate controversy based solely on facts. But after his segment aired, Ben was subsequently suspended from the station and ordered off social media. He received a ton of flak, presumably from powerful people, simply for reporting the story. </p>

<p>Corporations have a ton of power over the information you receive and the way it&#39;s presented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie rolled over like a bitch and let Killary walk all over his weak ass.</p>

<p>He was always a foil, a patsy, a sham. Just like the ideology he espouses (soft communism.) Notice the common thread in his rhetoric; always more gov&#39;t control and less autonomy for the individual. The class warfare he parrots constantly is more D&amp;C from the party that uses D&amp;C as a grand strategy to win elections.</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t supposed to get as popular as he became. He was never supposed to outshine Killary. But he did and the DNC fucked him. It was obvious then, it&#39;s obvious now. And he rolled over and took it up the ass from them and from Killary. He then went on to say &quot;HURR I&#39;M TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT THE DAMN EMAILS&quot; and basically refused to pursue her Goldman Sachs speech transcripts. </p>

<p>Looks to me like he intentionally fumbled.</p>

<p>Things are never as they seem with the Democrat/Republican political Establishment, as a rule of thumb.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Donald Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey raises serious questions about what his administration is hiding. Why did President Trump fire the person leading the investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and the Russian government? I find it deeply troubling that this decision comes a day after damning testimony by former acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Russia’s ties to the Trump campaign and just days before Comey was scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p>

<p>“President Trump has repeatedly taken steps to kill inquiries into Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election. It is clear that whomever President Trump handpicks to lead the FBI will not be able to objectively carry out this investigation. We need an independent investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a Sanders supporter I disagree with him on these statements. Everything with the Russia story has struck me as wild fingerpointing by the Democratic camp to avoid talking about running a terrible campaign in which they equally harassed and insulted Democrat voters as often as Republican opponents. Every time I have delved into source materials supporting made available purported to support &#39;The Russians!&#39; argument I have found it devoid of actual evidence circling back to unnamed sources citing unreleased information. No amount of repetition will make a compelling argument - the Iraq war alone provides ample argument not to &quot;take their word for it&quot;.</p>

<p>Given the hammer brought down on the Edward Snowden&#39;s and Chelsea Manning&#39;s of the world who leaked information to the public on illegal activity conducted by the government - an action with a morally ethical defense - I remain astounded that Clinton and those around her were not even charged for their negligent handling of classified information. In their case the motives appear tied to avoiding public accountability obligations at best, and to trade power/information for personal profit at worst. To be damned as extremely negligent in handling state secrets demands stepping down from holding ANY public office at a minimum. There is no terms on which that campaign should have been allowed to move forward. </p>

<p>But for Bernie Sanders to say as much would carry a strong likelihood of impairing his ability to continue leveraging his momentum to work toward dismantling the corrupt Democrat leadership from within. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly right. To support your argument, Clapper testified that the public DNS report from January was virtually identical to the classified one. Look at the allegations that tie Wikileaks to Russia per the report - entirely based on Assange&#39;s (syndicated) show that aired on RT (among a half dozen other stations) 4 years ago.

<p>entirely based on Assange&#39;s (syndicated) show that aired on RT (among a half dozen other stations) 4 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure this statement is bullshit.</p>

<p>Here are the words from RT themselves:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The announcement that <strong>RT would host Assange&#39;s show</strong> created a global media stir, with many questioning the RT/Assange link-up. In a pre-show interview (details TBA) Assange explained his rationale.</p>

<p><em>&quot;A lot of the things that we have been trying to report have not been carried accurately in the mainstream press. There are many, many fine exceptions but when we look at international networks there’s really only two that are worth speaking about, and that’s RT and Al Jazeera.&quot;</em></p>

<p>RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan sees no coincidence in the connection. &quot;RT is rallying a global audience of open minded people who question what they see in mainstream media and we are proud to premiere Julian Assange&#39;s new project. We provided Julian a platform to reach the world and gave him total editorial freedom. He is absolutely the right person to bring alternative opinions to our viewers around the globe.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(my emphasis added)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see a single hint of &quot;syndication&quot;. In fact, Assange even says RT was only one of two networks he was even considering.</p>

<p>Do you have any sources for your claim about &quot;syndication&quot; and the &quot;half a dozen other stations&quot;?</p>

<p>Huh? So what? RT paid him for it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand what you think this means? So what if it was on different networks afterwards? Is your implication that WL and Putin have no ties because of this?</p>

<p>RT originally paid/funded them. And they&#39;re a Russian state-run network. Assange was essentially on Putin&#39;s payroll. I don&#39;t understand what your implication is if all you meant was, &quot;There were other networks that aired his show at some point&quot;. How does this mean his ties to Putin are trivial?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Further, the statement supports my argument by hi-lighting who had creative control. I&#39;m pretty sure this is discussed in the Jeremy Scahill podcast &quot;Intercepted&quot; when he interviews Assange from just a couple weeks ago. I&#39;m on mobile right now, or I&#39;d link directly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol... Are you serious? You just take them at their word?</p>

<p>Here are facts we can observe:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>10/26/10 - <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/1026/WikiLeaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-Russia.-But-will-Russians-get-to-read-about-it">WikiLeaks ready to drop a bombshell on Russia</a></p></li>
<li><p>11/01/10 - <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/11/01/russias-fsb-to-wikileaks-we-could-destroy-you/">Russia&#39;s FSB to Wikileaks: We Can Destroy You</a></p></li>
<li><p>1/20/11 - <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/assange-wikileaks-russian-visa/">Julian Assange gets Russian Visa</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s only ~2 months between having dirt on Russia to being protected by them. Russia doesn&#39;t go around protecting its enemies. Russia/Putin protect their <strong>friends</strong>.</p>

<p>Are you arguing that the &quot;allegations that tie Wikileaks to Russia&quot; are <em>only</em> based on the fact Russian state-owned media funded his television project? You&#39;re going to ignore these other circumstances?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What about the fact that he&#39;s never released <em>anything</em> damaging on Russia since then? Does Russia, <a href="https://cpj.org/killed/europe/russia/">a country where journalists are regularly killed</a>, have nothing to leak?</p></li>
<li><p>What about the fact that Wikileaks has even gone as far as <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/717459700367790080">criticizing leaks the <em>do</em> paint Putin in a bad light?</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think you have to be pretty naive to think that Julian Assange/WL and Russia are working independently.</p>

<p>Serious question, are there <em>any</em> set of facts that would convince you that there ties between WL and Russia? If so, can you describe hypothetically what they could be?</p>

<p>I mean, how would one prove to be the actual source? What is your threshold?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They had access to the same emails + many more than what WL had.</p></li>
<li><p>At least one of the emails that wasn&#39;t released was mentioned in a chat log between WL and RevoluSec</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Are you following the evidence? How much evidence do you expect? You seem to always speculate on the side of WL, despite the evidence presented to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless, the Syria Files should still contain the central bank’s emails from Oct. 26, 2011, concerning its €2 billion and bank account in Moscow: <strong>For one, WikiLeaks has published several emails received by the same account (<a href="mailto:treasury@bcs.gov.sy">treasury@bcs.gov.sy</a>) from that day.

</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t find any of this the least bit suspicious?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) The supposed source says they want to fabricate some emails, but the article never addresses if the email they are suggesting WL withheld was fake. Which would justify withholding the email. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what the article says. I suggest you re-read it more carefully. It says that the hackers joked about faking an email, the author <strong>does not</strong> think they ever went through with it, but it raises the question that if hackers have unfettered access to the data, <em>can</em> they fake emails? <em>How</em> would WL be able to verify them if they did?

</blockquote>

<p>What email are you talking about? They make a pretty good case that WL had the emails. One such email that was withheld was even mentioned in a leaked chat log between WL and the hackers. Why would WL have access to an email, but not publish it?</p>

<p>Please do. I have yet to see any evidence that the Syria Files WL released had any negative impact/dirt on Russia (other than them getting caught withholding those emails).</p>

<p>They accusations are against Wikileaks. It&#39;s up to the accuser to present rational evidence. So far it&#39;s all pretty flimsy. The evidence only supports the argument if you accept the headline before accepting the evidence. That&#39;s not how it&#39;s supposed to work. Evidence is supposed to stand on its own. </p>

<p>(having access to the emails) </p>

<p>The logic you are using can be used to say John Podesta was responsible for his leak. After all, he had all the emails, right? (see your emphasis) </p>

<p>(suspicious) </p>

<p>This paragraph is pure conflation. Did the Revolusec members discuss with WL? The article doesn&#39;t say so. Did the source provide all these emails to WL? We don&#39;t know. I&#39;m inclined to disbelieve the accusations because the author is deliberately misleading. They might be right, but they can&#39;t make such apparent leaps and conflation if they are trying to convince anyone of anything. Which I doubt is the purpose. It reads much more like the intent is to affirm a preconceived bias - it&#39;s evident in the deliberate conflation. </p>

<p>this doesnt credit WL with the &quot;reports&quot; that they are referencing (&quot;Russian banks and others are reported to be helping the Assad regime circumvent U.S. and EU sanctions by holding Syrian money while continuing to do business, legally, in the Europe Union and the United States&quot;). That fact is a big part of this entire situation. You dont see WL being credited in the media with being the source. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_Files#Rami_Makhlouf">But it is the source</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, dude you haven&#39;t made as single argument. I&#39;m seriously beginning to suspect you&#39;re just a some Russian troll.</p>

<p>The only &quot;argument&quot; you offer is that &quot;Russian banks...&quot;  thing, but <strong>your links don&#39;t support what you&#39;re saying</strong>. At all. Can you actually name a specific &quot;Russian bank&quot; or &quot;others&quot; connected to the Kremlin that were negatively affected directly because of the WL leaks? Just quote a leak or something. It really isn&#39;t as hard as you&#39;re making it out to be (that is, unless they don&#39;t actually exist).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I still want to know if Larry King is Putins puppet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s pathetic how you haven&#39;t constructed a single argument, yet you want me to dispute this (even though I have before):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at what? They&#39;re circumstances, rhetoric, actions, deals, and financials function completely different from one another. What could possibly lead a person to think these two situations are comparable. I no longer think you are being serious. I&#39;m checking out of this conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You literally want me to argue against a random allegation that has nothing to do and is completely unrelated to the topic at hand. You didn&#39;t present any proof, or even an argument. You just stated a random, baseless, and stupid allegation. Why do you divert focus so much?</p>

<p>Similarly, you&#39;re attempts to deflect to Larry King instead of answering some simple questions have soured this debate. If you&#39;re not going to take it seriously, I&#39;m no longer responding to your nonsense.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll post the questions <strong>one more time</strong> if you actually want to consider them, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have <em>any</em> leaks that WL released that negatively affected Russia/Kremlin/Putin?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only &quot;argument&quot; you presented boils down to &quot;this reuters article mentions Russian banks and this wiki page mentions a Syrian bank, therefore they <em>must</em> be related&quot;. This argument is just.... bad. If this is the best you can come up with, I&#39;m more certain than ever of the statement, WL has not released dirt on Russia despite an opportunity to do so, is true</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Any</em> evidence that the author is lying?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t answer this at all, you just don&#39;t believe him because it goes against your narrative. You&#39;ve provided no evidence, yet you somehow believe you&#39;ve addressed this point? Present evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Any</em> indication as to what your threshold of evidence for you to suspect WL is in bed with Russia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you&#39;ve completely ignored this point.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t address these points/questions, don&#39;t expect another response. I&#39;m no longer going to waste my time going around in circles with your nonsense.</p>

I&#39;m saying the article does not say what it claims to be saying. And it does not. It conflates two things and insists that this one email that was not in the leak was in WL possession, yet does not support that at all. Apart from the existence of the email. That in itself does not mean that WL is in possession of it. That is a leap, though reasonable to question it, does not support that WL ever had that email which means that there is still no evidence supporting the statement that WL withheld the email. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. So r/asablackman is getting linked a bunch in this thread. If you check it out you&#39;ll see how people online love to post statements along the lines of &quot;As a black man I think that black people are terrible&quot;. In most of those cases the person saying it isn&#39;t actually black, but thinks the statement will innoculate them from criticism and strengthen their argument. </p>

<p>Similarly, I&#39;ve noticed that people love to preface their pro-Trump statements with &quot;As a Bernie voter...&quot; Now, I&#39;m sure a lot of these folks did vote Bernie, but it&#39;s  irrelevant to the point being made. What about voting for Bernie gives you a special insight into Comey&#39;s firing?</p>

<p>A Bernie voter saying Trump&#39;s actions are questionable would just make the argument why without stating their affiliation.</p>

<p>&quot;As a Bernie voter...&quot; is used by people that want people to read their comment and think &quot;wow, even people on the left agree with me, this must be the pure truth that only those blinded by partisanship fail to see.&quot; But it doesn&#39;t actually make the argument any stronger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people tend to see things in black and white. &quot;If you&#39;re a liberal you think X, and if you&#39;re a conservative you think Y.&quot; And conversely, if you think X, that makes you a liberal.&quot; When in reality, that isn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>Independents and Bernie supporters don&#39;t often fall into these generalizations. Because of that, I find I often have to qualify my positions before I say something or else I will get stereotyped. For example, I think this Russia investigation is a giant sham, but if I say that, I automatically get called a Trump supporter or a Russian troll, when in reality I think Trump is a terrible president. </p>

<p>Although I do understand what you&#39;re saying. I remember during the primaries people would often say &quot;As a Bernie supporter...&quot; then espouse some pro-Clinton, pro-establishment ideals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are saying doesn&#39;t actually apply. You are forcing the connection that what they are saying is meant to be pro-trump and they are trying to cover it by saying they were a bernie supporter. The fact is that the point of saying he was a bernie supporter is to say that he ISN&#39;T holding this belief to be in support of trump but rather that the thinks it is within his belief system as a bernie supporter that Comey should be fired. </p>

<p>That is not being &quot;pro-trump&quot; and the very purpose of pointing out that he was a bernie supporter is to say that it is not in support of trump.</p>

<p>If you would like to derail his point further with your speculation, at least prove that his point was intended to be pro trump and that he  was not a bernie supporter. Otherwise what you are saying is useless and destructive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because if you say anything that doesn&#39;t attack Trump, you instantly get replies like &quot;oh look t_D has arrived in full force&quot; and shit like that.

If you say something that doesn&#39;t criticize Trump where usually a democrat might, then bam, t_D shill comments.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking ridiculous. So yea, I&#39;ve prefaced a lot of comments like &quot;as a bernie supporter&quot; or &quot;as someone who hates Trump&quot; because you&#39;re automatically labeled and disregarded as soon as you go against the democrat narrative. I&#39;ve had people fucking reply to me with &quot;I guess I&#39;m a crybaby liberal!&quot; just today. It&#39;s fucking infuriating. Literally someone pretended I called them a liberal as an insult... considering myself liberal.</p>

<p>This fucking election has poisoned so many minds, shoved so many labels out. This is why people feel a need to point out which side they&#39;re on from the start, because conversations automatically become toxic as soon as someone gets a hint of an idea you&#39;re pro Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes your political opponents, though opponents themselves, will agree on something. Maybe it is a Trump talking point, but that doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t a Sanders talking point either. Many Clinton supporters say Trump talking points to criticize Sanders too. That doesn&#39;t mean they are not Clinton supporters. It also doesn&#39;t mean the Trump talking point is wrong just because it is a Trump talking point - afterall Sanders and Clinton supporters will agree with Trump supporters often when that talking point is an attack on the other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can make all the supposed ideological assertions you like to try to gain credibility, but that doesn&#39;t change the facts ...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Comey being fired for how he treated Clinton when it is common knowledge that Donald Trump praised what he did and that most people think it helped Trump in the election -- and most importantly, that all happened a long time ago.</p></li>
<li><p>Comey being fired just days after he makes it known that the Trump administration is under investigation.</p></li>
<li><p>No matter how &quot;corrupt&quot; James Comey seems -- it is far more corrupt for an administration under investigation to fire the investigator and use its power to hire a replacement.</p></li>

<p>This is not the most difficult analysis ... and your &quot;leftist&quot; claim doesn&#39;t help your credibility. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey there thanks for your response. 
1. First of all, does anyone believe anything Trump says in the first place? And Comey helped Clinton in the primary season, which should have allowed her to win the general election.<br/>
2. I somewhat agree, in that Trump&#39;s mistake was to keep Comey on in the first place. I suppose he was trying for a non-partisan image of his new Presidency.<br/>
3. Is this also true when the entire investigation is based on a complete lack of evidence, and a suspicious collusion of corporate politicians and mainstream media?</p>

<li><p>First answer lends credibility to Donald Trump. People apparently do believe Donald Trump. To just throw this aside is to completely disarm. I know it can be boring or frustrating, but countering Donald Trump&#39;s untruths is quite necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to add that perhaps the reason Donald Trump did not fire James Comey in th3e early days was because -- as he practically stated -- he thought Republican James Comey was on Donald Trump&#39;s side. Now, it doesn&#39;t look so much like that.</p></li>
<li><p>This one is true regardless of your additions. If nothing is there, then Comey should not present a problem. Rather, he helps lend credibility to Donald Trump, as you specifically said in number 2.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be focusing on a different issue. Comey was fired because he was investigating the President. The administration&#39;s excuse that it was over the Clinton investigation is a lie. If that&#39;s really why he was fired, it would have happened awhile ago (instead of right as subpoenas came out and increased funding was asked for) and Jeff Sessions wouldn&#39;t have been commenting on his approval of the investigation in November if he really had issue with how it was conducted.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I agree with you half way. Comey did mishandle the investigation because the proper move would have been to recommend indictment back in July, regardless of the political implications.</p>

<p>Not this Bernie voter. If Trump would&#39;ve fired Comey right at the start of his term, I would&#39;ve supported it.</p>

<p>Doing it now, in the middle of the investigation, on the same day as the grand jury subpeonas were made public.....just stinks of attempted coverup.</p>

<p>Seems like Trump thought Comey was a &quot;loyalist&quot;, after all, he did help win the election for Trump. Donnie probably thought Comey would let him skate on the Russia investigation, and his pissed off that the investigation has been continuing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly not sure why people think the timing matters so much with this one. Ever since Comey recommended that they not indict Hillary, Trump had a reason to fire him. And he eventually did. Big surprise?</p>

<p>How loud would people be if he did it within the first week of POTUS? They&#39;d be screaming treason, say he&#39;s a dictator getting rid of all his rivals, etc. And any point people would say &quot;it&#39;s because the evidence Comey has!&quot; It&#39;s not like the Russian allegations are remotely new.</p>

<p>If anything I think the timing was because people aren&#39;t going to riot at this point. We were at our hottest after the election. With this timing, it&#39;s not fucking with people nearly as much. It was kind of prudent to wait until people came to terms with Trump being the POTUS.</p>

<p>If Comey had just shut up period that doubt wondering what exactly did HRC do with her emails would&#39;ve been a ball &amp; chain on her at the DNC let alone general election. </p>

<p>Comey basically declared HRC innocent even though there were on going investigations.</p>

Where everything went wrong is wikileaks released the emails and everyone could see for themselves she was guilty. If wikileaks didn&#39;t release the emails we likely would have never seen what was being said and they could have gone on pretending that it was just wedding plans and schedules, etc. But, that&#39;s just my opinion</p>

<p>In examining his sponsored legislation and voting record, it would appear that in 2013 he sponsored a bill to restrict foreign aid to countries that engage in religious discrimination.

<p>Donald Trump&#39;s party hold the majority of the Senate despite the national popular vote being against his party.</p>

<p>If you go back over a year ago, many established Republicans were saying they would support Hillary Clinton if Donald Trump was the Republican nominee.  This is because these established Republicans are associated with Bilderberg, The Trilateral Commission, and the Council on Foreign Relations.  They support their own, no matter the political party.  The whole Democrat-Republican thing is a distraction for us, to give us the illusion of choice.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The establishment is the private property oligarchs. Exxon comes to mind as the main political face. And where is its long-time CEO now?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bilderberg, The Trilateral Commission, and the Council on Foreign Relations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These groups may very well be the new establishment starting at about the time of Teddy Roosevelt, but a new Establishment has emerged since then -- a reactionary group of business oligarchs who want to turn the clock back to before Teddy Roosevelt. These oligarchs have names like Koch, Olin, Bradley, Scaife and Coors. There are a few more recent additions that you may be familiar with. </p>

<p>Notice this: these groups that <em>you</em> name do not ever bother to expose the oligarchs that I name. Why not? Because either they don&#39;t have the power to do so or they do not want to. Either way, these business tycoons ARE THE ESTABLISHMENT THAT YOU DENY. Checkmate. I just proved your views misguided.</p>

<p>Why did the Koch brothers have over 40 years of quiet &#39;oligarching&#39; until they were finally exposed on the internet? Why weren&#39;t they on the &quot;liberal&quot; media all those years? The answer is obvious. TAKE HEED. For that matter, why have so few heard of the Bradley Foundation which is the second largest political posturing group after Chamber of Commerce? And for that matter, what is the agenda of the giant Chamber of Commerce?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you go back over a year ago,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This entire paragraph is pretty much what the TV would tell you. I agree here: HRC was part of the establishment. But here&#39;se a little beyond the TV for you to swallow: Republicans tricked HRC into warming up to Republicans. When Dick Cheney hiself came out to support her, that was the kiss of death. She should have known better, but she was drunk with power.</p>

<p>Donald Trump? Donald Trump was an actor playing the outsider the whole time. Republicans (and the TV btw) set the primaries up so that Trump <em>could not lose</em>. Why? Because that&#39;s what they wanted. TV gave him unprecedented free time without much opposition, while Republicans put every familiar face in the world into the primaries. Is this starting to stink of Republican dirty tricks yet?</p>

<p>So what happened on election night? The big Upset. Greg Palast predicted the upset with remarkable accuracy. <em>Some</em> people weren&#39;t surprised. A story came out yesterday confirming it. </p>

<p>Then what happened? When it became likely that Trump would &quot;win,&quot; the stock market fell. But then, it rallied spectacularly. If that wasn&#39;t a signal that Donald Trump was who the establishment wanted, nothing could be.</p>

<p>Since then, Donald Trump and Republicans have been on the same substantive page, despite the rhetoric. They are working together. Where are the Republicans being outraged about yesterday&#39;s firing? Right now, they have their do-boy Mike Pense right next to the presidency. They can easily eliminate Donald Trump any time they want to. Do we see that happening? Not at all.</p>

<p>Donald Trump&#39;s promises? He is keeping the ones that are typical Republican platforms and backing out of those which are not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everybody knows that the popular vote in an election does not determine it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And everyone should know that neither &quot;democracy&quot; or &quot;republic&quot; supports the Electoral College and a skewed election system -- especially in a nation that has other skews. That should give you an idea why people bring it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how the alt-right is deifying Pinochet in their memes, a brutal butcher and authoritarian dictator whose death squads tortured and murdered tens of thousands, acting like he &quot;saved&quot; Chile from the dreaded Socialism even though his coup is the culmination of an intense CIA campaign to topple Allende. But hey, let&#39;s pretend that the CIA had nothing to do with it and that Pinochet totally wasn&#39;t a puppet and &quot;leftism is poison&quot; so it&#39;s totally fucking justifiable that his men beat Victor Jara, ripped out his fingernails and broke his hands before ordering him to play guitar (finally killing him by Russian roulette) because he sang fucking songs about workers&#39; rights and unions and worker solidarity. </p>

<p>Authoritarian goons worshipping authoritarian goons, telling everyone about HorseShit Theory and that fascism = socialism and other stupid shit like that, as though libertarian socialists aren&#39;t a thing (really, ignoring the entire field of political science and a multitude of ideologies). </p>

<p>The real poison isn&#39;t the guy singing about how we should have workplace safety standards, adequate pay, and 8 hour workdays, it&#39;s the fucking rube who thinks it&#39;s cool and trendy to throw the former out of a helicopter into the ocean for &quot;being a leftie&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the big authors about anarchism have been left wing. It&#39;s still left wing in most of the places. Even Marx considered himself an anarchist. </p>

<p>Rock, blues and jazz came out as protests to capitalist oppression and right wing governments. The Soviet Union was only left wing as it presented itself, for Stalin&#39;s government was extremely conservative.  Even if you don&#39;t believe me, rocknroll, for example started in socialist UK. </p>

<p>There is great music that came out of the Soviet Union, as well as art anyway. If that&#39;s your points. As there is and has been great music from Cuba or China as well as art, for example.</p>

<p>I think you have a very childish idea of what being left wing means and how the government and the economy work. More like a scarecrow view of them.</p>

<p>Here, read some anarchism to educate yourself: </p>

<p>Even conservapedia accepts the left wing of anarchism:
&quot;Traditional anarchism is similar to communism, though unlike communism, traditional anarchists do not favor socialism as a means to their end, as it requires a state. Traditional anarchists advocate the formation of collectives. Traditional anarchism rejects all authority, both of business and of government.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can expand and contort definitions to fit any agenda you&#39;d like. Leftism, in modern American, denotes a view of society in which one man&#39;s problems are everyone&#39;s problems. Where a man does not care for himself and needs others to care for him, even against their will. If you&#39;re dreaming up kumbaya village communes where everybody plants crops for one another and there is no money, greed, or power, then fine - call it anything you want. </p>

<p>It the modern age, leftism is marginalization, control, and slavery. Anarcho-capitalism is the way to go. Leftst anarchism is unsustainable fantasy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your definition of leftism is a terrible strawman argument. Arguing with you further is wasting my time as you are clearly brainwashed and unable to actually discuss ideas.</p>

<p>In the modern age there are still left wing groups such as the zapatistas where anarchism is practiced and has been for decades. Anarcho capitalism has never existed or will exist because capitalism requires the state. In anarcho capitalism oppression would just be changed from the state to corporations. There is no realistic way it can be placed into practice and therefore no one thinker who has defended it (besides ayn rand, who is not really a thinker). </p>

<p>ayn rand</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agree with everything else you&#39;ve said here, but as a matter of fact, Ayn Rand was a huge opponent of An-Cap, believing as you do that the state is required to sustain capitalism. She hated Murray Rothbard, even though both of their philosophies boil down to &quot;might makes right.&quot; </p>

<p>In her own words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All kinds of people today call themselves “libertarians,” especially something calling itself the New Right, which consists of hippies, except that they’re anarchists instead of collectivists. But of course, anarchists are collectivists. Capitalism is the one system that requires absolute objective law, yet they want to combine capitalism and anarchism. That is worse than anything the New Left has proposed. It’s a mockery of philosophy and ideology. They sling slogans and try to ride on two bandwagons. They want to be hippies, but don’t want to preach collectivism, because those jobs are already taken. But anarchism is a logical outgrowth of the anti-intellectual side of collectivism. I could deal with a Marxist with a greater chance of reaching some kind of understanding, and with much greater respect. The anarchist is the scum of the intellectual world of the left, which has given them up. So the right picks up another leftist discard. That’s the Libertarian movement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take on anarchism is that it is actually extreme right wing,  extreme right wing tend to promote small government,  further right than small would be zero government AKA anarchism. Fascism and communism are types of socialism and inherently left wing,  personally I&#39;m pretty middle of the road. I feel that mass media have poisoned the brains of the masses into believing many false narratives including true anarchism being left wing.  Most self proclaimed &quot;anarchists&quot; I have met actually are just left wing revolutionaries promoting communism,  which is funny to me because communism is quite far from anarchism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>libertarianism is a word often used by anarchists when describing anarchism. It came into existence from anarchists writings from left wing writers such as the ones I wrote about in my other answer. It does have to do with the left. The left is the struggle against oppressive forces existent under the status quo, that&#39;s anarchism too.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why during the french revolution the liberals were the left. And during capitalism in the middle of the last century the liberals were right wing while social democrats were left. Liberals were defending the opressive forces in the system while social democrats were fighting against them.</p>

<p>Left wing in the end will always be the group fighting against the systematic/institutional oppression. That&#39;s why marx described the burguoise as the first revolutionaries, since they went against the oppressive feudal system. They were their time left wing group</p>

<p>In the case of inherited wealth who is actually stealing from who? The man born into billions of centuries old inherited wealth- who hasn&#39;t earnt a penny has more access to resources than a man who has toiled to build up a small business. When the man of unearned inherited wealth buys out the small businessman? Is that theft? Isn&#39;t he using his economic power to rob the poorer man of his hard work? </p>

<p>If society&#39;s leaders are bubbleboy men of inherited wealth rather than buccaneering men of toil and enterprise do you think it makes for a better society?</p>

<p>Ok?! So how do you measure value then, if not with wealth? You wake up in the morning. If you desire a shower of clean water, shoes on your feet, and a doughnut in your belly, you have two options: provide these things for yourself or perform an at-will exchange with another person. You expect to obtain what you want by some other means? Then be a bandit. No one&#39;s stopping you. Or produce everything yourself. No one&#39;s stopping you from doing that either. </p>

<p>How long are you going to maintain this fairytale, utopic outlook on life? Inherited wealth is robbery? Somehow? When you have a son, you better not give him a penny. Or 10 dollars. But it&#39;s just 10 dollars right? Ok so then where do you draw the line. You better not leave $10,000 to your son! That&#39;s wrong! Don&#39;t do whatever you wish with what&#39;s rightfully yours! Do you see where I&#39;m going with this? Come on man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Value is an abstraction of wealth which is an abstraction of resources. Wealth and value only exists as medium in which resources can be exchanged. If we run out of resources we run out of wealth as the only thing that can generate wealth is resources. My degree is in economics and the first thing you learn in economics is that every economic system from capitalism to communism is just trying to manage resources the most efficiently. Nothing to do with wealth or value.</p>

<p>Inherited wealth that passes through many generations allows for theft is what I&#39;m saying. My point is if your contention with taxation is theft then no taxation produces the same problem in different ways. People getting money they haven&#39;t earned. </p>

<p>I get what your saying and the instinct to provide for your family isn&#39;t something I think should be fucked with. I believe there should be a reasonable tax-free cap on how much inherited wealth you can pass on the rest can get donated to charities of your preference. Most people don&#39;t pass on a noteworthy amount for it to be of any concern, its more so people that have had multi-millions in their family across generations- they&#39;re fucked yeah.  But only as much as everyone else. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with this at all. In fact, I find it completely the opposite. Often, my peers on the right give the most and are the kindest people I know. Leftists love to talk about doing good. They survive on moral posturing. But it never amounts to much more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leftists identify with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American Indians), and so on. The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. </p>

<p>Leftists love to claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or moral principles but the behavior is never rationally calculated to benefit these poor, needy groups that the Left loves to keep as pets. If someone believes that affirmative action is good for black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile ways? I think it&#39;d be more productive to take a diplomatic approach to white people who think that affirmative action discriminates against them. But leftist activists don&#39;t take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. Helping black people is not their real goal. Instead, race problems serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustration over lack of power. This ironically harms black people, because the  hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred. If our society had no social problems at all, leftists would have to invent problems to provide themselves with an excuse for causing chaos. Leftism revolves are self-hatred. That&#39;s the truth. I&#39;ve seen too much of it and you&#39;re not going to convince me otherwise. </p>

<p>If you were actually a liberal, you&#39;d know that no liberals self-identify as &quot;leftists.&quot; Honestly, it&#39;s really sloppy to call yourself a leftist, because they only people that call liberals &quot;leftists&quot; are conservative commentators and those that listen to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do people legitimately believe that Comey was fired because of his handling of the Clinton case? Really, that&#39;s what people believe? Why? Because Trump told you and the MSM is in a hypocritical firestorm about it? Believing the opposite of what the MSM says, simply because it is the opposite, does not make your belief automatically right. Its too simplistic, for an overly complicated situation. Thats like saying everything RT reports is the truth because it the opposite of what the American MSM is saying. I completely agree that reading alternative news sources and opposing viewpoints is incredibly important and we must all search for the evidence and the facts to formulate our opinions and perspectives, which are often disguised in journalism. But the argument that Comey = bad therefore Comey fired = good is too simplistic. I am not lamenting Comey&#39;s loss in the FBI, it is clear he was compromised, but the manner and timing in which he was dismissed cannot be overlooked. The Russian investigation cannot be overlooked simply due to partisanship. In between all the propaganda there are nuggets of truth if you look hard enough. I don&#39;t see anyone here defending Nixon&#39;s actions leading up to his impeachment. I don&#39;t see anyone here who honestly believes Nixon was innocent of what he did and didn&#39;t deserve to get impeached. So why are we not holding Trump to the same standard? I believe I know the answer to this, not that it changes anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it all depends. If Trump goes down for the Russia cover up, Pence would probably go down with him. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s extremely unlikely that either would be impeached with the current Congress, as it is Republican controlled and they want to keep their power (the GOP is notorious for putting party before country). Dems will likely gain some seats in 2018, and if they get the majority then impeachment is almost certain. </p>

I personally believe the &quot;Hillary lost the elections because of Russian hacking!&quot; narrative was a blatant attempt by the MSM to divert attention from the awful campaign Hillary and the Dems ran. This narrative along with Comey&#39;s announcement of Hillary&#39;s investigation days before the elections were just scapegoats to divert attention. There was plenty of mudslinging and fake reporting on both sides of the aisle and if &quot;Russia&quot; planted some of these stories, who the fuck really cares. We interfere in worse ways in other foreign elections. However, if members of Trump&#39;s cabinet are receiving donations and bribes from foreign countries, that is an impeachable offensive. The evidence has already show that Flynn was compromised and accepted money for foreign agencies. I am appalled when the Clinton Foundation receives payments and donations from foreign agencies, and I am equally outraged and horrified with Trump and his cabinet do it. Being a leftist or a rightist is irrelevant when both sides are equally corrupt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of our politicians receive bribes, disguised as donations from many different foreign agencies. The Clinton foundation is a great example of this. And the trump administration is no different. I swear I feel like I&#39;m in an episode of the Twilight Zone when I see people defending the president of the United States on a conspiracy board and believe that any director of an intelligence agency is going to do what they say they are going to do. Allowing the president to select the person in charge of an investigation into his cabinet is an egregious example of the disintegration of checks and balances in this country. If only the American people had the same privileges. &quot;Hey Joe, I hear there&#39;s an investigation into you stealing that tv from Best Buy, so why don&#39;t you chose who is going to lead that investigation.&quot; &quot;Well my friend Henry has my back so let&#39;s go with him, he can lead the investigation.&quot; It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous, and I feel sorry for Trump supporters who can&#39;t understand just how absurd this is. It wasn&#39;t ok when Bill Clinton influenced Loretta Lynch to drop charges against Hillary, just like it&#39;s not Ok for Trump to fire the director of the FBI who is leading an investigation against him and his people. This is not and has never been about partisan politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy is that there is a Cabal in control, and Trump was not the selected President of The Cabal. Hillary was.  Do you see?  </p>

<p>Of course the Trump administration is no different.  It is hoped that Trump will be useful in going after The Cabal.  They are the real enemy.  </p>

<p>Comey appeared to be the Director chosen by The Cabal.  Comey was put into place by Obama, and Obama turned out to be a puppet.  Is it not good to remove Comey and replace him with someone who is not beholden to The Cabal?  I am not saying this will happen, but it is now a possibility.  If Hillary was President, Comey would still be in place.  </p>

<p>The whole Russian thing is a distraction.  The real story is the child trafficking and underage sex issues that Comey covered up.  </p>

<p>We want peace with Russia, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your evidence that Trump is not part of The Cabal as you say? If he were not a part of The Cabal why would they have let him win in this rigged system we pretend is a democracy? For all you and I know, both Trump and Clinton were a facade, orchestrated by those who run this country. </p>

<p>I find it disingenuous for you to say that the Russian investigation is a distraction for a child sex trafficking ring. The two are not mutually exclusive, they can both be true. And what is your evidence that Comey covered up a sex trafficking ring? There have been many FBI busts of human trafficking organizations recently that happened because of years long sting operations that were all under Comey. Again, I&#39;m not defending Comey, he&#39;s a useless pawn and he got played. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that Trump fired him under corrupt pretenses. </p>

<p>And of course we want peace with Russia, but we don&#39;t want our elected officials to take money from foreign agencies. Again these are not mutually exclusive, and are both true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/40770/obvious-thoughts-comey-firing/">This piece</a> from a national security blog sums up the rationale well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The stated reasons for Comey’s dismissal are pretextual.  They are so transparently, ludicrously pretextual that we should all feel at least a little bit insulted.  The putative basis for Comey’s firing is a three page memo, dated May 9, faulting his public handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail server investigation, and a recommendation from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, also dated May 9, that Comey be dismissed on that basis.  The three-page memo levels a number of fundamentally valid criticisms. It is also, as perhaps three page memos must necessarily be, pretty conclusory: It renders a verdict without much more than a gesture in the direction of an argument, and preempts a pending Inspector General investigation that would have produced a lengthy and serious account and analysis of Comey’s actions.    While I’m inclined to agree with the memo’s critiques, underdeveloped as they are, they would be an extraordinarily thin basis on which to remove an FBI director, even if you thought they were the real basis.  And they’re clearly not the real basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are asked to believe that the decision to fire the FBI director—so abruptly he learned about it from a cable news chyron while out of D.C.—was based on a dashed off memo, and a response from the Attorney General, both issued the same day.  We are asked to believe that it was motivated  by Comey’s breaches of FBI protocol: First, in publicly criticizing Hillary Clinton, rather than letting Attorney General Loretta Lynch announce the decision that the former Secretary would not be indicted, and then in informing Congress that he had (fruitlessly, as it turned out) reopened the investigation into her e-mails.  These are breaches both Trump and Sessions praised effusively at the time, with Sessions even declaring that Comey had an “absolute duty” to act as he did.  All of them, of course, were well known long before Trump took office and chose to retain Comey.</p>

<p>The most charitable thing one can say about this narrative is that it is not even intended as a serious attempt to advance a genuine rationale. It is an attempt to be cute. Having been directed to concoct a reason to eliminate Comey, the Attorney General ran with a slapdash pastiche of Democrats’ complaints.  Anyone who’s been on a long car trip with a sibling knows this gag: “Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself!”  The only people even pretending to take this explanation seriously are those paid for the indignity.</p>

Trump is just flying the middle finger out for everyone and using this as a cheap trick to confuse his base into believing that he is actually &quot;draining the swamp&quot; and making Democrats look stupid by highlighting their hypocrisy.

Most of the Health insurance providers are smaller divisions of larger insurance or banking institutions, and those institutions exist elsewhere but are nowhere near as important - they can&#39;t compete with the government program for price or coverage. At the end of the day, most private health insurance would either be absorbed or would become an addition to the government option. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The public option would be a card like you receive now - with the exception that you would receive it at 17 when you signed up for selective service. The premium would be a payroll deduction but would be one deduction covering Medicaid / medicare and would be on an income-based sliding scale - a 17-year-old wouldn&#39;t pay as much as the 35-year-old with 4 kids, but would be contributing throughout the young healthy years as anyone else would. By covering the largest pool of people available we are able to push the cost down and we have more ability to negotiate with Doctors / Pharmacies / what have you while allowing the citizen the choice of whichever doctor they feel is best. The citizen would have access to a GP, Specialists, Dentists and Optometrists, and would have a prescription co-pay much as what we have now and would have some out of pocket expense ( a certain percentage on eyeglasses ) but at the end of the day would have all the basic services but no cosmetic or unnecessary surgery.

    <div class="md"><p>I volunteered for Ron Paul&#39;s campaign back in 2008, and have been a supporter ever since because he represents one of the few politicians in this country who seem to <em>genuinely</em> want to help a majority of the people in this country. He&#39;s intelligent and well-read, seems to have a solid understanding of the issues, and didn&#39;t take money from lobbyists like most of our current politicians...he was accountable only to his constituents rather than his financial backers.</p>

<p>Sanders, to me, is similar in that he&#39;s an intelligent person who seems to have a solid grasp on the issues and genuinely wants to help a majority of the people in this country. I have no problem supporting politicians like both Sanders AND Paul, even if they disagree on the <em>way</em> in which they feel it would be best to achieve things. What&#39;s important to me is their underlying motivations, principles, and overall intelligence.</p>

<p>There are positive and negative aspects to both capitalism and socialism, and I think both extremes are potentially dangerous in different ways. But there are certain issues like campaign finance reform and the role of money flowing through our political system that should be bi-partisan in nature and are actually crucial to fixing the democratic process in this country. Both Paul and Sanders would agree with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with all of this but I also just have to say it&#39;s frustrating that Ron Paul gets so much right but then believes in the whole free market scam. </p>

<p>You just can&#39;t have economy integrated with society without it being disastrously corrupt and exploitative without regulation. When businesses control so much infrastructure and money they can do whatever they want and the average person is just along for the ride. We already have enough of this problem as it is where companies bribe government and control the media to influence public opinion and make them complacent and accepting of the corporate control of our economy. If you remove the requirement of having to do that it will only get worse. The free market can&#39;t right itself when these companies are so powerful that no amount of protest or boycott will hurt them more than it will hurt the people doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually completely agree with you here. Even though Paul got me interested in politics/economics in general, I have gradually become more and more distrusting of free market capitalism&#39;s effect on society over the past several years. I can understand that people like Paul believe in the system for what it&#39;s helped us achieve in the past (and capitalism HAS benefited society in many ways, imo), but I just don&#39;t think capitalism alone can function very well in the hands of very flawed humans with greed and corruption running rampant. Over time, it just leads to an increase in wealth disparity due to money&#39;s power/influence over our political system. And if we look back over the past several decades, it&#39;s pretty clear that this is just getting worse and worse rather than getting any better. Those with wealth/power will use that wealth/power to maintain it by any means necessary...at the cost of the majority.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, experiments with socialism haven&#39;t fared much better either. Again, this is mostly a result of human flaws (greed, corruption, etc). It&#39;s just so incredibly hard to pull away from a capitalist system that has been in place this long. Those at the very top of the food chain at this point just have so much wealth and power that it&#39;s too easy for them to use it for control via media/education systems (&quot;manufacturing consent&quot;). I also feel it&#39;s a threat to humanity on a fundamental level, as it only works to nurture and reward some of our worst traits such as greed and materialism. It reinforces a superficiality that goes against everything I feel we SHOULD be working towards as humans.</p>

To me it&#39;s a bit like communism versus capitalism - either one could work with the right government structure built around it, but the unfortunate reality is that the most influential people in our broken society got to where they are by maintaining its brokenness. </p>

Replacing the president with one of These two doesn&#39;t change the fact our government is a democratic republic, but the changes these kinds of people would be able to make in the government would manifest in some of the same ways. Social democrats and libertarians have quite a few things they agree on </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is that we can actually look at voting records, personal history, and financial backers to understand more about politicians rather than just accepting/trusting their &quot;surface level&quot; media personalities.</p>

<p>Obama and Trump were only able to fool the people who don&#39;t bother to dig beneath the superficial outer shell public personas.</p>

<p>Paul and Sanders have a long history of honorable public service. They may not have the same charisma as Obama and Trump, and they may seem &quot;too boring&quot; to the average American who doesn&#39;t care much about politics...but to those of us who have our eyes open, we could actually see what they stood for. There was no facade.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the Rothschild family established Israel.  Do you disagree?  I know I read it somewhere recently, so I can look for that article again.  It had something to do with the Rothschilds agreeing to fund the Allies in WW1 or WW2, I believe.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight--</p>

<p>1) Trump praises the release of Comey&#39;s letter concerning Hillary Clinton&#39;s emails repeatedly during the campaign.
2) Jeff Sessions says that Comey releasing the letter was &quot;legally correct&quot; and &quot;a necessity.&quot;
3) Trump expresses &quot;total confidence&quot; in James Comey.
4) Comey testifies that there&#39;s an active FBI investigation into the Trump campaign&#39;s contacts with Russia.
5) Trump fires Comey for mishandling the Clinton investigation.</p>

<p>Seems legit /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m center left. Definitely not happy about Comey being fired. I&#39;d rather the FBI release the truth, no matter how much it hurts the status quo party. His ability to enrage both parties probably means he was doing his job correctly. The fact that media is flipping on him does not change my opinion. Life is full of grey areas and the media has trouble getting those right all the time. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s been the truth for a while now, but I&#39;m concerned that our government in our Trump admin is becoming very brazen about their corruption. (Again, I understand it might have been similar with dems, but at least they acted like they held up American values) I would love there to be an independent investigation so we can find the truth about the Russian issue, but it doesn&#39;t look like we will get that. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears to be a massive assumption that Comey was literally the only person involved in the Russia investigation.   Are you all retarded?   There are likely teams of agents with direct knowledge who are not likely to stop the investigation because one guy was removed.

<p>My hunch is he is aware, and remaining as singularly focused as he was previously.</p>

<p>The Stein VP pick said it well: Sanders is still a colonialist/imperialist who accepts the globalist banking fascism structure... he just wants more for the common man outta the bargain.</p>

<p>Somebody then responded to me with:</p>

<p>If there was a single substancial evidence then there would be an investigation at least in a single newspaper in the country. There are a lot of terrible made connections, fallacies and some weak circumstantial evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Big Bernie supporter here, too! I also think firing Comey was a hundred percent the right thing to do. I was bitter that he wasn&#39;t fired during the Clinton email investigation (and I was incredibly angry that he didn&#39;t hold her accountable). I can only hope at this point that Comey&#39;s replacement is someone who&#39;s respectable. </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;d also like to say that while the termination of Comey makes Trump look bad, I could care less. Comey needed to be held accountable, and that&#39;s that. It should have happened months ago. </p>

<p>I also strongly dislike Trump but I think that the Trump/Russia narrative is entirely false and was created by HRC/DNC to hide their pathetic rigged campaign and as an attempt to save face. It gives me second-hand embarrassment.</p>

Bernie is still set on a thorough investigation into the &quot;trump-russia ties&quot;.</p>

<p>You have a lot of deprogramming to undergo. </p>

<p>What does this even mean? Like all that awesome rock, blues and jazz that came out of the Soviet Union? Those killer rock bands that are sanctioned by the government and tour on kickbacks and subsidies... right... </p>

<p>And yes, rap is bad art. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the big authors about anarchism have been left wing. It&#39;s still left wing in most of the places. Even Marx considered himself an anarchist. </p>

<p>Rock, blues and jazz came out as protests to capitalist oppression and right wing governments. The Soviet Union was only left wing as it presented itself, for Stalin&#39;s government was extremely conservative.  Even if you don&#39;t believe me, rocknroll, for example started in socialist UK. </p>

<p>There is great music that came out of the Soviet Union, as well as art anyway. If that&#39;s your points. As there is and has been great music from Cuba or China as well as art, for example.</p>

<p>I think you have a very childish idea of what being left wing means and how the government and the economy work. More like a scarecrow view of them.</p>

<p>Here, read some anarchism to educate yourself: </p>

<p>Even conservapedia accepts the left wing of anarchism:
&quot;Traditional anarchism is similar to communism, though unlike communism, traditional anarchists do not favor socialism as a means to their end, as it requires a state. Traditional anarchists advocate the formation of collectives. Traditional anarchism rejects all authority, both of business and of government.&quot;</p>

<p>Come hang out in SC for awhile. We still have KKK rallies on a regular basis. When they took down the Confederate flag, there were people marching in the streets in full Klan uniform. Others waving Nazi flags. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comey wasn&#39;t axed because of how he handled the Hillary case, he was axed for reasons very personal to Trump and I imagine that the evidence of what that is will come to light soon. The fact that Trump now has the power to decide who will lead the investigation against him and his staff is very concerning. I certainly don&#39;t want war just let the rest of us here, but I also don&#39;t want my elected officials receiving payments and bribes from foreign agencies. The entire lot of them, Democrat, Republican it doesn&#39;t really matter, most if not all of them are compromised by some foreign agency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take on anarchism is that it is actually extreme right wing,  extreme right wing tend to promote small government,  further right than small would be zero government AKA anarchism. Fascism and communism are types of socialism and inherently left wing,  personally I&#39;m pretty middle of the road. I feel that mass media have poisoned the brains of the masses into believing many false narratives including true anarchism being left wing.  Most self proclaimed &quot;anarchists&quot; I have met actually are just left wing revolutionaries promoting communism,  which is funny to me because communism is quite far from anarchism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes your political opponents, though opponents themselves, will agree on something. Maybe it is a Trump talking point, but that doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t a Sanders talking point either. Many Clinton supporters say Trump talking points to criticize Sanders too. That doesn&#39;t mean they are not Clinton supporters. It also doesn&#39;t mean the Trump talking point is wrong just because it is a Trump talking point - afterall Sanders and Clinton supporters will agree with Trump supporters often when that talking point is an attack on the other. </p>
