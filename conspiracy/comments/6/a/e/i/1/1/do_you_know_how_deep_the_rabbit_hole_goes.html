        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I will show you an interpretation of reality that is thought provoking. 
I will not provide proof.
You are free to ponder it, embrace it, or reject it.</p>

<p>Who am I ? I’am a guy who just awoke to a higher level of consciousness. This awakening was triggered by the reading of High Level Insider Q&amp;A from 4chan.
Alternatively, I just became completely mad. Decide for yourself.</p>

<p>HLI posts contain very powerful suggestions deliberately engineered to trigger a transformation in the way you perceive reality, in people who are already close to awakening.
Like if everything you saw in your life suddenly clicked together.</p>

<p>We have been opposed by a very powerful and sinister conspiracy, that you already know. The only way to bring the system down was to subvertly disseminate small pieces of information, like a puzzle. When the final piece of the puzzle is put, the whole truth suddenly illuminates your mind, it is like awakening from a dream.</p>

<p>As you probably know, our enemy is known as the master of inversion. Therefore everything in our reality is inverted. 
Media tell Fictions.
Movies tell Truth.</p>

<p>Did you see the movie “In the Mouth of Madness” ? It is exactly about what I just said, except in a negative way : The last piece of the puzzle triggers madness. Now did you hear about the movie “A cure for life” ? What does the title mean ? If you ask any normie, they will tell you anything except the obvious true meaning of theses words, because the truth is so cynical that their mind can’t even imagine it. In other words, they have been brainwashed into decoding reality in a way that makes them blind to something that is very salient and important.
“A cure for life” suggests Life is some sort of disease that needs to be cured. It other word, it means “Suicide”. Do you recall that the promotion said “Take the Cure” ?</p>

<p>We have been brainwashed into decoding reality in a dysfunctional way. Your model of reality defines your perceptions, not the other way around. People who are awoke are said to have the sixth sense, or the third eye.</p>

<p>The movie Matrix says we are living in a virtual reality : It is true, in a certain way. We have a Soul, which exists in an underlying reality and is incarnated into a physical body. It is metaphorically equivalent to saying that we are living in a virtual reality. The communication channels between your Soul and your physical Body are the Chakras. Your brain decodes reality into the language of the Soul, which is all about metaphors : Essences. Yes, these are the Essences Platon is talking about. Things like Fire, Water, Up, Down, Pointy, Dark, Heart, Horse, Wolf, Solid, Liquid, Pure, One, Two, Circle, Red, Blue, Feminine, Inside, Fast… These Essences, when they are projected to our physical reality, give things like actual fires, imperfect circles drawn on a piece of paper…
By the way, the Mandela Effect proves our physical reality is indeed an illusion : it can be edited. Glitches in the Matrix are interpreted as paranormal events.</p>

<p>What is the nature of our Soul ? I don’t know, but I have noticed that behind every physical human being, there is an animal, sometimes several animals in some kind of superposition. Like every truth, there are remnants of it in some obscure old spirituality. In this case, it is found in shamanism and is known as Spirit Animal. Reference to the actual Spirit Animal of known people are found everywhere, yet most people don’t notice. You can learn many things simply by using google image on famous people.
Jack nicholson is a wolf (he played in the movie wolf, what a coincidence)
Hillary Clinton is a Spider (again, type Hillary Clinton Spider on google image)
Jeff Bridges is a goat.
Katy Perry is a Mantis.
George Soros is a giant Worm.
Michael Chertoff is a fucking Demon, literally.
Did you see the movie The Golden Compass ? It is about spirit animals.</p>

<p>What is happening now is the biblical end of time. Again, you are free to believe me, or disbelieve me, but I know it to be true, in my heart and my soul.</p>

<p>Julian Assange is the christ, or the white horseman of the apocalypse,  or the white rider from the lord of the rings.
Donald Trump is Archangel Michael.
George Soros is Satan himself.
The jewish people are the army of Satan.
Plastic surgery, organ transplant and abortion are abominations that we were brainwashed to consider as “normal” while in reality they are satanic practices.</p>

<p>Recently Julian Assange tweeted : “the FBI will now start leaking leaking like Niagara”. It is a reference to the Flood (biblical) of truth and purity that will wash the earth from Satan’s grip.</p>

<p>Alien Covenant is about the false promise made by Satan to the jewish people that they will go to heaven, while in reality they will go to hell : Satan is the master of deception. He lured the jewish people into believing they would be the masters of this world while in reality no such thing was ever be possible : there was always going to be a point where God would intervene and bring down everything Satan (Sauron) had built. I believe this is cyclical : these events happen again and again and again until the end of times.</p>

<p>Alien Covenant
&quot;In religion, a covenant is a formal alliance or agreement made by God with a religious community or with humanity in general. It is central to the Abrahamic religions and derived from the biblical covenants, notably the Abrahamic covenant.&quot;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(religion)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(religion)</a></p>

<p>Just deleted all my edits by accidents. Let me just say that Nathalie Portman, though Jewish, is actually an Angel. JJ Abrams is a very good person too. So that you know that not all jews are bad. I&#39;m half Jewish.</p>

<p>The flood in our current times is metaphorical. It is a flood of Truth, Love and Awakening. Satan&#39;s system can&#39;t survive it, so it will be washed out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose that&#39;s true. I get what you&#39;re saying but the flood myth serves more as a tale that scares us into preserving consciousness.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with some of it, other parts I&#39;m not so sure of.  I do believe we are in satan&#39;s matrix and everything is being twisted the wrong way around.  </p>

<p>Interesting that you mention it&#39;s all cyclical, I&#39;ve had the same thought.  The Dark Tower (fiction) contains a lot corresponding info (truth) that matches up with our perceived world.  A central idea (ka is a wheel) that things come back around and start over again.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only cyclical because we keep repeating the same mistakes, the definition of insanity. We are still fighting the crusades. </p>

<p>It&#39;s no ones fault, I&#39;ve learned it doesn&#39;t matter who did what, the deception is so bad that good people got duped into thinking other good people were the enemy and had to take them out. Which continues a never ending cycle. When you want to take the government out, you become an enemy of the government. When the government tries to harm you or control you, they made themselves your enemy. But yet it&#39;s all good people everywhere convinced there has to be enemy, which ensures there is an enemy. Politicians are blackmailed with the threat of prison, the same institution that feeds off people indiscriminately, because it must have people to survive. Putting anyone in jail is good for it. Crime is good for it. Sickness is good for the medical institutions that will destroy its own members. It&#39;s not about people, it&#39;s about systems programmed to survive off of people&#39;s lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was with you on some of this but I think you should read HLI more carefully... Also get to know history better.</p>

<p>Seems like you&#39;re getting a little too swept away with direct analogies. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>What makes you call Assange the christ? He&#39;s revealed some truth, but only enough to prevent a Clinton presidency. Perhaps he really does have good intentions but, as HLI said, he&#39;s CIA so we can&#39;t put our full faith in him. A Christ figure is one whose loyalties are unquestionable and is fully deserving of all of our faith.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump the archangel? Would an angel spend his whole life in bed with the elites? Trump is just as involved with the Jeffrey Epstein crowd as the Clintons are. If you don&#39;t believe me, have a look at the information <a href="/u/closedsociety404">/u/closedsociety404</a> posts on this topic (he&#39;s either extremely well-read or a member of three). However, I definitely think Trump has the potential to leave his sordid past behind and transform into a good president. This would make at best more of a Paul figure, however.</p></li>
<li><p>Calling all Jews the army of Satan is obviously not realistic and exactly the sort of blanket statement that the elites trick you into assuming. They have played the role of the evil banker for quite some time and are used by the synagogue of satan if that&#39;s what you mean. But being an ethnically Jewish person myself it prevents me from sympathizing with your line of thought. The Old Testament is a pretty evil book, but don&#39;t condemn an entire group because of it. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>HLI has an interesting quote about the Jews:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You guys are right that jews have disproportionate influence in the world, especially in spheres where it really matters like finance and the media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where you are wrong is that you confuse cause and effect. The jews were put into these fields by non-jews as patsies originally. Christians were not allowed to engage in usury, but jews had no problem with it, so &quot;Christian&quot; monarchs/governments used the jews to steal from the population, then blamed it on the jews.</p>

<p>Today, with the widespread weakening of the nationstate, international finance is emerging as a shadow state. That gives the jews increasingly more power, but the nationstate is being destroyed by the same people who put jews into finance in the first place. So, many are right that there is growing jewish power, but generally wrong about why and how we got here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I havent seen it &quot;yet&quot; either. But you can guess only from the Title : Covenant. </p>

<p>In religion, a covenant is a formal alliance or agreement made by God with a religious community or with humanity in general. It is central to the Abrahamic religions and derived from the biblical covenants, notably the Abrahamic covenant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad to see you reading up on the High Level Insider; but all of your associations between people like Assange or Trump are all totally out of whack with everything the HLI has written.  Not to mention, he explicitly explained that we are not at &#39;the end of times&#39;; we are actually at a point of the start of a renaissance (nothing to do with Trump though; trump is sort of a villain tbh).</p>

<p>I think you need to go back and re-read, and reserve your confirmation bias.  Read very closely - bible related shit is all symbolic, not literal</p>

<p>Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</p>

<p>HLI said Assange was CIA agent to make you understand that nothing he says is to be understood literally. He is just showing us how mind control works and the suggestive power of language. So obviously Assange is not a CIA agent because it makes no fucking sense, then why did HLI lie about it ? Because Assange is part of their organisation : Three, which means Love.</p>

<p>Also it is easy to understand why HLI did not say Trump is one of them (which he is), because it would be divisive and clumsy. Better to suggest it strongly to those who can read between the lines.</p>

<p>Also, he DID explicitly say Trump is part of the order, and that he is friendly with all of those people that he pretends to dislike.</p>
