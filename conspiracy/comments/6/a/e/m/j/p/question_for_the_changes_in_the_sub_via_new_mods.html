        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m hoping that just like the spirit of our sub here in r/conspiracy is has always been one of open discussion, transparency, and debate, that we can continue to carry on that spirit and discuss the addition of all the new Mods.</p>

<p>While we all want a productive community here in this sub, I&#39;ve noticed a pattern that has corresponded to 4 new mods added in the last 2 months corresponding with lots of Bans of users and noticing a whole lot of [removed] posts, which is very rare for this sub which has a history of hands off mods, and any discussions/debates/etc usually play themselves out naturally and mutually, for all to see, and whatever is the truth usually wins out.</p>

<p>Now having been a member of various occult subs, sports subs, philosophy sub, and new/worldnews sub, I&#39;ve noticed this exact same pattern whenever new mods get added, then it results in an influx of [removed]/banned and the vibe/energy/flow of the sub gets completely changed.</p>

<p>Heck I&#39;ve watch r/politics get completely taken over by David Brock&#39;s ShareBlue propaganda group and they openly link to his site there as a source (along with correct the record).</p>

<p>A year ago new mods were added, and I got swooped up and banned from the sub from debating an obvious Monsanto operative who started getting militant, swearing, calling me names, etc and I was merely defending myself and trying to stay calm and logical, but that user got banned and so did I without warning. Now I&#39;m not really too invested in my username since we should all be using throwaways/burners that are tossed every so often and I was due, but still.</p>

<p>Can we discuss in openness, transparency, in the Spirit of being all about the truth in this sub?</p>

<p>*Edit, I&#39;m receiving several PM&#39;s from banned members telling me their stories and agreeing with the premise of this post, however since they are banned, they are not allowed to add to the discussion here.</p>

<p>Edit** what about a re-instatement of all for a second chance. Or imposing a democratic review process prior to ban implementation?</p>

<p>I mean that&#39;s the style I&#39;m used to here. Really hands off and wide open. There is also a big SJW/PC movement going on that we have to be careful of because they are trying to get rid of free speech. There&#39;s a real fine to all of this, I know that</p>

<p>The user before me is saything that before when he complained to mods, they said &quot;deal with it,&quot; implying the style of modding used to be like that.</p>

<p>The style of modding in other subs, is super SJW/PC style modding. </p>

<p>With the new mods added last 2 months, we are leaving the old style, for the new style</p>

<p>If someone is banned in the sub, they are still allowed to send PM&#39;s. But not if they are site wide. Some of the site wide banned users have sent me PMs from a new or alt account</p>

<p>I&#39;m asking for evidence of what OP is claiming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want me to give you the usernames of people who are PM&#39;ing me to privately discuss how they got banned for supposed &#39;stupid reasons&#39; and how everything was fine until the new mods showed up, discussed in private for fear of being tracked/banned again, and you don&#39;t see anything wrong with that?</p>

<p>You can go to the public mod log and PM them I guess, but if they are permabanned site wide then they won&#39;t be able to reply unless they have an alt</p>

<p>How about this, point to something in the public mod log that backs your claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about I just admit I got banned a year ago? And then had several alts I made that same day and they all got banned? There are people here in the thread also stating they got banned.</p>

<p>My gripe is mostly the new mods being on a ban kick and how this usually happens anytime new mods are added they can go on a power trip. This sub used to be hands off, u can swear and people would duel it out with operatives and trolls publically, and now there are a bunch of bans and removed and the people PM&#39;ing me are putting it all on the news mods lest that 2 months old. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone always disagrees with their ban.  It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen a ban done by any mod that seemed inappropriate, and in the few cases I&#39;ve doubted the necessity of the ban, after a few minutes of research into the situation I&#39;ve found the reason for the ban.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even people who have unquestionably broken the rules and deserved their ban are successfully appealing by showing a willingness to acknowledge and follow the rules going forward.  I find it hard to imagine a scenario where someone was wrongfully banned AND unable to successfully appeal the ban.</p>

<p>TLDR; we are willing to give even the worst offenders a second and third chance so why would we not give someone wrongfully banned a second or third chance?</p>
