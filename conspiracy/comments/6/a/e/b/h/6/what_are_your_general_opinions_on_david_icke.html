    <div class="md"><p>Nah mate, just have spare time at work and always refreshing new to get the latest info. I like to crunch the data as it comes in and isn&#39;t too clouded by toxicity, once a post reaches front page it becomes a cesspool. Reddit is a good place to get a good feel of what&#39;s going on, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> receives in new pretty much everything, from CNN to rag papers to shareblue to obscure sites nobody heard about. Then people can discuss it and you can get a good idea of what the general feeling towards that thing is and it sometimes help to determine if something is bollocks or not. Hey maybe I&#39;m weird in the way I&#39;m doing it, but so far it&#39;s working and we&#39;re on a good track so I&#39;m not too worried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are entitled to your own opinion. Putting David Icke in the same universe as David Wilcock is absurd. Wilcock is a charlatan salesman who says alot of new age nonsense. David Icke has painful arthritis, yet travels the world and does 10 hour lectures every weekend. He goes on peoples internet shows for free. Luke Rudkowski and &quot;we are change&quot; is an exmaple among many. David Icke puts everything back into his work an lives in a small apartment and drives a used chrysler. Icke was the man who exposed Jimmy Savile, Ted Heath and numerous other sicko molester/killers decades before anyone else. He is an incredible human being and EVERYONE can learn a massive amount about this reality by reading his books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you really think about it think hard with all the lies and deception, the worshipping of moloch in the undergrounds of the world and their true belief that they are feeding this energy (we are all energy via vibrations this is practically mainstream now) is it really so far fetched to think that there really is higher dimmensions that our 3rd dimmensional brains have a hard time grasping and that they could be easily manipulating things behind the scenes? Weve been lied too time and time again to think in their narrative. Thought matters and higher dimmensions are all around without our knowledge we are all connected way more than any of us think this world is amazing and we can all fix it.

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t even remember who I first started with but I think I was woken up by researching the JFK assassination and there was a lecture given by Jim Marrs. He&#39;s a good old Texas boy and kind of funny. </p>

<p>If you like historical conspiracy/ hidden history kind of stuff then look up Graham Hancock. His research into a lost global civilization is super interesting. Also Lloyd Pye&#39;s documentary &quot;Everything you know is wrong&quot; is awesome. It deals with Big Foot but is mostly about how we&#39;ve been lied to about who we are. </p>

<p>Those are just some of the people I like but they probably aren&#39;t everyone&#39;s cup of tea... to each their own!! I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll think of others and will post here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have learned not to discredit anything Icke says.</p>

<p>So much of what he has said has turned out to be true.</p>

<p>Jimmy Savile a pedo.</p>

<p>Prime minister Ted Heath a pedo.</p>

<p>2001 911 terror attacks.</p>

<p>He talked about Microchips in humans long before anyone else Likewise the holographic universe.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a few of his &quot;accurate predictions&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theinfopost.org/2015/12/10-things-david-icke-predicted-that.html#IkDVfBKmrikjFX8E.99">http://www.theinfopost.org/2015/12/10-things-david-icke-predicted-that.html#IkDVfBKmrikjFX8E.99</a></p>

<p>His book the biggest secret is one of my all time favourites and I would advise everyone to read it.</p>

<p>I see people saying he talks n metaphors or the reptilian thing is disinformation. To this I say Icke totally believes it and shows his evidence and workings as to how reaches these conclusions.</p>

<p>If the queen came out as A reptilian I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s certainly on the ball with some of his information, specifically the various British paedo scandals. He outed Savile as one way before anybody came forward and likewise for Ted Heath. Unfortunately that all gets buried under the reptilian stuff he insists on shouting about. The majority of the UK thinks he&#39;s a laughing stock. That said, if it turns out the Queen is a lizard person, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me. I&#39;d like to add Theresa May to that list too. There&#39;s something not quite right about our (unelected) PM. At times it looks like she&#39;s wearing somebody else&#39;s skin! </p>

Was just beginning to open my eyes to conspiracy stuff (thanks to the &quot;Mage Ascension&quot; rule book). Had no idea who he was or anything about him, but started reading and couldn&#39;t put it down. I&#39;ve tried reading his other stuff, but it all seems very similar and repetitive. He&#39;s pretty spot on with the stuff about the &quot;third dimension&quot; (us), but I can&#39;t say that I believe all of his stuff about the other dimensional alien lizards, but he makes a strong case.</p>
