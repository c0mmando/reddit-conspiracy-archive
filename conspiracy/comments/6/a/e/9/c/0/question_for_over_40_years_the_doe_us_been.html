       What can you expect, this is a sub to share information and discuss in order to better the community. Just saying, although I do agree with your post. I'm not the one who asked for sources. People can go research stuff and get different answers from non-credible sources; this isn't about you being wiser and more knowledgeable than other people. You alone are insignificant in this battle against oppression, but all of us together stand a lot better of a chance.

       I guaruntee you will find a site that says the opposite of what you're saying. Nontheless, sourcing is a good habit to form. But you do you man, I was just trying to help you, which in turn will help the community.

       So what your sub shills are doing is writing a bunch of offensive stuff to provoke responses, deleting their comments, then reporting the person they offend who is merely responding. It's abuse of your subscribers and your sub. Apply your standards equally. I see why so many subscribers are upset. You have an issue and it's not guys like me.

       Very possible, even probable. I likely would have removed the deleted comment had I seen it, but I didn't.

       Where would you say your responsibility plays into this? If you don't want your comments removed, don't respond to their provocations. You're essentially blaming me and the other mods for what you admit to as feeding a troll.

       You don't have to ignore the trolls, but you can't ignore our other rules just because your responding to someone else who's breaking them. I'd only suggest ignoring trolls because it's not worth your time, or ours when we have to deal with the comment reports.

       I don't care a flying mouse fart about your demand for facts. Who the fuck are you? Nobody that's who. Every great conspiracy cracked or percolating started with people saying "hey the story we are being fed does not fit with reality". Over 40 years they've told us they're administering these test to improve education, yet we've somehow not cracked the code...that fits your experience or it does not. Since it does not, you may move the fuck along - self-important poser.

        "The latest U.S. PISA achievement results are disappointing but not surprising," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. "They were predictable given the impact of the last 15 years of U.S. education policies combined with continuing state disinvestment following the 2008 recession. Thirty-one states still spend less per pupil than before the recession."

       The tests are just for measurement and a semblance of accountability. I don't think standardized testing is necessarily a bad thing in and of it's own. They do become a problem when schools are rewarded for good test scores so that they only "teach to the test"
though.

       Some idiot politician got their panties in a wad when they noticed that schools don't perform the same (churn out the same student) every year in every area in ever city. So in order to make sure all school were compliant, they standardized everything so that no matter where lil Johnny went, he would be in the same place when he changed schools, lesson wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened was a catastrophic failure that required schools to have good scores for good money, and limit funding on schools that performed badly. So in essence, the rich schools got richer, and the inner-city schools failed miserably. More and more funding was cut to the "poor" schools, and...well, there ya go. Our current state.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to go down the rabbit hole, then the standards taught meant every kid would churn out the same way across the country. Same historical facts, same bullshit, same programming. It just isn't working, though.
