    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is also another extremely important thing, now that we are giving degrees to everyone, we are really lowering their overall value. As well as the amount of debt young people are getting into is increasing. We are told that we need to buy more and more, yet I agree people need to be able to relax and learn to appreciate what they already have. If we weren&#39;t trying to buy more all the time, we might live healthier lives too as we would be forced to make wiser choices.</p>

<p>If this guy is happy in his existence who cares? If he goes out and gets a job and becomes miserable it means that someone who wants a job cant get one and they then become miserable.

    <div class="md"><p>Why avoid it? If technology means that there&#39;s less shitty jobs and more free time we should embrace that as a society. The problem is our society is corrupt so technological advances are only benefiting the very rich. Ideally less jobs would mean 3/4 day weeks on similar wages. It doesn&#39;t though and so it creates an unemployment problem. There is not enough jobs to go around- so why cant people find happiness in their shit existence and go with it? </p>

<p>If society only has enough jobs for 80% of the working population what do you propose for the other 20%?</p>

<p>People can take what they want from life I think, its not for anyone to say; you should spend 50 hours a week working in Mcdonald&#39;s because making and consuming art and culture instead isn&#39;t life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking if we took the people wh weren&#39;t providing value to the market, like say the 20% or whatever and taught them how to farm, and gave them some land, they could sustain themselves at the very least and maybe generate enough food to feed others. We all need food, and fresh organic food would be optimal. Im sure people would feel way better doing this, and providing a healthy alternative that is still greatly needed, as opposed to working a job they may not feel they contribute to or being &#39;a parasite.&#39; Maybe we could farm all of eastern Russia, or western Canada, or Africa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That technology everyone thinks is going to set them free will definitely bite them in the ass. The very rich don&#39;t want you to have their resources and i&#39;m not speaking of tech because they will give you that eventually. They don&#39;t want you on their land, they don&#39;t want you eating their food, they don&#39;t want you breathing their air. the world is not going to get set free to be beach bums. There will be genocide.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even advocate the current system of working. I think its slavery, but i do believe in working for myself..Just Myself. Not handing over taxes to feed the dreamers on the government teat or anything else in this ridiculous system. What that 20% and anyone else who is tired of it can do is leave the system and fend for themselves. Grow your own food and live your own life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree that this option would be amazing, however I don&#39;t think that it is an option for most people to achieve. In the past, let&#39;s say 1940&#39;s-1960&#39;s a man could go to work and support a family while his wife stays home and takes care of kids, etc. Nowadays things are much different, and we are dependent on being in debt and forced into these jobs that are unfulfilling. I think if people felt like what they were doing was more meaningful and felt less forced into it, we would see far less people on welfare and more people volunteering for work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. It&#39;s definitely not an easy thing to achieve - and you will most likely have to work for a while before you can get there. </p>

<p>Not every business is going to cost an unrealistic amount of money to start. And not every investment has to be an unrealistic amount in order to make money off of it. The key is to create multiple streams of revenue for yourself all at once. The more streams you have, the less dependent you are on any one source (your 9-5).</p>

<p>Use your 9-5 as your stepping stone while you work on creating new streams of revenue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it requires experience, which is what most young people lack at the critical times in their lives where they have to make important decisions. What you are talking about might be fairly easy, but a student fresh out of high school might feel like they&#39;ll never make it unless they go to university for 4 years, while taking on $30k of debt or more, and then not getting employed right away. They may have been better off taking that $30k and starting a business or something like that instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure. It&#39;s funny that you mention that, because I actually listened to a speech of a father and son who sort of made that decision. The kid was graduating high school and the dad said &quot;okay I&#39;ve got $X (can&#39;t remember specific number) to pay for you to go to college. If that&#39;s what you want, that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do. HOWEVER, I want you to learn about investing and decide if you&#39;d like to invest that money instead of go to college.&quot;</p>

<p>So that&#39;s what they did... they learned and invested the money together and today, the son is now in his late 20&#39;s and nets $250k+ per year and he works about 2 DAYS/YEAR. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because technically, the government stole my time/labor/skill to give to them so they could do nothing. That is what&#39;s wrong with it. Getting something for doing nothing might be freedom for one person but it is slavery and oppression for the other person paying for it.</p>

<p>With that said, I agree with you. The whole rat race is bullshit. It is slavery. Packing all of us into mega cities so we don&#39;t have the space or resources sustain ourselves and are forced to have a job to survive.</p>

<p>I hate to say it. But the world needs a major reset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess what I was thinking is we have politicians who make 6 figure sums for working 150 days a year, and we can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on things like killing the world&#39;s poorest people in foreign countries, yet to spend a few thousand dollars per citizen in our own country would be criminal. Same thing for health care, we should be able to provide every citizen with at the very least basic necessary for health care, yet people still pay for drugs and stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like UBI either, simply because it is not sustainable and it would have to be done a worldwide scale for it to actually work. It cannot work in the current economic system. Any country that did it, would destroy it&#39;s currency due to the inflation that would occur.</p>

<p>With that said, the only way to maintain the structure of society as we know it today, would be to have UBI. Personally, I don&#39;t like either. I despise the rat race system we have, and even with UBI the rat race system would still exist. I find it ludicrous that we find it acceptable to spend nearly 40% of the time we are alive working a job just to survive.</p>

<p>There are several facets to the problem. Government. Money. Corporate greed. The list goes on. And sadly, it&#39;s all intimately tied together, and it&#39;s all part of the problem. It all needs to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there needs to be a reassessment of how we view work as a society, but I don&#39;t think we are quite at the point where allowing some people to not work at all is logistically feasible. I think full-time employment should be decreased to 24 hours a week, and I think, rather than paying politicians and bureaucrats, we should pay all registered voters an extra 25% of their weekly wages to contribute in some way, either as a community representative or in the capacity of a social worker/charity worker, or in some other government function, in exchange for one 6-8 hour day of work per week. Taxes should be based on wealth not on income, because it would incentivize spending and entrepeneurship over saving. Spending creates jobs and a healthy economy much more than anything else. Saving creates inequality and a stagnant market.</p>

<p>Assistance should be given for people with disabilities/diseases that make them incompatible with work and those temporary unemployed, but looking for job.</p>

<p>As one once said &quot;for one that receives without work, other works without receiving&quot; (not exact words but something like that).</p>

<p>You&#39;re not restrained to do the 9-5 way. Do it your way. Create something that adds value to the life of the others. Move the farmlands and live out of what the earth gives you. But as long as you make your life out welfare - without needing it - you&#39;re taking resources from the ones who deserved it.</p>
