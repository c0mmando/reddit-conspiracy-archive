Isn&#39;t a religion that was created by the holy roman empire a form of control structure for the elite? Yet I see so many on here fear mongering about esoteric ideas and jebus not digging it. </p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t want people achieving their full spiritual potential wouldn&#39;t you tell them the ways to do so are naughty and frowned on by a giant invisible man in the sky?</p>

<p>Serious discussion on no faith based arguments. I see this as a legitimate problem in this community. Don&#39;t try to understand the ideas of the pentagram on golden ratio! Fear and demonize it!!! Ya makes total sense. </p>

<p>Parallel: You can take a page from Harry Potter and choose one of life&#39;s allegorical Gryffindor&#39;s over one of life&#39;s Slytherine&#39;s, but that doesn&#39;t mean you believe in witchcraft. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Sadly I agree with you. When i look at religions the one i align most with is levays satanism. But I stay away from it as I have also done my fair share of reading on theistic worship of certain entities. Not down with that kind of shit. I like, do as thou wilt and no harm unto others as another poster on here said a while back. Theres just silly shit in christianity for me. Dont beat off is a huge one and i rarely masturbate. Why would a god design us to be able to fuck ourselves if its an atrocity and offends him? Contradictions all throughout and i cant fucking stand hypocrisy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bible from a historical perspective is accurate.  If you have an hour....nah...forget that...this is a truth forum...so..im just gonba say the only truths that matters is what happens when you die...so please take an hour and look at this video.  It answers all the misconceptions that people have about the bible.
<a href="https://youtu.be/G1XJ7DeR5fc">https://youtu.be/G1XJ7DeR5fc</a></p>

<p>Next a video that proves from a scholarly and historical perspective that jesus raised from the dead.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5znVUFHqO4Q">https://youtu.be/5znVUFHqO4Q</a></p>

<p>The first video is entertaining...the 2nd is boring</p>

<p>But what i challenge you to do is get off the internet...go to the nearest university...find the history department and ask for a scholarly historian...with a phd that is an atheist....and ask them abiut the claims made.</p>

<p>You can them make up your mind.</p>

<p>My bottom line is the bible is true.  Jesus raised from the dead.  People know there is something different about the bible bit few think and take tims to research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes no sense...what am i commanded to do?  Im commanded to love him with all my heart soul and mind ( mattgew 22:36-38).</p>

<p>Im also commanded to love my wife and serve her with all my heart just like christ loved the church (eph 5:25).</p>

<p>Then im commanded to not exasperate my kids but love them and bring them up in the lord (eph 6:4).  Meaning spend time with them over my career and love them and be their best friend.</p>

<p>Why wouldnt i do that?  Thats my job as a man.  Its a pleasure to be tired serving my God and my family.  Yes its daunting to be responsible...but i have grace and its an honor to serve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another question, why is it I believe in &quot;god&quot; and have seen for myself what god is. Mind shattering to say the least. Why was it done under conditions demonized by the church? Yet earlier in life as a christian I felt no connection to god. Now I know my connection and puzzle pieces in my life have started aligning.</p>

<p>Im under the conclusion there is a god and all that but the bible has been rewritten and designed to keep people from truly understanding their full potential and connection to a powerful omnipresent being. </p>

<p>Why is it that me, someone who is far from special has been given the vision and experience I have yet so many other people who follow the book the the T still question what their lord truly is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely am against modern organized religion for the most part but I definitely think spirituality is a very real and personal thing, and that the Bible does contain SOME pretty decent teachings (things Jesus said mainly, Love thy neighbour and all that) but that is also contains a a great deal of ancient information coded as symbolic myth, information about the hidden history of the world. I think the deluge was real, but in Graham Hancock&#39;s view - asteroid impact during the Younger Dryas destroying whatever civilization(s) existed (sea level rose 300-400 feet...Atlantis...). Something like that.</p>
