       Isn't christianity a conspiracy? Isn't a religion that was created by the holy roman empire a form of control structure for the elite? Yet I see so many on here fear mongering about esoteric ideas and jebus not digging it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you didn't want people achieving their full spiritual potential wouldn't you tell them the ways to do so are naughty and frowned on by a giant invisible man in the sky?
      </p>
      <p>
       Serious discussion on no faith based arguments. I see this as a legitimate problem in this community. Don't try to understand the ideas of the pentagram on golden ratio! Fear and demonize it!!! Ya makes total sense.

       I like holding the morals and dispensing with the stories.
      </p>

       Parallel: You can take a page from Harry Potter and choose one of life's allegorical Gryffindor's over one of life's Slytherine's, but that doesn't mean you believe in witchcraft.

       No I apologize if it was ambiguous, but I wanted to cite an example of a character making a good choice in a work of fiction. The choice is still good, and those good traits should be emulated, while the story is largely inconsequential to one's life

       I definitely agree that too much conspiracy is latched on by messianic "end times" people. Read some entertainment industry conspiracies to see examples. Any time someone wears red to an awards event the conspiracy forums start "whore of babylon"ing everything.

       From my understanding, religion is mankinds explanation of the inexplicable. Revelation is genuine truth and Jesus was one of the revelators of recent times.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible has missing and altered parts for sure though. Religion is natural but the elite have used it against us.

       I'm beginning to see religion and it's dogma are what hold humanity back. All religions are a box for the mind. Morals can exist without dogma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe religion is what seperates
       <em>
        the wheat from the tare
       </em>
       but oposite of the way religious folks think it does. They are the throway who couldn't see reality for themselves.

       Wow. Sadly I agree with you. When i look at religions the one i align most with is levays satanism. But I stay away from it as I have also done my fair share of reading on theistic worship of certain entities. Not down with that kind of shit. I like, do as thou wilt and no harm unto others as another poster on here said a while back. Theres just silly shit in christianity for me. Dont beat off is a huge one and i rarely masturbate. Why would a god design us to be able to fuck ourselves if its an atrocity and offends him? Contradictions all throughout and i cant fucking stand hypocrisy.

       I read a good thing the other day how early Christians were an example of a communist revolution based on values and ethics rather than a centralized state mechanism. Now Christianity is a giant protestant excuse to do whatever the fuck you want because you can pray and everything is fine. Religion, truly an opiate of the masses.

       The bible from a historical perspective is accurate.  If you have an hour....nah...forget that...this is a truth forum...so..im just gonba say the only truths that matters is what happens when you die...so please take an hour and look at this video.  It answers all the misconceptions that people have about the bible.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/G1XJ7DeR5fc">
        https://youtu.be/G1XJ7DeR5fc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Next a video that proves from a scholarly and historical perspective that jesus raised from the dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/5znVUFHqO4Q">
        https://youtu.be/5znVUFHqO4Q
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The first video is entertaining...the 2nd is boring
      </p>
      <p>
       But what i challenge you to do is get off the internet...go to the nearest university...find the history department and ask for a scholarly historian...with a phd that is an atheist....and ask them abiut the claims made.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can them make up your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       My bottom line is the bible is true.  Jesus raised from the dead.  People know there is something different about the bible bit few think and take tims to research.

       I bow to no man or God. God could be real, I could give a rats ass if he is man. I'd never bow or worship the dude. Just not my style, he or she or whatever a god is supposed to be can do their own thing, I'll do mine. If I'm punished in hell fire for all time when I die, than so be it. It beats kissing some God's ass for all eternity.

       That makes no sense...what am i commanded to do?  Im commanded to love him with all my heart soul and mind ( mattgew 22:36-38).
      </p>
      <p>
       Im also commanded to love my wife and serve her with all my heart just like christ loved the church (eph 5:25).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then im commanded to not exasperate my kids but love them and bring them up in the lord (eph 6:4).  Meaning spend time with them over my career and love them and be their best friend.

       Why wouldnt i do that?  Thats my job as a man.  Its a pleasure to be tired serving my God and my family.  Yes its daunting to be responsible...but i have grace and its an honor to serve.

       What you are saying makes no sense to me man. But hey, you can believe and live your life how you wish, it's all good. I'm not shitting on your religion. I just don't care about your religion or any others for that matter. I'm here on earth livin life man. My life is my own, and I make it what it is. I don't need a higher power to get me through the rough times in life, I rely on myself and some of my loved ones, not God. You do what works for you, and I do what works for me, that's just the way  life is man.

       Christianity is not the problem with our society. Too little Christianity is the problem. Too much Islam is the problem. Too much atheism is the problem. Too much Zionism is the problem. Chrisitianity would be the solution, if we only had more of it.

       I don't see a bunch of people yelling at others that they are condemned for silly things as a good thing in the world. And don't get me wrong I realize there is one "god". I understand what jesus meant when he said we all has a bit of god in us. The hilarious thing is I saw/had this revelation doing something church had demonized long ago.

       Another question, why is it I believe in "god" and have seen for myself what god is. Mind shattering to say the least. Why was it done under conditions demonized by the church? Yet earlier in life as a christian I felt no connection to god. Now I know my connection and puzzle pieces in my life have started aligning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im under the conclusion there is a god and all that but the bible has been rewritten and designed to keep people from truly understanding their full potential and connection to a powerful omnipresent being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that me, someone who is far from special has been given the vision and experience I have yet so many other people who follow the book the the T still question what their lord truly is.

       I definitely am against modern organized religion for the most part but I definitely think spirituality is a very real and personal thing, and that the Bible does contain SOME pretty decent teachings (things Jesus said mainly, Love thy neighbour and all that) but that is also contains a a great deal of ancient information coded as symbolic myth, information about the hidden history of the world. I think the deluge was real, but in Graham Hancock's view - asteroid impact during the Younger Dryas destroying whatever civilization(s) existed (sea level rose 300-400 feet...Atlantis...). Something like that.

       The Bible is not a RELIGION, it's a book of history. When the Romans sacked the walls of Jerusalem in 70 AD they TOOK THE BIBLE AND MADE IT INTO A RELIGION.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible is and has always been for only the Israelite's of the Bible. It clearly states this in almost 70% of the Bible books.

       The tribes of Israel are lost and all will be revealed when the messiah returns.
