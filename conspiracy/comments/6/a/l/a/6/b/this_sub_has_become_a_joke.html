    <div class="md"><p>Here comes some alternative <em>alternative</em> analysis. :D</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now there is Nixon level unraveling of the current administration in real time. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Richard Nixon committed very real crimes, so if this is a &quot;Nixon level&quot; incident, what would that say about Donald Trump?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Potentially a staged coup by a foreign nation in the highest office... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The irony of it all. Democratic partisans are blaming &quot;a foreign nation&quot; namely Russian for what happened in the election, and you appear to be claiming that Donald Trump is the victim of such a thing. Neither side has it right, but it makes for some good distracting Hegelian dialectic. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and this sub is still acutely focused on demonizing the Clintons, denying anything involving &quot;Russia&quot;, and promoting other right wing agendas, months and months post election?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part seems pretty accurate. Far too much submission to the current power structure. This has never happened at r/conspiracy before. And it shouldn&#39;t be happening now.</p>

<p>Wake up! This sub has been infiltrated and usurped by r/the_donald and other alt-right trolls, </p>

<p>Probably, but this is just the type of thing that would polarize more. And more polarization will dumb down the sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and is no longer a heaven for free thinking, nonpartisan, skeptical, truth seekers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be repaired -- and it probably will eventually -- when people recognize that Donald Trump is and always was a tool of the powerful -- and a member of that club front he outset. Of course, the longer it takes, the more difficult it will be to reverse course and take action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>RIP r/conspiracy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sub will live on. We may just have to rummage through far more nonsense than we are used to. :)</p>

I believe the Jews at the top don&#39;t hate you Gentiles; they just don&#39;t give a fuck about whether you live or die. I don&#39;t feel that way. Trust me. I don&#39;t hate Gentiles.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. It&#39;s really not about the small putz. I think the Jewish women&#39;s hatred of men stems from the fact that Jewish men treat Jewish women like absolute shit. They do. They cheat on their wives. Jewish women have to live with this abomination. Jewish women are treated like shit by their husbands.  So, what do Jewish women do in retaliation? They cheat on their husbands. They fuck Schwartzes with huge putzes to piss off their small dick husbands. And, do you now what ? The husbands don&#39;t care. A Jewish husband doesn&#39;t care that his wife just got schlonged by a twelve inch black putz. They don&#39;t care. That is why Kushner doesn&#39;t care that Trump makes sexual over-tones to his wife, Ivanka. What do you make of that? Kushner hates  Ivanka.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No thank you! Your own post activity shows you are not a net loss. </p>

<p>Maybe if you actually posted sometimes, I would actually consider what you say, but this just looks like concern trolling. I am sorry this sub isn&#39;t as partisan in the same way rest of reddit has become, but you could always try to change it by posting here even a TINY BIT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;d like to have a real dialogue, I&#39;m open man. The post is a legitimate concern of mine... not meant to troll, but a very concerning development has occurred in this sub over the past year. This is what pulled me out of my lurker status, and I felt I had to speak up. </p>

<p>I do see you are a frequent and active the_donald guy, which is fine, I don&#39;t care who you support politically. And that&#39;s my point, I just wish others like you, would leave that shit at the door and come to this sub with a open mind to discuss and seek truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, sure!</p>

<p>I used to go to TD, but I haven&#39;t posted there since around the end of the election. I might have shared a link or two there since but I don&#39;t remember exactly when. I don&#39;t see a use for it at the moment.</p>

<p>I like to have my ideas challenged, and this is the closest sub I have found that actually has a fair amount of balance. I actually DON&#39;T like the political topics on this sub though, because I personally prefer to read about the more fringe topics. Stuff like historical conspiracies, other dimensional beings, hollow earth/antarctica, fringe science, or basically stuff you would expect to find in an HP Lovecraft novel. </p>

<p>The political stuff all feels like there is concerted motivation and goal to manipulate the conspiracy community to try and effect culture. This is true about both sides of the aisle. A great majority of it has a seriously disingenuous vibe to it, and either side will flip their stances as it becomes convenient. If Trump came out tomorrow and said &quot;Climate change is real and a serious problem&quot; I would gamble both sides would be doing cartwheels trying to claim the opposing sides positions just to maintain their team sport.</p>

<p>I also have a complete distrust in the Media and Intelligence Agencies, so I find a lot of current events, as they are reported, to be lacking in honesty because of the way they are framed or because of the information they omit. </p>

<p>I would prefer to not talk about politics at all, but when I see something that comes off as deceitful or reductive, I feel motivated to complain. The reality is this sub is CONSTANTLY being astroturfed by both political sides. There are also users who consistently argue in favor or against certain political &quot;conspiracies&quot;, and I genuinely trust that they are NOT shills. I am not going to name names, but I see the same people day in and day out defending the same ideas consistently. On the other hand, there are users who literally come here just to stir up shit, and there are multiple subs that are dedicated to ridiculing and attacking this sub that also direct users this way. If you are genuine, I am sorry to group you in with them, but you should know that is a very real phenomenon. </p>

<p>If you care about the direction of this sub, I just suggest you should comment a bit more. The really good stuff here is rarely in links. The comment section is where the real good stuff is hiding. Join the party!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your openness, seems we have a lot more in common than is contrary, and likewise I&#39;m sorry to have lumped you in with the aforementioned Donald &quot;trolls&quot;. I&#39;ll take a closer look within this sub to see the alternate side, so far the political astroturfing seems heavily weighted from the right (not to say reddit as a whole and r/politics isn&#39;t the exact opposite).
I agree,
there is no reason to believe the intelligence community is being straight with the executive branch, the executive branch is clearly not doing so with the media, and the media is being anything but honest with the public... but when public opinions in posts on a conspiracy Reddit are also compromised... I just don&#39;t know anymore ha, the absurdity is beyond me, and I&#39;m simply expressing my dissatisfaction with this development.
I&#39;ll take your advice and comment more, I&#39;ve always been more of an observer here, but it seems beneath the snide comments, are still some people who just want to know wtf is going on.</p>
