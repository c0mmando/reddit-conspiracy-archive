<p>No, what I&#39;m saying is Hillary has been doing illegal shit and has been untouched never investigated before Trump ever considered running for Prez.</p>

<p>In terms of &quot;Russian&quot; connections, its all made up cold war 2.0 scapegoat&#39;ism whipping boy</p>

<p>Look at all these people admitting there is no Russian evidence</p>

<p>&quot;them&quot; was literally wikileaks, and still no one is in jail, no one is in court, nothing else being done</p>

<p>She did intervene. It all came out via wikileaks which she had no control over, but the DOJ and FBI which both should have acted, didn&#39;t lift a finger</p>

<blockquote>
<p>World renowned journalist Seymour Hersh has revealed, in a series of interviews and books, that the Obama Administration falsely blamed the government of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad for the sarin gas attack that Obama was trying to use as an excuse to invade Syria.
As Eric Zuesse explained in Strategic Culture, Hersh pointed to a report from British intelligence saying that the sarin that was used didn’t come from Assad’s stockpiles. Hersh also said that a secret agreement in 2012 was reached between the Obama Administration and the leaders of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, to set up a sarin gas attack and blame it on Assad so that the US could invade and overthrow Assad.
“By the terms of the agreement, funding came from Turkey, as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar; the CIA, with the support of MI6, was responsible for getting arms from Gaddafi’s arsenals into Syria.”
Hersh didn’t say whether these ‘arms’ included the precursor chemicals for making sarin which were stockpiled in Libya, explains Zuesse in his report. But there have been multiple independent reports that Libya’s Gaddafi possessed such stockpiles, and also that the US Consulate in Benghazi Libya was operating a “rat line” for Gaddafi’s captured weapons into Syria through Turkey.
The importance of Saudi Arabia’s role in funding Clinton is tremendous, as the Syria/Saudi relationship over the last half century is what this civil war is all about.
A Zuesse points out in his article on Strategic Culture, when the interviewer asked Hersh why Obama is so obsessed with replacing Assad in Syria, since “The power vacuum that would ensue would open Syria up to all kinds of jihadi groups”; and Hersh replied that not only he, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “nobody could figure out why.” He said, “Our policy has always been against him [Assad]. Period.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To informed analysts, the Clinton Foundation appears to be a rogue charity that has neither been organized nor operated lawfully from inception in October 1997 to date--as you will grow to realize, it is a case study in international charity fraud, of mammoth proportions.
In particular, the Clinton Foundation has never been validly authorized to pursue tax-exempt purposes other than as a presidential archive and research facility based in Little Rock, Arkansas. Moreover, its operations have never been controlled by independent trustees and its financial results have never been properly audited by independent accountants.

<p>Charles - when will you be posting the first exhibit? look forward to it. thanks</p>

<p>Charles, I have years of audit experience and welcome your hard work. I am investigating whether Osama Bin Laden contributed to the Clinton Foundation through his Saudi network in exchange for his life. Would you have any evidence to support this?</p>

<p>Any update? It is well over a month since Sept 7. When will the exhibits be posted?</p>

<p>Jesus I forgot this too - I mean hell - Clinton was forwarding her top aide in the foundation, and she was forwarding to her husband, classified material, with the bullshit excuse to &quot;print&quot; - right - that&#39;s why weiner has 650,000 emails saved on his laptop, with his &quot;trusted staff&quot; - jesus </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the Clinton Foundation, the Saudi Arabian government has donated between $10m (£8m) and $25million since the foundation was set up in 1997. Last month it was reported the government of Qatar offered to donate $1m to the foundation in celebration of Bill Clinton’s birthday.</p>

<p>Rajiv Fernando was a kind stranger who, in 2011, thanks to the kindness of Clinton senior aide Cheryl Mills, ended up as a kind stranger in a strange land—or at least strange from the perspective of everyone else on International Security Advisory Board (ISAB).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the ISAB’s portfolio is to provide advice on “arms control, disarmament, nonproliferation, international security, and related aspects of public diplomacy.” Fernando? He was a Democratic Party donor who had “given up to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation.”
As the Washington Examiner notes, it took a Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens United to shakeout the emails that revealed the “scramble” by Clinton’s aides when ABC News asked for Fernando’s resume.
Prostituting the State Department isn’t a sly joke—it’s unethical, it’s a national disgrace and it’s probably criminal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Due Process is a joke now... no longer a right even outside civil courts. I remember reading about an alleged murderer who has been in prison for years and they still haven&#39;t has jis2 trial.  His attorney claims it&#39;s because they have no case so they keep kicking ot down the calendar so he stays on prison.  His life is ruined ans he never even had a trial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how much of that I believe. </p>

<p>If the accused knows he is innocent and can not afford bail which I am guessing since he is still waiting for trial.</p>

<p>The state will try to dick around and constantly continue the case to gather more evidence because they feel the accused is guilty and they don&#39;t have a strong enough case. Any competent defense attorney will pull the &quot;right to a fast and speedy trial&quot; and the case will be heard in three months. Hardly ever can the prosecution keep pushing a case if the defense wants the trial. </p>

<p>Most likely the guy is guilty and the defense attorney is building his case and also allowing time to go by so evidence/testimony will diminish in trial. </p>

<p>Basically if the defense wants a speedy trial the defense will get one. Dragging the case on longer is a defense strategy to weaken the states case as time goes on. </p>

<p>This does not apply for civil not criminal</p>
