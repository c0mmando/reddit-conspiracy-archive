    <div class="md"><p>Here is how. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1NHIjSw.png">For simplicity let&#39;s compare a flat earth with a pentagonal earth.</a></p>

<p>We have two observers some distance apart, A and B. Both observers measure the angle between the surface and the sun at the same time. On both planets, observer A finds the angle is 90<sup>o,</sup> meaning the sun is directly overhead.</p>

<p>On the flat earth, observer B measures an angle greater than 0<sup>o,</sup> but less than 90<sup>o,</sup> depending on the distance between the sun and observer A. The smaller the distance, the smaller the angle.</p>

<p>On the pentagonal earth, observer B notes that the sun is halfway set, meaning the angle is 0<sup>o.</sup> If the earth was flat, this would mean the distance between observer A and the sun would also have to be zero. Clearly observer A is not touching the sun, so the distance has to be non-zero. The only way this could be true is if the surface the observers are standing on is not a flat plane.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t have to do any maths at all to disprove the idea that their earth is flat.</p>

Or why the sun and moon would be round, but we wouldn&#39;t be. They can&#39;t explain why the sun rises over the horizon. The entire theory is basically based on calling the vast amount of pictures taken of earth fake. And it assumes that in this crazy world, where all these countries can barely get along, that everybody would come together to lie to us about the shape of the earth. Why the hell would they do that?

<p>The evidence has been produced and ignored.  Eratosthenes and  Aryabhata experimentally proved the curvature of the Earth centuries ago.  Thousands of photographs of the Earth from numerous space institutions demonstrate the Earth to be a sphere.  Lunar eclipses, the Belt of Venus as well as the visible spherical shape of all other planets as well as the moon help demonstrate that the Earth is spherical.</p>

<p>The reason the debate still exists is because of the erosion of the educational system in the Western world as well as the mistrust people have in the government due to the absolute failure in providing a decent society for their citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can absolutely refute flat earth for sure, lumping it in with 9/11 just discredits 9/11 more as well as other legitimate conspiracies, if you take a picture of the North Star each night and then played them over multiple nights the stars would seem to rotate, and if you did the same thing on the opposite hemisphere they appear to rotate the opposite way, this wouldn&#39;t work on a flat earth model, also it is not true that toilets go the other way on other hemispheres because they are powered to go whichever way the manufacturer intended, but in a controlled experiment draining water from pools on opposite sides of the earth leads to opposite rotation when draining the pools, this also doesn&#39;t work on a flat earth model since everything should rotate the same no matter where you are on earth or no rotation at all.

<p>My point here is that for every single argument against the flat earth (like the ones you outlined above) someone who is a flat earth believer will issue you a counter argument, and the debate roars on. It cannot be truly ended until a private citizen, not a government or corporation, and with air-tight oversight sends a craft up high enough to show the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple answer. I&#39;ll quote a couple of comments I made a while ago:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/nqEuGAx.png">Is this a flat plane, or a circle?</a></p>

<p>It sure looks like a flat plane, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/LNWZ09C.png">But no, it is a small part of a much larger circle.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the second comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is another look at the reality of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/wusLVpP.png">This image is scaled so that one pixel represents a box with sides that are three miles long.</a></p>

<p>At the very top is a tiny red dot. That dot represents the height of Mt Everest (2 pixels/6 miles - Everest is actually 5.5 miles high).</p>

<p>I have zoomed the dot so you can get an idea of the relative scale. Our planet is so big, even the tallest mountain is nothing but a tiny dot on its surface.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you can&#39;t see the curve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry? Atmospheric magnification accounts for why only part of a giant smokestack is visible?</p>

<p>That video was made by a fucking idiot.</p>

<p>First he shows the clip where <em>more</em> of the skyline becomes visible,  then claims this is how <em>less</em> of the sun becomes visible. That is stupid beyond words.</p>

<p>The point of the clip is that items below the horizon become visible because the light coming from them is bent around the earth. This happens to the sun as well - when the bottom edge of the sun touches the horizon, the sun is already below it.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/kogzb12.png">Here is how that works</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ll note that the sun appears to be <em>higher</em> in the sky than it is, not <em>lower</em>, because as he repeats several times, the light is being bent downwards.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/lhXfaYc.png">Here is what he claims is happening when the sun sets</a></p>

<p>Here we see the sun is higher in the sky than it appears to be because the light is being bent <em>upwards</em> not downwards, which is the complete opposite of what he admits happens.</p>

<p>This guy is such a fucking idiot he proves himself wrong.</p>

<p>Now every man and his grandmother can make a video and upload it with nothing more than a cheap smartphone.</p>

<p>There is also the effect of critical mass and exponential growth. As more people are exposed to the belief and share their view, there are more sources for other people to be exposed to it, so it spreads faster. 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, 4 becomes 8, and so on.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing. Facts don&#39;t give a shit about flat earth theorists, nobody is going to hand whatever the hell a &quot;popular flat earther with influnce&quot; is a rocket with great optics. They cost money. Lots and lots of money. What we have in the world now is NUMEROUS accounts, from private citizens and organizations stating that the earth is NOT FLAT. But we still have loons who think the earth is flat and people I dunno, fucking fall off the side and nobody ever hears about it or discusses it? There are no corners, there are no edges, that&#39;s why there are no pictures of them, that&#39;s why there&#39;s nobody who says &quot;I&#39;VE BEEN TO THE EDGE&quot; because if they did we might have a debate. What flat earthers are presented with are cold hard facts and like the petulant children they are, they will stick their fingers in their ears and scream &quot;PHOTOSHOP AND CORPORATIONS&quot; without having a shred of evidence to back themselves up with. </p>

<p>Simply put that&#39;s why there&#39;s no debate, there is no proof for the earth being flat and tons of proof for it being a sphere. Nobody is going to take you seriously if you seriously believe the earth is flat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard people mention the religious angle and I&#39;ve seen a couple of graphics showing what they claim is described in various religious texts. Question for you, and I&#39;m asking honestly. If the FE theory rests on descriptions from ancient religious texts, why has this theory had such a surge in just the past couple of years? It&#39;s like it came out of nowhere. Counterintelligence program meant to poison the conspiracy well? I&#39;m seriously curious. You&#39;d think this would have been all over the Internet since its inception. </p>

<p>It only appears that way because even morons can use YouTube and reddit etc. Relatively speaking, the same amount of morons a spreading this belief... they just have far more effective means to do it now.</p>

<p>Remember, You Tube and reddit have only been around for just over a decade.</p>
