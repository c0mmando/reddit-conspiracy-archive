        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s say powerful occult societies do indeed literally eat children in their rituals - &quot;Satan isn&#39;t real&quot; then means jackshit, doesn&#39;t it? (Not saying they do that 100%, but there&#39;s some weird circumstantial evidence)</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what you believe in, it matters what they believe in! If they believe that doing these rituals has some useful effect for them, responding with &quot;but he&#39;s not real!&quot; is outright ridiculous and just an attempt to squelch discussion, really.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like responding to Islamist terror by saying &quot;but I don&#39;t believe in the Hadiths!&quot; - yeah, so what?</p>

<p>Also, how do you know the entity (not even necessarily the literal Biblical variant of it, but something like it) doesn&#39;t exist? These folks are way more into their occult stuff than 99% of the people who have a mainstream-religion are into their faith. Yet these elite-occultists have top-access to the most prestigious scientific institutions of the planet - and it only made them even more occult. Maybe they KNOW something about the nature of the universe that you don&#39;t?</p>

<p>Is the current materialist ideology &quot;there was nothing, it exploded, and all matter and laws of nature got squelched out of that exploding nothing&quot; really the be-it-all-end-it-all?</p>

<p>Looking without bias at it, it isn&#39;t that much more &quot;logical&quot; than any other esoteric explanation (theistic creation, holographic universe, universe being a dream of some creature, computer-simulation etc.)</p>

<p>Fact, you don&#39;t know for sure. If elite billionaires are into occult this much, it&#39;s worth researching why.</p>

<p>And that they are into it, is quite obvious. Look at the materials at vigilant citizen for examples. If you say all the occult material in music videos and fashion for example (not to mention &quot;elite&quot; events, like the opening of the Swiss tunnel) is just &quot;youth rebellion&quot; and to shock the audience then you&#39;re clearly wrong. The vast majority of this stuff goes way over the stereotypical Bible-belt Baptist parents. They wouldn&#39;t even notice all the Baphomet-handsigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. To turn it the other way, religious people of all backgrounds do crazy things.</p>

<p>Saying God is not real is not even an argument.</p>

<p>And I hate how people say that Satanists do not believe in Satan. While that may be true of some sects, there are definitely occult sects that worship Satan.</p>

<p>These people are victims of the deception themselves.  &#39;I don&#39;t see it so it must not be so&#39;.  Just like low-level freemasons, they can&#39;t see that they are cover for the true believers at the head of the organisation.</p>

<p>The deception is so well perpetrated at this stage now, saying the devil is real is a joke to most people.  </p>

<p>Active denial and cognitive dissonance are sympthoms of mental incapacitation / illness.</p>

<p>This phenomenom can affect any kind of person. Many americans for example are denying that the US. Government is absolute evil and the Mainstream Media is lying all the time because otherwise the fictional world that exists in their minds would collapse and their fake personalities would be destroyed.</p>

<p>The film &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) is a very good example of how exactly this works. &quot;Red pill or blue pill&quot;.</p>

<p>Read about what Aleister Crowley taught. These things are discussed frequently in this sub if you&#39;re looking for information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is a serious and non-facetious question, I&#39;m willing to answer it but from a much more narrow starting point. The &quot;why&quot; can be answered from any angle: historical, scientific, spiritual, societal, philosophical, moral, personal, you name it. What makes it &#39;more&#39; truthful? The sincere answer is that you can&#39;t have multiple &quot;truths&quot; espoused by religion. People try to state that religions are all different variations of the same theme or a path to the same place, but that&#39;s just ignorant. That&#39;s saying they&#39;re just stories that conflict one another. Similarly, they can&#39;t all be true because that&#39;s equivalent to saying that there are dozens of simultaneous alternate realities based on each religion, and if there are there i haven&#39;t heard of anyone who has experienced such a thing.</p>

<p>The real answer to your question is that to know the truth you need to actually seek it. Not taking the lazy way out of &quot;acceptance&quot; and &quot;tolerance&quot; which is a cousin of apathy; but a true thirst and desire to search for the objective truth, search for goodness, and to ask the right source for it.</p>

But seeing it as occult is a as much a bias as seeing it without the occult. 
I&#39;ve argued on this sub often that we should focus on the theories and back them up with unbiased, unpartison, and secular evidence and inquiry so that all people will pay the same attention in an attempt to avoid as much bias as possible.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not &quot;disproving&quot; anything. I never aim to do that. I think that the inclusion of the supernatural in conspiracy theory is what gives these theories the bad light they have. The ultimate goal here is to informa and wake up as many people as necessary, by removing those from the preview image we open up to more people, then you can present the supernatural side, once they buy into the physical. I&#39;ve never sought to disprove anything, Im just arguing that if we take the supernatural aspects out of the initial presentation more people will be able to accept these theories. Also, full disclosure, I don&#39;t believe in the supernatural.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re looking for is the <strong>Cult of Saturn.</strong>  That&#39;s the black cube symbology, pedo/human sacrifice, death culture.

<p>Research the Black Cube &amp; you will find it uniformly placed in cultural centers all over the world. It is the underlying element that binds the big 3 religions. Look into Stanley Kubrick &amp; the Saturn Cult. The info is there, but most people don&#39;t see how it&#39;s just slightly left of what they think they&#39;re looking for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. All 3 Abrahamic religions were co-opted by Archons.</p>

<p>The ones running all 3 now are the Khazarian bloodlines, and the most powerful group among them are the Jesuits - who are in direct contact with Archons through blood ritual. </p>

<p>With this system they are able to be both sides in every conflict. In essence, ever major war is a proxy war... and every war is begun as a false-flag within this system.</p>

<p>Well, the basis of my info is a little out there for some, but I&#39;m referring to &#39;ascension&#39; and the evolution of consciousness. <a href="http://prepareforchange.net/the-event/">This</a> goes into what I think is about to happen to the whole planet. We&#39;re going through the &#39;shift&#39; now... I&#39;m also a big proponent of ET disclosure and many other &#39;bottom of the rabbit hole&#39; stuff, and much of my information comes from direct contact with my spirit guides (which many have a hard time understanding to be sure).</p>

<p>Name&#39;s not a reference to anything particular, just amused me for some reason, and also a little mysterious too. ::</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, considering there are more than 7 billion people in the world (off the top of my head) and most towns have more than 8500 people, Lucifer must be pretty damn powerful. If we zapped those 8500 people out of existence, what would change? Considering all the child pedophiles in prison, way more than 8500, and so many more not in prison, it makes me wonder what Lucifer or any religion has to do with it.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s actually all those Christians trying to blame everything on Lucifer! Since they worship Mars, the god of war. </p>

<p>The diversity of the world would be reduced by its wealthiest pedo subculture.  The actual difference to practical facts-of-life would be up to differences in governing, but people who aren&#39;t used to controlling children recreationally are much less controlling generally, so you could expect a regime of deregulation and reduced government expenditures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan was just a rebel freedom fighter according to the Jews who seen God as an evil tyrant who tried to control the human race through communism.</p>

<p>but as history goes , the Jews were thrown out of Babylon because of their evil ways .</p>

<p>those evil ways were idol worship , child sacrifice and sexual promiscuity .</p>

<p>lets start with the idol worship . the devils idol , the Baphomet .  and the instructions on how to preform rituals to it were handed to the Jews by Satan himself , it was The Devil who taught the Jews magic , esoterics , Kundalini etc ..  how ever , man being man took this scripture and made a mockery out of it , twisting it to his own devices . this is where the Devil failed , he gave man knowledge to bring him to the hights of the Gods but man thought he could do better thinking &quot;the devil gave us the secrets now lets put a human tint on them&quot; a &quot;stamp&quot; if you will , not the Devils magic any more but a bastardization of it. this is what got them kicked out of Babylon .</p>

<p>down through the ages this knowledge got passed from one tribe to another and each time it did the tribe put its own stamp onto it so it is not recognizable as its original form .</p>

<p>Satan was not worshiped . not in the beginning or today , it was once Baphomet , then Ba&#39;al (all 7 of them) , some of the the Jewish tribes  went on to worship the celestial bull and other idols but the one thing at the core stayed , sacrifice and inbreeding , it is from the inbreeding that we find the eating of human flesh within the occult .
inbreeding makes people think they are either super human or less than human ( sub human) those who think they are better than human do not have the blood craving as the sub human inbred&#39;s , </p>

<p>the sub human think if they consume human flesh they will become more human as the DNA they consume will fix theirs and they will be normal like every one else .</p>

<p>it is these same inbred bloodlines we find at the core of the elite and rulers of the world , these people have a superiority complex but at the same time also have an inferiority complex and it is this complex that drives them to kill and consume the flesh of a sacrificed human , this is usually a boy or girl aged between 2 and 12 , once puberty starts a human is not fit for sacrifice as they are now unclean .</p>

<p>the esoterica behind this is powerful to them as a child of that age is said to be at their most connected to god by way of sexual innocents  and this makes their blood more powerful .</p>

<p>over the past decade the elite have started a shift in belief and have added into it sex magic from India and Bolivia/peru as they know their heritage from their Jewish bloodlines came from the Devil and seek to shun this off as the Devil is no longer a friend to them .</p>

<p>so to call what they do &quot;satanic&quot; is false , it was in the beginning but over the past 10 thousand years  it became nothing more than a bastardization of what was once supernatural esoterica handed to them by their Lucifer ( he brought the light of truth ) he was their light bringer of knowledge and now he shuns them , hows that for a slap in the face ? God doesn&#39;t want them and nor does the Devil :)</p>
