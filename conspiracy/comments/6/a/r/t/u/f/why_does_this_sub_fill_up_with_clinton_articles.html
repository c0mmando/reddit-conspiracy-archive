    <div class="md"><p>I think the difference is Trump has officially been a politician for 6 months. It&#39;s going to take some time to have any sort of equal ground with other politicians conspiracy wise. It doesn&#39;t help that the biggest &quot;conspiracy&quot; about him is being pushed relentlessly by the MSM, which by default makes most people question it who know that the MSM is owned by a small number of corporations with obvious partisanship towards the DNC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spicey came out and was showing off wall construction (never mind it was not what he was saying it was).

<p>lol you must have never read about Trump before that. His entire life is a long line of corruption and conspiracy. Bankruptcies? Polish immigrants building Trump Tower and not being paid (until a court forced him to do so)? Multiple sexual assault allegations? Racial Housing Discrimination? Trump University? Ties to the Mafia? Raping his wife? Being forced out of the casino business for corruption? Defrauding investors? Corey Lewandowski? Not paying contractors for their work? Trump Institute plagiarized textbooks? Using campaign funds to buy up $55k of his own books? Illegal immigrant models? Everything having to do with the Trump Foundation? Trump businesses operating in Cuba for decades before the embargo was lifted?</p>

<p>You must have never read a single thing about Trump before he was president. </p>

<p>Maybe my comment came off that way but I have no doubt he&#39;s involved with conspiracies. Then again what rich people aren&#39;t?</p>

<p>We had 2 very shitty candidates in the end and one was much more corrupt than the other. Never want corrupt politicians to be held accountable? Involve a Clinton.

    <div class="md"><p>Not like I post the articles but here&#39;s my take.<br/>
There&#39;s absolute proof that Clinton is corrupt, and is in collusion with the mainstream media via the Wikileaks leaks.<br/>
Whereas, the mainstream media (aka CIA, via Operation Mockingbird, AND they are allowed to feed Americans Propaganda, blatant lies) whom was in bed with Clinton prior to Trump being president, points to me that the CIA really wanted Clinton to be president.  </p>

<p>I doubt the Trump/Russia Narrative is real (Very likely propaganda). We have seen zero proof (except all of this stage play), but we have tons of stuff about the Clintons, therefore, more articles. Also, bad PR about Trump, that&#39;s all there has been since before he was president and it hasn&#39;t changed. Where was all this PR for Obama the bomber?</p>

<p>Watch Clinton Cash if you haven&#39;t. That&#39;s a good place to start.</p>

<p>Not that Trump or Clinton being president really matters. Two sides of the same coin and all that.  </p>

<p>Propaganda being allowed on the citizens (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5">http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5</a>  just one article about it)<br/>
along with Operation Mockingbird to misguide the public.<br/>
My 2 cents.<br/>
Have a good day.</p>

<p>Why does this sub fill up with Clinton articles every. single. fucking. time there&#39;s bad PR about Trump?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>nah mate, you are mistakenly drawing parallels:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>every day</strong>, there is &quot;bad PR about Trump&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>every day</strong>, there are &quot;Clinton articles&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>you might as well be asking:  why is it that when the sun comes up... does this sub fill with &quot;Clinton articles&quot; ?</p>

<p>it&#39;s a totally absurd association.</p>
