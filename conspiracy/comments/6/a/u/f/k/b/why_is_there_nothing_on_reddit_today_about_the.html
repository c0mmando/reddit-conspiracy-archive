<p>I saw one from someone who worked at the Nissan car plant in the UK, that maybe shut down production... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that this is being <em>promoted</em> as huge (and it may well in fact be huge).</p>

<p>But forgive me if I&#39;m skeptical (I lived through Y2K after all) and want to see a story -- a <em>personal</em> story  -- from ten or more people who have personally had their health histories eliminated.</p>

<p>Not trying to be cantankerous, but, again, &#39;evidence&#39; from &#39;news agencies&#39; or even &#39;companies issuing mandates in response&#39; is not the same as anecdotal evidence from mutiple sources.</p>

<p>Plenty of companies reacted -- erroneously it turns out -- to Y2K hype.</p>

<p>I&#39;m waiting to see if this is just more of that.</p>

A few errors that resulted in no real damage - I don&#39;t think you realize what y2k was purported to be(the end of the digital world basically with massive damage/outages). With the exception of the HSBC cards, which wasn&#39;t actually on the switch over off 1999-2000, it was 3 days prior - which indicates to me that it was actually a problem caused by them taking measures against that they probably didn&#39;t even need to take.</p>

<p>But forgive me if I&#39;m skeptical (I lived through Y2K after all) and want to see a story -- a personal story -- from ten or more people who have personally had their health histories eliminated.</p>

<p>Not trying to be cantankerous, but, again, &#39;evidence&#39; from &#39;news agencies&#39; or even &#39;companies issuing mandates in response&#39; is relatively meaningless given all we know about control of media and corporate interests these days. </p>

<p>Personal stories from multiple people who have <em>personally</em> had their health records tampered with.</p>

<p>Not companies and media working in collusion to hype up an &#39;event&#39;. Sorry, I&#39;m quite skeptical of this whole thing.</p>

<p>The only thing I&#39;ve seen so far about the Hospital is 2nd hand info, that a dudes heart surgery was canceled.
But I haven&#39;t looked specifically for examples.</p>

<p>The reports are saying that so far, No patients files have been compromised that they know of. The doctors just cannot access any. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if info has changed since I have been squirrely on other topics. :)   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just stupid. I checked the top thread from this week and it was about Trump firing Comey. One of the highest upvoted comments, and most of the comments that followed, claimed there was an ulterior motive for Trump firing Comey (covering up a conspiracy with Russia.)</p>

<p>The most upvoted comment claimed &quot;paid shills are downvoting this juicy conspiracy.&quot; </p>

<p>Another top comment was deleted, but I recovered it. It claims the FBI are going to start leaking dirt on Trump to the press.</p>

<p>How are paid shills downvoting the most upvoted thread for the whole week? In fact, this thread is ranked number 52 in top threads of all time for this sub. </p>

<p>The bullshit narrative you are pushing has been officially debunked. </p>

The reality is that XP can be patched for this exploit using the POSReady 2009 patch. Just takes a very simple registry change.<br/>
And the vast majority of XP users on the planet (patched or unpatched) won&#39;t be affected by the exploit.</p>

<p>I worked at a hospital from 99 - 2010 and while they loved using the fancy computers they also filled out paper forms for patient folders.  So, all you&#39;d have to do is enter the data once the computers were back up and you&#39;d be all set.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will begin by saying that I am as skeptical of the NSA as anyone, and I am aware of their crimes and think many people in the organization should be punished. However, I find your assertion that the NSA should be held accountable a bit odd, so I have some questions to further investigate why you think that. I mean this in good faith, and I&#39;m not attacking you personally for your opinions. I just want to know more.</p>

<p>Would you blame a gun manufacturer if someone murders someone else with a gun? Or a knife manufacturer if someone murders someone with a knife? Moving away from weapons, would you blame a spray paint company if someone defaces someone else&#39;s house or a public building?</p>

<p>It seems odd that you are only calling for the NSA to be held accountable for this. Why not the people who perpetrated the attack? Why not the people who stole or leaked the tool? Why not the people who gave the tool to the hackers? </p>

<p>Again, I agree that the NSA has avoided accountability and people in the organization need to be jailed. It just seems like blaming the NSA for something they didn&#39;t do is over simplifying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds strange. A huge ransomware attack, affecting 57,000 users across 78-99 countries and the only news source reporting it was Britain, a country that can&#39;t get a fair deal with the EU for leaving and future trade deals. Sounds like a way to scare people into doing something or wanting to know what people do.</p>

<p>Reminds me of Gotham Shield during the NK tensions rising that, probably, would&#39;ve been useful for some EMP contingency but was primarily done in San Francisco and New York, areas that had already been &quot;hit&quot; during the 2016 election from a cyber attack. Seems like a repeat of yesteryear.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a few others that&#39;s been in the news recently, they ring a similar bell. I wasn&#39;t saying that was used that way but it does jump into my mind a lot. I do believe Nigel Farange believes that Marcon is the EU&#39;s poster boy and would potentially try to void any good deal for the EU. What that entails from their agreements with the EU and their own individual trade agreements, I can&#39;t say.</p>
