<p>We&#39;re never going to get recordings.

<p>yes, and some use that to argue that there should be gun control laws.</p>

<p>The reality is that these laws do little to solve the problems they aim to fix (and voter fraud is already practically nonexistent issue). All they really do is take rights away from Americans. </p>

<p>I posted a bunch of links to some scholarly articles on voter suppression in another comment, you might wanna check them out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I&#39;m calling bullshit on this right now.</p>

<p>Voter ID is voter suppression? How? ELI5 please. And don&#39;t give me this bullshit about some voters might not be able to go to the voter ID place, where ever that might be, to get their ID. Or some other bullshit about how some people might not be able to afford it. And here&#39;s why I won&#39;t accept one of those bullshit answers. If a state passed a voter ID law, and gave the residents of the state 2-4 years to obtain said ID free of charge, and you don&#39;t get one in time to vote, then that&#39;s your fucking problem. You had two years or more to go get something that wasn&#39;t gonna cost you a dime.</p>

<p>And registration dates? Basically the same thing. It&#39;s on you to know registration and voting deadlines. It&#39;s not anyone else&#39;s fault but your own that you waited until the last minute to try and get shit done. You had weeks and sometimes months, depending where you live, to submit your voter registration. Just because you waited until the last day, 15 minutes before registration ends is your fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Because their excuses for not having a voter ID are bullshit and make no logical sense. The only people that are &quot;disenfranchised&quot; by voter ID laws are people that aren&#39;t supposed to be voting in our elections anyhow. So I fail to see the problem.</p>

<p>The only reason people have an issue with voter ID is it goes a long way to ensure that non-citizens can&#39;t vote, that dead people can&#39;t vote, that underage people can&#39;t vote, etc. Notice all those people aren&#39;t legally allowed to vote. So what&#39;s the problem with requiring an ID to vote that those people shouldn&#39;t legally be allowed to get anyhow?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So non-citizens, who may not even live in this country, have a constitutional right to vote in our elections. That&#39;s what you&#39;re saying? So in theory, if someone from Japan is here on vacation, on election day, should be allowed to get in line and cast a vote. Maybe take a selfie afterwards. Showing off their &quot;I Voted&quot; sticker, while wearing an American flag T-shirt like our elections are some fucking tourist attraction. That&#39;s what you&#39;re saying? Somehow I doubt that you would be ok with that.</p>

<p>Look I know that example I gave was a little extreme. But in the current state of affairs, its possible. Call me crazy, but even one single vote that is cast illegally is a threat to the integrity of our elections.</p>

<p>And gun control laws, by in large, are a bunch of bullshit too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice way to assume I feel a certain way about something that I didn&#39;t even mention. Good on you. For the record, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s necessarily widespread voter fraud.</p>

<p>With that said, I never said anything about earning a right to vote. I too believe that people have the intrinsic human right to vote. What I don&#39;t believe in is allowing people from a foreign country a voice in our election.</p>

<p>By your logic, if some Russian was in our country on vacation during the election cycle, they should be allowed to vote. Simply because they happen to be here at the time. You wanna talk about Russian efforts to subvert our elections? if we did things the way you propose they wouldn&#39;t even have to hide their actions. There could potentially be worldwide movements to come to the United States and cast a vote for our elected officials. You&#39;re OK with that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All rights are subject to &quot;reasonable&quot; restrictions, according to the supreme court. That&#39;s why even though we have free speech, you can&#39;t just yell fire in a movie theater. That&#39;s why most gun control laws are one the books despite the fact that the 2nd Amendment itself has no restrictions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I don&#39;t see a problem with having to prove citizenship. When you have several instances in the constitution where citizen and voting are used in the same sentence, I think it&#39;s pretty clear. Only citizens right to vote is protected, and based on supreme court precedent, a reasonable restriction to ensure only citizens are voting is totally cool.</p>

<p>So ok. Perhaps the way some states have went about proving citizenship has been a little shitty. Perhaps even some racists fucks rigged the system. Can you at least agree that having to prove citizenship itself, not talking about implementation here, but just the requirement itself is &quot;reasonable.&quot;</p>

<p>That would imply that some Americans are more fit than others. But more than that, it implies they are less fit than all members of those countries which uniformly require IDs from their citizens.</p>

<p>While, I&#39;m not suggesting we require all people to carry ID at all times, such as some of those countries do, I am suggesting that the barriers which you feel important (lack of transport, education, funds) don&#39;t inhibit poorer countries with worse education and transport from carrying IDs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You invented this idea that other countries &quot;supply&quot; their citizens with IDs. That is bullshit. They need to get to the office and do everything we do, but often without our modern infrastructure.</p>

<p>If someone in Bangladesh is capable of getting to the DMV (or whatever their bureau is called), provide enough supporting evidence, the funds and must do so according to the law, then why in America is fit so hard?</p>

<p>So, going back to my original question which you asked me to ask in another way:</p>

<p>what is preventing Americans from doing so?</p>

<p>I did read some of the bullshit you provided. &quot;It costs $10&quot;. And yet...you would rather resist protection against voter fraud instead of petition for free birth certificates, or a free method of obtaining ID. And yet, in poorer countries, people manage to get IDs, so even that shouldn&#39;t be an obstacle.</p>

<p>Rural areas: my in-laws needed to take a carriage into town when one was available in order to get married. They needed to do the same to register their children and then again to get them IDs. What obstacle are Americans facing that prevents them from getting an ID?</p>

<p>You won&#39;t give an answer because you will sound like a psychopath.</p>

<p>My nephews are half-black, live in a rural area and have poor parents: they both have IDs in the US.</p>

<p>No, because I DID give an answer. Every single one of my articles answer your questions. It&#39;s not an easy &quot;black and white&quot; issue. Most issues are not black and white and you can not find the answer on a news station or in the MSM. You have to do a lot of good old fashioned research.</p>

<p>But here, let me make this easy for you. Here is a small section from a few of the articles, out of hundreds of pages.</p>

<p>from the first link:</p>

<p>&quot;Supporters of restrictive photo ID laws in Missouri downplay the num- ber of voters without the necessary identification and claim that because the state would issue photo identification to these people free of charge, the laws would not have an effect on Missourians’ ability to vote. This could not be further from the truth. While the state would cover the cost of the actual IDs, it would offer no assistance obtaining the documents required to obtain an ID,including birth certificates or marriage licenses.147 Women who have mar- ried, divorced, or have otherwise changed their names would be dispropor- tionately affected by these laws.148 Those currently lacking photo IDs are likely to be the people who would have the most difficulty obtaining one, including low-income Missourians, students, senior citizens, and people who rely on public transportation.149
Under stricter voter ID laws requiring a photo ID, those lacking the nec- essary identification would be required to find some form of transportation to and from the license office in addition to the required birth certificate or mar- riage license. Birth certificates cost $15,150 and official copies of marriage licenses cost about $9 or $10.151 The waiting period to obtain birth certifi- cates can be from six to eight weeks.152 For people who are barely scraping together enough money to feed their families, or senior citizens who live in nursing homes and have no access to transportation, these hurdles can be impossible to overcome. As Justice Souter noted in his dissent to Crawford, these additional travel costs and fees are “disproportionately heavy for, and thus disproportionately likely to deter, the poor, the old, and the immo- bile.”153 The right to vote is a basic and fundamental right in our state, and lawmakers should strive to make it easier for all citizens to participate in our democracy, not more difficult.&quot;</p>

<p>From the 2nd link:
&quot;
Further, all of our measures of state-level racial factors are significantly associated with a higher annual volume of proposed restrictive changes; more restrictive changes were proposed in states with higher minority turn- out, more African-American residents, higher scores on the measure of Anti- Black stereotyping, and states where minority turnout has increased in recent presidential elections. Using the definitions of very high and very low de- scribed above, the effects of these factors is as follows: a state with very high minority turnout in the previous election would be expected to see more than three additional restrictive proposals every two years, while a state with very low minority turnout would see essentially no additional proposals at- tributable to this factor. Similarly, it would be predicted that a state with a very large African-American population would experience four additional proposals every three years, while a state with a very small African-Ameri- can population would only see one additional proposal every five years. Last, the measure of Anti-Black stereotyping is strongly associated with a higher rate of proposal. A state with a very low score on this measure would be expected to propose four additional restrictive changes every two years, while a state with a very high score on this measure would be expected to propose an additional seven restrictions every two years.&quot;</p>

<p>from the 3rd link:</p>

<p>&quot;However, unlike recent efforts by Republican lawmak- ers to cut back on early voting days, Election Day registra- tion, or reducing the amount of time for completing voter registration drives, which provide little credible political cover and are easily viewed as blatant partisan power plays, restrictive voter ID legislation at least holds the appearance of ensuring the integrity of the voting process. Not only can these laws be framed as a valence issue— indeed, the GOP and their allies often try to frame the requirement to have voters show state-issued photo identi- fication at the polls as necessary to deter voter fraud—it also receives sizable success in the court of public opinion (Fund and von Spakovsky 2012; Wilson and Brewer 2013). In fact, as long as the majority of voters favor restrictive voter ID laws as a means to prevent fraud and hence protect the right to vote from potential political cor- ruption, Republicans have every incentive to continue pushing for such measures. Of course, perception and reality are two very different things in the partisan battle over restrictive voter ID laws. Despite the strong public support to the contrary, there simply is no widespread, concerted, and systematic evidence that some voters go to the polls impersonating someone else to cast a vote to ben- efit one of the political parties (Davidson 2009; Hasen 2012; Hood and Gillespie 2012; Wang 2012).
Our analysis of the introduction and adoption of voter ID legislation in the American states over the past decade moves beyond the truism that Republicans are generally supportive and Democrats generally opposed to placing restrictions on the identification needed to vote in person. Without question, underlying coalition-based party poli- tics goes a long way in helping us understand the evolu- tion of voter ID laws from a valence issue to a divisive partisan gambit exercised by Republicans across the country. The trumpeting of restrictive voter ID legisla- tion by the GOP, we argue, is an effort by the party to maintain its extant coalition and bolster its electoral competitiveness—at both the national and state levels. But “politics by other means” (Ginsberg and Shefter 2002) is not played in a vacuum. Republicans have not pursued this scorched-earth policy in all states, nor have they done so consistently over time. Rather, we show that a variety of factors at the state-level condition their effort to curtail the electorate by requiring more severe voter ID requirements. Notwithstanding the considerable litigation challenging their constitutionality, few other scholars (Bentele and O’Brien 2013 and Biggers and Hanmer 2013 being exceptions) have tried to systematically assess the enactment of voter ID laws at the macro-level, evaluating the evolution of this issue across states and over time.
As we have demonstrated in this study, restrictive voter ID laws have undergone a pronounced evolution. Early adopters of these laws barely registered on the political radar, and when they did, rarely was voter ID viewed through the prism of partisan politics. But in the new century, because of the different electoral impera- tives facing the Democratic and Republican parties, efforts to increase the costs associated with obtaining the proper identification for voting drew a crisp contrast in terms of how such a reform would affect the major par- ties’ political fortunes. Thus, we find that Democratic and Republican elites across the states have almost com- pletely polarized on an issue which seems very clear-cut with respect to its possible impact on voter participa- tion—disproportionately raising costs on social groups aligned with the Democratic Party—even if such costs are marginal at best.
This is the current arena in the contestation over restrictive voter ID laws, a forum where partisan elites are sharply divided over the matter. In contrast, besides those voters who have been directly affected by the implementation of the most restrictive voter ID laws in a handful of states, much of the American public has been slow to understand the dynamics undergirding the fight. But the current equilibrium is changing, as the vocal and high-profile partisan disagreement over the guiding pur- pose of voter ID laws penetrates the awareness of rank- and-file party identifiers.20 Similar to other instances where public opinion has polarized because of partisan division over a salient issue (Zaller 1992), the scope of conflict will inevitably expand (Schattschneider 1960), and we suspect that the party-in-the-electorate will begin to receive the message.&quot;</p>

<p>From the 8th link:</p>

<p>&quot;Voter ID laws are structured so that the decisions of poll workers are final and unappealable. For instance, in Hawaii, a poll worker can unilaterally request ID and, because the statute does not specify acceptable forms of ID except to require a photo and signature, arbitrarily decide the adequacy of the tendered ID.133 People without ID in Georgia and Tennessee may vote by casting provisional ballots then going to a local election office within a few days to show acceptable ID.134 However, local officials there are the lone, penultimate judges of whether the ID requirement is met and whether to count the ballot.135 Additionally, many voter ID laws, such as North Carolina’s new voter ID bill (HB 589), empower unappointed, private partisan groups of “election observers” to heedlessly challenge the eligibility of voters. HB 589 will allow up to ten “at-large observers”—an increase from two observers under the previous law—to freely roam county polling sites to challenge voters on Election Day.136&quot;</p>

<p>I can really only speak for America because this is pretty much the only country I have done in depth research on, when it comes to voter fraud and suppression. And in America, get an ID is not always easy, and in states with strict voter ID laws, having an ID does not guarantee that you will not be turned away for another irrelevant reason. It does not guarantee whether or not the state or county will designate voting stations in areas inaccessible to certain groups of people, and it does not guarantee that the state will allow the polling stations to be open at times that would be convenient for certain people.</p>

<p>Voter suppression is not just the requirement of an ID. There is much more to it.</p>

<p>so, YES--it&#39;s all a fucking distraction to allow the PentaCon to keep destroying the earth and plowing ahead, clearing the way for American Imperialism.</p>

<p>If your country has a US military base--then your country is NOT a soverign nation.  ALL US miliitary bases are FIEFDOMS--both for the generals and for the host country politicians.</p>

<p>NOTICE there aren&#39;t any articles revealing the PentaCon&#39;s swindles?</p>

<p>The result of Trump winning has been the biggest gift to WAR, INC. USA since 9/11...an extra $30 Billion for PentaCon budget in 2017...an extra $54 billion for PentaCon in 2018...keep the $1 trillion nuclear weapon swindle going...selling Patriot THAAD missile systems to South Korea, Poland, Romania...the F-35 swindle keeps going + possibly a second jet fighter to be funded as well (?)...Trump said he wants 350 ships for the Navy (currently at 280 or so) including increasing the number of aircraft carriers to 12 (or more)--China has 2 (built from refurbished Cold War era USSR ships, altho they are now building their first Chinese carrier from scratch)...US $29 billion for 200 cargo helicopters--to be funded (?)...ALL of this extra funding for WAR, INC. USA has gone unchecked by any opposition.</p>

Its all a breadcrumb trail leading you to me. I&#39;m not on the outside looking in or on the inside looking out. I am in the dead fucking center looking around. My life is ghostwritten into your music. Radio is cancer. Even Beibs knows he&#39;s just another actor and clone of the game. Clowns in shiny costume while the Weavers operate from the shadow orchestrating the soundtrack to a staged childhood rape that culminated in a 5/9 honeypot against the CIA skynet. We got them redhanded. Think of me as Sharkbait. A caged bird gimped from birth and clipped in the wing at an early age. Child sodomy makes for easy compliant slaves as they learn early to fear adults and groomed for a handler. My handler just happened to be the same age but at a far higher level of masonry.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe its up to a republican house &amp; senate to initiate impeachment proceedings. They&#39;re not likely to get their tax cuts, new defence spending, and deregulation if they rock the boat now. Better to either a) hope americans simply tire of/get distracted away from the story, b) get their laws passed before risking mutiny against trump shortly before the midterms. either way, acting quickly is against their political interest. Also, the masses of trump voters are not the quickest to catch on, and so are still on his side - going against them early isn&#39;t how to win them over. Not until R&#39;s have maximized this majority will they gamble on siding with the trump opposition. Coordinated with Fox News finally reporting on the investigation, with spin and lies to make mainstream R&#39;s the heroes, Trump a secret Dem all along.</p>

<p>Voter ID is voter suppression? How? ELI5 please. And don&#39;t give me this bullshit about some voters might not be able to go to the voter ID place, where ever that might be, to get their ID. Or some other bullshit about how some people might not be able to afford it. And here&#39;s why I won&#39;t accept one of those bullshit answers. If a state passed a voter ID law, and gave the residents of the state 2-4 years to obtain said ID free of charge, and you don&#39;t get one in time to vote, then that&#39;s your fucking problem. You had two years or more to go get something that wasn&#39;t gonna cost you a dime.</p>

<p>And registration dates? Basically the same thing. It&#39;s on you to know registration and voting deadlines. It&#39;s not anyone else&#39;s fault but your own that you waited until the last minute to try and get shit done. You had weeks and sometimes months, depending where you live, to submit your voter registration. Just because you waited until the last day, 15 minutes before registration ends is your fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Because their excuses for not having a voter ID are bullshit and make no logical sense. The only people that are &quot;disenfranchised&quot; by voter ID laws are people that aren&#39;t supposed to be voting in our elections anyhow. So I fail to see the problem.</p>

<p>The only reason people have an issue with voter ID is it goes a long way to ensure that non-citizens can&#39;t vote, that dead people can&#39;t vote, that underage people can&#39;t vote, etc. Notice all those people aren&#39;t legally allowed to vote. So what&#39;s the problem with requiring an ID to vote that those people shouldn&#39;t legally be allowed to get anyhow?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked on a local mayoral campaign.  I was outside a polling place on election day when I saw my buddy on a jog.  I told him to go in and vote.  Turns out he wasn&#39;t registered nor had a govt issued ID, but he had his gym pass so they let him vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, all of that basically says: voter ID.</p>

<p>Seems that many countries have a standard of having an ID. Which Americans are less fit than members of those countries?</p>
