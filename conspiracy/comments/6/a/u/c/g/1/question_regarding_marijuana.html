       Hello and sorry in advance for any formatting errors. 
Over the years I've heard certain joke conspiracys about marijuana making you resistant to forms of outside influence or mind control. 
In the movie "Cabin in the Woods" one of the characters is a stoner, and at one point in the movie is said that the marijuana he is smoking made him immune to different types of manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       They touch on it a bit at 3:20 in this video.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there any actual conspiracys true or false that touch on that?
      </p>

       I've heard some pretty mind altering stuff happens when people have dmt and other psychedelics, and I'm not just talking about when they're under the influence.

       Yeah. Technically it's not the drug that is protecting you, but what you've learned from experiences under the influence. I've had some awaking moments while under the influence of high proof alcohol.

       Yeah, I really do not understand it, myself. I suspect it's my overall perspective of life/self and reason for drinking. I have a theory that if your energy is good, good "spirits" will come into you, but if negative, negative or nefarious "spirits" will come into you. Not saying that it's good, because it's a poison to the body, but, meh maybe I need another ride on this ride, if you catch my drift. Cheers!

       It's possible for any chemical to "change your frequency" so to speak. Think of it like a radio, when you tune out of one station you tune into another thus making you more or less receptive to the waves on that channel.

       I think that's true. I've seen it said (though can't recall where) that in the MKULTRA experiments many drugs were used and marijuana turned out to be counterproductive to their goal of programming their victim. One more reason they don't want it legal, maybe.

       yeah LSD is both.  LSD can free your mind but it can just as easily enslave it.  It all depends on what youre being suggested while under the influence.

       I stay with what's in nature because as i've observed, every time man tries to outdo nature it just bites them right in the ass. I think we have things out there in the natural world that are perfect and need no tweaking. Mj, shrooms, ayahuasca - these things aren't used in those experiments because they truly are beneficial to the mind and perspective.

       shrooms are nature but the psylocibin molecule is from an alien planet.  Nature almost never has phosphorous atoms in its naturally produced molecules.

       Notice all the psychedelic molecules are CHON chains as you would expect (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen)... all of them except mushrooms.  It has this weird phosphorous attachment almost done on purpose by someone or something.  Just a thought I heard somewhere else.

       Where do you think Psylocibin came from? Really asking because i suspect a few other plants might be not quite earthly..or earthly but are the result of GMO round one from a collapsed civilisation.

       Mushroom spores are the most dense biological artifact known to man.  They are so dense they can survive in space.  The current popular theory is that these psylocibin mushroom spores are flying around the vacuum of space looking for planets to grow on.  The phosphorous atom seems to act like an antenna to communicate back to the "alien mind" that created it.  It might be why some people experience "alien beings" while on mushrooms more than lets say LSD or mescalin.

       Maybe they were brought here. Surviving in space would be one thing but entering an atmosphere sounds a bit of a rough ride even for a mushroom spore. It's interesting in conjunction with ancient religious texts which talk about beings coming here and introducing various technologies to humans, including genetic engineering.

       I think it makes it possible for you to see outside of the regular human parameters that normal people are generally susceptible to. If that makes sense. I think of it like being able to see around corners. Things that you would never be able to intuit sober become possible to see.

       There isn't a conspiracy, it's more like a joke. Back when a lot more people disapproved of smoking weed, it was seen as an activity only people who were resistant to authority would do. Also, when you're high, you are more likely to question authority or to not care, because you're feeling good and relaxed and not in go-go-go-listen-up-do-this-do-that etc mode. Also maybe because you're feeling good/relaxed, you might pick up on other people's tense vibes more easily.

       I couldn't say what they might add but I just wouldn't trust them.  best you could probably do is knowing the person growing it.

       Yeap. Monsanto allegedly created
       <em>
        Sour Diesel
       </em>
       . Its been back crossed into hundreds of different strains. When it's patented anyone growing anything with Sour D crossed will owe Monsanto money to grow their product...legend on the hill

       That's my thought too, recently there was an article that said scientists discovered the GENE in cannabis that gave it its distinct aroma (citrus/diesel/skunky) etc. I call bullshit because I'm pretty sure they discovered that like 30 years ago and just letting us know now. Good thing is since it's worldwide they can't cross pollute every single crop around the world or force people to buy their seeds so there will always be good stuff somewhere

       The movie ends with them smoking a joint and letting the shit hit the fan.  Weed allowed them to see the beginning of the end.  The government and health industry say it's a "Gateway" drug and I believe them.  It opens a gateway in your mind to view things in a different way. I like Cabin in the Woods because it makes me think weed is either the most powerful force in the film allowing the young adults to survive to the end or it's the worse thing ever because it brings the end.

       It's the complete opposite dude. Marijuana is a drug that allows liberals to brainwash you easier. That's why so many young liberals smoke weed. It's a fuckin mind control drug. Look it up and DON'T LISTEN TO THE REST OF REDDIT.

       I mean, just speaking through my own experience: everyone of my closest friends who its more open-minded, thus 'smarter, and more inclined to consider conspiracies as truthful, when presented with necessary evidence, have always been my friends that smoke weed. It certainly opened my mind, and continues to. It also, I think, literally affects your consciousness, which opens your mind up to the fact that
       <em>
        maybe there's more to reality than the collective has been fooled into believing
       </em>
       . It's weed that lead to my journey of awakening, when consciousness becomes aware of itself, and the ego is seen as the illusion it really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason, beyond $, that marijuana has been kept from the public. I have a habit of thinking fanatically, but it just seems so obvious that weed can open your mind in a beautiful way -- in such a way that you realize you are a self-aware manifestation of the universe, resulting in the death of all suffering.

       Sounds like a great plan :) congratulations on finding wisdom at a young age (I'm assuming you're young because of the internship, but of course I could be wrong). That's something that'll greatly impact your life, forever -- not the internship, but the wisdom!

       Yea, its definitely an obsession of mine, your post reminded me of this experience i had last night of an ego death, or a removal of identification into a vast plane of existence, the more vast the more light there is - the more no suffering can touch you - funny how afraid the ego is and then once it's there it's fine lol - thanks for the wishes - your post brought me back to that vast unattachedness :) really powerful

       Check out the Law of One: Ra Material
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can't help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of "God"/existence as well in session 13

       Doesn't a pattern of memories established over "time" or even the illusion of it create distinct personalities and thus "individuals?" Doesn't the creation of a truly unique perspective from unique experiences that then completes and compliments another perspective prove that we are One AND individual? Like Odo from DS9? One that is also part of an eternal and interdependent mass of "ones." The "you" that contributed your comment and not "me." Your perspective contributed to mine.

       You are certainly 'you', while also being the totality. I think that's why 'going within' is often referred to as a journey. What I'm realizing through experience, is that this 'journey' inward is really just a game of the mind, in which the mind tries figuring out what the hell it is, and that 'trying' ultimately tires the mind out, and you come to the experiential conclusion that all you have
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       been is in this moment, right here, right now. Every journey leads you to now. That very fact implies that what we are is now,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       then. We went on the journey into the 'then', and found ourselves in the 'now'. We are the external and the internal, the here and the there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the ego is fundamental in truth being discovered. It we hadn't developed ego, which is really just the illusion that takes us away from truth, how would we know truth? How do we know black without knowing white? We can't. It's fundamental; essential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I do think each person is born with a unique personality that pre-exists in our DNA. Like, some people awaken before others (discover the truth of ego as illusion), so does that mean they will not have as distinct a personality as someone who believes in ego for a lifetime? I don't think so. For example, I was born into a family where one parent is a hugely materialistically successful narcissist, and the other parent is a selfless angel. Growing up, I always felt an internal paradox, a sort of conflict, where I wanted to do the right thing (for others) but felt compelled to act on behalf of self. Eventually, that paradoxically confusing thought structure (part of me wanted to be good, part of me wanted to be bad) lead to depression, which lead to figuring out who the hell I was. In truth, I'm not someone who cares about self. I'm not selfish, and when I acted selfish, something within me felt disgusted. So, the ego was there to show me what I am not, which unveiled what I now know I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, I am you, and you are me. There is no separation; that separation is illusory. I am your perspective, and you are mine. Life is a mirror of self, while also being selfless. The paradoxes are endless to the mind. But to truth, it's all perfect.
      </p>

       Edit: not sure I answered a
       <em>

       Interestingly I find weed before investigating conspiracy theories make me much more able to identify bullshit - it's like a truth serum in reverse, I can tell if something is truth or bullshit. It's fascinating because some material I will resonate with then test it again (under the influence) before I take it the material on board. It's heightening my sense

       My friend's view regarding marijuana and how it relates to the power structure:
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana releases a tremendous amount of energy in the mind. This energy must be focused somewhere. In the absence of all external stimulus, the energy of the mind has nowhere to go but inwards. So it becomes almost super-humanly introspective, reflective, contemplative. For some who are not willing to have such an experience, who were instead hoping to just chill out, the experience can be over-whelming and lead to discomfort, anxiety, paranoia. For those who are willing and intending to have the experience it can lead to deep, deep contemplation, some cultures believe towards enlightenment. So the strongest effects come from using marijuana in an absence of external stimulus, the extreme example being the suffis doing so in caves for weeks (months?) on end with a minimum of even food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Used in this way, marijuana poses a huge threat to the establishment that seeks to control the individual and his mind. The individual becomes independent of thought and Free.
      </p>
      <p>
       This same huge energy can lead to total immersion in an external stimulus. If this is paint, music, art, or even academia, it can still be hugely productive, but an external productive that benefits the individual in a more removed way. This could benefit the System or not, depending on the work being done and how it is subsequently utilised.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is also a third scenario, which involves the use of marijuana with still external stimuli, but those of an aimless and frivolous nature. This isn't wrong necessarily, I've been told there's great pleasure in getting stoned and playing video games, or watching comedies, or just fucking about with friends, but it can be very tempting to repeat such hedonistic activities at the expense of other perhaps more productive activities. It's cheap, very enjoyable, not particularly harmful.
      </p>
      <p>
       This last scenario, my friend believes, is particularly relevant today because there are so many frivolous distractions available. It is now possible to watch fail videos and vines literally endlessly and they be, to a certain extent, provide constant pleasure. Clicking videos like a rat in a skinner box. Certainly many people have enough discipline or responsibility to avoid such a scenario, but many do not, and with distractions becoming increasingly available and pleasurable, even sober, the latter is likely to increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if marijuana can make you less susceptible propaganda, as in the first case, it might be offset in this latter case by the constant bombardment of propaganda incurred in continuous system sanctioned entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in summary, my friend would say it depends on the context in which marijuana is used.

       cannabis is a low grade hallucinogen. It will trigger very similar effects to the following and then some;  mushrooms., peyote, LSD, some research chemicals, fasting for 2+ weeks, getting tweaked out for a couple weeks and not sleeping.

       I am regularly smoking with friends and with the exception of some really intelligent guys who don't smoke,  they are my only friends I can properly discuss history, politics and conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot confirm with certainty that the plant itself makes you more resistant to be influenced by media etc, I have always had the urge to question things more. Once in a discussion with friends we thought that weed being illegal (Europe) and the stigmatising of weed smokers by society has the effect that you, if you smoke, automatically begin questioning things more. After all, it's a fucking plant that has been completely banned. This itself is so ridiculous you just have to ask why. Then this starts a chain reaction and you learn that cannabis was used in around 50% of all medicine in the 19th century and a lot of clothes were made of the same plant . You come to the conclusion that the pharma &amp; clothing industry just teamed up for this ban, to be able to massively increase their profits by producing artificial replacements for medicine (painkillers etc) and clothes (nylon) and selling it for much more than the products out of the weed plant. Cannabis was just too cheap, too easy to grow in many climates. Maybe there's an effect somehow connected to your ability to critical thinking but I am not sure if it is the effect of smoking it or the effect of being stigmatised and therefore starting to question things. But it has certainly contributed to my interest to understand the world for what it really is and not for what media/society wants you to believe it is. I am now reading a lot of books about history, politics and money, trying to learn and understand how our world really works.

       Well one of the very first of many "funny things" you discover the first time that you smoke and toke-up, is that you've certainly been lied to and told a lot of nonsense about this stuff you happen to be smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing is that whatever you thought "getting high" meant before you actually did goes right out the window at the same time... a momentary flash where you can't decide if this is all just some kind of a joke that finding yourself spontaneously laughing you ass off about it at the very same time pretty much answers that question for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you broke a taboo by deciding to do it and you've broken through another major barrier right then and there when you did... and it is funny... funny as in ha-ha funny and funny as in odd, unusual, or peculiar all at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking or talking about anything besides all the sensations you seem to be picking up on just keeps on getting interrupted by them, so you pretty much have to go with flow, work them into the conversation or into whatever you thought you were thinking about and go wherever that happens to take you. That can range anywhere from the sublime to nonsensical but either way seems uplifting enough to put a smile on you face or squeeze a giggle or laugh out of you and anyone with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a world as complex, rigidly defined  and organised from the top to the bottom as the one we all actually live in this sort of free-form experience and way of sensing and looking at things after all the hard work and conditioning done on us as children to get us to stop doing and forget all about it, obviously represents a loss of that conditioned control over us.
      </p>

       You realize after a while that it's not so much the drug as it is a state of mind that it permits you to recover that and as time goes by you require less and less of the drug itself or encounter what we used to call a "contact high" being around someone or in a group that's been smoking-up before you arrived and climbed right on board.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is the experience isn't exactly new and it doesn't feel abnormal. It was familiar to us long ago before it got buried under all the layers of shellac about how we should think and what we should think about and all the artificial separations and definitions and descriptions of things that we were taught to focus on and sort through far more than on any of the things themselves and the kind of sensations we ignored rather than paid more attention to because of that. When you simply and spontaneously pay attention to those sensations and how they feel at any given moment that's basically what "intuition" is and is all about... getting good or bad "vibes", off certain people or ideas or things going on around you, if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, using grass is definitely going to make you more intuitive and more trusting of that intuition as time goes by if you allow it to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make it harder for others to manipulate, coerce, or use you? I can when you're tuned in enough to feel or sense it no matter what the setting or circumstances are, once again, if you let it and have learned to trust those feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to whatever is presumably true, it isn't enough for any ideas or explanations to simply look or sound true if they don't automatically feel that way at the same time, too. If you don't want to find yourself getting manipulated or having your thoughts directed the way someone else wants them to go for their own purposes you have to pay attention to that because whenver that feeling isn't there what you're dealing with is either a lie or worse yet a half-truth.

       It's been a decade or so since I last smoked.  All it did for me is cause my brain to pat itself on the back and give the chemical equivalent of a "good job" and thumbs up to itself without having really earned it.  I churned out some of the worst work I'd ever done and thought it was brilliant.

       I suppose if a type of mind control required a reliable mental state, then changing that mental state could screw with the mind control.  I'm not really sure how MC is supposed to work though.

       So with this I was a huge and I mean huge stoner and I had been for years. Now I am still advocate for all the good it does and have no problem with and basically everyone including my mom smoke it. However I had to stop, I was literally loosing my mind, I would smoke and then just let my mind consume me and my mind (due to borderline personality disorder and anxiety)  is not a fun place to be. So first I quit smoking pot, and my thoughts became less paranoid and slowed down not 50 thoughts a second, then I quit cigarettes and my body stopped aching and my anxiety got better, then I quit all alcohol and I felt great physically, then I stopped my cable, took up yoga and the last thing I did was stop food from anywhere but farmers markets and local resteruants and local meat shops. I also only drink water and tea. I have never felt more clear and calm in my entire life. My mind finally is quiet and let me tell you it is fucking beautiful. I try Not to consume anything but things an animal would I stay away from electronics(except Reddit and music) and I read read read anything and everything.

       It's a mood altering drug, which can make you look at things in a different way. It's a little bit like "red pilling" the brain when you get really stoned for the first time.. you become aware that there's more to the world than what you see in your default, government approved state.

       Lol I mean it definitely can be tool for reaching enlightenment and deeper consciousness so in a sense yes, but it's not an anti-mind control drug, no more than having strong self control or something similar.

       Eh, I think it's just another topic people have been lied to about, so once they use Marijuana they realize it's not that bad and they have been lied to. Then they start wondering what other ways they have been lied to.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's certainly not something specific to marijuana or a cause of marijuana specifically. There are many topics/life events that wake them up to lies and therefor conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having Lyme Disease wakes you up to conspiracy for several reasons. One, you realize there is an active attempt to discredit people who have this common bacterial infection. Doctors will routinely say it does not exists despite the fact its in your blood and DNA as determined by extensive and accurate lab tests. So people with Lyme start to question why doctors are taught nothing about Lyme and why our surgeon general will not come up with a designated treatment protocol. They start to wonder why big pharma will not research Lyme, but will hold the patent on it. Then, they start to question more than just Lyme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing happens with those injured by vaccines. The same thing happens to those who have been misdiagnosed for years, not getting better, given prescriptions that don't help or make things way worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any topic that makes you realize you have been lied to. Any topic that makes you question your assumed safety. It all wakes you the fuck up. The cool part about marijuana is that it's common and it's a big wake up call to users that govt does abuse its power.

       This is now added to my list of reasons why I smoke which include:

      <p>
       *spine bent like "candy cane"(doctor's phrase) from car accident
