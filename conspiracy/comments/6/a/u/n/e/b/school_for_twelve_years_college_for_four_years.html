       How does Capitalism create that? No matter how you cut it, you have to work in life. Be it working a 9-5 with a business or running a self sustaining homestead. Life requires work.

       See Daniel Quinn.  Pre agricultural, tribal life required alot less work than the system we have now.

       I know nothing in life is free, but there has to be a job that basically "frees" you from this system of just living to working then working till you die, right?

       Yeah just letting you know that job doesn't exist. If you have passions pursue them and stick to it/ become good till people are offering you jobs. Most people out here just go with whatever they think they are good at outside of HS or college and find out in college or after they they don't really like the job they are just there because it pays good.... most people are full of shit and hide their happiness for a salary. The real lifestyle I wish I had was being a Native American. Wake up, hunt, eat, fuck. No need for traffic, or faking emotions at work, all this bullshit we endure makes us older. Usually people who go a different path to their pace end up happier than the slave who has 80k in the bank, lives in a nice house but his marriage is dead and his kids hate him. Remember just because someone has taken more shit that you in life doesn't make them wiser or smarter. you have your own thoughts and perspectives don't let anyone take that away from you think for yourself always fuck what people say

       Depends on your cost of living and lifestyle. I can live extremely comfortable at 70k. So pile up around 800k-1mil invest it. Live off the interest. 7-10% nets you around 70-80k a year. Just find your number and get it.

       you gotta know how to market yourself though.  I see lots of ignorant folk not get what the skill is really worthy because of self esteem, lack of desire for money, not being able to hold a conversation with someone in a tie ( don't blame them, but you gotta learn to act one day.)

       Amish are currently working a pretty good scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean... what's to stop me from buying 200 acres, throwing up solar, on a well, and saying i'm Amish?  Then just setup a state of the art wood shop and churn out tax free cash furniture all day.
      </p>
      <p>

       This lifestyle isn't normal. I don't care what people say about life requiring "work," I think the glorification of hard work is a tool of manipulation. Minority groups in this country are always told to simply work harder to overturn social injustice &amp; economic inequality. Where does it stop?

       Whoa dude, that's a pretty shitty way to look at it. School is the worst part of life. Only do as much as you need. I really enjoy my work as a programmer and it was mostly self taught. I'm not a wage slave. I'm a normal fucking person with bills and a stomach and someone else is out there farming the shit I eat with the same needs. You telling them their and my life is worthless?

       I want to become a doctor. Through my parents, I must follow that path to break the cycle of being lower middle class.

       But now seeing the truth behind them, I'm more interested in being an Orthodontist.

       You are young and have plenty of time to figure out what you want to do. But being a Doctor now is not the same as it used to be. They do not make the money they used to. I know many doctors who had their practices "go out of business" because of Obamacare. So I don't know how they will be affected by the the new healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just so you realize, nothing in life is free.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it is rare that you can make a decent living from youtube or be "discovered". Yes, it happens, but it is rare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just relax right now. You are young and have time to figure out what you want to do.

       Why don't you do all of it? I'm 32 and onto my third career path. I have been a primary school teacher, graphic designer and now I'm a marketing manager for a decent sized company. I will probably stay in this until 40ish then switch to something else. Honestly I think the big conspiracy is convincing kids they have to choose one career for their whole lives. Embrace change. Challenge yourself. Find what you love and master it. Then move on to something new. Never settle. When you feel comfortable that's when it's time to jump in the deep end again.

       I would argue that the structure of our society did not occurred organically, but has in fact been designed for the benefit those who own and control capitol. There is also mass indoctrination to follow a well worn pattern of restricted choices (be a wage slave). IN many ways life is like joining a game of Monopoly after all the property has been bought. The structure (by design) limits your actions. Is it impossible to escape and live relatively free? No. Is it difficult? Yes. People do conspire to continue the status quo which protects their position, wealth, and power.

       I think on a certain level the secret planning and implementation of laws, codes, treaties, and policy is a conspiracy. Did you read the Patriot Act before it was passed? Neither did any member of the congress. How about the NAFTA or TPPA? I'm suggesting the secret planning of our society to benefit a few stake holders and reduce others to wage slaves is a conspiracy. I understand if you disagree, but I think it's worthy of discussion on this sub.

       no those are specific policies. not society as a whole. or even more broadly speaking social values

       I guess I would disagree. The structure of specific policies (taken in total) are the society. If one is to take poling as authentic, then policy does not necessarily reflect social values. I don't want to beat a dead horse, and I agree this was a weak post, but our systems of indoctrination (advertising, schooling, law, etc) are planned and hidden from the view of the public. I just thought the post reflected the planned structure of our society that funnels people to limited choices. I mean clearly one can point to ALIENS.

       The white man works like a slave all his life in order to retire, to be able to loaf and hunt and fish. We already have this for which the white man is working. So why should we adopt his ways and work all our life for what we already have?

       All of this is just for entertainment and conveniency​. School just builds you up so you can work. If you don't want to be apart of that, then live off the land and become self sufficient. All you need is your belly full and your shelter protected. All other things is for entertainment, and we've been programmed to consume entertainment. To consume more than we need to eat, to have more shelter than we need.  And we want more and more, so we get a job so we can buy and buy. It's a vicious cycle of control until you realize you're on your deathbed and none of that really mattered. Not even your death mattered, it's just the natural cycle of life. Why does man think he is so much more special than a plant, we both grow and we both die. The government used you all up, covered with a facade that is what your will that made you go to work. There's no goals in life except to live it. One could sit his entire life looking at the mountains and that can be a good life, with his only worries being the protection of his shelter and the preservation of his body. Break out of societies conditionings so you can give back to society.

       The object is to simply find some
       <em>
        meaningful
       </em>
       work. Something interesting that you actually enjoy doing and can always learn more and get better at doing and that is also helpful and beneficial to others. When you approach life and work that way people will respect and appreciate what you do for them, word will get around, and enough will come your way not simply in business but personal relationships and associations.

       It's a big world out there with plenty of opportunities to do that in a big or small ways. It's up to you to decide what kind of a lifestyle you want but you have to have some means to afford at least the basic necessities.

       if you stop learning after college I'd feel sorry for you.  training and self improvement are daily activities in your life, and career.  since I graduated college, I've gotten another degree, all the certs for my profession, and do professional training for my career or hobbies at least 3 times a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       why would you quit learning from people who are more experienced, or a knew way of thinking?

       Do something that doesn't seem like work would be a good first step. Second, don't live beyond your means. I see so many people 'keeping up with the Jones'.

       There's alot of people out there who could do themselves alot of good by just drawing a line down the middle of a piece of paper, and write their income and expenses on either side.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that said, there is definitely a better way to live than the way we are now. I realized this about 5 years ago, and I'm now just about out of the rat race myself. A few more years.

       I know nothing in life is free, but there has to be a job that basically "frees" you from this system of just living to working then working till you die, right?
