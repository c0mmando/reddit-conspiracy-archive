      </p>
      <p>
       Some quotes from the Hitchen's piece:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For Henry Kissinger, no great believer in the boastful claims of the war makers in the first place, a special degree of responsibility attaches. Not only did he have good reason to know that field commanders were exaggerating successes and claiming all dead bodies as enemy soldiers--a commonplace piece of knowledge after the spring of 1968--but he also knew that the issue of the war had been settled politically and diplomatically, for all intents and purposes, before he became national security adviser. Thus he had to know that every additional casualty, on either side, was not just a death but an avoidable death. With this knowledge, and with a strong sense of the domestic and personal political profit, he urged the expansion of the war into two neutral countries--violating international law--while persisting in a breathtakingly high level of attrition in Vietnam itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of nothing is this more true than his own individual involvement in the bombing and invasion of neutral Cambodia and Laos. Obsessed with the idea that Vietnamese intransigence could be traced to allies or resources external to Vietnam itself, or could be overcome by tactics of mass destruction, Kissinger at one point contemplated using thermonuclear weapons to obliterate the pass through which ran the railway link from North Vietnam to China, and at another stage considered bombing the dikes that prevented North Vietnam's irrigation system from flooding the country. Neither of these measures (reported respectively in Tad Szulc's history of Nixon-era diplomacy, The Illusion of Peace, and by Kissinger's former aide Roger Morris) was taken, which removes some potential war crimes from our bill of indictment but which also gives an indication of the regnant mentality.
       </p>
       <p>
        hen Kissinger was finally exposed in Congress and the press for conducting unauthorized bombings, he weakly pleaded that the raids were not all that secret, really, because Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia had known of them. He had to be reminded that a foreign princeling cannot give permission to an American bureaucrat to violate the United States Constitution.
       </p>
       <p>
        On November 9, 1970, Henry Kissinger authored National Security Council Decision Memorandum 93, which reviewed policy toward Chile in the immediate wake of Salvador Allende's confirmation as president. Various routine measures of economic harassment were proposed (as per Nixon's instruction to "make the economy scream"), with cutoffs in aid and investment. More significantly, Kissinger advocated that "close relations" be maintained with military leaders in neighboring countries, in order to facilitate both the coordination of pressure against Chile and the incubation of opposition within the country. In outline, this prefigures the disclosures that have since been made about Operation "Condor," a secret collusion among military dictatorships across the hemisphere, operated with the United States government's knowledge and indulgence.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we have now seen, Kissinger has a tendency to personalize his politics. His policies have led directly and deliberately to the deaths of anonymous hundreds of thousands but have also involved the targeting of certain inconvenient individuals: General Schneider, Archbishop Makarios, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. And, as we have also more than once glimpsed, Kissinger has a special relish for localized revenge.

       After detailing the transformation that occurs once access to secret information was obtained:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You will deal with a person who doesn't have those clearances only from the point of view of what you want him to believe and what impression you want him to go away with, since you'll have to lie carefully to him about what you know. In effect, you will have to manipulate him. You'll give up trying to assess what he has to say. The danger is, you'll become something like a moron. You'll become incapable of learning from most people in the world, no matter how much experience they may have in their particular areas that may be much greater than yours."
       </p>
       <p>
        ....Kissinger hadn't interrupted this long warning. As I've said, he could be a good listener, and he listened soberly. He seemed to understand that it was heartfelt, and he didn't take it as patronizing, as I'd feared. But I knew it was too soon for him to appreciate fully what I was saying. He didn't have the clearances yet.

       Basically, he's a mass murderer who is admired among the oligarchs.  Kissinger should have been hung by an angry public, but they instead opt to call him an "elder statesman".

       Henry Kissinger and the chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Peter G. Peterson were doing business together as the Blackstone Group. They financed the privatization of the World Trade Center just weeks transferring responsibility for the property to Larry Silverstein and including a rare insurance policy against terrorism some 6 weeks before the attacks of 9/11. During the attacks all 7 of the Trade Center buildings were  demolished. 4 of the buildings were left standing but had to later be destroyed because they were damaged beyond repair.

       It's almost like Kissinger continued the work of the Dulles brothers after they passed away.

       Kissinger caused Nixon's fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1969, Kissinger was in charge of computerizing the White House.
He installed the taping system. Nixon didn't even know until Kissinger did it. They were computerizing a lot then. In 1970, Dick Cheney signed off approving covert action for CIA to hire 5 programmers to build the first database that ever existed. It was for MKCHAOS and it held Dossiers on 300,000 Americans. The Anti-War movement. All of it, everyone. Kinda like the Antifa of today.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes Kissinger somewhat of a tragic figure, because if the Nixon Tapes never existed, then Watergate never would have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps there's a lesson there to learn about today and what happens when you surveillance so much that you end up exposing your own secrets.
