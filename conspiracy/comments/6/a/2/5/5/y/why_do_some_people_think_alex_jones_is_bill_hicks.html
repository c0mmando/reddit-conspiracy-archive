    <div class="md"><p>I watched a YouTube video on it recently as I didn&#39;t get it either. If I remember correctly (at least this persons video) they think bill hicks was CIA, staged his death and got some facial surgery, and is just controller disinfo. They had some clip of bill hicks saying something along those lines would be a good idea, who knows the context though. Some pics of a young alex Jones that they say looks nothing like the guy you see today, but I dunno ppl get old haha. It was interesting to entertain for a few mins but I&#39;m not sold on anymore than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jones lies about his age, surely.  He has the same production company and best friend with Hicks, Kevin Booth.  </p>

<p>Hicks had complained that his act wasn&#39;t resonating with southern hicks and they both thought the &#39;shock-jock format&#39; would be even funnier.   He looked fine up until his supposed death, and his idol was Andy Kaufmann, who famously faked his own death and returned as another character.</p>

<p>The videos (especially the first one) were convincing to me, add all the other &#39;coincidences&#39; and I&#39;d say the simplest explanation is that they are the same person.

    <div class="md"><p>they both grew up in/near dallas so they have the same accent.</p>

<p>but they have completely different body types.</p>

<p>plastic surgery cannot change your body type.</p>

<p>alex jones is not bill hicks.</p>

<p>He is a clone of bill hicks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched a YouTube video on it recently as I didn&#39;t get it either. If I remember correctly (at least this persons video) they think bill hicks was CIA, staged his death and got some facial surgery, and is just controller disinfo. They had some clip of bill hicks saying something along those lines would be a good idea, who knows the context though. Some pics of a young alex Jones that they say looks nothing like the guy you see today, but I dunno ppl get old haha. It was interesting to entertain for a few mins but I&#39;m not sold on anymore than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m serious btw. While there may be folks that honestly think Bill Hicks and Alex Jones are the same dude due to looks and timing, I think the majority of the references you see to it are tongue in cheek just to rile him up.</p>
