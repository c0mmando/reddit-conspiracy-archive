       I've heard this for some time now, but just got around to looking into it. I'm very familiar with Alex Jones, but didn't know who Bill Hicks was. So I just watched several Bill Hicks stand up videos. They are not the same person at all. Why do people think this?

       Yes, they are what I said, or just flat out ignorant people who have heard the theory and based on their relative similarities think it could be real. It's not, and they are not. One is a shill and the other was a brilliant man, imo.

       I'll be honest. I'm 49 and had never heard of Bill Hicks. I have been watching some of his stand up videos on youtube today. He was way ahead of his time! Love him! Such a shame he passed away at a young age.

       Bill Hicks was saying he did not support Fake Wars. He became a target and they gave him the fast acting cancer they killed Bob Marley with.

       i am not a doctor and do not know the exact details. but bob marley was injected by a needle in his boot. hicks was a huge threat. he said he did not "support the troops" constantly during his appearances. he was pulled from late night with david letterman at the last moment.

       2)Only a handful of Marley’s most trusted comrades knew of the band’s whereabouts before the festival. Yet a member of the film crew, or so he claimed – reportedly, he didn’t have a camera – managed to talk his way past machete-bearing Rastas to enter the Hope Road encampment: one Carl Colby, son of the late CIA DIRECTOR William Colby.

       I watched a YouTube video on it recently as I didn't get it either. If I remember correctly (at least this persons video) they think bill hicks was CIA, staged his death and got some facial surgery, and is just controller disinfo. They had some clip of bill hicks saying something along those lines would be a good idea, who knows the context though. Some pics of a young alex Jones that they say looks nothing like the guy you see today, but I dunno ppl get old haha. It was interesting to entertain for a few mins but I'm not sold on anymore than that.

       Well, Bill Hicks (from what I've watched) was a comedian way ahead of his time. Fully awake, like George Carlin.

       I see similarities between Hicks and Alex Jones, but I don't think they are the same person. Their voices are very different, to me.

       I'm serious btw. While there may be folks that honestly think Bill Hicks and Alex Jones are the same dude due to looks and timing, I think the majority of the references you see to it are tongue in cheek just to rile him up.

       Jones lies about his age, surely.  He has the same production company and best friend with Hicks, Kevin Booth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hicks had complained that his act wasn't resonating with southern hicks and they both thought the 'shock-jock format' would be even funnier.   He looked fine up until his supposed death, and his idol was Andy Kaufmann, who famously faked his own death and returned as another character.

       So you're saying you believe Jones' is the age he says he is?
      </p>
      <p>
       The videos (especially the first one) were convincing to me, add all the other 'coincidences' and I'd say the simplest explanation is that they are the same person.   Even check out their unaltered body details, the ears for example are almost exactly the same from available photos of Hicks compared with Jones.

       the number and type of coincidences show that it's very likely that they are the same person - and very unlikely that they aren't.  sure it could be a coincidence, but not so easily many of them at once.

       I watched a YouTube video on it recently as I didn't get it either. If I remember correctly (at least this persons video) they think bill hicks was CIA, staged his death and got some facial surgery, and is just controller disinfo. They had some clip of bill hicks saying something along those lines would be a good idea, who knows the context though. Some pics of a young alex Jones that they say looks nothing like the guy you see today, but I dunno ppl get old haha. It was interesting to entertain for a few mins but I'm not sold on anymore than that.
