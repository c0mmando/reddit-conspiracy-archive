    <div class="md"><p>Craig Murray provides an account that seems to indicate Wikileaks gets its information multiple ways, and sometimes they are aware where info is coming from:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I resigned as Ambassador to blow the whistle on UK/US complicity in torture and extraordinary rendition, I had a number of official documents I wished to leak to prove my story. They were offered to WikiLeaks through two friends, Andrew and Jonathan. WikiLeaks declined to publish them because they could not 100% verify them.</p>

<p>Their reasons were firstly that they were suspicious of me and whether I was a plant; British ambassadors are not given to resigning on principle. Secondly a few of the copies were my own original drafts of diplomatic communications I had sent, not the document as it printed out at the other end.</p>

<p>That is how scrupulous they are. I can vouch for the fact that their record for 100% accuracy is no fluke, it is safeguarded by extreme caution and careful checking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AMY GOODMAN: Did Russia leak the documents, either the DNC documents or the John Podesta emails, to WikiLeaks?</p>

<p>JULIAN ASSANGE: We have said quite clearly that our source is not a member of any state, including the Russian government. Now, if you look at these statements by James Comey, James Clapper, going back a couple of months, statements by Barack Obama, they all are harmonious with our description. Now, what—what the U.S. investigation by James Comey seems to be trying to say, at least in public, is that they perceive that there was some Russian hacking, or at least some hacking from somewhere, of the DNC, other institutions in the United States. In fact, the allegations are that several thousands of people were hacked in those operations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem is there is no such evidence. There can’t be because both the DNC and Podesta emails were leaked by Washington insiders, to my certain knowledge. I repeat that, to my certain knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is your prerogative.  So to conclude, we have Assange saying it was not the Russian government, we have Murray, and affiliate saying it was an inside leak.  In addition we have this piece of circumstancial evidence of Wikileaks offering a reward for info on Seth Rich. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/wikileaks-offers-reward-in-killing-of-dnc-staffer-in-washington/2016/08/09/f84fcbf4-5e5b-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/wikileaks-offers-reward-in-killing-of-dnc-staffer-in-washington/2016/08/09/f84fcbf4-5e5b-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html</a></p>

<p>Now you provide evidence that it was Russian intelligence who hacked Podesta and the DNC and gave the info to Wikileaks. </p>

<p>I hope the irony of commenting in a thread about a perjurer where his allegations are given more credence than Murray who leaked documents and was targeted by the British state is  not lost on readers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange/Murray could easily try and provide evidence to the &quot;Seth was the leaker and thus killed&quot; claim. Instead it just seems like they wanted to float the idea as a counter-conspiracy, and it worked.

Kind of the opposite of Assange&#39;s usual journalistic mantra, actually. </p>
