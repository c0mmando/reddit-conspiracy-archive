       so yeah we all have read and understand they are a thing, but what i never read is :why do the iluminati what they do? for power i guess, or does anyone know why they dont feel ethic wrongdoings? im not talking what they do, im really wondering how they think and what their motivation is as human beings. does greed make really so blind? or are they simply unaware since they maybe isolated in a higher class?

       Everyone is in it for their own purpose. Some simply desire control. Some genuinely believe theyare doing the right thing. Some are probably oblivious to the end goal. Most are probably sociopaths, uncapable of feeling empathy. I hear thats where the term "reptilian" comes from. Icke never meant it literally, he meant their brains work like reptiles do, no emotions, they work instintually.

This is largely correct. It's almost inherent to their method of governance. When you operate in in such a way as to stifle even internal dissent you will become unhinged over the long run.

       You have biological reasons for this too, not just social ones. Familiar transfer of power, inbreeding, the differential susceptibility to syphilis before a cure was available, etc., have all engendered a quickening of the insanity / psychosis of these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who run the world today had parents and grandparents that were literally insane, not just in the sense of their ideas, but because of a biological infection. It's hard to comprehend for ordinary people, but extremely important in explaining how we got to where we are now.

       I think there are several roughly familial units that have been competing for ages, and their purpose is no different from when my family sits down to play the game Risk. Of course winning is important, and the eventual goal. But it is a ton of fun and interesting to see what happens along the way as people get control of different areas of the board.

       what u say here i didnt dare to say in my post. we play risk board, they play with human cattle. sometimes i feel as if the illuminati are just "normal" people, but in that spot at that certain moment in history. am i wrong if i state that if we would put any random person (sane civilian) in the iluminatis position / history / conections, wouldnt that civilian act the same as iluminati do? im not trying to say that iluminati are inocent. im just wondering if they really are that different from us.

       If I am right, then they have selectively bred themselves into something approaching pure psychopathy. So, while I see your point and think normal folks thrust into that position would probably not be improved by it, I think these gifted psychopaths are evolved to do evil, to a point, beyond what normal people are.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I believe their spiritual traditions are extremely dark and evil. I don't pretend to know if spiritual things are even real, but I think they believe they are real, and act accordingly.

       Ants masterclass in philosophy:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do human kids torture us with great delight, in great numbers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it's in their nature and they do not believe to be doing anything without their right.
Because they were born inside a group "humans" with no obligation or similarity to we ants.
Because pertaining to that group, we are but a nuisance to be dealt with.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same logic, their group thinking doesn't extend to humans. As wild ants we should be gathered in huge cities to be given fire once and for all, kek.

       This is a very complex question.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, make sure you know what the illuminati is. Based off my observations, I've concluded that the illuminati was a secret society created by America's founding fathers that intended to break the 'old world order' and create a 'new world order'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this because George Washington
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/pgN5l">
        spoke favorably of the Illuminati
       </a>
       . This may make George Washington appear to be a bad guy but let's look closer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Owl of Minerva is often used as a reference to a secret club and, historically, a symbol of concealing knowledge (a hallmark of the old world order).
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/WtCjf">
        A huge statue of this owl
       </a>
       is famously used for ritualistic purposes in Bohemian Grove, and if you browse Wikileaks, you'll see that "Minerva" is often mentioned. In this
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Oif7R">
        email
       </a>
       Hillary Clinton asserted that they have Minerva's consent to openly declare their plan to topple Gaddafi in Libya. It is also on the
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/TbbhW">
        temple
       </a>
       of human trafficker/blackmailer Jeffrey Epstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/yH2D8">
        original pamphlets
       </a>
       the Illuminati passed around also featured this owl. Does this mean the Illuminati is also part of this evil club? Not necessarily. It appears the Illuminati simply disguised themselves as having the same goals as the Old World Order, allowing America to build up its armaments, and when the time was right they made it evident to the 'bad guys' that they meant business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their new
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Ed8ss">
        symbol
       </a>
       became what is now on the dollar and the seal of America. Those latin phrases mean "it favors our undertakings" and "a new order of the ages," respectively. Also the pyramid has 12 steps which is certainly a reference to "the twelve manner of fruits" in the New Testament. 12 is a highly significant number biblically in many ways, but that one is the most obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does this new symbol mean and how can we be sure America's attempt at "a new order" was legitimate? Well, that requires some reading. A primer on this, in the context of America, is Anton Chaitkin's book "Treason In America: From Aaron Burr To Averell Harriman." It's a short read, packed with info, and very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: The founding fathers legitimately resisted the Old World Order but eventually America was infiltrated by bankers and loyalist freemasons. (As you can see the pyramid is unfinished, but it is in our ability to see and "illuminate," or shine light on the world with our knowledge, that will completely the project.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        As to your other inquiry regarding ethics:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A large majority of the people currently in charge are legitimate psychopaths and commit atrocities without a twinge of remorse. If you're interested in this I would highly recommend reading
       <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/bush/ponerology_preview.pdf">
        Political Ponerology
       </a>
       , a book whose publication was intentionally prevented for decades because it so perfectly explained the mindset of the elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to their motivation... think of it as being similar to a custom of micromanaging that has been ingrained in the ruling class's culture for thousands of years. To better understand this: look at the Old Testament. What is God's reason for keeping Adam and Eve from eating "the fruit of knowledge of Good and Evil"? What is God's motivation behind confusing the language of the builders of the Tower of Babel? Don't listen to any traditional interpretations; read it for yourself. Also take notice that the God of the new testament refers to 'himself' as "us" "we" and even the hebrew word for God, "Elohim," is plural (anything ending with "im" is plural in hebrew).
      </p>
      <p>
       But now it's gotten to the point where it is illogical to micromanage because they spend more time keeping secrets stored away than actually doing anything to progress humanity. As a matter of fact, they intentionally regress humanity to ensure they don't lose control. They go around knocking down towers and confusing people.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are power hungry psychopaths -- incompetent psychopaths at that.

       The elites are psychopaths and the illuminati was fighting against them. That might sound silly but read what I said above closely. I'll try to restate it more clearly:
      </p>
      <p>
       The illuminati put the Owl of Minerva on their pamphlets to make it appear to the elites that they were on the same side. This allowed America to build up its armaments and prepare for war without the British intervening.
      </p>
      <p>
       But by the time the British realized that the Americans meant business they were on their way to losing the war. Therefore, America's founding fathers concluded that "it (probably God) favors our undertakings."
      </p>
      <p>
       The psychopath bankers in Britain did succeed, however, in completely infiltrating America's institutions and preventing a long-term American national bank. They installed the Federal Reserve and it has a tight grip on all of our lives. You can read about them outright discussing this infiltration in quotes about their various round-table movements, most thoroughly examined by Carroll Quigley's "The Anglo-American Establishment." They eventually established groups in America such as the Council of Foreign Relations, Council of National Policy,  Bilderberg, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Old World Order, comprised of groups such as those, is what we are fighting against. The whole 'illuminati new world order' hype is just a PSYOP to instill fear in us and to make us doubt the intentions of America's founding fathers.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know that we can't win if we don't know who we're fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know thy enemy.

       I can answer this.

       These people are called "sociopaths". That means the lack the ability for empathy towards others. That means they could burn a newborn puppy alive, and feel ok with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, they view this lack of empathy as a gift, because it doesn't hold them back from what they want to achieve; rulers of the globe, more for them, Less for us; the sociopathic dream.
      </p>
      <p>
       They see empathy as a weakness. They see themselves as the most intelligent and rightful owners of the globe.
