        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Didn&#39;t know where else to post this without being rejected by the majority of people, so here I am. </p>

<p>Long time lurker here at r/conspiracy. Over the past almost 4 months, I&#39;ve had a major change in my perception of reality and the world around me. From being a super Pro - Trump guy, to despising the establishment and feeling like a slave to society. Recently I have (IMO) been enlightened to the fact that our reality is generated to make us think of things as norms and what not to keep us trapped as essentially money slaves. Along with that, I also believe in &quot;The Archons&quot; feeding off our negative energy and also keeping us trapped in a reincarnation cycle (white light theory). As much as I&#39;d like to think this is all conspiracy sci - fi rubbish, for some reason I can&#39;t help but feel like its the ugly truth and explains for me a lot of why the world is the way it is.</p>

<p>Now where I need help. After acquiring this information, my outlook on the world and life has been very dark and negative. I constantly feel like a slave, as I said before. I feel like the human race is being taken advantage of. I also have a hard time breaking from the materialistic lifestyle I thought was normal 99% of my life. So here are two questions I would like some insight on and additional advice not pertaining to the two questions is more than welcomed as well.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do I fix my perception and feel like I&#39;m living life for myself and not as a slave, and not have such a negative outlook.</p></li>
<li><p>How can I fight against the forces taking advantage of humanity? How can I try to spread awareness of what&#39;s going on?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT: To add more context to my situation, I have a pretty normal social life, main group of close friends, girlfriend and working two jobs. I am on YouTube and Reddit a lot reading up on conspiracy type things and political (mainly social) things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking only for myself, I went through a very dark period 3 years or so ago when I realized just how seriously fucked up things are and how deviant and psychopathic our leadership actually is. </p>

<p>The only thing that pulled me out of it was going back to church. On a brutal rainy Sunday when I felt near suicidal, I walked through the downpour to the first church I could find and it was like the minister was delivering a sermon specifically for me. Totally resonated. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been going back and reading the Bible since, and, while it&#39;s not been a cure-all, it&#39;s been a cure-a-lot. </p>

<p>I also know it can be very very difficult to find a good church. A lot are run by power hungry charlatans. Good luck to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They DIDN&#39;T</p>

<p>The book of Revelations is the Revelation of Jesus Christ that is entirely future prophetic from Chap. 4 till the end. It was given to the only apostle that wasn&#39;t martyred (john) on the isle of patmos while he was in exile near the end if his life.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand because it is symbolically encrypted and must be read with an OT book, Daniel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prophetic clues are strewn throughtout the Bible in dozens of its books (always keep in mind, same author) in particular Daniel &amp; Revelation have arguably the most &#39;end times&#39; prophecy, and are specifically paired to go together. One from Old Covenant, one from New Covenant. The whole Bible is engineered by God so that they must go together to be understand.</p>

<p>An orthodex jew that does not accept Christ or his teachings knows little to nothing about what is about to come upon their nation.</p>

<p>Similarly a modern day Christian that only reads from the NT will not fully understand either.</p>

<p>I am reading scripture tonight.  Do you have any favorite areas I should focus on ?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the Bible confirms at least 2 different books that should be considered canonical:</p>

<p><strong>Jashar</strong>
&quot;17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son, 18 and he said it should be taught to the people of Judah; behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar. He said:&quot;
- 2 Samuel 1:17-18</p>

<p>&quot;12 At that time Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel,</p>

<p>“Sun, stand still at Gibeon,
    and moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.”
13 
And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped,
    until the nation took vengeance on their enemies.</p>

<p>Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day. 14 There has been no day like it before or since, when the Lord heeded the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for Israel.&quot;
- Joshua 10:12-14</p>

<p><strong>Book of Wars</strong> (evidently a collection of songs/poems about war)
&quot;14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
15 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.&quot;
- Numbers 21:14-15</p>

<p>Enoch, curiously enough being the 7th from Adam (divine things occur on frequencies of this number. Such as we are coming into the 70th year since Israel was recognized, the 70th year since the Dead Sea Scrolls were uncovered &amp; more, all in the same year that the Revelation 12 sign occurs on Sept. 23... )</p>

<p>Enoch was also only 1 of 2 people recorded as being raptured and sparred from the first death (the other being Elijah)</p>

<p>&quot; 5 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. 6 And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.&quot;
- Hebrews 11:5-6</p>

<p>But I think if any verse accredits Enoch with the writing of a book it is found in the NT, right before the book of Revelations, in the very short letter of Jude:</p>

<p>&quot;14 It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, &#39;Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, 15 to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.&#39;&quot;
- Jude 14-15</p>

<p>The book of Enoch was also found in abundance in the Qumran Caves (Dead Sea Scrolls), and has been part of the Ethiopa canon of the scriptures as well. However, keep in mind that God is in control of His Word. If it has been &quot;lost&quot; all these years, it was intended to be so, and has been revealed again nearly 70 years. In particular it covers the Nefilim spoken of in Genesis 6 and Numbers 13:33, which is where you will find the real truth behind what all of those reptilian race, shape-shifting archon stuff, ET stuff is you read about on this sub.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s 3 books, we might as well add a 4th to come up to a nice round number of 70 canonical books like it probably is supposed to be, opposed to our more widely accepted 66 books. My personal guess would have to be the book of Jubilees, which was also found in the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have no idea where you are at in your spiritual search, but imo it is always a good thing to go back to the Book of John and re-read about our Christ, our Messiah, our King, Jesus of Nazareth. I think it&#39;s the most eloquently written of the 4 gospels, and is the same author as Revelation:</p>

<p>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.&quot;
- John 1:1-4</p>

<p>Sometimes it helps to substitute words with their meaning to help understand what the verse is saying. For instance, &quot;The Word&quot; is Jesus. When you read it with that inserted, it helps clarify the passage:</p>

<p>&quot;In the beginning was <strong>Jesus</strong>, and <strong>Jesus</strong>was with God, and <strong>Jesus</strong>was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me meditation was the single biggest positive change in my life. Changes in diet (organic fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, nuts, etc) are also important. If your body and mind are healthy then you will feel empowered to go and be the co-creator that you were born to be. </p>

<p>1) I would highly recommend daily meditation - even if you only start out at 1 minute, try working your way up to 10 minutes a day. This will gradually free your mind of the negative though loops that come about from one&#39;s cumulative life experience. While meditating you can try visualizing a single object such as a circle in your mind, or you can focus on your breath. There are many types of meditations with many great guides on youtube.</p>

<p>2) Fight with your dollar, buy food that wasn&#39;t grown using pesticides, support local businesses. By simply being a good example you can spread awareness. </p>

<p>When you get deep enough into meditation and spiritual practice you realize that you are a co-creator and that you have the freedom to positively influence the world in which you live. I&#39;d reccomend skimming through the Ascension Papers, stopping for a more careful look at the passages you find relate to your life <a href="https://zingdad.com/images/downloads/the_ascension_papers_book_1_-_zingdad.pdf">https://zingdad.com/images/downloads/the_ascension_papers_book_1_-_zingdad.pdf</a> - it is a great resource for changing to a more positive outlook and realizing your own power for positive change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mantak Chia is a good resource for learning internal practices such as meditation. His book Fusion of the Five Elements has some good practices which focus on healing your organs. Turns out alot of our emotional baggage is coming from toxicity and imbalance in our organs! Also his &quot;inner smile&quot; technique is the simplest and one of the most powerful transformative techiques that you can practice at any time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZT__DOuT_8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZT__DOuT_8</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s funny because I know you were just making a joke , but it&#39;s a truth that our aura has all the vibratory colors of a rainbow, swirling and mixing even as I speak. Each color is a tone and you can recognize that tone in each person you meet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh, you are not alone. There is a wave through the collective addressing to the very things you are noticing.</p>

<p>Ill put it this way, it&#39;s not a conspiracy thought is that more people are awake now and it&#39;s gaining momentum. You may not believe this but it has an affect on everyone&#39;s perception when the underlying current is moving stronger in Notincing what the cabal is doing.</p>

<p>But even more important is what are We doing? What are you doing? How come we are thinking what They are doing is what we should be doing?</p>

<p>We are all, I believe, in particular asking ourselves what is important now. What is important every moment, every choice we make we are noticing. </p>

<p>So to alter your perception now more than ever is to live for yourself and find what you love doing and be the type of person you want to be. Because in actuality The president, or government doesn&#39;t have to be perceived as controlling your life. They don&#39;t really. They have this illusion you can choose to be part of, but you can still exist and find what is the most beneficial to you in other ways and the adventure now would be to find those ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of good stuff included in the responses so far, but allow me to echo some: </p>

<p>Meditation and turning inward is crucial. It will help focus and ground you in actual reality rather than the illusion which is presented as reality. You are more powerful than you have been allowed to know, getting in touch with that power and doing the inner work (which means shining a light on the darkness inside and letting it go, forgiving yourself and others, realizing you can only control your actions, letting go of your ego, and working to consciously chose love over fear and hate at every fork in the road) is the key to becoming free. </p>

<p>Inner work alone isn&#39;t enough, as others have said you have choices which can make a difference in not just your life, but in the lives of those around you. Vote with your dollar and look for ways to improve the lives of others. It&#39;s through service to others that we can all help to build the kind of world everyone, even those still asleep, truly want. </p>

<p>Finally, remember that this is a school. We&#39;re here on this planet to learn. I believe we&#39;re here to learn to love without ego. Every day we&#39;re given dozens and dozens of choices, the more aware you become of the power of positive thinking, love, and compassion the easier the road will become. But, just like in school, you need recess. Do not let this new knowledge overwhelm you to the point of inertness. Inertness is death. Allow yourself the freedom to enjoy the world around you which - despite being painted as big and scary - is filled with love and opportunity. </p>

<p>/hippy rant :)</p>

<p>Yes, I admit that about 5% of the time, I fall into a little slump and feel negative and depressed about things too.</p>
