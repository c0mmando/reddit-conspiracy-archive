    <div class="md"><p>no, the boxes aren&#39;t networked.  They are programmed via a card, which is the vector the proof of hack concept was verified.  It is on youtube, if you search for dibold voter machine hacked.  I think I might be typoing the dibold name.  hmm.</p>

<p>So for it to be foreign, it would have to be them penetrated the ranks of whomever maintains the integrity of the voting boxes.  So possible but more likely a domestic hacking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Propaganda is an interesting choice of words.  DNC voter databases were hacked.  Public and private addresse systems were merged and built into a targeting system that aimed propaganda at susceptible people based on psychological profiles developed by Cambridge Analytica.  </p>

<p>Those same databases were also used to identify voters for purge lists in competitive states.  That particular tactic wasn&#39;t unique to this pst election.</p>

<p>Look up the trace dns and ip evidence white hats are posting on twitter.  Russian fingerprints ALL over these efforts.  Even Wikipedia all of a sudden added a server in Russia.  Self identified conservative and liberal hackers have been very busy posting the evidence.</p>

<p>Putin overplayed his hand this time.  There will be severe sanctions against Russia after the dust settles and dozens of Americans in jail.</p>

<p>Is the innuendo here that Cambridge Analytica used data obtained from the DNC voter databases?    How about this you provide evidence that the Russians hacked DNC voter databases!</p>

<p>Really...ip evidence?   Please provide evidence that it was Russian intelligence. </p>

<p>What makes you think that Americans will be in jail.  The Russian sanctions are obvious.  As long as Russia is compromising American hegemony, the Trilaterals will try to contain it. Ergo they are insane!</p>

<p>Re: the ip and Dns data, Give me about an hour and I&#39;ll post the proof that&#39;s out there.  PITA but I&#39;ve been meaning to start a doc to archive all the proof, theories, etc for awhile.  There has been some really quality work done on this and people should and will be recognized.</p>

<p>Thanks for the prodding to get it done.  </p>

<p>BTW, it&#39;s all private citizens posting their work.  They can only see so deep into the grid.  The Feds have a much neater case made.  They can see all the way down.  Remember, the internet as we know it is a creation of the defense department.</p>
