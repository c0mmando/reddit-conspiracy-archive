<p>I&#39;m not saying that him being fired isn&#39;t suspicious in terms of the Russia investigation, but stop defending a man who doesn&#39;t give a flying fuck about Americans and stop commenting foolish shit like &quot;he&#39;s a good guy...&quot; &quot;he was just doing his job...&quot; Please point me to a few examples of when Comey was actually this stand-up guy some of you would like to believe he is, and when he actually did the job he was hired for. I&#39;m all for discussions on the possibility of the Russia investigation being the cause of him being fired, but I&#39;ll be fucking damned if you all expect me to defend people like James Comey just because of the POSSIBILITY that he was fired because of his involvement on investigating this supposed Russia/Trump collusion. </p>

<p>Regardless of whatever bullshit reasons the Trump admin will offer to explain why he was fired, I&#39;m more than happy to see Comey go, and you should be too. I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing who he chooses to replace Comey and all of the conspiracy related discussions that will follow that decision, but the Russia investigation angle will not sway my opinion on Comey being a horrible director of the FBI. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that it may not have been his responsibility to make a recommendation, and Loretta Lynch was saving her own ass by referring to him on that, but as the director of one of our leading law enforcement agencies, the findings of his investigation should have been enough to warrant an arrest regardless of intent, and since Lynch DID choose to deflect to him, his decision to not recommend charges shows that he is unfit to be in that position because he chose politics over the law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See now you&#39;re going from conspiracy land to the real world, and it&#39;s important to point out where your wrong. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the findings of his investigation should have been enough to warrant an arrest regardless of intent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not true. The legal opinion is that the &quot;gross negligence&quot; part of the espionage act is unconstitutional and cannot be successfully prosecuted, and an attempt at this would risk striking down the whole espionage act down. In fact there has never been anyone successfully convicted under &quot;gross negligence&quot; and the most recent attempt at prosecution was a 100 years ago. No sane prosecutor would bring that case to a judge. Comey, as a lawyer, recommended that no indictments be brought because doing so would be completely fruitless.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not denying or accepting that Hillary did bad stuff, but that&#39;s conspiracy land, but Comey had no evidence of intent, and given his evidence no indictments was the right call in the real world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Espioange act is very specific, either purposefully giving classified intel to the enemy or being so grossly negligent as to allow the enemy to steal classified intel. </p>

<p>As far as I know, nobody has ever been taken to court over gross negligence. This is considered the unconstitutional part of the law and can&#39;t be used. </p>

<p>Can the prosecution prove beyond reasonable doubt that Hillary intended to give classified info to US enemies? The answer is absolutely no, and even under a preponderance of the evidence standard, you couldn&#39;t even prove that Hillary intended to give enemies classified intel. </p>

<p>Private email servers are not illegal on their own. So intent to have a private email server is not a crime. Many state secretaries and past federal employees used them and had classified data on them. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if someone has been taken to court for it in the past, there is always a first time. No one else has set up their own private server and passed classified information through it. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t have to prove that she wanted to give it to enemies.
They don&#39;t have to prove intent</p>

<p>She HAD to have intent, by printing out these documents from secured systems, and then scanning them back in on an unsecured network. That is the only way she got classified documents out of their secure location.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like my other comment got down voted without any reply. Anyway, here&#39;s where we disagree ...</p>

<p>You seem to have not recognized that Donald Trump&#39;s earlier appointments have been absolutely atrocious -- beyond anything that would even seem possible.</p>

<p>You seem to believe -- and this is far too common -- that taking some &quot;man who doesn&#39;t give a flying fuck about Americans&quot; should be replaced even where the only option is someone who is literally against Americans. Unfortunately for those who continue to believe this, history shows that replacing the ambivalent, the bad, or the corrupt OFTEN produces a worse situation than NOT doing so -- and that the worse situation may become entrenched and hard to undo -- while meanwhile REAL PEOPLE suffer from the result.</p>

<p>And here&#39;s where we agree ...</p>

<p>Uh no. Tucker is openly conservative and doesn&#39;t pretend to be a liberal. John Stewart is a liberal and doesnt pretend to be a conservative.</p>

<p>When Tucker says he&#39;s trying to be fair it means he criticizes conservatives and praises democrats sometimes. When John Stewart says hes a &quot;partisan hack&quot; what he REALLY means is &quot;I dont like your conservative views&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Benghazi was and absolutely <strong>IS</strong> a non-issue. FFS, did you not notice how even this subs hero Trey Gowdy hasn&#39;t said a peep about Benghazi since the campaign? Do you not see how disgustingly partisan that investigation was? We are lambasting the administration for statements said immediately after a firefight in a foreign nation, not to mention we have focused so incredibly on a type of firefight that is far from uncommon.</p>

<p>Just watch Tom Rick talk about this on Fox News, in which he talks about the highly politicized nature of this entire &quot;investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbUz3pIPmTY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbUz3pIPmTY</a>&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Hindsight is 20/20. Do you know how many requests from how many embassies and other organizations ask for additional security? I&#39;m gonna go on a limb here and say no, and that if they did honor every such request we&#39;d need 10x as many troops as we have right now. </p>

<p>Also, here&#39;s a quote from Politifact:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/mike-pence/mike-pences-false-claim-about-clintons-role-and-re/">http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/mike-pence/mike-pences-false-claim-about-clintons-role-and-re/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Others have accused Clinton of ignoring requests for more security for the Benghazi consulate. It’s undeniable that officials in Libya repeatedly asked for better security, but there’s no evidence that Clinton herself was aware or that she willfully denied them.&quot;</p>

<p>Where is the crime here? Where is the negligence?</p>

<p>I thought the logic dictated that there is no evidence of collusion. And even if there were, the extent of Russian intervention was the leaking of real, damning emails of a massively corrupt politician.</p>

<p>The story was that Russia interfered. It&#39;s almost been a year and no one has provided anybevidence or specifics. Why is that? Russian collusion has been a story for half a year, but still no evidence? What is going on? If the evidence has been available and surveillance has gathered that evidence, why is the investigation so important? Seems like that should have already borne fruit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was coercion by more than just Lynch, and prob involved Obama Clinton and other cronies and I have a feeling they were coming down on him pretty hard. And i think he announced the reopening of H&#39;s investigation in October bc people within the FBI were angry about the original decision and forced his hand.... as a result, he was then threatened even more by the Clinton camp leading him to announce it was closed again. There&#39;s no telling what kind of dirt they had on him, his own people and the people he was investigating. Blackmail is a great tool for manipulation and we know how much our govt loves to use it :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I think, bear with me: The FBI would normally turn over the findings of an investigation to the DOJ for prosecution, but when Lynch came out and publicly declared that she would follow the FBI&#39;s recommendation on the matter <em>before</em> the investigation was complete, she effectively left Comey holding the bag, forcing him to let H off the hook weeks before the election. They (Lynch and the Clintons) were counting on him doing whatever he could to preserve the political impartiality of the FBI during a presidential campaign. They knew that when forced to make a decision, Comey would choose to postpone any action against Clinton until after the election, so that the FBI would not be seen as playing any political role in tilting the election one way or the other. In the end, however, his efforts to protect the bureau from any political backlash ended up costing him his job. He&#39;s basically the fall guy in a well crafted conspiracy by Clinton Inc. to stave off an indictment until after Hillary was already president.</p>

<p>Yes, he&#39;s also NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE INVESTIGATIONS LIKE THIS PUBLIC OR TO INTERFERE IN ELECTIONS. Funny how people seem to forget the worst of his misdeeds and have instead honed in on one tiny part of that charade. </p>

<p>I see, so that explains why Republicans never tried to charge Hillary with anything, and this ofc includes the Trump administration. It&#39;s nice that this sub is so convinced of her guilt, but her largest detractors in positions to actually do something about her guilt, don&#39;t seem to think so. </p>

<p>Also, here&#39;s the law (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1924):">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1924):</a></p>

<p>Note the bolded words. If you are referring to a different statute, I&#39;d love to see it. </p>

<p>Yes, Clinton intended to mishandle 8 classified E-mails out of 10s of thousands. Why you ask? Because reasons. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before the past months&#39; controversies, Comey, a former deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, was perhaps best known for a remarkable 2004 standoff with top officials over a federal domestic surveillance program.
In March of that year, Comey rushed to the hospital bed of Attorney General John Ashcroft to physically stop White House officials in their bid to get his ailing boss to reauthorize a secret no-warrant wiretapping program.
Comey described the incident in 2007 testimony to Congress, explaining that he believed the spy program put in place after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks was legally questionable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why so obtuse tho?  Not OP, but the implication is that Trump doesn&#39;t have to do anything his AG or deputy AG says and he certainly doesn&#39;t have to do it right when it looks insanely suspicious.  It&#39;s also suspicious that the deputy AG is a Trump appointed subordinate of Sessions who recused himself from the Trump campaign/Russia investigation directly after being called out for making false statements before Congress about his own contacts with Russian &quot;diplomats&quot; during the same time he was working for the Trump campiagn; and who is also almost certainly under investigation himself. </p>

<p>Sessions has said his talks with the Russians were about other matters. I would guess you don&#39;t believe him, but it&#39;s certainly plausible he would have other reasons to talk to Russian diplomats as he was a senator at the time.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand the way US attorney&#39;s are appointed. Obama didn&#39;t appoint Rosenstein.  Bush did.  Obama neglected to nominate a replacement.  You can say that Rosenstein served under Obama, but Obama didn&#39;t appoint him.  Surely you can recognize the difference between selecting someone for a job and simply deciding not to fire them.  Saying Rosenstein is an Obama appointee is like saying Comey is a Trump appointee. </p>

<p>Comey enjoyed short lived derision and praise from either party at different times depending on whether his actions helped either party&#39;s political agenda.  Not really all that meaningful given the political motives of either party to praise him and censure him.

<p>Why did the letter specifically say Trump wasnt under investigation. So how could it be treason?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comey said <em>these exact words</em>, under oath:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The F.B.I., as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 Presidential election, and <strong>that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.</strong>” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump himself may not be individually under investigation, but his campaign as a whole is, and we know for a fact that some members of his campaign had unsavory connections with the Russian government. His first campaign manager had to be fired after his connections became public.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the letter specifically say Trump wasnt under investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did Trump use misleading language to downplay active investigations into his campaign&#39;s connections with Russia?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, why would he do that??? You tell me.</p>

<p>Why are you acting like a letter that Trump wrote is an unbiased or valid source of information on this topic?</p>

<p>You are not doing a whole lot to dispel the earlier impression you made, that you have worse reasoning skills than a child.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The circumstances behind the firing would allow any person with two brain cells to rub together to see how it is probable that Trump did this to cover his own ass.</p>

<p>If Obama had fired the acting director of the FBI while said director of the FBI was investigating his campaign for colluding with a foreign government to undermine American democracy, you wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Well there&#39;s no reason to believe Obama had a bad reason to do this&quot;.</p>

<p>It was a huge document. Some parts were false, others were verifiably true. If someone gives you a 100 page document but one thing on page 83 was false, does that mean the entire thing is fake?</p>

<p>Nonsense.  Comey had nothing because there is nothing there.  If this is not correct, some other agency can easily bring forward the concerns.  Every report that has come out, however, has failed to establish any connection with Russians, so what exactly is the claim?</p>

I think it is pretty fucked up to fire a dude who is leading an investigation into your administration.

    <div class="md"><p>Comey had six months to come up with something concrete re the Russian investigation, but he has come up empty handed.  The investigation will go forward.  I believe Comey was using the Russia thing to protect him from firing . . . he in turn is in a position to protect other Washington insiders.  Distracting everyone keeps thins in play and theoretically prevents Trump from moving forward.  Well, Trump has decided to more forward.  </p>

<p>It is not even clear at this point what the Russians presumably did to impact the election or how they might have been involved with Trump.  The Russians had no impact on the election. This was a fishing expedition/delay tactic. </p>

<p>Yaaaawn. This again? If she was so &quot;guilty and corrupt&quot; why hasn&#39;t Trump ordered Sessions to file charges against her, or hired that &quot;Special Prosecutor.&quot; </p>

<p>FFS Comey sucks, but not because he didn&#39;t recommend charges against Clinton, but because he actively interfered in the election by releasing information regarding Clinton&#39;s investigation, but did not due to same with the investigation into the Trump camp&#39;s ties to Russia, which had started in JULY. The idea that Comey somehow helped Clinton but hurt is so ludicrous and out of touch with reality that it&#39;s simply astounding that people would even have the remotest notion that was the case.</p>

But then draining the swamp was already dead by day one,  and there has never even been a pretense of justice or rule of law from the day that Trump took office.   His fat stinking ass is no better than Obama&#39;s skinny ass,  just two different flavors of the people getting shafted.    One favored identity politics more.

<p>The people who are rushing to the Saturday night massacre comparisons have a blind spot for Obama.  Obama aggressively targeted the media and leakers used IRS to target political enemies.  He Funneled DOJ money to community organizing groups and politicized the intelligence services.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its already been established that Comey was compromised along with his boss Loretta Lynch. I could care less about Comey, this has nothing to do with defending his actions (and inactions), and everything to with the nonexistent check-and-balances system in our country. Nothing screams more obviously corrupt than firing someone who is investigating you for illegal activities, right after members of your staff are subpoenaed. And then you have the authority to hire the next person who will lead the investigation against you. At least with the democrats they did their damnedest to cover this shit up (I&#39;m being facetious here). Trump and his team are so painfully obvious its not even a fucking conspiracy anymore. Anyone who still believes Trump is going to live up to his campaign promises, and wasn&#39;t corrupt from the very start is living under a rock. Anyone that believes our government is a fucking democracy is living under a rock. The whole lot of them, Republicans and Democrats, are all corrupt to the core and are compromised at any given time by a number of constituents. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Again, Obama then appointed him for US attorney.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t understand the way US attorney&#39;s are appointed. Obama didn&#39;t appoint Rosenstein.  Bush did.  Obama neglected to nominate a replacement.  You can say that Rosenstein served under Obama, but Obama didn&#39;t appoint him.  Surely you can recognize the difference between selecting someone for a job and simply deciding not to fire them.  Saying Rosenstein is an Obama appointee is like saying Comey is a Trump appointee. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, more recently, Comey enjoyed bipartisan derision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comey enjoyed short lived derision and praise from either party at different times depending on whether his actions helped either party&#39;s political agenda.  Not really all that meaningful given the political motives of either party to praise him and censure him.  And if you&#39;re like me, and don&#39;t generally trust either party, bipartisan support doesn&#39;t really mean much to begin with. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has said over and over again that the question clearly implied a certain type of contact </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I don&#39;t buy it.  I&#39;ve got a bridge to sell you if you do. </p>
