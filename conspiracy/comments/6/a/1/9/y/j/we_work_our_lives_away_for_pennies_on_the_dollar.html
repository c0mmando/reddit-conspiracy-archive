       This morning I was awoken by my alarm clock powered by electricity generated by the public power monopoly regulated by the US department of energy. I then took a shower in the clean water provided by the municipal water utility. After that, I turned on the TV to one of the FCC regulated channels to see what the national weather service of the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration determined the weather was going to be like using satellites designed, built, and launched by the national aeronautics and space administration. I watched this while eating my breakfast of US department of agriculture inspected food and taking the drugs which have been determined as safe by the food and drug administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the appropriate time as regulated by the US congress and kept accurate by the national institute of standards and technology and the US naval observatory, I get into my national highway traffic safety administration approved automobile and set out to work on the roads built by the local, state, and federal departments of transportation, possibly stopping to purchase additional fuel of a quality level determined by the environmental protection agency, using legal tender issued by the federal reserve bank. On the way out the door I deposit any mail I have to be sent out via the US postal service and drop the kids off at the public school.
      </p>
      <p>
       After work, I drive my NHTSA car back home on the DOT roads, to house which has not burned down in my absence because of the state and local building fire codes and fire marshal's inspection, and which has not been plundered of all its valuables thanks to the local police department.
      </p>
      <p>
       I then log on to the internet which was developed by the defense advanced research projects administration and post on freerepublic.com and fox news forums about how SOCIALISM in medicine is BAD because the government can't do anything right.

       Give me a break. I agree with the clean water but that's about it. The food that most of us eat in the morning is filled with artificial hormones and shit. The roads suck. Fiat currency makes us all slaves. Public schools are indoctrination camps. My alarm clock is my phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is not some kind of magical force. Most of the stuff they do they just hire private contractors anyway. The government usually gets in the way. But keep being a sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying ALL government is bad but to act as if they provide our lifeforce and all great things in life is a joke.

       I can get on the road and drive to any major city.  Compare this to India, where you can be traveling down a road that will eventually lead nowhere and you have to backtrack.  What alternative do you suggest?  Roads are clearly not a free market.

       So you are telling me that in an unregulated system, the food would be filled with less 'hormones and shit'?  How would that work?

      <p>
       Camps for what?  Educating your kids should be mandatory and the public schools do a decent job.  It's all about what you put into it and how much your parents instill the value of an education.  What would parents do if they couldn't afford to send their kids to public school?  Would you prefer higher illiteracy among the poorest Americans?

      <p>
       There are aspects of society that affects everyone relatively equally: the need for clean water, the need for a transportation system, a system to ensure law and order, a system to treat disease, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of decisions are best handled on an individual level.  But for problems that affect an entire community, does it not make sense that the community come together to solve the problem?  If that makes me a sheep by your retarded definition, then I guess I'm a sheep.

       Mate, that's happening today for millions of people... Half of the U.S. is below the poverty line, and there are millions of homeless children. People get thrown in cages for non-violent victim-less crimes at a higher rate than any other country in the world. More than half of the planet is malnourished. You're perspective is limited by the media ignoring the fact that most of the population is barely surviving, they only show the minority of the world that is at least getting by. It creates the perspective that more people are living better than ever before, when really its less people living better and more people suffering and paying for the few to be comfortable. All the wealthy countries are wealthy merely through the oppression and subjugation of other cultures throughout the world. All of your comfort comes on the back of slavery.

       I dont disagree with that i was just talking about specifically modern america.  Trust me im the first one to call out new age slavery when people try to praise americas economy and shit, but that doesnt change the fact that id rather exist now than 200 years ago when being a slave meant you were literally just a garden tool that came out of the shed when it was time to be used

       Yeah i get it. You're just more aware than many of the people your age. Im 40 and its the same but, people are more worried about paying bills and keeping their families safe and secure to embark on world changing adventures for the sake of humanity. When your young your peers dont care and when you get older people know and understand but are too set in their ways and wrapped up in their own lives to really make a difference.

       im the same, im 25 now, but have felt this way since i was like 16. when i started waking up to the world, i lost all of my superficial friends, leaving me with just one friend, who was just like me. deep conversations about life, the universe, etc. but she moved away and im all alone now. it really sucks when you cant find and connect with like minded people, but when you do, its the greatest thing ever. your friendships will be much more fulfilling. id rather be alone than be with people who dont give a shit, or are not fully aware, of whats going on in the world and in life. 
ive found that i met more like minded people when i stepped out of my comfort zone. like for example, when i went backpacking. or when i go on extended camping trips. like minded people are out there, they are just not in the cities, not the people with the meaningless jobs and existences. where i live, im surrounded by people who are comfortable living within the confines that the government allows us to live. to find people who arent into that, you have to get out of those places of comfort, those places that are 'the norm'. if this makes any sense, im awful at explaining things lol
i probably went way off topic here, but yeah, like minded people and shit :p

       I'm a military vet and I worked in state corrections awhile
 I've been all over the world and been around many types of people young and old. I did a honestly with a French family as a youth. I have never felt truly connected to another person who understood or saw life beyond the veneer of just trying to make it through the day or week. My fellow Christians mean well but are just as unintentionally ignorant.

       21 y/o here, I felt very similar until recently when I opened up to my friends about it and found we all agreed to some degree about wars freedom and the like. A lot of us, especially our age group, are afraid to speak up (or if they do they aren't represented in Media etc as some have said) because the other half of us is brainwashed to a violent AntiFa standard almost. Try not to lose hope friend. God bless. If you need someone your age to talk to about this stuff just pm me! :)

       30 here, lots of people know the basics on a superficial level: TPTB have corrupted government, wars are mostly bullshit, the media lies, fiat money is a joke (inflation), the stock market is rigged, etc. The BIG problem is most people worry about their jobs, money, bills and are trapped in the 9-5 rat race and are exhausted at the end of the day. If you factor in the commute a lot of people are tied up at work for 12 hours/day. People just don't have the energy.

       Can't place your hope in any of it, but you can exist outside of it. Cancel all of your subscriptions to Cultural Marxists companies (Netflix, etc) and use that money to support real independent journalists, podcasts, and radio. Start a blog and share your values, and don't worry about what all the nutty pop culture morons are preoccupied with.

       Actually they only want some of us as slaves, they want to exterminate everyone else. Then there's the fact that they are constantly programming (brainwashing) you with their occult (satanic) images, ideas, rituals, etc. Most everything is propaganda meant to infiltrate your deepest subconscious thoughts. It's such a depressing reality we live in and what makes it even worse is that most people are completely asleep.

       Yeah I have a hard time making friends with people in the "real world" because all I talk about are books I read, insightful thinkers (Terrence McKenna, David Ike, Graham Hancock, etc), conspiracy theories, or really anything that gets my brain thinking outside of the box. But I always get met with the fluoride stare. There are a few people I have met along my path that are very open minded and realize that I do not believe everything I read or hear, but they realize I like talking about it just for the sake of talking about it rather than talk shit about people, or talk about drugs, or some dumb ass TV show. The people I work with can't even believe I haven't watched TV for like 3 years.

       You seem to forget that there have been protests and marches around the world in resistance to what's been going on. Maybe you feel depressed because you're not doing enough to take control of your own life. Here's a test: out of all the things you mentioned how many of them affect you directly? And out of those, what have you done to make it better?

       I hustled my ass off, sometimes 2 jobs, then got a gig doing 7 days a week 12 hours a day sometimes for 7 months straight before any off days. Also my sister is coinvested and she does writer retreats their with her dog so it made it easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily I grew with slavic mother's side of the family where several generations live together under one roof to split the costs of bills, to split the responsibilities, and so its easier for each person to save, however in my family being the oldest son, it means when my Mother retires, she has to come stay with me and I have to be the caretaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know some friends who grew up together who crowd sourced a get away lake cabin between the 5 of them with legal contracts. They each get fair share of the place or sometimes go together to party/chill/long weekends...most are having kids now so its more chill, but still gives you an idea of what's possible/
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't do any of that, at the very least become a minimalist materially speaking, learn mediation/breaks from here, and save a dog from your local shelter. My dog is my best friend I ever had and learn to appreciate your time with your friend, fetch, walks, etc. Makes the heaviness here a lot easier

       Embrace healthy nihilism, spend less time consuming spirit crushing news, especially when your inner light is dim. The rabbit hole is deep, and the darkness is exotic, enticing... It contains all of the knowledge, nothing is unknown in the dark, but remember your positivity protects you (flip a light on in a dark room, darkness cannot exist) the deeper we go, the more truth we digest, the more powerful we must become spirituality/physically and mentally. Increasing one without the others is unhealthy, take care of yourself first, the world and its people will never change until they decide it for themselves, all you can change is you - so work on yourself and breathe in your positive, do pushups, take cold showers and destroy your comfort zone, you will be comfortable everywhere when you regain the force. the real world around you will begin to change as you embrace your power and take back your control, it can be done, but only I can do it ~

       If that's what you took from that then cool, found the group of people you flex on. Trying to help a person through depressed feelings through self empowerment is a great method. No one can fix the worlds problems and we can go years carrying the weight of the world on our backs, simply reminding that positive thinking can help to clear mental, emotional and physical weight/pain we carry over the years, eventually you fight yourself if you carry to much

       You will hopefully throw off the ''ownership paradigm'' that has infected you from the NEW Age cult.

       <br/>
       Attend a meeting.

        https://www.google.com/search?q=arcane+school+conference
       </a>
       <br/>
       Examine cults and ''ownership based'' pseudo spiritual teachings.
       <br/>
       Avoid them. Maybe the ''weight of the world on your back'' will show itself to be an illusion of your own making,as you stop greedily trying to create things for your personal ownership. Problems are also something you can decide you own as a possession. New Age cults feed on that.
       <br/>
       Other ''ownership'' cults are the Course in Miracles, Eckencar, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Tibetan Buddhism.

       Examine closely for when cults trick you into thinking you own something.
       <br/>
       Just be. Chill out and stop trying to have things.
       <br/>
       Be and do. Pretty simple.

       Demographic studies have shown more people have depression and anxiety. The cause is addiction to mobile phones. Microwaves also cause social isolation, cognitive decline and zombies.

       I believe addiction and depression are not mutually exclusive, and agree entirely, to much screen and not enough dream. A healthy amount of anger comes up when we learn how much deception has shaped who we are since being thrown into a rich mans game, and letting all of that go so we can continue growing our spirits rather than copping out in the face of our true nature with numbing addictions is a very hard process, but I like to think a guy like Wim Hof has a lot to teach us when it come to our bodies ability to heal these traumas with no outside help or medicine. All of the programming is within us to find balance and self empowerment through breathing, exercise, cold showers - just smashing the comfort zone we've built, not letting anyone in or out... letting ourselves re-enter the garden to once again play, helps us rise above our low level emotions back to self love. Addiction and depression are in my opinion clear signs of disconnection with the heart, and the weight of our world (with a lot of baggage) is certainly felt on our backs or on our chest. We were raised to consume media and food with little sustenance and I believe eventually our body cant move on in this way so we manifest disease, and usually drug ourselves back to sleep. Learning how to remain human with empathy in tact is a challenging road and sobriety/facing it all will likely be the biggest trip we take - mushrooms help

       I just started researching whether radiofrequency and electromagnetic fields disconnect our sense of being connected with the earth, nature, pets and people. I believe they affect the ability to sense when someone is staring at you or sense someone or a pet is in the same room.  Colin Ross hypothesized people can sense the EMF emitted by staring. If so, the EMF emitted by our devices could interfere with our sensing natural EMF. Hence, causing social isolation and apathy towards activism.

       Completely agree and have actually had a conversation with someone recently who was touching on the 5th element in the upper atmosphere, which I haven't researched, but similar the work of Masaru Emoto with intentions and their effects on water, disruption in the emf field and its corresponding material manifestation with certain elements key to life - and the lack of harmony/increased disruption in all these areas have a huuuuge effect on our health. Im stoked to check that pdf and glad you mentioned that. Energized Quartz is a great thing to carry at all times...

       p.s I used the use of "I" once in that entire post, the last sentence, which is a quote. Suggesting one uses the force for the good is clear evidence that Im talking about being a jedi. In which case one must lose ones self to regain the force. dont let your anger towards hippy yoga types, who knows one of them might be your princess laya with ya I've heard it all type muthafucka bitch ass

       ''weight of the world on your back''
       <br/>
       come on man. 
If you think Tony Robbins is so great, why don't you go for some serious training in NLP, just like he did?
       <br/>
       Crack a Milton Erickson book. See what Tony studied, before he scammed loads of unwitting beginners.

       It may seem like ''the weight of the world'' if you are aiming for personal limitations.

       Ticket to Heaven (1981)

       David is a young man seduced by a religious cult that uses starvation, exhaustion, and brainwashing to mold recruits into money hustling disciples of a messiah-like leader.
       <br/>
       Roger Ebert-- ''What makes the movie absolutely spellbinding is that it shows us not only how he is recruited into the group, but how anyone could be indoctrinated into one of the many cults in America today. This is a movie that has done its research, and it is made with such artistry that we share the experience of the young man. ''

       I'm not sure what any of this is about with the whole intro to cults and ownership of things ( I too live in a forest and grow caneebus and hike to waterfalls ) and completely agree with many of your points, just not understanding why you thing I preach what you say I preach. I rarely however debate anything online but seeing as you've been on this site for 8 years and I have only been scouring it off and on for about a year. I don't fully understand or trust anything posted on this site nor do I wish to maintain using it for much longer, as there are many great things to be building and producing and adding, and while In felt this sub to be a bit more open to thoughts, I was simply presenting my perspective to someone who researches things a bit deeper than the average ignorant human, travelling into unknown places and dealing with topics above the subconsious and martial strengths required for war, because there is a real spiritual war, star wars isn't just a fariy tale and Im not spouting a group message. I have died and come back, a tumor in the back of my skull before removal at 14 took me somewhere I hope never to go again, and if not for dmt, acid, and mushrooms and natural trips through universal technology, time, rhythm, and sound, I would not be here today to discuss anything with anyone in similar dark place. hating on new age or whatever, I know folks in all places from all walks who are real, and some who act. whatever label, its not black and white, its a choice, and we are the opinions we place on others of any category, if you really want to just be I recommend less arguments on reddit for no apparent reason.

       Its a comedy act bro. Remember when I was on Dead tour in the 80s, telling kids that they were in a CIA cult? Yeah that was me. They used to spin me the fuck out, and I mean index card fluff in my face, no joke. Some of the upper level hated me for talking my shit, but I also had certain pranksters that took me under their wing, and smiled at me when I would talk my shit. Happy that I wasn't a zombie drinking the literal dogmatic Koolaide. I know they know I know, and many of them are my friends. I just realized one day where I was, looking around the scene, and figured it out. So many people have admitted it to me, its hilarious. I stopped yelling on Dead lot about it in 88 and never went to shows again. But I still know people. I live in California in the Cannabis business. It's not like I can avoid them, LOL.

       I'm thinking Terrapin will be filled with single mothers on Sunday, so I'll see ya there, to check out the cuties. LOL

       I lived on a Herkimer mine for 3 years. That is a funny funny place to be , to hear the variety of word salads available. Silence is golden. Any time one is not keenly aware of the 5+ senses, one is in trance state. There are three properties to reality ... Existence, awareness, and acceptance. Similar to water being wet, liquid, transparent, and no other discernable qualities.

       Google  : amanita muscaria religion , and find a whole world of dubious info, and some academic stuff that's pretty interesting. 
Then there are all of these people, some fiction writers, and some scholars, tackling the psychedelics and religion subject, including R Gordon Wasson, and Albert Hoffman.

       I read it a month or so back. Fascinating read. People have become complacent to the fact that WW3 has a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       chance of happening within the near future. Which should scare everyone.

       The destruction of the family and the promotion of homosexuality and transgenderism is part of their plot as well to cull the population.  They are also promoting the normalization of pedophilia to destroy the lines of morality.  By destroying families, boys grow up not knowing how to be men and are emasculated by the new leading role of the empowered woman.  There will be no men left to fight back for their freedom.

       Every single god damned day there's another post like this that goes straaaaight to the top complaining about issues resulting from capitalism but refusing to levy any blame whatsoever towards it, even though it's literally the foundation of power for these "extremely rich sociopaths" who pay us "pennies on the dollar." Fucking blows my mind how so many are willfully blind to this, complaining on the one hand about the oligarchy while on the other rushing to defend the system of private capital ownership upon which the oligarchs' power relies.

       I agree with everything except the first part. Get yourself an education, even a two year technical degrees that is much less expensive and in high demand, and you will not be working for "pennies on the dollar". Complaining about that is the same victim ideology BLM activists, feminists, and other whiny leftists express everyday that doesn't fix anything.

       People can't all be happy with the same thing, but the more you can get away from the lowest levels of employment and living areas helps. Also, don't buy in to the idea that the material ($$) and the vacuous people who promote it are having a better life, because they are controlled and being used. They are living a deceptive life built on the wrong  principles of greed and status. The TV is lying, don't watch it, news is garbage, really the only way to feel good is to search meaning out for yourself. And give your life the meaning your want it to show, like helping others out, volunteering, working for somewhere that has ethics (yeah, I'm not sure where that is either) but have hope! You really can't force the people who don't know yet to understand.  Just lead the way for them and hopefully they will realize what you are doing /talking about and go back to you when they begin to see it. Every day ask yourself, what can I do to improve my situation, 1 small thing and keep building! Just start with one small change...

       Smartphone addiction is a really big one among those concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me the distinction between searching and checking has made all the difference in overcoming my smartphone addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Searching is when you go on your phone with a specific purpose/goal in mind
      </p>
      <p>
       Checking is when you go on your phone simply to stave off boredom or satisfy curiosity

       Seek adrenaline in any way possible, I've been boxing for 2 months and it's the best thing I could do for myself after I was too old for football.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best part about it is that most of the people I'm boxing with are so tired of their routines we talk about anything at any time, once you punched the face of someone you don't feel like you can't talk about something with him, so you open up and end up learning there are a lot of people like you, they just don't like to talk about it.

       Th bathroom thing is so a non-issue. Businesses could just have one or more single-occupancy restrooms. Many already do and then have Men and Women written on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a solution that won't cost a billion dollars: Take out the words Men and Women and instead write Restroom on them.
