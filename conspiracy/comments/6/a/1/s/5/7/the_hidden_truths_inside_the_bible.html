       You need to meditate and see that the biblical stories are about those who were on the journey of mastering their respective minds. The God of the Jews/Christians is the war God Jehovah. Muslims worship his brother Allah. Amen-RA, (who we coin as Jesus nowadays) is the one they answer to during the end of the End Times, (mid 2020)

       If you are saying that because in the English we have the word Amen, that this must be talking about another Gods proper name, then this is poor textual criticism. If so, then everytime you see the word Verily (or at least 101x) in the new testament, you have to put in the name of that God. Its a word that means true, firm, or faithful.

       Aka Jehovah. The book tries to percieve the serpent(kundalini) as Satan so that it can control the populace by having them pray to Jehovah or turn them to Allah and then complete the ultimate blasphemy by ending their prayers with Amen. Amen-Ra is the true savior, but people can't seem to grasp that every religion, every greek and roman mythology, ALL came from Egypt.

       The way I look at it, many religions all had similar spiritual links and there underlying messages are all the same. We can learn much by learning about all different religions and opening our minds to it. It really changes your perspective of it all, and just further supports our own spirituality.

       Psychedelic are only a short cut to astral realm. It's difficult to control. Psychedelic are certainly useful for breaking through, but habitual use should not be necessary once you truly enlighten yourself.

       My acid trip had changed my life and opened my eyes. And I microdosed for a bit. However, I always thought of the beetles song, Day Tripper. Acid, DMT, etc are shortcuts that can help, but don't depend on them.

       What if that's still this world, the dark world? This world is getting healed, but astral travel and those things, from what I can tell (so don't claim to know for sure) can give people bad experiences, and possibly get manipulated into some agenda. So obviously only you know, I just wanted to mention that because I heard bad stories. But i have had some very good positive experiences and it didn't involve that, but definitely did involve a strong feeling of love for all humanity. That's the only way I can really know a religious experience.

       To provide that much evidence in one reply is honestly more work than I'm willing to do. It's a lifetime of research into the subject but I will say in short that you have to remember the modern bible is composed of a series of books. These were borrowed from oral histories from many varied cultures. The first books were written in biblical hebrew and aramaic.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're talking about heady, cerebral subjects such as god and religion in general, even a fluent speaker can be lost for words. The act of translating these old languages is a challenge on it's own, not to mention the challenge of translating concepts and ideas that don't cross cultural barriers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The etymology of the bible is a very interesting study. If you're really interested in it, I'd suggest reading the book The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. Whether or not you'll subscribe to his theories isn't important, but he offers a breakdown and study of possible translations for the biblical hebrew. He has one interpretation, but reading it will allow you to see why there is a lot of debate over translations in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this helps somewhat.

       Man first worshiped the sun because it gave him light and heat.  When it set, it got dark and cold. Man praised each sunrise.  As time went on, he lay in the fields looking at the stars. Over time he gave star sets names to help identify them and later noticed these sets had an annual pattern. He began to use them as a calendar of sorts, planting crops when the virgin was in the sky, reap when they saw the water bearer or whatever in the sky.  This is the reason Mithra, Horus, Jesus, an a host of others down through the ages have all been born of virgins, died, rose from the dead, were here to save mankind, celebrated on the winter solace (Dec 25th) and spring (Easter). It's why they were the son (of) god, The Light,  etc.   And the bible was written to help convince people it was something more.... it was Caesar who called the council of Nicaea and defined Jesus as a god, not the bible. He was only a man prior to Caesar deciding he was instead a god or son of. Nothing metaphysical, nothing spiritual... not even religious.  It was used to help control.  Catholics invented hell.

       Those men who learned of what the sun, the moon, and the stars were all practiced meditation as if the act of meditation was religion. They also didn't speak as they could look at each other and read each others thoughts because they were in tune with themselves. Much like my friends and I are re learning to do. You'd be surprised at how many times you're around someone you both are talking to each other in your head. You just can't tell the difference between your thought and theirs

       Thank you.  Jesus did exists but until the Council of Nicaea, he was not considered a god.That was determined by the "bishops" in attendance after Caesar forced them all to agree on one concept. That concept spread as Christianity.

       This is also debunked. Jesus refers to himself as God multiple times in some of the most attested to primary sources in history. If he is claiming to be God (before Abraham was, I Am), he is either lying, delusional, or he's telling the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what option that's not left is that Jesus was a good person that was later made God by followers hundreds of years later

       Authentically old but inspired by the "breath of God?"  The litmus test seems to be which old books passed that test.... books that could be proven to be inspired by God.  Josephus' writing are old but not considered as accurate because they know his work was not God inspired. How do we tel the difference?   Some say those "forgotten" books have inaccuracies but isn't it true the included books do too?

        I wasnt making a breathed by God argument (although that is what I believe). I was saying that they can be trusted as to what they report. They are reliable witness to history according to any academic standard. We have no reason to claim that they misquoted Jesus. If you are claiming that they did, the burden of proof is on your end, because you are making the contradictory claim
       </li>
       <li>
        If we are getting into the Inspired Vs Uninspired question, Josephus would never even be in the conversation. No one was claiming that it was a religious text or claiming that it was scripture.
       </li>
       <li>
        The council of Nicea was not a time when they  "Made the bible". Your history is incorrect. According to Dr R.C. Sproul, "During the second century a.d., the heretic Marcion produced a list of his approved books of the Bible. Marcion held that the Old Testament God was an evil god of wrath, so he eliminated the Old Testament and those places in the New Testament that favorably referred to the God of the Old Testament. To answer Marcion, the church formulated once and for all the list of true books of the Bible."
       </li>
       <li>
        For the most part, The church simply recognized the books that had already been in circulation. There was very little debate during this council. A few shorter books like Jude, were debated, and a few Apocryphal books. All other books were not even seriously considered. The gospel of Thomas or Judas and other books like it, were not much of a controversy at the time, and are a recent revision to history.

        Agreed   2. Josephus was a historical writer, not religious. But he writes about events in the time of Jesus and never mentions him. Is he less trustworthy that the others?   3. CoN did not "make the bible", they debated each other's beliefs and hammered them into one common idea. Some considered Jesus a god, others did not. In the end, they mutually agreed to preach that He was.  4. Gospel of Mary, was that discounted becasue it was a forgery or because the pope wanted few women in the church?

        Josephus certainly did mention Jesus in Antiquities. But if he hadn't, an argument from silence is the best that can be made here.
       </li>
       <li>
        CoN looked at the text to answer their questions... That same text that you agreed was reliable. They did not "decide" Jesus was God... Jesus claimed to be God. That's what they noted. If someone is "deciding" it was Jesus.
4.gospel of Mary is clearly written in the second or third century.

       Added.
5. CoN did not meet to establish an orthodoxy. They met to remove heresy. The idea that the Gnostic gospels had been competing with the Canon since the beginning is false. They were later creations by a different group
6. By the time the CoN meet, the books of our modern Canon we're already in circulation and widely  viewed as scripture.

       Oh you mean this mention....  Scholarly opinion varies on the total or partial authenticity of the reference in Book 18, Chapter 3, 3 of the Antiquities, a passage that states that Jesus the Messiah was a wise teacher who was crucified by Pilate, usually called the Testimonium Flavianum.[4][5][1] The general scholarly view is that while the Testimonium Flavianum is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it is broadly agreed upon that it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus, which was then subject to Christian expansion/alteration.[5][6][7][8][9][10] Although the exact nature and extent of the Christian redaction remains unclear,[11] there is broad consensus as to what the original text of the Testimonium by Josephus would have looked like.[9]
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern scholarship has largely acknowledged the authenticity of the reference in Book 20, Chapter 9, 1 of the Antiquities to "the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James"[12] and considers it as having the highest level of authenticity among the references of Josephus to Christianity.[13][1][2][14][15][16]

       yes, that mention. The quote says very clearly that most scholars think that while not entirely authentic, it is from an authentic nucleus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second mention is considered as having a high level of authenticity among scholars.

       Agreed. I wish i knew more. My "research" was done a decade ago, personal investigating. Who knows what the truth is?  I think you for helping dispel some myths. Currently, I'm "researching" foods and nutrition. There is just as much misinformation about it as about religion.  No one can see to agree on too many facts. But we try.

       Caesar was a title, a rank.  His father was a Caesar and he was eventually promoted to that rank.  Constantine became leader of both eastern and western parts of the Roman empire and in order to solidify his new holdings, he commanded leaders of all the different factions of Christian teachings and beliefs to gather and hammer out one common belief. Some of these "bishops" were o more than itinerary preachers roaming around preaching whatever they thought....   at this meeting, they all agreed to teach the same things and from this the new unifying religion grew.

       The point being, he forced the various "churches" to find a common belief that became Christianity.   He wanted a unifying force, not necessarily a new religion.  But thanks for the clarifiation.

       Ah Gnosticism. I was a follower and it made me half awaken. A lot of truth but one major flaw. If God is the enemy, then all Gods are the enemy. I believed this was Hell. Until I saw how the realm truly looks. I saw that God loves us so much that we are literally the center of the universe.

       What if that's still this world, the dark world? This world is getting healed, but astral travel and those things, from what I can tell (so don't claim to know for sure) can give people bad experiences, and possibly get manipulated into some agenda. So obviously only you know, I just wanted to mention that because I heard bad stories. But i have had some very good positive experiences and it didn't involve that, but definitely did involve a strong feeling of love for all humanity. That's the only way I can really know a religious experience.
