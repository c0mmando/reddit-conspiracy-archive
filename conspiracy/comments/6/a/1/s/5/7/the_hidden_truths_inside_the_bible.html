    <div class="md"><p>If you are saying that because in the English we have the word Amen, that this must be talking about another Gods proper name, then this is poor textual criticism. If so, then everytime you see the word Verily (or at least 101x) in the new testament, you have to put in the name of that God. Its a word that means true, firm, or faithful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if that&#39;s still this world, the dark world? This world is getting healed, but astral travel and those things, from what I can tell (so don&#39;t claim to know for sure) can give people bad experiences, and possibly get manipulated into some agenda. So obviously only you know, I just wanted to mention that because I heard bad stories. But i have had some very good positive experiences and it didn&#39;t involve that, but definitely did involve a strong feeling of love for all humanity. That&#39;s the only way I can really know a religious experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To provide that much evidence in one reply is honestly more work than I&#39;m willing to do. It&#39;s a lifetime of research into the subject but I will say in short that you have to remember the modern bible is composed of a series of books. These were borrowed from oral histories from many varied cultures. The first books were written in biblical hebrew and aramaic. </p>

<p>When you&#39;re talking about heady, cerebral subjects such as god and religion in general, even a fluent speaker can be lost for words. The act of translating these old languages is a challenge on it&#39;s own, not to mention the challenge of translating concepts and ideas that don&#39;t cross cultural barriers. </p>

<p>The etymology of the bible is a very interesting study. If you&#39;re really interested in it, I&#39;d suggest reading the book The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. Whether or not you&#39;ll subscribe to his theories isn&#39;t important, but he offers a breakdown and study of possible translations for the biblical hebrew. He has one interpretation, but reading it will allow you to see why there is a lot of debate over translations in general. </p>

<p>I hope this helps somewhat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man first worshiped the sun because it gave him light and heat.  When it set, it got dark and cold. Man praised each sunrise.  As time went on, he lay in the fields looking at the stars. Over time he gave star sets names to help identify them and later noticed these sets had an annual pattern. He began to use them as a calendar of sorts, planting crops when the virgin was in the sky, reap when they saw the water bearer or whatever in the sky.  This is the reason Mithra, Horus, Jesus, an a host of others down through the ages have all been born of virgins, died, rose from the dead, were here to save mankind, celebrated on the winter solace (Dec 25th) and spring (Easter). It&#39;s why they were the son (of) god, The Light,  etc.   And the bible was written to help convince people it was something more.... it was Caesar who called the council of Nicaea and defined Jesus as a god, not the bible. He was only a man prior to Caesar deciding he was instead a god or son of. Nothing metaphysical, nothing spiritual... not even religious.  It was used to help control.  Catholics invented hell.  </p>

<ol>
<li>I wasnt making a breathed by God argument (although that is what I believe). I was saying that they can be trusted as to what they report. They are reliable witness to history according to any academic standard. We have no reason to claim that they misquoted Jesus. If you are claiming that they did, the burden of proof is on your end, because you are making the contradictory claim</li>
<li>If we are getting into the Inspired Vs Uninspired question, Josephus would never even be in the conversation. No one was claiming that it was a religious text or claiming that it was scripture. </li>
<li>The council of Nicea was not a time when they  &quot;Made the bible&quot;. Your history is incorrect. According to Dr R.C. Sproul, &quot;During the second century a.d., the heretic Marcion produced a list of his approved books of the Bible. Marcion held that the Old Testament God was an evil god of wrath, so he eliminated the Old Testament and those places in the New Testament that favorably referred to the God of the Old Testament. To answer Marcion, the church formulated once and for all the list of true books of the Bible.&quot;</li>
<li>For the most part, The church simply recognized the books that had already been in circulation. There was very little debate during this council. A few shorter books like Jude, were debated, and a few Apocryphal books. All other books were not even seriously considered. The gospel of Thomas or Judas and other books like it, were not much of a controversy at the time, and are a recent revision to history.</li>

<li>Agreed   2. Josephus was a historical writer, not religious. But he writes about events in the time of Jesus and never mentions him. Is he less trustworthy that the others?   3. CoN did not &quot;make the bible&quot;, they debated each other&#39;s beliefs and hammered them into one common idea. Some considered Jesus a god, others did not. In the end, they mutually agreed to preach that He was.  4. Gospel of Mary, was that discounted becasue it was a forgery or because the pope wanted few women in the church? </li>

<li>Josephus certainly did mention Jesus in Antiquities. But if he hadn&#39;t, an argument from silence is the best that can be made here. </li>
<li>CoN looked at the text to answer their questions... That same text that you agreed was reliable. They did not &quot;decide&quot; Jesus was God... Jesus claimed to be God. That&#39;s what they noted. If someone is &quot;deciding&quot; it was Jesus.
4.gospel of Mary is clearly written in the second or third century.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>Added.
5. CoN did not meet to establish an orthodoxy. They met to remove heresy. The idea that the Gnostic gospels had been competing with the Canon since the beginning is false. They were later creations by a different group
6. By the time the CoN meet, the books of our modern Canon we&#39;re already in circulation and widely  viewed as scripture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh you mean this mention....  Scholarly opinion varies on the total or partial authenticity of the reference in Book 18, Chapter 3, 3 of the Antiquities, a passage that states that Jesus the Messiah was a wise teacher who was crucified by Pilate, usually called the Testimonium Flavianum.[4][5][1] The general scholarly view is that while the Testimonium Flavianum is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it is broadly agreed upon that it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus, which was then subject to Christian expansion/alteration.[5][6][7][8][9][10] Although the exact nature and extent of the Christian redaction remains unclear,[11] there is broad consensus as to what the original text of the Testimonium by Josephus would have looked like.[9]</p>

<p>Modern scholarship has largely acknowledged the authenticity of the reference in Book 20, Chapter 9, 1 of the Antiquities to &quot;the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James&quot;[12] and considers it as having the highest level of authenticity among the references of Josephus to Christianity.[13][1][2][14][15][16]</p>
