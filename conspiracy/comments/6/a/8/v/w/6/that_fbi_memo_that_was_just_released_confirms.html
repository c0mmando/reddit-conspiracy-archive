       Someone will dig them up.  But he also said "the bodies are within the Foundation"  The real crimes are in the Clinton Foundation  And he was right.
      </p>
      <p>
       On this sub, and the Chans, leading up to the election we were told for months, from FBI Anon and others that the FBI was revolting, agents were mad at Comey and that a bunch of the 3 letter agencies were having similar issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       That letter we just saw confirms all that.  Grossly mishandled the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its clear they wanted hillary indicted and Comey refused to do it

      <p>
       The memo doesn't confirm any of that. It just talks about Comey's decision to hold the press conference. It doesn't say the investigation itself was mishandled.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBIAnon is full of shit. He's never produced anything that wasn't already public. For example, how come he never mentioned one word about the investigation into Trump and Russia? If he really was a high-level analyst with knowledge about everything he claims to know about, he'd have known about that.

       Its not public yet, it's about the pedophilia, also how can I source something that isn't public nor proven yet? This is an example of him saying something, or her, beyond what's known to the public, but has yet to be proven. Which is exactly what my point was, I will admit that I thought I saw this in his original posts but I don't have the energy to drudge through those again, on my phone I might add, to get there but yea, this is something that's he's said that isn't public or wasn't public before hand.

       One thing that I've noticed about pizzagaters is that their level of reading comprehension is typically woeful. When I wrote that FBIAnon had never produced anything that wasn't already public, I meant that he'd never related anything that was not public but was later shown to be true. Him saying something that has not been corroborated is irrelevant to the discussion because it doesn't prove anything. You say that "it's not public yet" but you don't even know that it exists!

       As for your link, it's from March 2017, but Morgan Brittany had tweeted about a "Life Insurance" file on
       <a href="https://nationonenews.com/2016/10/30/huma-abedin-kepts-deleted-emails-folder-called-life-insurance.html">
        30 October 2016

       and others had mentioned it
       <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-29/fbi-found-tens-thousands-emails-belonging-huma-abedin-weiners-laptop">
        before that
       </a>
       . All FBIAnon has done here is jumped on public information to push his fiction of being an FBI source.

       I'm not making the Russia investigation a "thing", but it's been going on at the FBI since the middle of last year. If FBIAnon was genuine he would have at least mentioned it. He's just a nobody repackaging news stories for gullible conspiracy theorists.

       I'm not saying he would believe the Russian claims but if he really were some high-level FBI source, he would have known about it. Hell, he claims to know the truth about aliens and JFK but he's completely ignorant of a major FBI probe into potential interference with the US election and possible compromising of politicians? The fact that he didn't even make one mention of it, not even in a "you won't believe this bullshit probe they've got going here" just shows he's a fraud.

       Yeah, but you're not claiming to be a high-level FBI analyst with knowledge of all sorts of investigations going on there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why do you disbelieve the Russian claims anyway? They fit with the old pattern of behaviour shown by both the US and the USSR during the days of the cold war, and it's not hard to imagine that the Russians would want a president in the US that was more amenable to them. It seems like conspiracy theorists will only support the most ridiculous fringe conspiracy theories, because only then do they get the ego boost from thinking themselves privy to information the rest of the world isn't. It's no fun believing in a mundane conspiracy being invesigated by law enforcement, but a global elite of paedophile satanists moving children around the world in shipping containers and through sewer tunnels and utilising pizza shops and dentists offices, now that's gold!

       In what way is it probable they influenced? Working with Trump? Thats highly unlikely and unsubstiated with any evidence? That whole narative reeks of democrat spin for losing the election and is after the election that it first got mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the Russians produce leaks to wikileaks? This is more possible, but if they influenced election by showing truth behind the dem party modus operandi than I see no problem with that.

       Yes, "incorrupt" FBI who had a relationship with the Boston Bombers, intimidated witnesses Mafia-style, murdered a witness in cold blood, continue to claim Bruce Ivins is the Anthrax killer, continue to uphold the 9/11 myth 16 years later.
      </p>

       Those are your "Good Guys."

       If they're "new blood who haven't been corrupted" then why are they not revolting against the 9/11 myth?  They've never heard of WTC-7?  Bullshit.

        Mossad was behind 9/11
       </a>
       . He also claimed aliens exist, the FBI believes the Holocaust is fake, JFK was killed for "messing with the banking elite", and the CIA was behind the Orlando nightclub shooting. In other words, he claims to know the truth about whatever conspiracy theory you might be interested in. It's obvious this guy is just making this shit up.

       You keep talking about Russia. No one here brings it up because most of us know what a red herring that was. And if this fbianon was as connected as some people think (i think it was a well-read larper, personally), then he/she would likely take that position, as well... So yeah, that's why no one talked about Russia. Cause the only people who think that's an issue are people who casually browse buzzfeed.

       I'm not talking about the substance of the Russian claims, I'm talking about the complete ignorance of it shown by FBIAnon. Even if he didn't believe it, I still would have expected him to drop a reference to it, even if it were just "there's this complete bullshit probe going on here".

       Well, no, it's a major issue for the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it hilarious that people here are willing to buy into any manner of ridiculous conspiracy theories like pizzagate and to also call for them to be investigated, but when the FBI is investigating a conspiracy theory, you all dismiss it out of hand. Apparently, if it's a fringe conspiracy theory promoted by nameless people on the internet, with no evidence, it's true, but if it's well-known and being investigated by credible law enforcement, then it's lies.

       How does that memo confirm anything that FBIAnon said? It says nothing about a coup or that "agents were fucking furious"; it just quotes a bunch of former Attorneys General and Deputy Attorneys General who agree that Comey should not have held that press conference.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never seen anything posted by FBIAnon that wasn't already public or that couldn't have simply been extrapolated from existing media reports. He's never shown any proof that he's even a janitor at the FBI.
