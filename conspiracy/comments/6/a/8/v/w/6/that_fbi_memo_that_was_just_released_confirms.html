<p>On this sub, and the Chans, leading up to the election we were told for months, from FBI Anon and others that the FBI was revolting, agents were mad at Comey and that a bunch of the 3 letter agencies were having similar issues.  </p>

<p>That letter we just saw confirms all that.  Grossly mishandled the investigation.  </p>

<p>The memo doesn&#39;t confirm any of that. It just talks about Comey&#39;s decision to hold the press conference. It doesn&#39;t say the investigation itself was mishandled.</p>

<p>FBIAnon is full of shit. He&#39;s never produced anything that wasn&#39;t already public. For example, how come he never mentioned one word about the investigation into Trump and Russia? If he really was a high-level analyst with knowledge about everything he claims to know about, he&#39;d have known about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not public yet, it&#39;s about the pedophilia, also how can I source something that isn&#39;t public nor proven yet? This is an example of him saying something, or her, beyond what&#39;s known to the public, but has yet to be proven. Which is exactly what my point was, I will admit that I thought I saw this in his original posts but I don&#39;t have the energy to drudge through those again, on my phone I might add, to get there but yea, this is something that&#39;s he&#39;s said that isn&#39;t public or wasn&#39;t public before hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that I&#39;ve noticed about pizzagaters is that their level of reading comprehension is typically woeful. When I wrote that FBIAnon had never produced anything that wasn&#39;t already public, I meant that he&#39;d never related anything that was not public but was later shown to be true. Him saying something that has not been corroborated is irrelevant to the discussion because it doesn&#39;t prove anything. You say that &quot;it&#39;s not public yet&quot; but you don&#39;t even know that it exists!</p>

<p>As for your link, it&#39;s from March 2017, but Morgan Brittany had tweeted about a &quot;Life Insurance&quot; file on <a href="https://nationonenews.com/2016/10/30/huma-abedin-kepts-deleted-emails-folder-called-life-insurance.html">30 October 2016</a> and others had mentioned it <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-29/fbi-found-tens-thousands-emails-belonging-huma-abedin-weiners-laptop">before that</a>. All FBIAnon has done here is jumped on public information to push his fiction of being an FBI source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but you&#39;re not claiming to be a high-level FBI analyst with knowledge of all sorts of investigations going on there.</p>

<p>And why do you disbelieve the Russian claims anyway? They fit with the old pattern of behaviour shown by both the US and the USSR during the days of the cold war, and it&#39;s not hard to imagine that the Russians would want a president in the US that was more amenable to them. It seems like conspiracy theorists will only support the most ridiculous fringe conspiracy theories, because only then do they get the ego boost from thinking themselves privy to information the rest of the world isn&#39;t. It&#39;s no fun believing in a mundane conspiracy being invesigated by law enforcement, but a global elite of paedophile satanists moving children around the world in shipping containers and through sewer tunnels and utilising pizza shops and dentists offices, now that&#39;s gold!</p>

<p>Did the Russians produce leaks to wikileaks? This is more possible, but if they influenced election by showing truth behind the dem party modus operandi than I see no problem with that.</p>

<p>Hell, one of the biggest reasons I voted for Trump was so we could see some improvement in US/Russian relations.  Seriously.  Cold war is over.  Russia is no longer communist.  Time for us to grow up and fucking shake hands and behave like adults.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s Russian connection?  If it existed, I say fuck yeah it&#39;s about time.</p>

<p>Well, no, it&#39;s a major issue for the FBI.</p>

<p>I find it hilarious that people here are willing to buy into any manner of ridiculous conspiracy theories like pizzagate and to also call for them to be investigated, but when the FBI is investigating a conspiracy theory, you all dismiss it out of hand. Apparently, if it&#39;s a fringe conspiracy theory promoted by nameless people on the internet, with no evidence, it&#39;s true, but if it&#39;s well-known and being investigated by credible law enforcement, then it&#39;s lies.</p>
