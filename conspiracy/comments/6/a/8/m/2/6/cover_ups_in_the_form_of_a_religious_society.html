        jehovahs witnesses cover up thousands of child abuse in Australia
       </a>

      <p>
       This has been going on for a few years now but has finally started hitting msm here in the states. When I stopped following it, Ireland and the U.K. Started their own investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back story:
They believe everything should be handled in house and you should not report to the police due to making witnesses look bad. When an issue happens, they will grill kids of any age in a room full of men and see if they can get the truth out. They also believe that someone else has to be present to reprimand the individual. If it's me vs an elder with no witnesses, most times, I'm "lying".
      </p>
      <p>
       If the person does end up getting in trouble, nothing comes from it or they get moved to another congregation with no tract record.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a conspiracy but ties into the whole pedogate equation.
      </p>

       Edit:
      </p>
      <p>
       I created this new thread for further explaining. Feel free to add to it.

       Thank you for posting this. The cover-ups need to be exposed. Everyone needs to know that the Jehovah's Witnesses are not just some annoying fake smiling people who wake you up on the weekends so they can hand you a badly written tract about Armageddon.

       Anyone who opens their door to them is potentially talking to a pedophile. Oh and it's a doomsday cult.

       I was raised a Jehovah's Witness. I wasn't allowed to question it. I was constantly fed lies about how terrible the outside world is and how it's constantly getting worse. I was taught that people that knew 'the truth' but left would be killed by god.

       They used all manner of misdirection and fallacious reasoning before finally concluding that the woman herself was under the power of demons. Her original concerns were asking why the members of the leadership, including a governing body member (a 7-man Pope body), lied under oath during their testimony to the Australian Royal Commission.
       <em>
        They
