<p>This has been going on for a few years now but has finally started hitting msm here in the states. When I stopped following it, Ireland and the U.K. Started their own investigations. </p>

<p>Back story:
They believe everything should be handled in house and you should not report to the police due to making witnesses look bad. When an issue happens, they will grill kids of any age in a room full of men and see if they can get the truth out. They also believe that someone else has to be present to reprimand the individual. If it&#39;s me vs an elder with no witnesses, most times, I&#39;m &quot;lying&quot;.</p>

<p>If the person does end up getting in trouble, nothing comes from it or they get moved to another congregation with no tract record. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a conspiracy but ties into the whole pedogate equation. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I created this new thread for further explaining. Feel free to add to it. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6acin4/jehovah_witnesses_child_abuse_cover_ups_and/">Jehovah Witnesses: Child Abuse Cover ups and allegations.</a></p>

<p>They used all manner of misdirection and fallacious reasoning before finally concluding that the woman herself was under the power of demons. Her original concerns were asking why the members of the leadership, including a governing body member (a 7-man Pope body), lied under oath during their testimony to the Australian Royal Commission. <em>They</em> (the members of the leadership, including the JW Australian branch representatives) are not the ones with a problem, <em>she</em> is.</p>

<p>Even the ARC&#39;s senior council, Angus Stewart, <a href="http://jwsurvey.org/child-abuse-2/royal-commissions-angus-stewart-accuses-watchtower-representative-of-deliberate-deception">pointed</a> out as much during their testimony at the commission, too.</p>
