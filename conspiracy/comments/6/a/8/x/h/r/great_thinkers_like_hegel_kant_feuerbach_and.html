    <div class="md"><p>First, we have to pollute the Earth and then scatter the few Gentiles that remain:</p>

<p>&quot;See, G-d is going to lay waste the earth and devastate it; he will ruin its face and scatter its inhabitants--&quot;--Isaiah 24:1</p>

<p>Then the Gentiles who are remaining have to be  slaughtered:</p>

<p>&quot;Now go, attack the Gentiles and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.&#39;&quot;--1st Samuel 15:3</p>

<p>Afterwords, we Jews will live on a paradise Earth:</p>

<p>&quot;I will bring out of Jacob an offspring. And out of Judah the one to inherit my mountains; My chosen ones will take possession of it, And my servants will reside there.....See, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind. But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy. I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more. “Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years; the one who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere child;
the one who fails to reach[a] a hundred will be considered accursed. They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands. They will not labor in vain, nor will they bear children doomed to misfortune; for they will be a people blessed by the Lord, they and their descendants with them. Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear. The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain,” says G-d.--Isaiah 65:9,17-25</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but here is the deal. Whether a Jew believes in G-d, or not, we have been taught from birth that the planet is intended for us. For thousand of years Jews have been waiting for some Messiah to come and make all of this happen. Not now. Jews are making it happen. You are witnessing history. You should feel lucky. I never dreamed that I would live to see all of this take place, but it is really happening. I have to pinch myself sometimes to remind myself that this is all very real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It shows respect to older Jews. Believe it, or not, you&#39;ve got Jews in their 90&#39;s that enjoy reading r/conspiracy. They&#39;ll read all the way through a &quot;crazy&quot; post claiming that the Jews killed Kennedy (they won&#39;t agree), but if you spell &quot;G-d&quot; as &quot;God&quot; they get upset and may not finish reading your post.

    <div class="md"><p>The Hebrew Bible is very well written. It always seems &quot;fresh&quot;; as if it were just written. I enjoy the stories that are in the Hebrew Bible.

Somewhere &quot;along the way&quot;, though, strict adherence to these teachings has pretty much been pushed aside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I understand perfectly.  What you did is called false equivalency.  It&#39;s a logical fallacy and it&#39;s used to marginalize and castrate a legitimate point through crude association.  And it is entirely unhelpful in reasonable argumentation.  What&#39;s important to the discussion here are the outcomes (i.e. the fact that millions practice a faith reliant on those very scriptures), not veracity of the stories themselves.  </p>
