    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure Clapper said he had not seen it. But the investigation continued after he left soo... also it was the fact that Flynn lied about contacting the Russian ambassador that got him fired. And trump was warned about Flynn on multiple occasions.

<p>That isn&#39;t a very open ended quote. Using the word &quot;still&quot; would mean he has been updated on the ongoing investigation to which no evidence has been discovered. I can agree with the Flynn firing. I don&#39;t know what reason youre referring to with the Comey firing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>surely any evidence would have been collected by january 20th? before that date are you saying that the Obama administration wouldn&#39;t have shared said evidence with their CIA director? correct? </p>

<p>or are you saying the evidence was only turned up between feb &amp; now, a time during which Clapper might not have had accessed to said evidence (unless someone leaked it to him, which considering the EO allowing for the dissemination of evidence across agencies &amp; plenty of Obama era holdovers i find difficult to believe)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s 4 months to gather more concrete evidence. I believe he mentioned something about having dismissed some evidence about something unrelated to this because it wasn&#39;t strong enough, same situation could apply here, he has seen evidence but it wasn&#39;t as strong as he would like. 
When I got out of the navy my friends still on the boat stopped discussing classified info with me. Has he probably heard some juicy gossip? Yea sure. Could he have been told about evidence of collusion and not have &quot;seen&quot; it? Also very likely. </p>

&quot;I still have not seen any evidence of any kind of collusion between Trump campaign and Russian foreign nationals.&quot; - James Clapper.</p>

<p>You really think he still doesn&#39;t have any inside information on the investigation and the goings on of the IC? He doesn&#39;t have friends or colleagues who aren&#39;t going to give him information on the investigation? Again the way you&#39;re seeing the context of the quote could be different from what he meant. &quot;Still&quot; could mean I have seen the evidence and there still is no collusion or it could be your way as he &quot;still&quot; hasn&#39;t actually seen the evidence in front of him.</p>

<p>During my tenure as DNI, it was my practice to defer to the FBI director, both Director Mueller and then subsequently Director Comey, on whether, when and to what extent they would inform me about such investigations. This stems from the unique position of the FBI, which straddles both intelligence and law enforcement. And as a consequence, I was not aware of the counterintelligence investigation Director Comey first referred to during his testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee for Intelligence on the 20th of March, and that comports with my public statements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you continue to read the entire transcript rather than bits and pieces to fit a narrative. It goes on to say.</p>

<p>GRAHAM: Would it be fair to say that the counter-intelligence investigation was not mature enough to come to his — to get in the report. Is that fair, Mr. — Mr. Clapper?</p>

<p>CLAPPER: I — that&#39;s an — that&#39;s a possibility.</p>

<p>GRAHAM: What I don&#39;t get is how the FBI can have a counter- intelligence investigation suggesting collusion, and you, as director of National Intelligence not know about it, and the FBI sign on to a report that basically said there was no collusion.</p>

<p>CLAPPER: I can only speculate why that&#39;s so. There wasn&#39;t — the evidence, if there was any, didn&#39;t reach the evidentiary bar in terms of the level of confidence that we were striving for in that intelligence community assessment.</p>

<p>They then discuss the Trump dossier that people continue to point to as &quot;evidence&quot; of a Trump-Russia collusion and point out that it has no backing and no sources. </p>

<p>They then go on to Yates who says just because she cannot comment on an investigation by the FBI doesn&#39;t mean that the evidence isn&#39;t there. This whole part of the hearing to me either shows a dog and pony show of nothing or that our own government is so bureaucratic and inefficient that our own IC has an inability to share information on an investigation that suggests our own Government has been taken over by the Russian Federation which is what this whole Russia story line concludes to. The IC either lacks this ability to share the information of a Russia-Trump collusion with each other or it simply does not exists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your argument. I think those who are an &quot;affront to logic&quot; as you put it are those that believe we no longer have control of our government and somehow Mother Russia after all these years of a Cold War, have finally won. They have installed their Manchurian candidate. We no longer have a government that is going to work for the American people, we have a communist Russian authoritarian government now. The Russians have fooled us all. They somehow got Trump to the top of the RNC during the primary. Then miraculously they got him elected against Hillary Clinton who was such a strong and great candidate it was just impossible she would lose. Now that Trump is in power its just a matter of time before he tells us all how it was a Russian plot to subvert our own government and that of NATO and the EU. Soon Russia will rule the world now that they have Donald Trump as president of the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, because it makes total sense that Trump would fire the guy to prevent investigation of allegations he knows are false. </p>

<p>What is happening is that &quot;they&quot; will not allow Trump to appear to make a good decision, ever. So he fires Comey for being a bag of shit liar, and they spin it into some anti-Trump nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This fucking sub. This is a blatant attempt at a cover up and you guys are towing the White House line. I have never seen this sub so quickly go to pro elite and pro us government </p>

<p>Trump fired Comey today after the subpoenas were issued. It was obviously not something planned because they didn&#39;t even know where Comey was at the time FFS. The timing is not just some crazy random happenstance. Trump wants to kill any investigations into him and replace all levels of government with yes men and loyalists. And you guys are LOVING it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By sitting on the fence and trying to save his own job instead of just doing it, Comey ultimately managed to piss both sides off.</p>

<p>They both wanted him gone for political reasons of their own that either side will now claim are vindicated by his dismissal which really has nothing to do with why the public should be glad to see him gone or the basic reason for that, namely that he failed to faithfully uphold the law which he, more than anyone else in the country, had more than enough power and independence to do, DOJ or no DOJ.</p>

<p>The only permission he needed was for a search warrant and all he had to provide for that was a reasonable suspicion that a crime had been committed. In Clinton&#39;s case and with the private unsecured server she admitted to having set up at her residence for her own private and State Dept. communications that wasn&#39;t even a suspicion but a matter of fact and an open admission of guilt on under oath on her part to the congressional committee investigating what she knew and did when the Benghazi embassy was over-run and the ambassador was killed. </p>

<p>That was Comey&#39;s time to move. If he had the Congress wouldn&#39;t have needed to try and investigate the issue of the server and finding itself having to negotiate with Clinton while the server was still in her possession.</p>

<p>Comey should have immediately seized Clinton&#39;s server both as threat to national security as well being evidence of a crime and additionally all the devices that her aides and assistants linked to and communicated with that server for the very same reason. </p>

<p>Devices they would ultimately destroy, while Clinton had the server itself scrubbed. All because he dickered and dallied with the DOJ over the political optics and simply didn&#39;t do his job as he should have. </p>

<p>The case was clear, cut, and dried. He didn&#39;t have to build it but simply collect all the irrefutable evidence before any of it could be tampered with or destroyed, which was precisely what happened.</p>

<p>Similarly, when the DNC believed it&#39;s server had been hacked and quite possibly by a foreign power, Comey once again had the law and an a reasonable suspicion it had been broken on his side to get a warrant and seize that server for a complete forensic analysis to see if that suspicion was in fact true or not.</p>

<p>We can only imagine what the outcome might have been had he simply done his duty on those occasions. If the DOJ refused to prosecute Clinton, Comey could have gone public and put his job on the line to force the issue with a better than average chance he would have won. The matter of the DNC hack or leak could also have been decisively resolved instead of still being out there and being speculated about and quite possibly unfairly damaging US and international relations with Russia as a result.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please make more of these posts, and use more capital letters next time so it really stands out.  Every time someone makes a post like this, it sounds like a defense and makes me find both the events themselves and the reason for these posts to be suspicious.</p>

<p>Basically what I&#39;m saying is that this post makes me more sure there were nefarious goings on or else people would let the investigation(s) continue and conclude instead of trying as hard as they can to deflect and defend.  So thank you for reaffirming my belief that his campaign had some very bad apples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Flynn stuff appears to be blown out of preportion and wildly skewed.  </p>

<p>I really doubt at the time Flynn was in Russia that he was aware of the possibility that he&#39;d be chosen to be in Trump&#39;s administration.  </p>

<p>It seems he was doing something similar to what the Clintons have been doing which should quickly render the whole thing moot since alot of these people talking about Flynn would have liked Hillary in the white house.  </p>

<p>Hillary would have been subject to much greater amounts of foreign influence, and she was going to be president.  Why is nobody talking about that?  </p>

&quot;I still have not seen any evidence of any kind of collusion between Trump campaign and Russian foreign nationals.&quot; - James Clapper.</p>

<p>You really think he still doesn&#39;t have any inside information on the investigation and the goings on of the IC? He doesn&#39;t have friends or colleagues who aren&#39;t going to give him information on the investigation? Again the way you&#39;re seeing the context of the quote could be different from what he meant. &quot;Still&quot; could mean I have seen the evidence and there still is no collusion or it could be your way as he &quot;still&quot; hasn&#39;t actually seen the evidence in front of him.</p>
