       Can someone talk to me? I have been following the world of "conspiracy" and such things for many years (in the perspective of my age, 21.) I am a Christian but lately I've been reading into things like the matrix and related matters, traveling between atral plains, dimensions or what have you and I have had many experiences during meditation in which scared me to no end because I thought I had died and entered another life or dimension. I stopped doing that a couple years ago because of that. Again, I've been reading into these sorts of things mentioned in this article from Squawker(and many other places, but this article was shared on this subreddit very recently), "Singularity Has Already Occured: We Are Machines." and lately I've been more confused than ever and I can't handle it. I really need to talk to someone on here who is polite, kind and can reason with my beliefs and work things out with me. I'm confused and I need someone to talk to because everyone I know is a sheep. Apparently including myself in some aspects. I consider myself much more "awake" than most that I know, but recently on here and in general my mind has been in more confusion than ever. I'm very familiar with everything essentially being sounds and vibration. Even the Bible hints at that. God "says" something and then becomes. I've believed this for years. I don't want to keep typing but I would really appreciate anyone reaching or to talk in a civil and helpful manner. Thanks!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I am not interested in professional help. I have tried this and it made things worse. Many on this subreddit claim they want to help awaken people and share love. Now is your chance to show compassion and talk to me like I'm not some maniac.

       I can hardly sleep anymore. I wake up every 20 minutes. I believe I am spiritually attacked heavily all the time. Even believe I am frequently attacked and abused by a succubus demon(s). My life, mind and spiritual life are a mess and I need some talking.

       I try to remember and use His name as often as I can. But I don't always remember to pray. Then as soon as I forget to ask Jesus to cast out these demons and evils they flood right back. This is likely due to my foolish lack of being in the Word the past 7 or more months especially.. But it's just so much to explain just because the way my life is situated. But thank you, God bless.

       You sound as if you are torturing yourself for this lack of being in the Word.  Don't be that way.  It isn't something that depletes.  Being away 7 months or 70 years doesn't matter, would it?  If you believe in the Word, wouldn't it renew the moment you did a 180 and turned back to the Word?

       I haven't believed in what the world sees as aliens in years because I believe they are demons. This much I know. Thank you though. I believe in Giants and all the sorts. Steve Quayle and Tim Alberinl brought me to these beliefs a few years back.

       I hope you are doing okay.  Spiritual attack is definitely real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you considered speaking to a priest?  They can provide spiritual help (not secular baggage that comes with psychopharmaceutical industry) and can help sort spiritual problems from emotional ones.  Also, they can provide deliverance prayers if necessary.  A good orthodox priest can be a good listening ear and spiritual advisor.  Will say a prayer for you!

       Not to be disrespectful of your religious beliefs, but excessive religious focus is associated as a  symptom of many different psychological disorders.  It could be a manic episode. You should seek to talk to a therapist that is trained.

       well, it is. OP has specifically said:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I can hardly sleep anymore. I wake up every 20 minutes. I believe I am spiritually attacked heavily all the time. Even believe I am frequently attacked and abused by a succubus demon(s). My life, mind and spiritual life are a mess and I need some talking.
      </p>
      <p>
       try to remember and use His name as often as I can. But I don't always remember to pray. Then as soon as I forget to ask Jesus to cast out these demons and evils they flood right back. This is likely due to my foolish lack of being in the Word the past 7 or more months especially.. But it's just so much to explain just because the way my life is situated. But thank you, God bless.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       i agree with your advice its a good idea to see a professional yet to dismiss demons as being real is quite controversial

       I've also read sea-salt and water in a glass jar can help against negative energies.  Have a search on the net about the things you're experiencing, you should find a bit of stuff to try out.

       went through a similar time period around your same age. the world is chaos and feels heavy on your shoulders, while you know that the world wants you to fall in line, you know deep down there is more to yourself and what you can offer the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       find your hobbies and loves of life (activities, passions, service) and persue them in some capacity. give your soul that happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, go on a bike ride or a long run late afternoon/mid evening, this will help tire you so you can sleep better. plus the exercise will help release your brain and distract you a bit.

       Of course you can. I've been reading here for 4 years with no account. But some people care about karma instead of content. I got through the entire squawker article. It brings up so many subjects, i can understand you are confused. But what exactly is confusing you? That you don't "know" the nature of the world you live in, and all this mystery stuff. Or is it more like you don't know what to do with yourself? You need to find a meaning with life or a path to follow?

       Thank you for your comment, and thank you for reading the article to elaborate. Basically. I know there is something wrong with this world, not quite right. I mean, obviously there are countless things, Monsanto, NWO, chemtrails, holograms, mind control, etc. But I am looking for someone to help me break out of this shit reality that is ours and confusing life that is mine, if it really is a trap. I definitely believe the spirit is not natural to this world, and I believe it is trapped here. I thought this life was a trial from God and upon death or rapture I finay get past everything that we know as the world today. But now people are makignme question if I just need to do some deeper thinking, harder meditating and even more research to break free. Basically. I've also believe I need Jesus to be free of this world. But I haven't been able to apply Jesus to my life as well as others.

       I agree that there are countless things wrong as you mention, but nevertheless, this is the reality we live in at this moment. We all wish it would be different, better, and filled with love, but it isn't right now. If you take the burden to change these things on your own shoulders, and make that a goal you need to achieve before you get peace in your mind, chances are you will always be miserable.
I try to see all the "evil" in this world as an "unpleasant good", because it is needed for the development of us all. That doesn't mean I'm not fighting against it, but I accept the fact that this is where we're at, in an evolutionary perspective. You don't need to figure out everything today or tomorrow, and thinking you can, is just naive. But it seems like you are very focused on your own development spiritually, so you need to figure out what you need to get over this obstacle right now. Maybe you need to stop thinking so deeply for a while, and do/learn something you always wanted. Maybe you need to go travel and replace your everyday environment completely. Maybe you need to dig deeper in you spiritual experiences from another perspective. Get some new real life inputs that you then can use to solve this temporary confusion. There is time for thinking and time for doing (new experiences). Take everything you have learned up until now, and use this knowledge to decide what you really want to be, and then start implement this to your everyday life. I don't know your situation so it's hard to give advice. But traveling alone with just the basic stuff you need, for me, is always enlightening, and helps me keep positive and navigate my life for years afterwards. I never had strong "spiritual" hallucinations or dreams through meditation, but I have had some LSD and psilocybin experiences that opened my mind. Next year I want to explore DMT through an ayahuasca retreat somewhere in South America. Have you ever tried any of this? It can be really dangerous if you're scared so don't rush anything, but in a comfortable environment with people you love, it can really give you some amazing experiences.

       Thank you so much for your time and comments, I appreciate it tremendously. I will try to take as much od your advice and apply as I can. Unfortunately with my situation I cannot travel. But I agree with what you've said. Also, I have done both LSD and psilocybin mushrooms in my teen years, and once maybe a year ago. But I don't mess with that anymore. I'm too far down the rabbit hole to trip. The last several trips I had were quite terrible for this reason. Again, thank you so much for your time and help.

       I even say this having grown up in a christian home and being indoctrinated in it since I was a child.  I no longer participate in it, but I've definitely seen the effects of "faith" first hand.

       Real advice. You're clearly emotionally weak and shouldn't be opening portals. Read. Ingest knowledge. Pray. Meditate. You should know where your feelings are coming from. When you feel a certain way.

       OP, I hear and feel your reaching out.  No need to fret.  Breathe.  You scratched the surface and are realizing what you've seen and what you've been told may very well not be the case.  That disconnect is scary indeed.  You in time will realize it doesn't need to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't know your situation other than you are 21, but I might recommend you take some quiet time away from things and focus on trying to find a spot of calm.  Some people meditate, some bathe, some read, some run, some lift weights, some hop in a car and road trip.  You get my point I imagine.  Give yourself time for you to think about these confusing thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       What works for me is to break away and make a block of quiet nature time.  To me, nothing is more soothing than the sound of wind going through trees making the leaves do what they do.  I can think so clearly here!
      </p>
      <p>
       Once in a calm state, I just think.  It consider it a light form of meditation, nothing deep or structured - just where I focus on truth vs emotion.  Fear is emotion based, so that sloughs off and you are left with trouble points, the things that caused me distress or fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       For you, it sounds to me that you might be unsure of what is real or what isn't, and that shakes your foundation.  I would suggest you start internally questioning everything while looking for truths to set as base foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many here who will share.  I think there are some that will be less than helpful.  Waste nothing on them other than a loving farewell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will tell you, these are very interesting times.  You are no maniac for feeling unsure of reality.  You may have health issues that need tending to, don't ever be afraid to seek a doctor's help.  You were on psych drugs previously you said, so you need to be open to the possibility that you do have an imbalance.  But question everything, be open to anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish you well, I wish you love.

       My advice is to focus on your heart. That's where our creator is and where you can find peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think of the astral realm like it's Fantasia from the movie Never Ending Story. It's as wonderful or as horrible as we can imagine and it's teeming with creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have three ways out of our body that's I've found. Your head (3rd eye), your heart and your genitals. The heart leads to heaven, the other two lead elsewhere.

       These concepts you mention above are all lies formulated by people like madam blavatsky, and kabalists who wish to take you away from god in anyway they can, these concepts are new age concepts that are engineered to confuse you and make you feel insignificant. Do more research into them, debunk everything and anything and you will find that these ideas are of the devil. Good luck and may jesus guide your way.

       OP,
       <br/>
       Might I suggest doing some research into the law of attraction?  I personally think this might be of some help. Sounds to me like  you have dived in to deep so to speak, and your mind is having trouble coping. Learning about this law and how it operates has helped me immensely.  Good luck.

       While it can be destabilizing to realize that reality is far more fluid than we are led to believe, I think this is ultimately a self-empowering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than using meditation to access "other realms" (visions, etc.), might you instead engage in exercises that help you focus and control your thoughts?  This might help you feel a bit more personally stable.  Once you feel cognitively secure, you can branch out and figure out how to use your perceptions to get closer to God, operate lovingly (or merely effectively) in the world, etc.

       I see a lot of myself when I read through your comments. I don't know if this applies or you'll be able to relate... so here it goes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I went to catholic schools all the way through high school graduation. Religion taught me to be overly critical of myself. According to the bible, my human nature was sinful. I always lacked faith &amp; this eventually took its toll on my mental health. It's hard when your entire social/family/work life revolves around a deity that, deep down, you struggle to truly believe in. After an intense inner awakening with hallucinogenics, I realized there is no biblical god. The shame I felt was artificial, built from years of conditioning. If there is a god, it made me this way, so I have no reason to apologize for who I am or what I think. I am flawed, like all people. Religion created this anxiety, stress, &amp; resentment towards myself. I don't mean this comment to offend any believers. I've seen religion make people better. The day I left the biblical god &amp; all of his "expectations" in the past, is the day I truly set myself free &amp; changed my life for the better.
       </p>
