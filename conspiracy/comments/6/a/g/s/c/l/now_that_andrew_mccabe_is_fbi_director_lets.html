       I am relying on my education to form opinions not what the elites say necessarily, Trumps actions, for the most part, when it comes to Wall Street are consistent with his words. I'll agree some aren't. I agree on Glass Steagall, it is a vital piece of legislation that should remain, they talk of replacing it with an updated version as it was signed in the 1930s I believe, but I will wait to form my judgements on this new bill until I know what is in it. As for Dodd-Frank, the entire thing was not rolled back, as I'm sure you know. it is compromised of hundreds of different regulations, the ones repealed make it easier for smaller businesses to obtain loans necessary for their day to day operations; the regulations dealing with the relaxed lending standards that had a hand in causing the financial crisis of 2009 are still in place. Many, even the CEOs of Wall Street banks agree that these regulations are absolutely necessary to prevent another crises from happening. It really isn't as bad as you seem to think.

       Bullshit. The bankers should be in JAIL. Trump was never going to do that. Hillary wasn't either. The voters do not get to dictate any real policy; the elite just do whatever the fuck they want to.

       Yes, but that doesn't mean that Dodd Frank is a good law, or that Trump might not still pass Glass Steagall. It's very important to create pressure for this right now.

       It's possible that Trump is in bed with the banks, but he can still push Glass-Steagall through. Stranger things have happened. The original Glass-Steagall was put in by a 33rd degree freemason.

       Dodd Frank is a terrible law. It's incredibly favorable to big banks; it created massive new regulatory costs that put all the small banks out of business.

       And he k led what happens when trump has another of those mood swings. After all, it was comet that leaked the news of investigating Hillary. Look what that got him. PLUS, he is booted for the Adler that brought about hillary's downfall. No I don't have any expectations from trump in terms of foresight.

       As I understand it, he's just the acting director because he was next in line? I haven't read too much about how it works, but that was the gist of it, from stories about Comey being fired. I don't think Trump would have picked McCabe.
