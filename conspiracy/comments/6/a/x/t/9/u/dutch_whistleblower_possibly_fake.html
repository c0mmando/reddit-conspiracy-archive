<p>Dutch alt media are getting <a href="http://revolutionaironline.com/verklaring-over-ronald-bernard-van-de-blije-bank-van-ex-volkskrant-journalist-sanne-ten-hoove/">suspicious</a>. (its in dutch)</p>

<p>I agree there is no info on this guy, and it is suspect, but this guy is a hell of an actor if it&#39;s fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He gives a name, he dies. Its that simple. Its not like Icke; the guy worked with the elite. He can&#39;t go around breaking agreements. </p>

<p>Proof is irrelevant. We don&#39;t have concrete proof for 99% of the shit we discuss. Its all about pieces of evidence. </p>

<p>As for his whistle blowing; his statements match that of other whistle blowers. Therefore, I have little reason to doubt him. If he insisted on advertising his bank, I would be suspicious, but he didn&#39;t do that. He only mentioned it after the interviewer did. He simply wished to tell his story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So do we have 100% proof for any conspiracy posted here? Or are you gonna play mental gymnastics and avoid 90% of a post in order to try and be clever? </p>

<p>The only way we can truly verify this stuff is by grabbing an elite by the balls and brainwash them into spilling the beans. Otherwise, you&#39;re not gonna find 100% proof of elite pedophilia and child sacrifice. </p>

<p>I clearly stated we needed evidence. I also stated that Bernard&#39;s statements match other whisteblowers. He is a piece in a giant puzzle; nobody is relying on a single source for 100% proof of anything and to do so makes you an idiot; to expect 100% proof from a whisteblower also makes you an imbecile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand. There is no amount of proof that would convince you it&#39;s true. Why? Because of the implications of his testimony. If what he says is true then we are living in the fallen world depicted in the Bible, Jesus is literally who he claimed to be, and you and me and the majority of the world are separated from God. You don&#39;t want to believe it so nothing will convince you. You&#39;d prefer to live in a world of speculation where you never have to settle on one truth. That way you never have to do anything, you&#39;re never wrong, and you don&#39;t have to worry about the fate of your eternity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. </p>

<p>&quot;i&#39;m not an expert on body language, so I can&#39;t verify if he is honest.&quot;</p>

<p>You watched a video with someone who actually was a body language expert. What did the expert say?</p>

<p>You believed it then... hell you even recommended it to people right?</p>

<p>Now your looking for the truth! Sure you are.</p>

<p>But, but, but... how do we know the body language expert is telling the truth? Go find the truth trailblazer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I know about pizzagate is that there are alot of high profile players being into kids.</p>

<p>Also there are rumors (and mentionings in wikileaks) of satanic rituals... Which sounds the same as what he is telling. </p>

<p>The problem comes when corrupt people get to know this they can use it to scam people and hurt the research. </p>

<p>People are speaking about pizzagate and alot of people are scepticle.  When someone who believes pizzagate is real and refer to the dutch people this vid and eventually its false... They disregard everything.</p>
