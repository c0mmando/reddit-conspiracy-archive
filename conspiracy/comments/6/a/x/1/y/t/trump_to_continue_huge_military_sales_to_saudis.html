        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think it would be great to attempt a nation-wide JULY 4th <strong>9/11 TRUTH &amp; PEACE FEST</strong> in which the entire community calls for a 9/11 Truth Commission run by the activists, whistle-blowers, researchers, witnesses, and relatives of victims. We simply cannot trust our political leaders to run an actual investigation--the 9/11 Commission was a whitewash and even members of the commission have stated they were mislead and obstructed by the White House and the intelligence agencies (and other governmental agencies).</p>

<p>Following is a list of those who I think should be at the forefront of any Truth &amp; Peace Commission...(I&#39;m sure I missed some important people/organizations--please leave a comment and I will add to the list)</p>

<hr/>

<p>note: All links are to a general youtube search for &quot;9/11 + name&quot;...I&#39;m sure I missed a few people/organizations who should also be listed--just thought I&#39;d list these to get a great list started and to show how many great whistle-blowers, activists and researchers there are in the 9/11 truth movement.  I&#39;ve also included many media figures who could be very useful in promoting new material for exposure.</p>

<p>It also might be a good idea to include peace activists because the current war on terror is largely built upon the LIE OF THE MILLENIUM.  The USA is currently going full steam ahead with many budget increases for WAR, INC. and pushing for more troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, South Korea...</p>

<p>The result of Trump winning has been the biggest gift to WAR, INC. USA since 9/11...an extra $30 Billion for PentaCon budget in 2017...an extra $54 billion for PentaCon in 2018...keep the $1 trillion nuclear weapon swindle going...selling Patriot THAAD missile systems to South Korea, Poland, Romania...the F-35 swindle keeps going + possibly a second jet fighter to be funded as well (?)...Trump said he wants 350 ships for the Navy (currently at 280 or so) including increasing the number of aircraft carriers to 15 (currently 12?)--China has 2 (built from refurbished Cold War era USSR ships, altho they are now building their first Chinese carrier from scratch)...US $29 billion for 200 cargo helicopters--to be funded (?)...ALL of this extra funding for WAR, INC. USA has gone unchecked by any opposition.</p>

<p>TRUTH &amp; PEACE TO ALL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It did seem to be emphasized by Alex Jones &amp; Co. that Trump might consider a new 9/11 Commission or investigation.  I don&#39;t think Trump ever said the exact words--but even to discuss 9/11 or the Saudis was enough for some to rush to judgment...</p>

<p>Any chance of Trump supporting a new 9/11 investigation is now DEAD...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. As much as I enjoy the No Agenda podcast, for instance, I feel like they&#39;ve been unreasonably soft on Trump. I get it - they&#39;re to be trying to compensate for a media narrative that is skewed to the opposite extreme (and they have been critical of Trump to some extent), but their unwillingness to connect the dots as far as Trump just being another tool to push the MSM agenda and save their ratings/propaganda-power. Keep in mind that if the world is safe and boring, no one watches the news and they can&#39;t influence the public in the same way that they can when someone like Trump is in office creating non-stop shitstorms and driving people to CNN/MSNBC/etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does one, <em>objectively</em>, determine which actions of Trump&#39;s mean &quot;he&#39;s a puppet&quot;, and which ones he would take if he &quot;weren&#39;t a puppet&quot;? If he supports Israel, does that mean &quot;he is a puppet of Israel&quot; by default? That strikes me as awfully sloppy and <em>emotional</em> &quot;reasoning&quot;. But it seems there is a tendency to interpret everything in just this crude way. It&#39;s not real thinking. It&#39;s emotional, political culture-conditioned reacting. </p>

<p>If Trump IS what he says he is, then he ISN&#39;T going to put things out in a way that will comfortably conform to every narrative that they actually serve. He may be &quot;playing the long game&quot; on any number of fronts. IF he is who he says he is then I would assume he is playing long wherever it strikes him as wise.</p>

<p>The depth of the conspiracies dictate the difficulty of rooting them out. If he were to go in yelling and stomping his foot like an outraged political person, he would get nowhere.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how far he can or will go in undoing the corruption. He may be a tool. But we don&#39;t know. We don&#39;t know shit yet. And if you think like an adult, and have any realistic grasp of how power works, and how men work with power, you would stop freaking out and jumping up and down and screeching at every single occurrence that can be interpreted as being bad for the cause.</p>

<p>Once again, as always, the fact that the mainstream has continued to throw a fullscale coniption fit at him speaks volumes... Lacking other info-- and more importantly, better options-- I am more than willing to wait and see what happens.</p>

<p>Twitch and jerk political culture is the source of much STUPIDITY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Trump had truly wanted to clear the swamp and makes an impactful start to his presidency--then he would NOT have named Mike Pompeo as CIA director.  The last president with any balls was Jimmy Carter who appointed Admiral Turner to CIA...there was a large list of CIA who were let go (retired early) or walked away.</p>

<p>As it happened, Trump did a volte-face and walked into CIA HQ on his 2nd day--just as Bush and Obama did.  Trump pulled another volte-face with his stance on prosecuting Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foiundation receded to &quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt the Clintons--they&#39;re a good family&quot; (or some such).  Reminded me of Obama&#39;s sudden &quot;Look forward, not back&quot; mantra on Bush once he got in office.</p>

<p>...but my biggest problems with Trump are his backing the rapid expansion of a larger 2017 and 2018 budget for DoD, his drastic approval of weapons systems (keeping the $1 trillion nuclear project going...the F-35 swindle going...wanting to add to the number of aircraft carriers and upping the number of ships to 350 (currently at about 280)...ordering $30 billion for 200 cargo helicopters (comes to over $100 million a piece)...Trump even approved a larger troop force for all branches of the military (Army, USAF, Marines, Navy)...more troops have headed to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Romainia, Poland and South Korea since Trump began his term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s also relevant that BOTH the democrats and republicans are willing to increase the DoD&#39;s budget, increase funding for weapons, etc...The ultimate hypocrisy is the &quot;humanitarian&quot; lie the CIA_DoD use to sell the 26,171+ bombings which happened in 2016 under Obama.  </p>

<p>Frightening that many have estimated Trump is exceeding the 2016 levels so far this year.
I actually wanted Trump over Hillary--but thought Hillary had illegally stacked the deck in the primary against Bernie.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometime around 1980 the Saudis began funding nuclear research in Pakistan--supposedly they actually have ownership to one nuclear bomb.  </p>

<p>With all the &quot;hot zones&quot; of live fire, bombings by drone, ship and air, mercenaries paid/equipped/trained by multiple countries (US, Saudi and Qatar)--I fear the war coming to Iran at some point unless We, the People STAND UP and demand the escalation STOPS.</p>

<p>Millions of people have already become refugees (Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen, etc.).  Over a million died in Iraq.  The infrastructures--roads, water, electricity--are often left in ruins as well (which is fine from the Halliburton industrial builder-type corporations because then they get to go back in and rebuild another country).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is very close friends with Larry Silverstein. His son in law Mossad Kushner is almost family with Netanyahu. Trump is also very close with Giuliani. Trump is extremely close to villains of the 911 slaughter. Not only will he never re open the investigation, he will actually cover it up as much as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love to see some solid evidence of Trump knowing Larry Silverstein--who Trump would have very likely done real estate deals with (but I don&#39;t know of any).  The Mossad-Kushner-Netanyahu link would be scary, too.  </p>

<p>The Giuliani part is definitely very visible, as Giuliani was mentioned to be on his list of considerations for various roles as he was getting ready for inauguration.  </p>

<p>Trump also had a surprising quote about Kissinger during the election (after Hillary met with Kissinger)--and has since then quite obviously backtracked and has met or spoke with with Kissinger a couple of times.</p>

<li>&quot;Larry Silverstein, he&#39;s a great guy, a good guy. He&#39;s a friend of mine.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting quote, noted for it&#39;s brevity but definitely sounds like they know each other.  I&#39;ve heard Trump say he went into the WTC building after the first bombing in 1993--so I wouldn&#39;t doubt if they knew each other.  Did you see the Trump quotes from 9/11 or 9/12 (He was on at least 2 stations that I know of--one was a phone call on 9/11, the other a street interview on 9/12 for a local NYC tv station (WB).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is what it is. I&#39;m not denying what you&#39;re saying, but we&#39;ll have to wait and see the whole picture. The president may very well have to worry about consolidating power and nothing else right now, so going with the flow in Saudi Arabia is the right choice. He surely needs to pick his battles.</p>

<p>Balanced with other evidence, in particular the fact that the establishment is desperately against him, I&#39;m more than satisfied with what I&#39;ve seen, and willing to give him plenty of leeway to navigate his way forward.</p>
