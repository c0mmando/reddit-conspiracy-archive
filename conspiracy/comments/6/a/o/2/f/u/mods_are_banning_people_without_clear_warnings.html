       That's not how Reddit defines doxxing, if a reputable news source has published the personal​ info then it's not doxxing.  If that hasn't happened then it's still doxxing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because​ the information is publicly available in some form doesn't mean it's been packaged as "this man is a pedophile and here is his address" and published as such online.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is reddit's property and if you want to use it then you have to follow their rules.  The mods here can't tell the admins to fuck off if they decide that /Conspiracy isn't an environment where their ToS is being followed and ban the whole sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have exactly 2 choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cleanse the post of all personal information before linking it here, or don't link it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no battle to be fought between the mods and the pizzagate "investigators".  And if you guys don't cut the shit out we will be left with no choice but to indiscriminately remove all pizzagate content.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ask yourself this, can you find a way to post pizzagate stuff here that doesn't contain or link to doxxing?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so than you can possibly get people interested enough to go to voat on their own where the rules are different.  If not then you're only harming your own movement by cutting yourselves out of our substantial audience here at Reddit.

       I know.  Still it's pretty annoying, it's hard to investigate people if you can't even share what you find.  I wish you guys would stick up to the admins, but I understand your position.

       I've had my fair share of debates with the admins and I've even won a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       But how can I debate the admins about an unprofessional investigative mob that has no due process and immediately posts all personal information it can find on anyone remotely connected to anything pizzagate related?
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes I called it a mob.  It's a mob because the entity which is made up of individuals researching this pedogate stuff has no rules, no oversight, no checks, no balances... Nothing.  It's literally madmax and the pizza dome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has it occurred to anyone that some 13 year old 4chan troll could intentionally slip some person's name into the pizzagate mythology that has nothing to do with podesta or any pedophile ring?  It could be their math teacher that pissed them off or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen some crazy shit posted in relation to pizzagate that isn't acceptable in a world of due process and legal rights.  I know it sucks that the government let's people like Denis hastert off easy when they are "serial child molesters" but what about every day Joe that isn't any kind of child molester who has done nothing wrong, suddenly becoming an internet star and accused of horrible crimes because of a mob style investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to put people's names out there and accuse them of crimes then put your own name out there as their accusor.  People have a right to face their accusor.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe in the morality that protects us from false imprisonment from anonymous accusations then why do you believe in the morality that protects children from being sexual prey?
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these morality​ driven laws have one thing in common.  Protecting the innocent.  The admins philosophy about doxxing is solid, even if they execute it poorly like they did when they allowed the doxxing of voiletacrez, it can't be argued that doxxing should be okay.

       Anyways, I think we're going to have to agree to disagree.  Pizzagate is extremely thoroughly researched, and I don't believe anybody has been accused unjustly.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, when the victims are children I believe that their needs should absolutely take precedence over those of others.  If pizzagate is real (it is) then these people are committing some of the most heinous acts possible.  Anybody associated with them should be suspect, but I have yet to see anybody in the spotlight who doesn't deserve it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I went to voat and looked at the post you banned, and it doesn't really seem like a quality article.  I see why you removed the post, but the banhammer might have been a bit heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The admins philosophy about doxxing is just another method to control discussion.  I see why you have to enforce it, but I think it's total b.s.
