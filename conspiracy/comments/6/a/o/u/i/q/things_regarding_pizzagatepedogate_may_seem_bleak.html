        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is the beginning of the end for the cabal, folks.</p>

<p><strong>Although pedophilia and child trafficking have been foundational pillars of the New World Order for many, many generations, our investigation and massive exposure of their culture, symbolism, and network of blackmail has become mainstream within the conspiracy culture and alternative movement! And it has only been 7 months!</strong></p>

<p>We have planted the seeds and laid the foundation for a new era. In this era, the MSM is no longer relevant, and the two party system is beginning to crumble. Their horrid crimes of pedophilia and human trafficking, as well as their pervasive network of blackmailing our public servants and politicians, are out in the open <strong>More than Ever before</strong>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time to unite under this cause. We finally have a non partisan issue to band together under. This Pedo stuff really scared them, and you can tell they are pulling out ALL the stops to shut us the fuck up. They can only hide from us for so long. Don&#39;t let them get control off the net before it&#39;s too late, we need to be able to share Information freely. </p>

<p>Their time is over. This is <em>our</em> time now. I love you all!</p>

<p>Edit: out of curiosity, what are the vote statistics on this post? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea Alex jones&#39; apology is what really made me walk away from Infowars too.</p>

<p>He has an obligation as the so called &quot;alternative media leader&quot;, to carry himself in a presentable manner, especially considering the fact that he is branded as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t you want to appear and come off as normal and articulate and poised as possible? Everyone already thinks you are &quot;wacky&quot; given your positions. Jones only indulges in this...</p>

<p>&quot;1776 WILL COMMENCE AGAIN!&quot; </p>

<p>...dude...that just made us looks like an insane and volatile movement of rebels...</p>

<p>See what I mean? He&#39;s a gatekeeper. It&#39;s all about presentation. He&#39;s a plant and has been for a long time guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, every system ever has up-ended and been finished by  &quot;the majority&quot; of one sort or another.  Sometimes, it actually <em>even is</em> a majority.</p>

<p>Most of the time, it&#39;s deluded sycophants who think they know better than everyone else because they are the only ones with the magic glasses enabling them to perceive the truth.</p>

<p>And, for the current System, yes, an honest majority are beginning to have legitamate doubts about their country ... and why shouldn&#39;t they?  The  candidate with little support from anyone except the farthest of fringe belief became elected after direct actions of foreign influence.  Talk about reaping what you sow!!  The US has had that coming to it for over 90 years.</p>

<p>What will happen??  Trouble for anyone who just wants to have a family and enjoy a weekend barbeque.  That&#39;s about all anyone can say for certain.</p>

<p>And, for what?  that some self-righteous group of idiots full of illogical, myth-based lies get to feel like their making history??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice try.  No, it&#39;s <em>not</em> a stupid theory, it&#39;s fact.  Your ignorance on the matter is completely irrelevant.  High-level pedophilia culture is completely proven to exist, many times over.  Look at what&#39;s going on with the Vatican, the British and Australian governments, in Belgium with the Dutroux Affair, or in America with the Franklin Scandal during the 80s (and connected to the Reagan White House), Dennis Hastert or even the testimony of Cathy O&#39;Brien.  Look at the testimony of former CIA and intelligence community officials like Robert David Steele or Field McConnell or Sibel Edmunds, they have all confirmed this to be true.  The CIA and Mossad regularly blackmail politicians with pedophilia, it&#39;s one of the few ways they can guarantee consent and get the agenda through, and some of them just enjoy it.  The idea that only lower-class individuals and regular people engage in this sort of behavior is hilariously naive, but it&#39;s pretty clear your intentions are less than genuine since you replied back with such a dismissive post and ignored all the historical evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice try.  No, it&#39;s <em>not</em> a stupid theory, it&#39;s fact.  Your ignorance on the matter is completely irrelevant.  High-level pedophilia culture is completely proven to exist, many times over.  Look at what&#39;s going on with the Vatican, the British and Australian governments, in Belgium with the Dutroux Affair, or in America with the Franklin Scandal during the 80s (and connected to the Reagan White House), Dennis Hastert or even the testimony of Cathy O&#39;Brien.  Look at the testimony of former CIA and intelligence community officials like Robert David Steele or Field McConnell or Sibel Edmunds, they have all confirmed this to be true.  The CIA and Mossad regularly blackmail politicians with pedophilia, it&#39;s one of the few ways they can guarantee consent and get the agenda through, and some of them just enjoy it.  The idea that only lower-class individuals and regular people engage in this sort of behavior is hilariously naive, but it&#39;s pretty clear your intentions are less than genuine since you replied back with such a dismissive post and ignored all the historical evidence.</p>
