    <div class="md"><p>Seriously? <em>Is it legal</em>?</p>

<p>We&#39;re essentially at a house party on private property. If someone breaks the rules, especially the posted ones, and gets booted from the party because they broke a rule(s), there&#39;s no <em>is this legal?</em> about it. Even better, because it&#39;s private property, they can drop-kick anyone for pretty much any reason because it&#39;s their house. It sucks, but that&#39;s how private property works. That the mods often warn people before banning is simply a courtesy; it&#39;s not a right or a necessity. Sucks, but that&#39;s how it is.</p>

<p>If you want to make the rules, you need to be the one hosting the party on your own property. </p>

<p>To be honest, the principle of the ban makes zero sense because users can just create new accounts. I don&#39;t know why mods would think taking the time to ban users really makes sense in a world where someone can create a new account in seconds. It&#39;s a waste of time.</p>
