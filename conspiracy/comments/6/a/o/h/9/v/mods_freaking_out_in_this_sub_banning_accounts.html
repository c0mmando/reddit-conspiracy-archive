       I've been banned from this sub before for calling a mod a "trump lover" and really lame and benign things like that, small shit.

       I prolly wouldn't be a good mod based on your metrics... cause I would enforce the rules... which would prolly lead to you getting banned again for admitting to ban evading.

       The same could be said for all of the rabbit holes. TBH once you figure out the methods of control, it will make you sick; until you learn to cope.. even then it's disheartening to see your fellow species blindly carry on through life without a care in the world.

       Perhaps it's hard sometimes to discern between being attacked for no good reason (which is most of the day long here) and being attacked for a reason, if your criticism doesn't come across as an attack in the first place it'd certainly help. I'm totally fine with polite constructive criticism.

       Seriously?
       <em>
        Is it legal
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       We're essentially at a house party on private property. If someone breaks the rules, especially the posted ones, and gets booted from the party because they broke a rule(s), there's no
       <em>
        is this legal?
       </em>
       about it. Even better, because it's private property, they can drop-kick anyone for pretty much any reason because it's their house. It sucks, but that's how private property works. That the mods often warn people before banning is simply a courtesy; it's not a right or a necessity. Sucks, but that's how it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to make the rules, you need to be the one hosting the party on your own property.

      <p>
       To be honest, the principle of the ban makes zero sense because users can just create new accounts. I don't know why mods would think taking the time to ban users really makes sense in a world where someone can create a new account in seconds. It's a waste of time.
