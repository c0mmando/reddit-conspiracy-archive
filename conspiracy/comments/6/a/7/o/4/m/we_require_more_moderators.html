<p>Good. </p>

<p>The conspiracy page currently has many active users and large volumes of comments and submissions, as such the existing team needs some community help with recommendations and votes for a few new moderators. </p>

<p>Many of you will have seen these types of threads before so please feel free to make nominations and submit your votes in a civil and respectful manner. </p>

<p>The current team all have lives and loves away from r/conspiracy and this is reflected in our request for some more help. </p>

<p>The page grows and so does the need for active and enthusiastic helpers. We are looking for diverse users, perhaps those who are based in different countries and those who have previous moderation experience. In short, if you feel you can offer us something we need then please mention it in your offer to help. </p>

<p>The only set criteria we are requesting is that anyone who expresses an interest in moderating r/conspiracy have at least a <strong>one year old account and +1000 positive karma.</strong> </p>

<p>We also request that anyone who is interested be of open mind and that they be individuals who can commit a some time to guard against low effort content and to uphold the values of the page. </p>

<p>Please keep the thread respectful and good luck to anyone who wants to join the varied biscuit barrel that is r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>All final decisions and selections are at the current teams discretion.</p>

<p>Edit: <strong><em>One nomination per user please.</em></strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I wish there was a little bit more attention given to obvious forum manipulators. But I also think this is a &quot;but then where do we stop?&quot; kinda problem. And it has been answered by &quot;if we wait long enough the shills will run out of money or energy or both, and we don&#39;t have to ban anyone incorrectly&quot; as a solution. </p>

<p>Also, I have been tagging obvious shitbags for a few months. And I learned that a bunch of people I thought of as shills are actually just...different. Because the majority of the actual shills have superficially real accounts, 1-6yr history, posts in a smattering of other subs, 10k+ karma. But I never see the same ones twice. Like we will get hit with this wave this week, and I will rarely or never see those users again. They just burn the acct and switch to new ones. </p>

<p>It is a complicated problem and I wish I was smarter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very complicated and yeah there&#39;s no solution as far as banning and removing things. I just want to see it be acknowledged and a comment stickied saying something like &quot;notice: there is vote manipulation and lots of divisive discussion going on&quot; or something like that. Just so it doesn&#39;t go unaddressed. Because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really a solvable problem, the last thing I&#39;d do is go around removing all the comments, but I just want it to be acknowledged because a lot of the actually different users can be tricked into thinking that what we see as politics is nothing more than a show with the sole purpose of distraction. </p>

<p>People are too emotionally attached to their own beliefs and need a reality check</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t just invent a fallacy, especially when it does not correspond to any logical progression. Account age, as stated every other time you&#39;ve alleged otherwise, is one of several useful indicators to utilize when approaching information. Again, combined with post and comment history, you can seriously determine one&#39;s motives. An example of this is how some users only post comments in an attempt to start arguments with other users. </p>

<p>No matter how many times you try, it won&#39;t work because your &quot;account age fallacy&quot; is a fallacious statement in and of itself.</p>

<p>Do you have any screen shots or links to back-up these claims? I didn&#39;t see the comment before it was removed but I&#39;m guessing it was an accusation of being a shill towards somebody? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read through your comment history of the last 8 or so days and it appears you&#39;re here solely to turn the community on the mods and a  select few commenters. </p>

<p>Of course that could be totally wrong so I&#39;m asking you what your motives and goals are by commenting here? You&#39;ve made some very valid points but I feel like you&#39;re only using them to take down your opponents. </p>

<p>So I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is do you care about or want to be a part of this community or is you&#39;re only goal to takedown the people you&#39;ve chosen and the mods with it?</p>

<p>do you always react that way to opinions or theories that you don&#39;t agree with - or just certain things you don&#39;t agree with - and what would happen if you are a moderator then and confronted with someone who doesn&#39;t believe in nukes, how could they expect anything fair from you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, digging up old dirt! I see you have a serious investment in this. Wonder why that would be. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t express myself well in that comment chain, it&#39;s true. Perhaps I would deserve 1 strike out of 3 for that. </p>

<p>I was simply irritated that people would insinuate nuclear weapons don&#39;t exist, which is a viewpoint I consider to be disinformation to make conspiracy forums look bad, because of the absolutely overwhelming amount of evidence showing it to be true. Like the fact nuclear power exists, or that two Japanese cities were completely destroyed. Or all the natives who got radiation poisoning in Bikini Atolls, from all the testing. There&#39;s just far too much history to act as though it&#39;s a legitimate hypothesis, and this was the reason I was upset in that moment. </p>

<p>Some disinfo will have to be tolerated because it&#39;s not always clear what is true and what isn&#39;t, but people outright ignoring things where there are overwhelming evidence is disingenuous conversation, which is a form of gaslighting. Intentional gaslighting is trolling. So if I saw that thread as a moderator, I would give a warning to move up the pyramid of disagreement, and then if the tone didn&#39;t change or kept derailing the thread with emotional attacks, then a strike would be issued because the person is working against the interests of the forum. However if a person is usually good and just got pissed one day, then maybe a strike could be removed. But if there is a consistent pattern of behavior that is negative and unhelpful to the quality of the forum, then 3 strikes will be accumulated.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> on this one   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/69na4b/to_flat_earthers_the_fact_that_people_are/dh7wacw/?context=10000">source</a></p>

<p>sucks when you are interested in a conspiracy niche that people like you aren&#39;t interested in, yet instead of just ignoring a post about whatever subject - they feel they must downvote it or attack the person in the comments like you did ... this makes for a lot of animosity where certain topics never are voted up and are always downvoted to oblivion - have you considered this from the perspective of those people? for someone who complains about gaslighting - you are actively participating whether you realize it or not, in the gaslighting of others</p>

<p>You&#39;re really abusing the meaning of that term, because it is to <em>deliberately</em> mislead people in to thinking true things are false, or false things are true. If I honestly believe what I say, it&#39;s not gaslighting. </p>

<p>If this sub started getting 100 posts a day about how Hillary is actually secretly Dracula and can change in to a bat, and people were upvoting these to the front page of the sub as a joke (or to ruin its reputation) then why wouldn&#39;t the sub take action against that? Do you think people should just be allowed to mess with the sub like that? Because I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>It means, I&#39;m not what you are trying to portray me as. I&#39;m a voluntaryist. I believe all interactions should be voluntary and do not believe in government. I believe in society and community. </p>

<p>Now, I talk about whether white&#39;s would be better off being in a voluntary white society, as would... blacks in the same (and asians, etc etc). We are tribal, as humans. It&#39;s an interesting thought.  We trade and communicate with all, but in our communities we are the same. Which is why Socialism somewhat works (for now) in Scandinavian countries.. </p>

<p>Be proud of your race, your culture, your history. But no one race/culture is superior... My words get warped.. But this is what I mean. Doesn&#39;t help I play Devil&#39;s Advocate. But, that is another topic...</p>

<p>Perhaps this time around putin felt like letting others nominate him would be the best course of action. In the past he&#39;s seemed a bit ravenous in these threads. A little too hungry for that mod spot.</p>

<p>He seems to have a tendency to fly off the handle, and also seems to be a very heavy drinker. I also remember him bring totally against voting in general one day, and the next I see him shouting magamagamaga and all other type of nonsense. It was pretty strange.</p>

<p>You can say that all you want, but absolutely nobody believes it because it doesn&#39;t make sense logically and because you&#39;re incredibly transparent.  </p>

<p>If you were just &quot;playing Devil&#39;s advocate&quot; trying to do research then why did you:</p>

<ul>
<li>delete the thread after 1 response</li>
<li>deny making it</li>
<li>subsequently lie about not being German, then take that back when called out on it</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, you create your own interpretations of the German language to try to deny things that Himmler outright stated in addition to presenting a woeful lack of understanding regarding what the Nazis did in Poland in an effort to try and minimize their actions.</p>

<p>All of these things combined would lead anybody coming here to think that you are a Nazi supporter without even mentioning the fact that you literally said  <em>&quot;I&#39;m proud of my German ancestry and fuck you if you think we are rebels. At least we had the balls....... You sheep dick mother fucker&#39;s didn&#39;t&quot;</em> while linking to Hitler speeches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really want to, but we need good mods that are proven to be on the side of the people/users/subscribers, and not the ones who&#39;d wish to infiltrate us and run us off course.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve been around Reddit to see the changes.<br/></li>
<li>Believe in less moderation the better.<br/></li>
<li>Periodically reference this post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/">How Reddit Was Destroyed</a></li>
<li>Been voted up 417,039 times on <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a></li>
<li>Comments been voted up 17,662 times on <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a></li>
<li>Brought in James Corbett, Russ Baker, and Bill Still for AMA&#39;s</li>
<li>Supported the Kevin Ryan and Sibel Edmonds AMA&#39;s</li>
<li>I also co-own [911Blogger.com](<a href="http://www.911blogger.com">www.911blogger.com</a>) which some felt was a conflict of interest last time I moderated here.</li>
</ul>

<p>I always take the side of the users here.  Mods should look at the user base as the treasure and not the enemy.  Some mods I&#39;ve noticed have taken the authoritarian tact of looking at the subscribers here as their adversaries rather than those they are part of and serving.  Typical political/authority/power dynamics.</p>

<p>Obvious shills should be dealt with of course.  But those who moderate least, or as little as necessary, are moderating best.  Moderators should also be open to constructive criticism and feedback and not abuse Rule 10 to ban any perceived adversaries.  If a moderator loses faith or hope in the user base, they should resign because that is what has historically made Reddit the awesome site that it is and has been.</p>

<p>The list of rules should be reconsidered from time to time as well as the mods in my opinion and discussed.  Some have the potential to be abused like many of us have experienced in other major subreddits around here.</p>

<p>Peace.  And put forth some good names if you pay attention to that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Especially since the globalists&#39; pet shill lost despite rigging her hardest. They&#39;re VERY pro-shill and anti-regular-user.</p>

<p>I saw several of them claiming &quot;certain people&quot; were &quot;regulars&quot; despite those people having nothing but history in globalist safe spaces like r/politics prior to the $40m injection to ShareBlue/CTR, then <em>boom</em> - they&#39;re &quot;regulars&quot; and never post outside this sub, pretend to chum it up with people here, but ONLY post pro-globalist pro-establishment comments.</p>

<p>The new mods &#39;curiously&#39; LOVE these users to the exclusion of everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m legitimately confused, I post primarily on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, and generally match the description of the &#39;shills&#39; you say have invaded this community. I&#39;m not getting paid, but am I considered a shill? Is a shill only a person being paid by CTR and shareblue, or is this like a guilt-by-association thing? I joined this subreddit during the election and have hung around for the Trump related conspiracies, as I&#39;m sure is the case with many if not most of the other liberals who lurk here.

<p>I would say yes, except for the fact that I&#39;m not sure that you can be proven innocent if you didn&#39;t participate here before the election cycle. Swarms of actual paid shills on both sides of the aisle are active on Reddit. Cambridge Analytica + Shareblue have both seen to that. So honestly, unless you&#39;ve been posting here for a while any time you get really involved in a partisan way you&#39;ll be looked at with suspicion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would urge everyone to look closely at this users account, it&#39;s suspect as hell.</p>

<p>No submission history before 3 years ago. Then almost nonstop news article posting to all the big news subs, quite bot like with zero comments. Then almost all submissions stop and it pretty much full on comments.</p>

<p>I have never even heard of this guy but he has a special flair for some reason when they seemingly don&#39;t even post here that much, more often at the_donald. I will admit that I almost always have the CSS turned off, and it was a fluke that I even noticed his flair, so maybe that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t notice this user sooner.</p>

<p>I mean seriously, two whole years of nothing but submissions to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, worldnews, news, a bit of funny, cars, and conspiracy.</p>

<p>Plus we&#39;ve got a mod here flexing their green muscle, a mod who vanished and suddenly in a strange way and reappeared later. Make of that what you will.</p>

<p>I would ask users to vote against this person due to their sketchy history.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with having those interests, I think many here probably share them. </p>

<p>I just find it strange that you have a 6 year old account, with history going back only three years. The start of your posting history a solid block of nothing but posts, no comments. Then suddenly you begin making a majority of comments with little submissions.</p>

<p>Did you erase your posting history or something, or did you just not make a single post to reddit until you were a member for 3 years?</p>

<p>No I don&#39;t. What is sketchy about it? You keep bringing up 3 years and other nonsense when my very first post here was back in 2010 when I created my account. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I may ask, how did you get your flair here and who gave it to you?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember. I was browsing a thread and there was a discussion about the flair one mod had and I said &quot;that&#39;s pretty cool, how do I get one?&quot; They said send me an image and I&#39;ll give you one. So that&#39;s what happened. </p>

<p>Why do you think you&#39;d be a good mod here? You said nothing besides tagging yourself in your original post.</p>

<p>The reason I would be a good mod here is because I have been coming to this subreddit for years and always post and share worthwhile information. I even created a write-up in the wiki for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to try and help people interested in 9/11. </p>

<p>Many of the mods are familiar with me and they already know that I regularly show up and post here. I stay out of the drama and I care about this sub. If you&#39;ll go back the last few days in my comment history you can see me talking about trying to clean it up before a mod spot was even purposed. </p>

<p>The reason I would be a good mod here is because I have been coming to this subreddit for years and always post and share worthwhile information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a lot of people though. Do you have any experience modding? I&#39;m just saying that many others are in the exact same position, helpful members of the community, what sets you apart from them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;ll go back the last few days in my comment history you can see me talking about trying to clean it up before a mod spot was even purposed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I saw that post. It&#39;s been known for awhile though that they would be searching for new mods, a post was originally put up asking for mods then put on hold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I&#39;ll admit that I was wrong about your post history.</p>

<p>I opened up your user page in another browser and was able to go beyond 3 years. So it must be some sort of error with my RES.</p>

<p>So I apologize for that.</p>

<p>I singled you out here because for one, you have a flair and that&#39;s pretty rare, and two you had a mod give you a nod in the comments. That leads me to believe you probably have a good shot a getting a mod spot.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t say I&#39;m 100% on board with that, but the users and other mods will decide. I just hope you have good intentions and aren&#39;t apart of some scheme or group to disrupt or hurt this sub in any way.</p>

<p>So again, sorry for calling you out about your post history, I was wrong about that. I&#39;m not gonna keep going through your history now since I was wrong before. Plus three more years to look through? Nah. </p>

<p>Good luck, and if you are chosen, good luck as a new mod.</p>

<p>Also, any mods out there want to give me a flair? :D</p>

<p>I like to spend majority of my time on the internet on Reddit and about a year ago <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> became my home-sub.</p>

<p>I love crazy conspiracies and not so crazy conspiracies. I navigate through HOT, NEW, and RISING and see duplicate posts waaaay too much. Happy to help out in that sense to ensure the content is clean and not being doubled or trippled.</p>

<p>Also, i have never been a mod on Reddit. I have a history of &quot;modding&quot; as i have run @Games on DALnet and EFnet on IRC waaaay back in the day so i have some experience working with large communities.</p>

<p>I am on EST and work from 9-5 but am on reddit for most of those hours and when i am at home, reddit is fun is always open on my tablet.</p>

<p>cheers. </p>

<p>As <a href="/u/sep11insidejob">/u/sep11insidejob</a> said, I&#39;m really not interested - mainly because don&#39;t think it would be in the best interests of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> if I were made a full mod. The topics I write about are &quot;controversial&quot; - borderline taboo - especially in the eyes of &quot;<strong><em>The Usual Suspects</em></strong>&quot;, those who are doing all they can shut this sub down, and push censorship across Reddit and in social media in general.</p>

<p>Making me a mod would stir up a <strong><em>shit storm</em></strong> of drama: <em>&quot;Look! They made a known anti-Trilobite a mod!!!&quot;</em>, lol!</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, this sub is precious, in that it is one of the few places left on Reddit with a GREAT mod team - one that hasn&#39;t either been infiltrated by saboteurs, or BULLIED into enforcing censorship by &quot;<strong><em>The Usual Suspects</em></strong>&quot;. I want to see the integrity of this sub preserved, and I sure as HELL don&#39;t want to give those clowns any more ammo in their relentless poop-flinging.</p>

<p>There are a number of other nominees here that I would fully support, and whom I&#39;m sure would do a better job than I.</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to throw my name into the hat. My account has been active (with regular activity) for over 2 years and I have 35.7k karma. I believe in transparency (without completely doxxing myself), so here&#39;s a little bit about me. Feel free to ask any followup questions.</p>

<p>This is my top submission to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> [OC] <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/56u8vz/new_evidence_of_ctr_on_reddit_from_podesta_emails/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/56u8vz/new_evidence_of_ctr_on_reddit_from_podesta_emails/</a></p>

<p>I am a progressive that caucused for Bernie in IA but voted for Trump in the general because imo the least progressive thing you can do subvert our democracy... especially when you&#39;re getting rid of our democratic process to cheat progressives.</p>

<p>I also am a strong supporter of the DNC Fraud Lawsuit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DNCfraudlawsuit/">https://www.facebook.com/DNCfraudlawsuit/</a> which I have been following I guess for at least 8 months (proof: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/POLITIC/comments/4ye32x/class_action_lawsuit_against_debbie_wasserman/">example 1</a>, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5414jx/dnc_files_scathing_rebuttal_wants_fraud_lawsuit/">example 2</a>)</p>

<p>I got banned a few days ago from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> for 21 days because I kept responding to a harasser / stalker. This shouldn&#39;t happen on any sub and I will fight to defend you all from users like this. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/69exrs/yes_bernie_would_probably_have_won_and_his/dh6l372/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=user&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=frontpage">https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/69exrs/yes_bernie_would_probably_have_won_and_his/dh6l372/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=user&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=frontpage</a></p>

<p>I think it&#39;s too risky to support Democrats especially with Tom &quot;<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4429">Bernie only appeals to young white liberals</a>&quot; Perez as the new chair (none of the other chair candidates addressed the rigged primaries either though). Because of this, I also started a new sub called <a href="/r/New_Movement/">/r/New_Movement/</a> that aims to support 3rd parties, or force the Democratic Party to reform (fair primaries, an apology for 2016, and ending FPTP in favor of scored ballots).</p>

<p>I always try to use sources in my submissions &amp; comments, and I expect others to do the same. In this sub I really have found that there are too many low-effort posts, and too many of them are efforts to spread disinformation (I am definitely not the most tactful... so if that&#39;s a requirement I might be out of luck) e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/69nwuc/wikileaks_calls_npr_out_for_spreading_false/dh8wuc3/?context=10000">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/69nwuc/wikileaks_calls_npr_out_for_spreading_false/dh8wuc3/?context=10000</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the delayed response. Got busy with work and then got busy again. Plus these questions aren&#39;t that straightforward ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you weigh the balance between the free flow of information and the necessary enforcement of certain rules to ensure that subversive manipulation is not able to undermine discourse?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well here it depends. I&#39;ll give you a couple examples. Sometimes it should be pretty obvious. If someone is doxxing a private citizen, no matter how good the cause, it threatens this community so it really can&#39;t be tolerated. Generally I think it&#39;s best to let upvotes &amp; downvotes do their job, but at the same time I think it&#39;s clear to most of us that have spent any time online, we&#39;re going to experience trolls and others who will actively work to hurt the sub. For example, I tend to get annoyed when people refuse to back up their claims, or when the sources people give me don&#39;t back up what they are claiming. I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m guilty of breaking rule #10 and calling another user a shill. But what&#39;s the best way not to be called a shill? Imo the best way is to back up your claims. Personally, I&#39;d like an open discussion about extending rule #11 to comments, but maybe that idea is a little reactionary. However, I&#39;m in this sub because I&#39;m seeking the <em>truth</em>. And imo that should be <em>the</em> guiding principle for the sub. I&#39;m more than willing to change my views when presented new data. But show me the data! And don&#39;t do it just for <em>me</em>. Do it so another Redditor who&#39;s reading our conversation can be better informed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How much do you value free speech as an ideological concept</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an ideological concept, beyond the cliche yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a movie theater, free speech is a must. Whether free speech is working optimally in the US is another question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you defer to that maxim when determining what should be removed/censored?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to say that I do but I don&#39;t, but I also don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a big deal. Even if I wanted to make the argument that Reddit supported free speech I wouldn&#39;t use specific subreddits as an example to prove my point. I&#39;d say that you have free speech on Reddit because if you don&#39;t agree with a particular sub, or if nobody is talking about what you want to talk about, then you can create your own sub. The question is what kind of community do <em>we</em> want?</p>

<p>If I am selected as a mod of this sub I promise to go by the book, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not going to try to change the book. Personally I think this sub has been flooded with meta posts. Do we really need 5 different posts on the front page of this sub saying how &#39;this sub has changed&#39; or &#39;has anyone noticed all these shills posting&#39;... yes... yes I have noticed <em>your</em> shill posts that pushes good content further down. And these posts never have any sources, not even Reddit links... and some of them get tons of upvotes. I don&#39;t think they need to be completely banned from the sub, but what if we limited meta discussion to a daily thread or made Friday a &quot;Free talk Friday&quot; kinda thing (allow memes, etc). I&#39;m just spitballing but I think there has to be a better compromise. I also think we should do the best we can to promote good comments &amp; the truth. How do you win an argument with someone who lies over and over again and doesn&#39;t include sources? And we&#39;re all aware how easy it is to make low-effort comments, right? Why should we give astroturfers a free pass to shitpost in our sub and paint a narrative by commenting en masse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hmm, this kind of post reads like a political campaign.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m just going to group this other user&#39;s comment in with this while I&#39;m at it. Sorry for only talking politics... I&#39;m into other stuff too, but politics does take up most of my Reddit time. Overall, if it&#39;s <em>good conspiracy content</em> I will support it.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks again for your time and consideration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you elaborate? This sub already limits free speech, so what in particular am I saying that&#39;s any different? You aren&#39;t allowed to doxx here. You aren&#39;t allowed to call users a &quot;shill&quot;. You aren&#39;t even allowed to post obviously fabricated stories.</p>

<p>So am I allowed to spam the shit out of users, to the point where I either astroturf the narrative my way with false information or they call me a shill and good users get banned? Am I allowed to astroturf this sub with shitposts / shitcomments to undermine the sub&#39;s entire message? I don&#39;t want to do that, but that&#39;s what you seem to be telling me people are able to do. And imo there should be no surprise that this sub <em>is</em> filled with trolls &amp; shills if that&#39;s the case.</p>

<p>Honestly your short dismissal kinda pisses me off a bit. You asked me an extremely philosophical question and just brushed it off in a sentence, and your response is quite contrary to how the sub actually works (I.e. It already limits free speech). I guess I&#39;m not sure what you think I want to do and why you think that. I&#39;m no vigilante dictator. The only thing I&#39;m looking for is the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize for the short reply, its not that I don&#39;t value your input on the point its just that your mentality, sadly, is incompatible with the mechanisms of moderation which facilitate the organic curation of content on the sub.</p>

<p>The mentality that you hold opens the door to a paternalistic approach to moderation which has simply never been allowed to take hold on the mod team, and sadly it was that core maxim within your argument which resulted in a prima facie exclusion from consideration.</p>

<p>The issue is not that what you propose is unreasonable (and I very much respect where you come from with your desire to ward off untruths and attacks); but the bottom line is that the mod teams will never assert themselves as arbiters of truth, which is why you are, sadly, fundamentally incompatible with the moderation of the subreddit. And, no, we don&#39;t want you to re-write the book, we have fought hard to keep the organic curation of content as the fundamental maxim of this subreddit, and that will not be changing.</p>

<p>We welcome your contributions to the subreddit very much, and your ends are surely noble, but sadly they also clash, on the most basic level, with the mod&#39;s team unwillingness to paternalisticly determine truth from on high.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not the content or the truth that I&#39;d like to see get moderated. Maybe I emphasized certain examples too much or maybe you are trying to err on the side of caution, but that&#39;s definitely  not what I&#39;m <em>trying</em> to talk about.</p>

<p>The <em>behaviors</em> I&#39;m talking about are repeated lying, not trying to help the discussion by providing relevant facts/sources to back up your claims, etc. Obviously none of that can be determined by a single comment and I&#39;m not saying we ban anybody who &#39;sounds&#39; like a shill. I imagine you guys don&#39;t ban users based on a single post or comment, but rather you look at their history and see if there is good evidence to determine if the user is legit or only works to troll other users, right? That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying... that there <em>are</em> limits to free speech even on this sub (just like the sub is <em>already</em> supposed to limit self posts with lack of context or content; no memes; etc).</p>

<p>There is a difference between users saying they believe &quot;X&quot;; users asserting that &quot;X&quot; is true with supporting evidence; and users that assert &quot;X&quot; is true repeatedly without supporting evidence, even when they are pressed or questioned for more information. And sometimes you&#39;ll see tons of users submitting low-effort comments with none of them backing up their claims even when asked. They blanket the post (astroturf) with these comments to influence other visitors who also take a look at the comments. The goal is to paint a narrative via hivemind i.e. <em>if everybody here believes it then it must be true because only a few people are saying otherwise</em>. Shouldn&#39;t we empower our active community members moreso than the people trying to troll us?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve experienced the following so many times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Redditor: X is true</p>

<p>Me: No, it&#39;s not. Why do you believe that? Do you have any links?</p>

<p>Redditor: It&#39;s obvious X is true, there is plenty of evidence to support it [does not include any links to said evidence]</p>

<p>Me: Ok... can you link me to that data? I&#39;ve already Googled the subject and can&#39;t find anything that supports your claim</p>

<p>Redditor: Post proof that the sky is blue</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or here&#39;s an actual example that happened to me recently in this sub (I wrote the above inspired from this link). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/69nwuc/wikileaks_calls_npr_out_for_spreading_false/dh8vyru/?context=10000">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/69nwuc/wikileaks_calls_npr_out_for_spreading_false/dh8vyru/?context=10000</a></p>

<p>In the link directly above it looks like a mod even removed that user&#39;s comment, but maybe the user just deleted it on their own? If it was a mod then how can what I&#39;m saying be <em>fundamentally incompatible with the moderation of the subreddit</em> if what I&#39;m proposing is just more of the same? Maybe we just need more people in the community to stop the trolls?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The behaviors I&#39;m talking about are repeated lying, not trying to help the discussion by providing relevant facts/sources to back up your claims, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fundamentally, what such a thing requires is a top-down judgement of veracity by moderators which is something we simply are not willing to do. You can say that you&#39;re moderating behavior in that case, but at the end of the day &quot;behavior&quot; becomes a subjective term in the context of requiring sources and such to back up claims. We want to encourage discussion, not put limits on what is acceptable by virtue of adapting a standard of &quot;veracity&quot;. Such a thing undermines the very nature of the subreddit, as it functions as a space curated entirely by votes with regards the content of a given submission or comment.</p>

<p>What it sounds like you might be better served doing would be to be active in the comment sections of some of the submissions on the sub, as we much rather you have a horizontal playing field with other users when debating veracity/sources/etc.</p>

<p>So yea, I suppose my response again is that, although it may seem like you&#39;re going after behavior, your perspective eventually requires subjective determinations of veracity and is simply incompatible  with the hexis of the current mod team as, again, we would not a vertical control structure with regards veracity </p>

<p>Rather than encouraging discussion, doesn&#39;t this encourage and empower trolls to post completely unverified information and lies?</p>

<p>What we should have no problem with: <em>I heard X from a friend so I think this</em> (we shouldn&#39;t have an issue because &#39;it is what it is&#39; and it <em>is</em> anecdotal evidence that the user didn&#39;t exaggerate or lie about)</p>

<p><em>MANY</em> things can undermine the very nature of the subreddit. As soon as a post reaches /all we&#39;re going to get users who never would comment in our posts before who will work to undermine our community, astroturf us with low-effort comments, and upvote other low-effort comments (or has this sub opted out of /all?). Obviously that&#39;s not the only time it happens, but if we want good discussion shouldn&#39;t we discourage discussion that hurts our sub? I wouldn&#39;t even call what many ppl do in this sub &#39;discussion&#39; - many have an agenda to just keep repeating a lie until another user snaps and calls them a shill or troll or something. That&#39;s what happened to me in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and is why I got banned for 21 days. Is <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/69exrs/yes_bernie_would_probably_have_won_and_his/dh6l372/">THIS</a> the kind of behavior you&#39;re saying should be allowed in this sub?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How is it a horizontal playing field when people in this community have to constantly deal with trolls? You originally asked about rules to <em>ensure that subversive manipulation is not able to undermine discourse</em>. Isn&#39;t trolling, astroturfing, and brigading inherently subversive manipulation?</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to stick around, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only user tired of the clutter (e.g. constant meta posts) and tired of meeting trolls here.</p>

<p>1) Any user can check my post history 2) I am fair but respectful of the rules 3) I am on here a lot anyway 4) I am passionate and offer a woman&#39;s perspective (do not see a lot of women on here) 5) I am open-minded and love this subreddit. </p>

<p>Also, I am a huge contributor here. I have written some pretty popular posts, and I write whenever I can!!</p>

<p>I am a compassionate person who cares deeply about others, but as a teacher, I also understand the necessity of rules. At the same time, I am definitely one who believes (for the most part) the less moderation the better. I feel I would be balanced and fair.</p>

<p>Also, I have no agenda.</p>

<p>I could think up of a bunch of people that do deserve mod that I trust on this site (you definitely being one of them), but it does tip the scale in one&#39;s favour for me if that person actually wants to be a mod. That implies they would take the time to actually do the work required as a moderator, which is definitely an important part of the deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one is tough because we have all been in a situation where we have been attacked by shills, and at times we just cannot prove it.</p>

<p>I hope that this does not weave around the question, but the less moderation we have, the more free speech we have. That leaves us more susceptible to trolls, shills, etc. It is kind of a risk we take.</p>

<p>I do NOT want to turn into one of those subreddits where there are a thousand rules and everything gets removed. </p>

<p>If I seriously became a mod, Id be surprised. I feel like that it would show this sub is somewhat &#39;real&#39;...and I would do my best to protect that.</p>

<p>What you can know about me is that I have no agenda and I am not power hungry. I would do my best to be fair, balanced, and open-minded.</p>

<p>I would continue to comment and not lose that passion. I would ensure that I am still a member of the sub, not just somebody who removes comments.</p>

<p>I hope this answers your question without going around it.</p>

<p>I think the shills are just going to exist. What we can do is have fair mods who make all users feel welcome.</p>

<p>From my understanding, there is a rule where we cannot call out shills? Perhaps that can be changed into something that makes more sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably describes just about everyone who&#39;s been on this sub for the last year and expresses any kind of a nuanced opinion. For most of the &quot;actual&quot; partisan shills, I&#39;d imagine most of them only get called shills by one side. The ones I think we have to worry about more, the JTRIG/Elgin types, are the more subtle ones, who will take any positions as long as it distracts and divides. They probably get called shills on all sides. </p>

<p>But as mods we are just more visible. I remove a blatantly rule-breaking post from a Trump supporter, and I&#39;m automatically CTR/ShariaBlue. Do the same for a &quot;leftist&quot; comment, and I&#39;m on Putin&#39;s payroll. Somehow I&#39;m both a holocaust denier and an SJW Zionist shill. Go figure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before you ask, I have actually been a reditor for over 6 years, but I have had multiple accounts that I usually keep deleting (for privacy&#39;s sake). I had a four year one at one point--my longest concunrrent account, and I have been active in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for the past 6 months only. But the reason I am applying is I am situated in New Zealand and free to do some moderating during my day time hours which are, of course, your late evening hours. The reason is I think you should have people from a few different parts of the globe to keep the sub/moderating team relatively active all hours with as little stress or burden on 1-2 people. I am suitable for this role because I actually have a good sense of what is evidence, what is proof, what is useful information. In fact, in the past I&#39;ve made a few requests to the mod team to have one or two things sticked that had a lot of evidence and were useful resources for people looking into certain conspiracies. So, basically, I want to help the users beyond just cleaning up the forum: my end-game, so to speak, is to make this a great resources for people to go to to learn about conspiracies while largely being unimpeded by false info, or relatively unsubstantiated claims. I want people to be able to come here, learn a lot as easily as they can--we all know the learning curve for conspiracies is quite high, or rather the suspension of disbelief can be--because I know there is some truth out there, and I want people to get on that wavelength where we, as a society, start questioning fractional reserve lending, banking practices, spying, war, hatred, bombs, propoganda, everything that is making our society worse. I realize this was a bit of a rant, but y&#39;know you gotta see I&#39;m on board. So good luck with the modding process and if you don&#39;t pick me this time around (cause of karam/post history or something), just keep me in mind for next time: maybe I won&#39;t delete this account.</p>

<p>I can promise everyone she is one of us.  If you need proof, check her history.  She is an outstanding teacher who has to moderate some serious and difficult situations at school so being a moderator here will be a walk in the park for her.  :)  I understand there are quite a lot of differences between moderating students and a subreddit but I know she would be great for us.  :)</p>

<p>Excellent teachers like <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">/u/polkadotgirl</a> make the best out of difficult situations by being fair and understanding of all different kinds of people.  These are qualities that are desired in not just a moderator but also in a person in general.</p>

I already run the subreddit <a href="/r/magnora7">/r/magnora7</a>, and I&#39;ve been on reddit for 8 years and on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for probably about 4 years. I would be happy to help clean this place up and maybe stop the decay if possible, and the pyramid of disagreement would be my fundamental basis for deciding how to apply the rules existing rules: <a href="http://fablegod.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/disagreement-hierarchy.jpg">http://fablegod.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/disagreement-hierarchy.jpg</a></p>

<p>People who strive for the top are good for the subreddit, and people who are regularly dragging conversation toward the bottom and are arguing disingenuously are damaging this sub and should get 3 strikes before they&#39;re out. This will ensure the sub is about conversation regarding the topics, rather than derailment and anger that obfuscates the subject for people who are truly interested. This will be an accurate application of rule 5, no trolling. </p>

<p>This will be my approach if I am made a mod. I want this sub to be a place where people can talk and learn new ideas, rather than being intimidated in to silence by hyper-aggressive trolls. </p>

<p>The comments that drive me crazy are similar to:
&quot;Oh, you must be a Trump voter, ugh&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Russia is at fault for Trump winning which caused the newest Earthquakes&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only shills would think Israel has done anything wrong&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary is the reason Aliens won&#39;t ever come back&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go back to Th_Donald&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go back to HillarygotRobbed&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a FACT that Russia is the cause of all our problems&quot;
&quot;Proof? Only a Commie would ask for proof&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Syria is run by the Devil! It should be destroyed.&quot;
&quot;You think Assad is not a problem now? So you like to see babies be gassed and die?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trump will destroy us all.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t care that this is a thread about the newest pyramid found. Trump will probably sell it.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, I made up all those comments, but they are actually not far off from a lot I&#39;ve seen lately. </p>

<p>Just trying to give examples of what I hate seeing here when NONE of it is constructive.  </p>

<p>Bringing up how much you hate trump, or how he is bad when it has nothing to do with what is being talked about is crap.</p>

<p>I am not good with putting names to things, or what all the labels of bad behavior are.  So if this is what you are talking about, sorry.</p>

<p>Politic posts that have nothing to do with Conspiracies shouldn&#39;t be let through, but that&#39;s my opinion.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant lol. I guess I&#39;m posting this here under your nomination because you are the one I&#39;d nominate.</p>

<p>Again, I was just posting the above comments as crazy examples that are pretty close to a lot of recent posts lately. 
I&#39;ll stop rambling lol  </p>

<p>I believe in freedom of expression, unless someone is attacked personally. I will not ban anyone because their opinions differ from my own, which mods here haven&#39;t followed. We are all adults. Adults argue and curse and get frustrated. Being an adult shouldn&#39;t be a bannable offense. If you attack someone <em>personally</em> then I&#39;d put a temporary ban. I don&#39;t believe in banning anyone outright unless they&#39;re clearly trolling, and even then, they deserve a second chance.</p>

I will always cherish this sub, and the people who contribute here because of it.  I also arranged the James Tracey AMA, and will work hard to bring in more quality AMA guests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve reconsidered about u/d8_thc. Not that I don&#39;t trust him or think he wouldn&#39;t be a good mod, quite the contrary.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that he is one of the few people that are doing the very important job of sharing and explaining the fractal holographic unified field theory and everything related to it (relating spirituality to physics) to a wide audience here on Reddit. If he became a mod I&#39;m just afraid it would eat up so much of his time that he wouldn&#39;t be able to do the work he is doing right now.</p>

<p>So u/d8_thc please don&#39;t accept the nomination (if you win) if that would infringe on your spreading of the work of Haramein or anything related to r/holofractal :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Self nomination.</p>

<p>I periodically check this sub on the daily, my method would be casual but the quality of my moderation would be high.</p>

<p>I have been a casual moderator for 8ch&#39;s /pol/ in the past and through that I have learned that the best form of moderation is to take a step back and let the community point out the frauds (before stepping in.)</p>

<p>Freedom of speech and expression is of the highest priority. Identifying threads that are purposely spreading misinformation will be my job, and closing those threads down is what I will be here for.</p>

Double standards much? You obviously have a political leaning against trump, so it&#39;s ok for you to have political leanings but mods can&#39;t? They must be neutral on everything? I was banned over saying the /u/ redpilledfaggot says things that a normal faggot would say..... Making a joke about his user name got me banned for a day with no warning what so ever when I never had any previous problems in this sub. Just because you&#39;re gay doesn&#39;t mean you have special status over others. You have no right to control what others think or say. Getting offended by what someone else jokes about is completely your problem. You&#39;re making the choice to be angry about it. It seems like others rights to free speech end where your feelings begin. The thought police have no place in a sub of free thinkers </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t think we are an Ivy League School; but you have answered your own question in asking what you have. It is because we are adults that we should understand that most people we don&#39;t know are worthy of basic respect. This basic respect may fall under, for example, not cursing or abusing someone. I&#39;m sure if you said shit or tit, no one is going to flip their lid. I think it&#39;s the intention behind the comments that matter.</p>

<p>For what I think you were actually getting at though; I think people choosing to get offended by what you say, and what you say being truly offensive, are two different things with a very fine line separating. I think if articulated correctly, you would have received a good response for what you are asking, not my bullshit long one that will probably just leave people annoyed, haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi mods,</p>

<p>Long time commenter and member of this sub. While I don&#39;t think all conspiracies hold water, I believe in a free and open platform in which everyone is able to speak their mind, post their opinions, and have an open forum/discussion.</p>

<p>Feel free to browse my history. You&#39;ll find that while I may agree or disagree with people, I am almost always open to having a discussion/debate about it.</p>

<p>My personal philosophy is that as a mod, you must do everything you can to separate your personal ideologies from your moderating responsibilities.</p>

<p>Our credibility as a sub comes not from the content posted, but from the ability of any user to post any theory and it be discussed openly.</p>

<p>For your consideration, I nominate myself, <a href="/u/inventingnothing">/u/inventingnothing</a> to be moderator of this sub.</p>

<p>It would be an honor, and I thank you for the hard work you to do.</p>

<p>A great user who&#39;s always helpful and always gives boatloads of information, also has modding experience.</p>

<p>It was a toss up between Nutrition and <a href="/u/knightbeforetomorrow">/u/knightbeforetomorrow</a> for me. I think they are both equally deserving and both great contributors. But even though Knight is very active I&#39;m not sure if they are interested in modding, whereas Nutrition currently mods four subs. So in the end that helped me make my decision.</p>

<p>That said, I do think Knight would be a great mod and they should nominate themselves or someone else should.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to nominate myself, my account is new, I have been a conspiracy enthusiast for 16 years. Many of the subjects discussed on this sub I&#39;m familiar with.  The change I would like to see is knowing how to gather the intel that is received properly.</p>

<p>Actions may speak louder than words but I advocate  looking at a subject matter from all angles and evidence, the proof in the pudding. </p>

<p>My very love of the truth. I want to know whole heartedly what&#39;s really going on, even thought about working for the &quot;gubmint&quot; and seeing what&#39;s really true. </p>

<p>With being a Mod its a civic duty to allow everyone to express their opinions but we must provide facts and evidence that is as irrefutable as water being wet.</p>

<p>Oh that makes a lot more sense now, thanks. I must&#39;ve read it wrong.  </p>

<p>I was banned from there also the day Trump ordered the missile strike on Syria. The reason for the ban was not a Trump supporter. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll take them serious the day they allow civil debate instead of ban everyone who doesn&#39;t follow their carefully crafted narrative.

    <div class="md"><p>Greetings,</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been part of this community for the last 3 administrations. And it&#39;s become really awful the last year or two. It&#39;s gone from a bastion of intellectual skepticism and critical thinking, emotional intelligence and a place for dialogue to take place to a hot bed of warring factions who are continually seeming to be unaware that they are truly on the same side. That it isn&#39;t left or right, it&#39;s We The People VS Tyranny. So whatever you do choose someone who isn&#39;t an apologist for some side or official just because it happens to be serving their interests while painfully neglecting many others. For true wisdom, according to Socrates, is to &quot;Know That I Do NOT Know&quot;. Which is to always allow oneself to be ever teachable, and open to evolve, adapt, grow, expand and become better for being so. Ignorance is stubbornness guised as certainty. Although I would like to nominate myself, I just ask that whoever you choose be someone who is not both a regular participant in t_d or regular participant in whatever the opposite of that would be. This subreddit used to be where you&#39;d go to question authority and the official story, and be cynical about what is being passed around as truth. And not it&#39;s unfortunately turned into a place where people call each other shills for merely disagreeing with them. </p>

<p>Fear always loses. Truth always prevails.</p>

<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not adverse to giving it my all... Especially during the late night shift... I could prolly do the most moderating 10PM-4AM EST... but I am also available during the day. I browse on PC, not mobile... and hang out in the new queue most of the night. I have my own opinions on a lot of matters, but I can easily stay impartial when it comes to enforcement of the rules... if it comes to reddit-wide rules, I&#39;d prefer to err on the side of caution, because those kinds of violations are the ones that could get <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a> in some hot water. I would be into moderating, because I feel like this sub needs someone on the ball during those late night hours a lot of nights... I&#39;ve watched the modlog enough to have a general idea of what I&#39;d be dealing with. </p>

<p>All of the people, including yourself, garnering support from others as a potential mod are all more valuable, imo, as contributors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could be interested. Should I just write here or send a PM? For me the most important thing in moderation is integrity and Id like to think I have that.</p>

<p>I have been following this subreddit for a long time. I check in here almost daily as well as a couple other subreddits I follow. </p>

<p>I am from Denmark, so perhaps that is a plus. I follow a lot of subjects, but what interests me the most are conspiracies which are palpable e.g. political corruption or 9/11 where it is possible to obtain hard evidence and conduct scientific research. That being said I am also interested in things like consciousness, DMT etc., but more as a distant observer.</p>

<p>I watch many of Joe Rogans podcasts as they often are really great, as well as follow Luke Rudkowski on youtube.</p>

<p>As I am in university and have a personal life aswell, I have be able to dedicate all my free time for moderation, but I will come here very regularly, if just for 30min a day. The way I personally use this subreddit is to get newsupdate on contemporary conspiracies, as well as being a place where you can seek out things you did not know anything about. </p>

<p>As regards to previous moderating, I do not have previous experience from reddit, but I have from others social platforms like gaming forums.</p>

<p>I hope you will consider me as a mod. I love this subreddit and I would hate to see it go down the drain.</p>

<p>Regards </p>

<p>//Chilly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greetings,<br/>
I, <a href="/u/sweetholymosiah">/u/sweetholymosiah</a>, request that the mod team consider my application to join their team. As a long time redditor and politically engaged North American citizen, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to help the mods here keep discussion civil, and keep the sub open and transparent. While other big subs have succumbed to corporate pressure, and now function as an extension of the mainstream corporate media, I believe <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> must remain free of overt corporate influence. With the ongoing destruction of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> remains a precious resource for free communication about the corruption of powerful groups.<br/>
The best way to uncover the truth about this world is through open communication of free thinkers. Even if corporate donors buy upvotes and push manipulative comments to the top of every post, by engaging in critical thinking with our peers, we can undermine the forced narrative and regain our agency as online citizens.<br/>
I&#39;m online daily, and can contribute to moderation efforts regularly. While this would be my first mod position, I&#39;ve been using reddit and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for almost a decade. I believe that through mutual respect and adhering to the rules, we can keep <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> an essential resource in the fight against tyranny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve mostly moderated on gaming platforms in the past (some game-centric subreddits, moderator on the forums of the websites of internet-based games, etc.). I currently moderate a few lower-traffic subreddits. I lurk (and occasionally post on) left- and right-wing subreddits, and have no strong affiliation with either side, as they are really just two forms of the same thing: control.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve made this call, as this subreddit has seen an increase in low-effort, low-quality troll posts lately. More alarmingly, there have been noticeable attempts to discredit posts using obvious propaganda techniques. I&#39;ve seen a lot of &quot;grouping&quot; lately, where some of the more incredible conspiracies (the world is flat, CIA mind control chem-trails, etc.) are being lumped in the same group as the much more plausible conspiracies (9/11 was an inside job) and the almost-certainly-true conspiracies (the richest people sensationalize social problems to distract people from economic problems).</p>

<p>I think this is being intentionally done in order to discredit the true conspiracies and keep people from seeing the world around them as it is. I think it is the job of moderators to allow legitimate users to contribute different opinions and disallow paid workers from being able to use propaganda to distract people from real discussion, and this is something I&#39;d like to help with.</p>

<p>The page grows and so does the need for active and enthusiastic helpers.</p>

<p>We also request that anyone who is <strong>interested</strong> be of open mind and that they be individuals who can commit a some time to guard against low effort content and to uphold the values of the page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve heard several times over the years, regarding this sub in particular, that people <em>wanting</em> the responsibility are not desirable for that reason alone. The above suggests differently, for something that is completely volunteerism. That makes no sense. Not even slightly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only set criteria we are requesting is that anyone who expresses an interest in moderating r/conspiracy have at least a one year old account and +1000 positive karma.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those requirements may be suitable in less toxic zones, but not here. Those are poor qualifiers and it should be clear on just why by observing the the past 9 months of activity here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We Require More Moderators</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you require a different view on quantity vs. quality--as well as a more consistent application of oversight pertaining to the sidebar rules (also adding some). The problems are glaringly obvious to anyone who looks at it without subjectivity, mod-goggles, partisanship, etc. You need a revised direction, not a bunch more soldiers. The game has changed since mid- 2016/ the elections, and the old ways of running this place are no longer effective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Howdy,</p>

<p>I&#39;ll nominate myself <a href="/u/manny_bothans">/u/manny_bothans</a>. I&#39;m just a spy with zero prior mod experience who happens to be very much alive, contrary to popular opinion. I&#39;m fond of the occasional drive-by comment and upvote here on <a href="/r/consipracy">/r/consipracy</a> when i see good things. In all honesty I wouldn&#39;t spend a huge amount of time moderating, but the time i would spend would be fair and impartial.</p>

<p>My main wish for this joint would be to promote more stuff from the alien/paranormal/suppressed technology end of the conspiracy spectrum. More philadelphia experiment shit, less goddamn pizza. Yall motherfuckers have fallen off and gone too political. This place used to be awesome like 2014 and prior. Return some balance to the force motherfuckers. Make me a mod.</p>

I&#39;m a moderator of <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a>, which is a largely speculative science oriented subreddit, as well as other subs, all of which you may inquire about via PM or here in the comments if you have concerns as to their nature. I was one of the earlier members of the HF team, having been invited nearly a year ago now by the founder (who was promoted as a candidate elsewhere in the comments) and am active there sometimes in posting mostly math based ideas which are relevant to the ideas already found in Holofractal. One of these posts is found in the sidebar as &quot;Gematria, God, and 64,&quot; and the suggestion of the sidebar link to &quot;Entropic Gravity&quot; was also my suggestion. However, I will only try to become a moderator if it is wanted - I personally vote for <a href="/u/d8_thc">/u/d8_thc</a> as a new mod.</p>

<p>By the way. I get a bad feeling about this. Why are we adding more mods here? I feel like it is another attempt at slipping in people who would do damage to our community and movement. Remember after the last run of new mods, there was that debacle over the stickyed post that was obviously shilling against Trump and the guy was insidiously using conspiracy terminology to try and push it? I think Trump is a stooge for the NWO, but I also know that the anti Trump shills are legion here, even worse than the Russian shills that litter this place. I dont like it! This seems like further r/conspiracy manipulation!</p>

<p>Do you have any screen shots or links to back-up these claims? I didn&#39;t see the comment before it was removed but I&#39;m guessing it was an accusation of being a shill towards somebody? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read through your comment history of the last 8 or so days and it appears you&#39;re here solely to turn the community on the mods and a  select few commenters. </p>

<p>Of course that could be totally wrong so I&#39;m asking you what your motives and goals are by commenting here? You&#39;ve made some very valid points but I feel like you&#39;re only using them to take down your opponents. </p>

<p>So I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is do you care about or want to be a part of this community or is you&#39;re only goal to takedown the people you&#39;ve chosen and the mods with it?</p>
