        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s a better full write up of all the pertinent information. This took forever to put together fully:</p>

<p>TLDR: This is all the data showing how Putnam Co TN is wiretapping any computer that a child from Northeast elementary school ever logged into chrome with (and other vectors) by a browser extension it installs into the background which gives administrator control of the infected device.</p>

<p>All the resources demonstrating how Putnam Co TN is wiretapping the homes of at least all the kids in Northeast elementary school who ever logged into their email accounts on a home computer. Can see all browser use, but additionally gives itself admin permissions to the computer, the google policy by itself would have given them the use history, the extension gives them far greater control over the infected host system.</p>

<p><a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-39/chapter-13/part-6/39-13-601">http://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-39/chapter-13/part-6/39-13-601</a> - state law on wiretapping</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/mXDIf">http://imgur.com/a/mXDIf</a> - Northeast elementary school computer use policy.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/UitVu">http://imgur.com/gallery/UitVu</a> - screenshot of how the google administrator policy was used to install a required extension. Top line of policy also blocks notification window that any of the required extensions are being installed. <a href="http://cdn.imperosoftware.com/knowledgebase/edupro/manuals/rollout-guide.pdf">http://cdn.imperosoftware.com/knowledgebase/edupro/manuals/rollout-guide.pdf</a> - manual page 22 of the required extension shows proof of wiretapping of all computers with Imperio extension installed, which is automatically installed on home computers if a child logs in. Says clearly captures all browser use, also allows administrator control of computer.</p>

<p>&quot;6 Browser Extensions The Impero web browser extensions enable you to filter and log Internet activity from Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Opera browsers.&quot; - in some instances it&#39;s doing more than that, it gives administrator permissions depending on browser used to log in some give more or less permissions. Also makes a difference which operating system. Windows based systems give FAR more control to the extension, the others appear to possibly be sandboxed to their own user account in Mac or Linux.</p>

<p>It also gives crazy access to things like your power subsystem and ability to automatically turn on your computer if wake on lan is enabled: &quot;The Power Management tool allows you to save money by powering off computers in different rooms across your organisation on a schedule, or even automatically power off computers that have been idle for a specified amount of time. &quot;</p>

<p>Patch management: it can install software: &quot;The Impero &#39;Patch Management&#39; system ensures that computers across your network are all up-to-date and running the latest patches. It scans remote computers to identify which patches are missing, and will then download and apply the patches as per a predefined schedule. Providing your computers support Wake-On-LAN, Impero Patch Management can wake up computers, apply patches and then power off the computers during the night or any other convenient times.&quot;</p>

<p>So by installing Imperio, and then using patch management, you can install anything you want into the host system. This is by name a viral attack vector known as a rootkit. &quot;root·kit ˈro͞otˌkit/ nounCOMPUTING a set of software tools that enable an unauthorized user to gain control of a computer system without being detected.&quot;</p>

<p>TN Annotated 39-14-602 &quot;(b) Whoever intentionally and without authorization, directly or indirectly: (1) Accesses any computer, computer system, or computer network commits a Class C misdemeanor. &quot; &quot;( 5) Makes or causes to be made an unauthorized copy, in any form, including, but not limited to, any printed or electronic form of computer data, computer programs, or computer software residing in, communicated by, or produced by a computer or computer network commits an offense punishable as provided in § 39-14-105.&quot;</p>

<p>They&#39;re doing that right now to anyone at home. Funny part is they have it linked in their own document 4406 below as legal reference. <a href="http://images.pcmac.org/Uploads/TennesseeSBA/TennesseeSBA/Departments/DocumentsCategories/Documents/4406_87.pdf">http://images.pcmac.org/Uploads/TennesseeSBA/TennesseeSBA/Departments/DocumentsCategories/Documents/4406_87.pdf</a> - Putnam Co School board policy document. Never states that home PC monitoring will take place. Says you can totally opt out the computer policy by contacting the director of schools. Northeast told me that was impossible yesterday as well.</p>

<p>You can see clearly in state law, it&#39;s illegal to bug home computers, the school use policy does not state it is going to happen at any point and parents are not notified, nor do they sign permission to allow software installation on their home computers via the chrome administrator account permissions, which turn off all notifications it is being installed, and allow it to control your microphone, camera, power settings and more. All that info is in the impero manual above.</p>

<p>In theory it would also allow them to do the same to every educator, but they force them to sign a document authorizing it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to attempt to talk to the superintendent of schools about this, doesn&#39;t appear legal. Waiting on a response from him now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would add the EFF to that list, the ACLU, and possibly the FSF (free software foundation). All of them would take a massive interest in this, even <em>if</em> it is somehow justified to be legal.</p>

<p>The intent of this crap is clear. It would be bad enough in virtually any situation, but that is related to a school is just completely foul. Kids are totally helpless against sophisticated adult exploitation- they need adults to protect them from these threats, to educate them of these threats, and they need a voice that says this shit is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except OP doesn&#39;t actually understand what&#39;s going on and went full conspiritard. Chrome ADMX/ADML templates are used to manage it in the school (or business) setting and are applied by AD Group Policy to domain computers. </p>

<p>IE policies don&#39;t apply to Chrome, Firefox, or Safari so you need the other templates in place. </p>

<p>If his screen shot is from a home computer, my actual guess is the kid signed into Chrome at school <em>and</em> at home with their school account. Chrome can roam your installed extensions from one PC to another, just like bookmarks. The school isn&#39;t pushing a plugin on a home PC and they certainly are not getting privilege escalation on a home PC through a Chrome extension. </p>

<p>Just have the kid sign out of their school account in Chrome and poof, the extensions are gone. If it&#39;s a school provided PC I&#39;m not sure why OP is even concerned. They very liked agreed to monitoring of activity when they accepted the PC. For all we know it could auto connect to the school&#39;s VPN so the traffic is going over their web filters anyway. </p>

<p>I&#39;d need to dig into his other claims and see what each of the extensions does but OP is going straight to the deep end without reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are so far off it&#39;s funny. Stick to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and out of technology subreddits. </p>

<p>I do design and implementation of what I&#39;ve described for a living. Many, many school systems provide students with computers and have for a while. </p>

<p>You also clearly don&#39;t have a grasp of how these systems work and calling my suggestion &quot;idiotic&quot; proves that point. I seriously, 100% promise you that you have no understanding of what you&#39;re talking about and clearly do not understand the content in my post. </p>

<p>If a user logs into PC1 and signs into the Google Chrome browser this will automatically download their associated plugins, bookmarks, etc. This is called &quot;roaming&quot;. It&#39;s been done for years. On systems in a domain a school may implement Microsoft Roaming Profiles or any one of the other technologies to roam settings and such (RES Software, AppSense, etc). This is separate from Google&#39;s account.</p>

<p>Layered on top of those basic items would be Active Directory Group Policy Objects (GPOs) which is where security, lockdowns, auto-config, printers, drive mappings, etc can be managed. Google Chrome has ADMX/ADML templates enabling administrators to manage the browser. That includes extensions, settings, etc.</p>

<p>When a user logs off of PC1 and onto PC2, the settings in their profile are saved to a central store/share and then copied to PC2 during the logon process. Again, separate from that you have the GPOs and Google Chrome stuff. </p>

<p>If the student logs into the web browser (probably should be blocked and managed with the roaming profiles actually) and then goes home and signs into the browser as well Google, <strong>not the school</strong> could download and install settings because that&#39;s why you sign into the browser. It roams the settings. It has absolutely nothing to do with the school or their system/settings at all.</p>

<p>Seriously, it&#39;s obvious you do not know what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>It still does enough to piss me off, and others I&#39;m sure. No one should be taking active screenshots of my browsing, let alone a school IT department. Reviews are populated with students clearly stupid enough to log into chrome browser with their school provided google powered email account, thus OP has some valid beef. If the school system has an Impero server hosted with external access, there&#39;s no reason this extension wouldn&#39;t work in the wild just the same as it would on their owned devices on their internal network.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi OP.  How is the impero software getting onto the student home computers?  I have read your post a few times and I must be missing something, are students forced to download something to access school work which includes the impero tracking? </p>

<p>I am Head of Computer Science at a high school in the UK and we use Impero a lot in the classroom, not just for managing access but for distributing and receiving work. I have always found it an impressive and handy classroom tool.  We do not use it at home.</p>

<p>I can tell you from the admin side impero stores a huge amount of data on its users, screenshots, video, browser history, program usage and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It technically does, but not specifically for the impero chrome extension. Since the account is a Google Suite Education account, managed by the school, the school set a policy to automatically install the extension as shown by the screenshot. However, when you use a G Suite account and log onto chrome on a new device, it will warn you about linking chrome data to the managed account and in the dialog box will states that you are giving the administrator control over your Google Chrome Profile, including the apps installed in the browser, browser history, bookmarks, etc. You then have to click &quot;Link Data&quot; to logon to chrome with the school email account.

<p>Not without the client software being installed first it doesn&#39;t.  This sort of system is intended for use on school-owned computers (which should be covered by a privacy policy spelling out what privacy can be expected) where the network administrator has the ability to deploy software to the fleet over the LAN.  See the rollout guide in the manual you posted if you want specific details of how the client is rolled out.  Unless your home computer is owned by the school, then there is simply no way they can deploy the client to it.</p>

<p>No client software, no control.  This does NOT affect home computer use by simply &#39;logging into email&#39; but would only affect computers owned by the school that have the client pre-installed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should look at the extension itself in the chrome store. It explicitly claims it will filter web traffic, can screenshot the browsers active tabs and so on. Not at at the OS level, but browser level. That&#39;s still not ok. Of course sign in is unnecessary, but again, look at the chrome store entry for the browser extension. Most comments in the review portion are by people who think logging in with their school credentials IS necessary and they whine about the effects of such. You and I may understand the difference between a browser and OS, but these end users clearly do not, and it&#39;s likely students who use these credentials to log in at home won&#39;t either. The school, if aware of the setup of their school provided google accounts consists of what OP is claiming even if only within chrome browser itself, absolutely should alert parents and students to these risks. </p>

<p>If my school could screenshot my active tabs at home cause I was too stupid not to log in at home and subsequently have chrome download and transfer extensions and their settings, I&#39;d have a large problem with that, even if it was my own ignorance as the root of the problem. </p>

<p>I was just alarmed by this when I saw it because it looked suspicious and I didn&#39;t know why it was there. I saw suspicious because they got unlucky. It&#39;s unusual in Linux for something like Netflix to work one day, then stop the next when you didn&#39;t update and no one else has sudo permission, and they blocked Netflix, and my kid was asking me why I blocked it because she assumed I did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK I want to clear some possible misconceptions up.  When your daughter logs into chrome browser it creates a profile within that chrome browser for her.  It then applies whatever policies are in place for the school.  I assume they use Chromebooks.  So they use this policy to install apps to content filter and have classroom management.  Whatever is installed will only affect her profile in chrome (you can switch its the box in the upper right corner with your daughters name in the picture you posted).  You are technically using a school resource when she is signed into her google account.  If you don&#39;t like it then don&#39;t have her sign into the chrome browser.  She can still go to gmail and drive without signing into the browser.</p>

<p>My personal windows desktops in 2 cases, a linux laptop in the other.</p>

<p>The children were given instruction by the school to log in in that manner when they log in at all times by a teacher, so while I do understand that there are other login methods, this is exactly what they were taught to do.</p>

<p>If the school did it completely on accident, it doesn&#39;t make it legal, it only changes the severity from Mis C to Felony D based on malice, it doesn&#39;t provide a loophole where the accidental passive wiretapping of my home becomes &quot;this intrusion is fine&quot; in the law posted above.</p>

<p>It says specifically that the act of doing it passively or installing software at all is a Mis C crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I almost hesitate to chime in on this, but I am an IT Guy at a high school. We have software on all of our on <strong>campus computers</strong> that allow us to take control, install stuff remotely, deploy GPO, wake on LAN, etc. These are all very common things when you have a whole network of computers to maintain. Imagine walking around campus turning on/off every computer and installing updates or configuring settings manually 1 by 1 by 1... So, inherently the ability to do these things isn&#39;t malicious. </p>

<p>All of our students bring their own devices and we do not install anything on their personal devices, but there are school computers in the library, classroom, cafeteria, computer labs, etc. I&#39;m not familiar with this particular extension, but the only thing I can imagine is they have this set as a user policy through Google Admin to set these permissions on any computer that user signs into with the intention of them using a library computer, a classroom computer, a computer lab computer, etc. I <strong>hope</strong> that&#39;s the case and they didn&#39;t realize it would also apply to their home systems.

He also has admin knowledge of linux systems from tn tech from school, and when asked point blank the people who knew him to the question &quot;do you think there is any chance he&#39;d try to watch K-4 graders on their webcams for fun for himself&quot; the answer was &quot;yes.&quot; </p>

<p>Sorta sick to my stomach I gave him a warning and didn&#39;t contact the FBI first thing now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just get off your high horse. A child was arrested the other day for LIKING the picture of a gun on FB. He used his home computer in his room to do this. Yet someone, somewhere from his school grassed him up.
Their argument was that it is against school regulations to be involved in any activity as described.
Now, most people have wondered how a school would know, considering this boy was alone and on FB.</p>

<p>You laugh at things that have already come true. Schools can and have used their powers to infiltrate private computers against pupils, and it can only be because of their planting of these programs.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t care that some people don&#39;t read the small print. How and why would they, if the school says that they are required to agree. You could read the small print and still have to consent if you want your kid to go to that school. 
OP even tried to opt out as suggested and wasn&#39;t allowed, despite it being apparently an option on the contract!</p>

<p>You probably think that because you &#39;know&#39; a bit about IT, that you are the most switched on person but privacy is a right in a free country.
OP has no privacy, other parents who let their child use their home computer to be used for school work also have no more privacy.
All of their searches can be monitored and used against them. That&#39;s beyond utopian and it is wrong.
Just like civil forfeiture is also wrong, despite it having been lawful, it is now being changed.
Thanks to people complaining and doing something about it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think OP would be laughed out of a lawyers office if the program was misused/ abused/ used for illegal privacy breaches. 
I am just glad that there are still enough &#39;old school&#39; people left that will expose unfair techniques and we are not all wet blankets that think authorities could never do wrong.</p>

<p>Grow up man and see it for what it is.</p>

I don&#39;t think the impero software/extension was ever intended to be implemented this way and is designed to be only installed on school owned computers. But since the school seems to be using Google&#39;s G Suite platform to push these settings, I think you may even be able to file a complaint to Google for the school&#39;s abuse of the G Suite platform to illegally spy on non-school devices without permission in addition to talking to the school and consulting a lawyer. </p>

<p>wake on lan is a setting in the bios that can be turned on or off, and requires it to be physically connected to a supported switch.  odds are your home network is not supported, unless you have it in a DMZ, and they are using intel amt.  which they aren&#39;t, cause no one is.</p>

<p>someone already told you what happened.  someone is signing into chrome with a student account, thus it&#39;s loading the extensions.</p>

<p>you can simply block them from installing.  even have chrome blacklist the extension ids if it&#39;s on a home machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of the comments. It is illegal to take control of any computer that is not the the school districts property. It is also illegal to have that restriction set on someone&#39;s account then when they log into their own, it restricts their computer. They do not have the right nor authority to have that control over your personal computers. I&#39;d take this to the superintendent and have a discussion about this, if I were you.

    <div class="md"><p>The actual true test of what&#39;s happening or not would have been if you did a netstat, WireShark, or equivalent with a before/after of your child logging into Chrome. You could then check the public IP&#39;s that the computer is connecting to to see where traffic is being directed to. If there&#39;s an IP owned by the city/county or something to that effect then you&#39;d know <em>something</em> was calling home to them.</p>

<p>In reality though, you&#39;ve just got Google doing a profile sync from the school system that has mandated policies by AD GPO which is enforcing plugins to be installed. They should have disabled browser sync with those same policies to prevent what you&#39;re seeing. When the student logs into Chrome elsewhere it&#39;s syncing those settings that were mandated in the school. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no privilege escalation, there&#39;s no inventorying of your hard disk, etc. If I had to wager the company has a default set of things blocked (netflix) separate from the school. </p>

<p>Just have your kid&#39;s account signed out of Google Chrome for sync and you&#39;re on your merry way. If anything you should recommend they implement the &#39;disable sync&#39; policy with Chrome. I linked to the specific setting in another post if you go through my history.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t care about your home browsing habits.</p>

<p>School IT administration typically is not the highest paid and it doesn&#39;t surprise me they would have overlooked the sync setting. That and AD GPO can be incredibly difficult to grasp, I&#39;ve seen people with years of IT not understand basic GPO policies and how they impact one another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha, part of it is going to be school IT salary doesn&#39;t attract the most qualified candidates so you can get sloppy policies. I got suspended my senior year for figuring out how to bypass some of the security on the machines in all the labs - didn&#39;t go over too well with the county. </p>

<p>My <em>guess</em> would be teachers or the IT guys had them set it up that way &quot;because it works&quot; rather than how it should work. That one setting I linked to and keep mentioning (disabling sync) should have been applied. I would absolutely go to them and print off that article and recommend they do it. Group Policy is a tough concept to master and as a result you really do get a lot of dumb luck (trial &amp; error) and then they leave it in place. Definitely not best practice and definitely not production ready stuff. </p>

<p>Software did get installed on your personal machine but it&#39;s the result of Google and not the school. The recommendation for WireShark and Netstat would be to determine if the plugin is actually phoning home for policy versus just a default layout. </p>

<p>I specialize in a product called Citrix (<a href="/r/Citrix">/r/Citrix</a>) which is remote apps/desktops and deal a lot with education (mostly upper education) as well as healthcare, insurance, financial, lawfirms, etc. I&#39;ve seen a lot of sneaky things that kids (and even adults!) do to circumvent security so we try to lock down stuff as best as we can. </p>

<p>Part of that is implementing the Google Chrome templates. Google and Firefox both can install into the user&#39;s personal directory (C:\Users\%username%\AppData) which doesn&#39;t require admin rights and is an absolute pain to prevent. There&#39;s a few other pieces of software that do the same - DropBox, Spotify, etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, to be 100% clear. </p>

<p>Active Directory Group Policy mandating the installation of <em>any</em> software or <em>any</em> policies can only occur on domain-joined machines.</p>

<p>That means, if the school is mandating the home page, internet settings, extensions, plugins, security settings, etc those settings <strong>can only apply to computers on the school&#39;s domain</strong>. There&#39;s is absolutely no way possible for the school&#39;s AD GPO settings to apply to your personal computer. It&#39;s technically impossible. </p>

<p>That said, and to reiterate what I said earlier, Google Chrome and its account are separate from the school&#39;s policies. </p>

<p>If the school allows the students to create a Google account with their school email <strong>and</strong> they&#39;re permitted to sign into Chrome <strong>and</strong> the administrators have not disabled Google&#39;s sync <strong>then</strong> if the students signed into another computer (personal, work, school, etc) Google would install whatever associated plugins you had and sync your bookmarks. </p>

<p>That does not bypass any security restrictions on the computer. Hopefully you&#39;ve given your child a &#39;standard&#39; user account rather than an adminsitrator but even then you <em>should</em> have User Account Control enabled which would prohibit anything without user intervention.</p>

<p>Google Chrome plugins do <strong>not</strong> require any escalation of privilege to install. They&#39;re installed on a per-user basis in the user&#39;s C:\Users\%username%\AppData folder (I think it&#39;s in the Roaming subfolder). </p>

<p>Now, the plugin you&#39;re specifically concerned with may have a default set of settings (Incognito, etc) that it installs with. If you log your child out of Google Chrome those plugins, bookmarks, etc should all go away automatically. </p>

<p>The school should disable synchronization to prevent this from happening but it&#39;s not some hidden agenda. Everything you&#39;re seeing can be explained from a technical point of view and makes sense.</p>

<p>Your child consented to synchronizing settings when they logged into Chrome - that would include those plugins and settings. There&#39;s no crime committed here. </p>

<p>I did look up the minimum age for a Google account is 13, how old is your child?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you can disable the synchronization in Google Chrome for extensions and keep their bookmarks and passwords.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/03BhJoE.png">Chrome Sync Settings</a></p>

<p>Pretty granular in what you can keep/ignore. On the home computer until they modify the disable sync I&#39;d just disable the browser extensions from syncing. </p>

<p>Regarding their ages, it&#39;s possible the school is associated with Google for email, I know my college was, but I&#39;d also double check your children didn&#39;t create an account on their own with a school provided email - which is something you can do. </p>

<p>If the school gave them a Google account <a href="https://edu.google.com/">see here</a> I&#39;m sure there&#39;s different policies on the ages and such.</p>

<p>I just want them to know I see it, and I think it&#39;s potentially not legal and could you stop, and I contacted them myself threatening to out my privacy or doxx me or whatever isn&#39;t something I give a shit about. I saw it looked suspicious and reported it to them.</p>

<p>For someone who is so concerned with privacy you sure did post a lot of identifying info.</p>

<p>Your about as bright as a broken bulb.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to give out your information freely at your own will. It&#39;s another for a 3rd party group to secretly steal said information.</p>

<p>How you can&#39;t understand that is absurd and I&#39;m embarrassed for your lack of mentality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quick update, spoke to sec of schools via email he offered to meet 7 days ago but wanted to record video and bring an &quot;independent&quot; expert from his old work, TN tech where I guess he didn&#39;t know I knew he worked.</p>

<p>Told him sure, but I&#39;d like to record video.  No response.</p>

<p>Emailed him again after 7 days asking for when he&#39;d like to record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What it&#39;s doing is running an extension in chrome that gives them that backdoor, then they have ability to patch literally anything in windows, linux/mac looks like not so much.</p>

<p>They can turn the cameras/mics on too possibly. Some probability this is confirmation bias, but some kids are now saying to my kids they saw their webcams turning on randomly. One of those I can verify 3 girls saw a webcam kick on while using a mac, but the light turned on, and they covered it with a bandaid, that one my kid told me, she&#39;s an awful liar I&#39;m 99% sure she&#39;s not making it up.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t verify the cause, hearsay as fuck, all 3 unreliable 10 year old witnesses sounds like the damn salem witch hunt, still makes me uncomfortable.</p>
