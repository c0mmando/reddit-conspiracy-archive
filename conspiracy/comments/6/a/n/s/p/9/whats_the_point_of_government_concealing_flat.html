       Recently there has been a lot of buzz surrounding the "flat earth" theory. I've found it to be more on the far-fetched end of the conspiracy spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fundamental question is, if hypothetically the earth was in fact flat, what benefit do governments/institutions ascertain by leading us to believe the earth is spherical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why bother wasting billions "faking" space footage etc, showing the spherical nature of the earth, and teaching it as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks in advance for the responses.

       Why couldn't they get the same funding if the earth was flat, and they showed it as being flat... They'd still get money to explore space etc. and still get funding to teach it...

       They mostly seem to push it being as a control device than a money making one.

       Even though I can kind of see why, it just seems way too hard to pull off.

       There is a long end game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppose you're the upper echelon of not only the government, but the wealthy. You find out, due to some circumstance that our reality is not what we expect, not what anyone expected, but in fact a simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now why fake space? why fake a ball earth? why any of it? If you found out you couldn't break out of the simulation, by military means, finding out how it was created how it works and everything else you could, including making one yourself would be the next goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are indeed living in a simulation then a few things are very real possibilities, not only did something/one make the sim, but we may not even be in the original sim but a simulation created by another simulation which leads in to which is the real, which is the start, if it's even traceable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if they wanted to create their own simulation, or matrix if you wish, how would they get people to join? Some for sure will join willingly, but others will not, so how? Create a 'cataclysmic' event in the future, tell humanity that the only hope is to flee via space ships/being cryo frozen on board to make the journey to the 'new planet' and wham, uploaded to whatever simulation they've created, trapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       and that's just one possible reason lol

       Good post/reason and I'd like to add to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like u/Glassclose said, I think once we figured it out, we'd reverse engineer it and break the fuck out of here or figure out who runs the sim and massacre them via a global uprising. If we don't find out, then those who run it continue toget fat ff our taxes and energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bigger thing is this: Systems of Vedic knowledge and Buddhism have literally already figured out whats going on and how we live in a sim and how to break the fuck out, but it takes some work to do so via mediation, yoga, realizing that you are consciousness and freeing yourself from the body to start exploring the rest of whats out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth to me is a waste of time because I don't believe it at all. At the same time, if people want to explore it, then go for it.

       Can you explain a little more how this relates to the FE theory. I've always found the simulation theory interesting but my perception was that the whole universe was the simulation and we were just a product of it

       I'm glad you asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       My ideas are, just that, ideas. However I would like to express that there is a basis of reality this stems from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mankind has a few options, Elon musk, and many many others have talked about these so if you want to know more look it up.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mankind never develops simulations
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mankind develops simulations but sometime in the future gives them up for other technology.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mankind develops simulations, however something happens in humanity's future that stops all technological progress.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mankind develops simulations that over time become so real, so immersive that not only are we able to create simulations of fantasy worlds, but a simulation replica of our own world and eventually solar system, and deep space.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Now here is the crux, we know it's not 1. as mankind currently spends an incalculable number of manhours playing simulations daily, known as video games. 2. is not likely either as we see even today how young to old, most people play some sort of electronic game which itself simulates 'something'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the fun begins, 3 and 4 are very real possibility, 3 is such a real probability that 4 will realize this, and being able to replicate earth, and everything and everyone, even being able to 'fast forward' and 'rewind' through time, which will lead to a fail safe, an emergency contingency plan, that if all else fails and 3 is to happen, 4 will be able to 'save' humanity in such a way to keep it living, till perhaps another civilization far more advanced than ours could find the simulation, and essentially if they wanted, make clones with the info saved on the simulation of humanity, thus restoring us to 'life'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know, trippy.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could be that beacon simulation, waiting for something more advanced to bring us back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now how does FE play into this? Essentially being made of energy at our very core, we could be powering the simulation as well as helping to keep it in a state of matter that we perceive as the physical world.  Perception is incredibly powerful, show a video to two people and each will have a completely different reality of the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.. is our reality fixed? is it a matter of perception, something that can be change and something that the collective humanity controls but we're asleep at the wheel? If it can be changed than that old saying "it's always been this way it will always be this way" can, and would be changed incredibly fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity lives this way because we're told and reinforced every day that this is the ONLY way to live, but maybe it's not.

       4 is my favorite. I've been reading this book where they talk to andrei linde, a theoretical physicist, and I think he says once the simulations are realistic enough it questions the very existence of reality, because the simulation is also real. Super trippy stuff to think about and I think consciousness holds more pieces to the puzzle but unfortunately that's not what society is focused on

        Now how does FE play into this? Essentially being made of energy at our very core, we could be powering the simulation as well as helping to keep it in a state of matter that we perceive as the physical world.

       again a few reasons and whys.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        FE, simulation theory share one major common theme, and that's that humanity's perception of reality is just that, a perception.
       </li>
       <li>
        Hiding FE could easily and quickly be explained by wanting to hide 'God' or a creator(s), not only as there is mention of it(firmament,FE) in religion but also as we live in a 'goldilocks' reality where EVERYTHING is just right, or else nothing would exist like we perceive it.
       </li>
       <li>
        Past the creator/God aspect, if we didn't live on a globe, and instead lived on something more resembling a flat plane, we really wouldn't know how far we could go, especially since, world exploring is done, so if 'humanity' was split up into different areas of this plane(think how the towns in The Giver were set up) we could be 1000 miles in the right direction from another existence of humanity.
       </li>
       <li>
        possibly one very important aspect of why globe earth, they've made so much money out of the deal, it's insane.
       </li>
       <li>
        If we lived in a closed system, and cannot go 'out' into this 'infinite space filled with universe's past comprehension all filled with galaxies past counting' then what? what hope does humanity have? we would have to face ourselves and actually fix our problems instead of holding out for a fairy tale of 'starting new' on 'fresh new planets', basically, humanity wouldn't have to do anything cause the establishment will save them!
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I personally could go on for quite some time with many more reasons why the richest and most powerful would want to hide the true nature of reality from the rest of mankind, but I won't.

       That's not a reason to hide the fact we live on a flat plane. All you done is kicked the can down the street. Instead of "why hide flat earth", the question now becomes "why hide the existence of other humans?"

       But this "closed" system would have been "created" right? Our hope would lie in the "creator", would it not? So this reason is is just the real reason in disguise - "our only hope is God".

       Can you imagine if the 50,000,000 a day wasnt going to space programs and instead propping up thr economy or paying for war?
      </p>
      <p>
       There would be a vested interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of FE (of which I am not a proponent) it would make sense as a system of control. If you kept an animal inside a nature reserve its likely to go about its life as normal. If it knows there is a prey the other side if a fence, how long until it jumps? Then who controls the animal?

       I don't think that explains it though. Start with the money idea. Would there not be equal incentive for exploration if the earth was a different shape? Would wars be any less prevalent?
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for control, that doesn't really explain it either. Regardless of what shape the earth is, we can't leave so there would be no reason to lie about it to keep us here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is something that's missing from a lot of FE arguments (and not to get preachy but a lot of arguments about conspiracies); nobody ever thinks about motive. Yes, there have been all kinds of organizations that mess with things in the shadows and lie about it, but they all have some reason to do so, and a lot of conspiracy theories never explain this. They're as bad as Marvel villains when it comes to having a satisfactory motive.

       I dont disagree. We have no clue as to who is really in charge and what their motive might be. Its all speculation at this point. But what we can go on is what we experience each day and that I feel is negative and therefore some body or some people are gaining at the general populations loss. That suggests there IS some motive or other.

       The fact is, they have thought about it, they just don't want to admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fundamental, underlying reason why they believe the earth is flat is because "God said so in the bible", and the reason it is kept hidden is "because Satan is trying to distance us from god".
      </p>
      <p>
       They know religious bullshit is rejected by rational people today, so like the other "intelligent design" arguments, they try to hide the religious basis of the belief.

       One interesting topic on the whole flat earth mish mash of confusion and stupidity I haven't seen anyone touch on, which would more likely find itself in a conversation about matrix/simulation/universal technology we are experiencing, is the human eye itself. our tiny little eyes, spheres in their own right - determine much of what we perceive reality to be. Yes the other 5 senses shape much of our view on reality since birth, and many experience only these 5 senses - never look in/beyond the 'physical' realm when shaping their view on whats going on... forgive my lack of clarity on this, but if the eye, like a camera sensor is picking up on light vibrations, sending this information to the brain and flipping &amp; mirroring it back to us so we can find our footing and equilibrium and make sense of the world around us, think for a second all of the external information that is being ignored by our brains in order to avoid an overload of information, unlike say a savant who is being bombarded with sensory overload to the most minute detail. If we could truly grasp the nature of the universe Im pretty sure we'd implode, so most likely there is some type of fail safe built in disabling everyone from accessing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are interesting scenes in interstellar, inception, and most recently doctor strange where reality is being bent and distorted from the 4th dimension by those who have learned to use it and I think those scenes do a good job of painting the picture of what reality could truly be. Im guessing the average flat earther has rarely thought beyond 3 dimensions and likely bases all their ideas in 3d/5 senses/trusting only the two eyes on the outside of their head. Id like to see some of them take a healthy dose of pysli or enter into a dmt viewing of sorts... come back with a mind less boxed in. Whatever this place is its not flat, but its held together with a unique rhythm and sound and it feels quite real, so props to the designer.

       The creator is here. It's everything alive here on earth. That's the secret. It's all around and you didn't know it. You don't worship it but you can connect to it. I mean it can feel you and you can feel it.

        Hiding FE could easily and quickly be explained by wanting to hide 'God' or a creator(s), not only as there is mention of it(firmament,FE) in religion but also as we live in a 'goldilocks' reality where EVERYTHING is just right, or else nothing would exist like we perceive it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And there it is... the only real reason someone would want to hide the "flat earth" is "because God".
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        so if 'humanity' was split up into different areas of this plane(think how the towns in The Giver were set up) we could be 1000 miles in the right direction from another existence of humanity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's not a reason to hide the fact we live on a flat plane. All you done is kicked the can down the street. Instead of "why hide flat earth", the question now becomes "why hide the existence of other humans?"
      </p>

        possibly one very important aspect of why globe earth, they've made so much money out of the deal, it's insane.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bullshit. They could make the same money exploring the flat earth... or the firmament... or whatever. That's not a reason to hide the flat earth.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If we lived in a closed system, and cannot go 'out' into this 'infinite space filled with universe's past comprehension all filled with galaxies past counting' then what? what hope does humanity have?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But this "closed" system would have been "created" right? Our hope would lie in the "creator", would it not? So this reason is is just the real reason in disguise - "our only hope is God".
