      <p>
       Ok let's use some logic here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary loses election unexpectedly after most people who voted for her did it because "she deserves it" and "it's her turn". Next, rumors are peddled that Russia had something to do with the election. MSM outlets (who were known to be pushing an agenda against trump in order to get Hillary elected at all costs) peddle the anti Russia narrative, relying on sourcing intelligence agencies the entire time. Intelligence agencies come out with a 15 page report after months of "investigation" where half of it was bashing RT, a legitimate news network with the right to push its own agenda, which is often sourced and truthful information (Abby Martin's 'Breaking the set') and the rest of the report lacked any real credible facts that could link Russia to any real interference in the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we have are former Obama White House officials illegally unmasking American citizens on trump's campaign discussing things (that weren't even made public) with the Russian ambassador. An unsourced and liked fake 'dossier' came out that obviously had the purpose of humiliating trump, with absolutely no facts to back up any of the claims. How do I know it was bullshit? Because if it wasn't, the MSM would have taken the opportunity to get trump out and expose him
       <em>
        as much as possible
       </em>
       . This is the best they could do. And it wasn't enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognize when you're being manipulated into believing a fake story. Libya. Syria. 9/11. All fake. They didn't have the time to plan out this Russia bullshit, so this one is particularly sloppy.

       Pictures were popularized last summer of Michael Flynn at a RT dinner sitting next to Putin and sharing a table with Jill Stein. He was paid 30K to give a speech there as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort has a long history of some shady shit. He was working for Victor Yanukovych for 8 years secretly to improve his image in the West and win election in Ukraine. Yanukovych is Putin's friend and has financial ties to the other oligarchs who run Russia as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was thought that Manafort only earned about 80k in a 6 month period working for them in 2008.
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html?_r=0">
        But 12 million n payments was earmarked for Manafort's firm in a uncovered ledger..

       Interesting. There is certainly some things not right, but it's hardly comparable to the millions exchanged through the Clinton cabal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's time that we as a collective people set aside our differences and get the TRUTH public. Because while this doesn't look like it's on the same scale of corruption as the Clinton cabal, it is still likely some business that the normal people would not be okay with. We need to create a new system of "government" that actually serves and protects the people without infringing on their rights. We need to start over.

       I almost can't believe how you can let the obvious archetype of a corrupt businessman dictate your reality to you.  You want massive expansion of executive power influenced by the religious right, big oil, and the military industrial complex?  That is what his administration is vying for.  I didn't want the Clintons anywhere near the presidency, but Trump was always worst case scenario.

       She stole the election from Bernie, plain and simple. I don't care about where the emails may have come from, as long as the truth came out.

       But the point is, its
       <em>

       to prove that Russia hacked it. Because anyone can simply cover their tracks with any other nation's hacking tools to make it look like it was any other nation. No proof + no ability to obtain proof + constant MSM peddling = distraction propaganda

        Reference Number: JAR-16-20296A December 29, 2016 GRIZZLY STEPPE – Russian Malicious Cyber Activity
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary
This Joint Analysis Report (JAR) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
        <strong>
         This document provides technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence Services (RIS) to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the U.S. election, as well as a range of U.S. Government, political, and private sector entities.
        </strong>
        The U.S. Government is referring to this malicious cyber activity by RIS as GRIZZLY STEPPE.
Previous JARs have not attributed malicious cyber activity to specific countries or threat actors.
        <strong>
         However, public attribution of these activities to RIS is supported by technical indicators from the U.S. Intelligence Community, DHS, FBI, the private sector, and other entities.
        </strong>
        This determination expands upon the Joint Statement released October 7, 2016, from the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security.
This activity by RIS is part of an ongoing campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the U.S. government and its citizens. These cyber operations have included spearphishing campaigns targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure entities, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations leading to the theft of information. In foreign countries, RIS actors conducted damaging and/or disruptive cyber-attacks, including attacks on critical infrastructure networks.
        <strong>
         In some cases, RIS actors masqueraded as third parties, hiding behind false online personas designed to cause the victim to misattribute the source of the attack.
        </strong>
        This JAR provides technical indicators related to many of these operations, recommended mitigations, suggested actions to take in response to the indicators provided, and information on how to report such incidents to the U.S. Government.

       I heard Trump say yesterday on NBC in an interview on Comey's firing that Comey had informed Trump on three separate occasions that he is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       under investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying everything Trump says is true, but Comey is also a known liar. It's a bunch of smoke, and no one can be sure who is telling the truth, so I like to go with the facts, which is what I outlined previously.

       been

       He stopped the TPP, that's still something I can maintain that I'm happy with that I think we can all have confidence that Hillary wouldn't have done.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he's making obamacare go away. And hopefully he will get the new tax stuff going too, so I don't have to give as much money to the system. I don't care what he does to the rich, the rich live in a completely different world where they control the scarcity, so Idk what will happen, and I don't want to debate this stuff with you, but
       <em>
        personally
       </em>
       I'm happy with these things. I'm not happy with everything, by any means, if I had it my way, they'd all be out of office, intel agencies shut down, and secrets made public. But we all know that won't happen until we, the people take matters into our own hands and overthrow the system with FACTS.

       If the FBI was actively investigating such a claim, I might consider it a possibility that Trump sheds his skin and takes vacations to the center of the earth or wherever the fuck the lizardkin supposedly live.

      <p>
       I don't think it's such an absurd notion that Trump used Russian money or is connected to Russia in less than legal avenues AND Democrats are blowing this up as chink in the armor, using the entire thing as a scape goat for their miserable candidate.

       Maybe. I think the caveat is more likely about manufacturing sour relations with Russia than with covering Clinton's sorry ass, but yeah..  I do smile when I imagine the hangover we'd all have if this sub found out both sides were right.

       All we know for fact is Micheal flynn was a foreign agent for Turkey before the election and as NSA director. Even if all the rest is bs the fact he was able to infiltrate the WH should be a huge red flag that they could've missed others shady business. You have to at least admit that right? I actually don't think Trump knew anything in detail about the situation. I personally don't think he could explain any policy in detail. If you find a clip of him talking policy coherently post it please.

       I'll buy that. I probably agree with Flynn on most politics, but you're delusional if you think you're going to take foreign money and keep a clearance (unless you're the Clintons). I don't even care about RT, but writing a pro-Erdoğan op-ed shows you've been doing business with the wrong team. He may just be greedy and not necessarily compromised, but we'll have to see what else comes out.

       I don't know. It's hard to tell. Trump could have not known anything, or he could have been concealing the information. The Flynn situation wasn't explained in detail, the call he had wasn't even made public, so we don't even know how bad it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please explain more of the Turkey stuff for me, and was that before or after the "attempted coup" last summer?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anyone knows where Trump is in all of this, so I find it unproductive to speculate about what goes on in Trump's head. He could be fooling a bunch of people, who knows. I don't bookmark every Trump speech I see, so I don't remember anything specific from him talking about policy, but it depends on each of our definition of "coherent" anyway, so it wouldn't be productive to discuss something like that either.

       Well the basics are flynn got paid through a consulting firm over a half million to lobby for the dictator there. He didn't disclose this until after he was fired from being the NSA. So the whole time during the campaign the presidents nation security confidant and advisor is working for Turkey. Then he's hired as the Nation security advisor for the WH and didn't disclose so he's a spy now and should be charged for treason really. The crazy thing is the transition don't vet flynn and just trusted him to tell the truth. At the least it's criminal neglect.

       Interesting. Like I said, it's hard to tell. He could have just been a greedy motherfucker, but he could have had more nefarious purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just hard to tell because when a situation like Hillary's private server is exposed to the extent George Webb did, and similar dots haven't been connected in the cases like Flynn's where you can track where the money is coming from and likely for what purposes. That's what makes me think that Flynn was likely just a slimey greedy bitch. That is if all of this wasn't just MSM manipulation, like much of what is made of the Russia story.

       Hello RT shill. RT is the opposite of real news.  How can someone who claims to believe in consipracies actually believe that a dictatorships propoganda arm is a legitimate news source? The only news agency in Russia? In a country where speaking out against your dictator gets you killed (including journalist). I've never seen a more clear agenda besides the other fake news outlets like brietbart.

      <p>
       "It's her turn", you say like you don't comprehend that was a lazy ass propaganda smear adapted from "it's his turn" - a meme mocking Mitt Romney that became popular during the previous election after he was recorded saying "it's my turn" (he was actually talking about speaking - someone was interrupting them and he was telling them it was his turn to speak).

       Oh, that happens "next" does it?  Presumably you will explain the origins of the time machine used to go back and publish this statement in October, prior to the election.

      <p>
       I read it contemporaneously.  Media did report it at the time.  If you know nothing of this, if you never heard anything about Russia's involvement until after the election, that says something about the media you rely on for your information.  At the best it is withholding very important information from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you got the notion that accusations about Russia only started after the election from your chosen sources of information, then this is worse than merely withholding information from you.  They're feeding you false information if they told you that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So can you?  Can you recognize when you've been fooled, hoodwinked, taken for a ride, made into someone elses useful idiot so you can spread their lies for them, let yourself be turned into someone elses propaganda machine.  Can you recognize when you're being made a fool of?

       I'm not saying I love Trump. I never have. There is certainly a struggle for power between two competing factions, and either way, I don't want any government that infringes on the rights of an individual. I know that there is enough resources in the world that everyone could live for free if we as a species simply allocated our resources properly. Trump isn't doing that, so I'm not in love with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's obvious when something is being used as a distraction and when it's being forced down the public's throats, even though there's no real evidence to condemn anyone of anything illegal.

       To be clear, your argument is that if there were actual collusion between Trump campaign people and the Russian intelligence apparatus, um what? The MSM would have exposed this "as much as possible"? That's your best argument for why there isn't collusion? Weak tits.

       Many parts of the dossier have been proven true, and I would guess that in the end most if it will end up being true. The reason the mainstream media didn't run with out (outside of David Corn from Mother Jones who published a story more than a week before the election) was because they have a responsibility as journalists to verify their sources and it was just too large a job in such a short time.

       He's right about the war on drugs, federal reserve, and many other things. Reddit used to be all about this guy until of course the shilling happened. In any case, while the narrative is being changed by propaganda, seeing Ron Paul's views give you a good base so one doesn't get lost in the bullshit.

       Project Monarch and the hypnotizing effects of the frequencies put out by our televisions. Being in a constant Alpha brainwave state makes people less critical and easy to influence. Personal observations, I'm not a scientist. However, our whole world view is built upon the idea that there is always an authority figure in our life. The television news is portrayed as the authority on information. Just think about it, from birth there is always someone who "knows better" than us and is willing to tell us the "correct" answer. They don't want to help you speculate and come to your own conclusions. In school there are books and if your answer isn't "correct"(in regards to history, politics, not things such as math) you are "wrong" and all the connotations that come with that label and feeling.

       Not to mention the laundry list of suspicious deaths closely tied to the Clintons. They have more close associates die in "accidents" than is logically possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about your life, most of us have lots of people die around us for illnesses etc. we can also likely point to a person or two has died tragically in a car accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton have literally had over 30 people die of suicide, plane crashes, car accidents and murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       And these weird accidents seem to always be close to some major event that might hurt them, and the people who die would likely have dirt on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a conspiracy theorist at all, but this whole situation is very very strange.

       Seth Rich was a leaker who was murdered, Hillary had motive and a long history of suspicious deaths behind her, and her campaign chair said they should "make an example" of the leaker.  I can't think of a more likely scenario that fits those facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, the whole "Ze Russians" narrative was made up by Hillary's campaign, and has been pushed by the MSM despite a complete and total lack of evidence.  Also, Russia and America haven't been at war for thirty years, and have been allies for most of that time.   Who on this sub is stupid enough to fall for such obvious propaganda?  A lot of people, apparently.

      <p>
       If there was a complete and total lack of evidence, the investigations would have stopped. Unless you think somehow Clinton is still secretly in control of it all, which is absurd, because if she had that kind of power she could have forced the investigation to make stuff up earlier and kill Trumps campaign. It's also absurd to think she
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       holds that kind of power, given that she lost; she doesn't have any political capital any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if there was a complete and total lack of evidence, people on Trump's staff or cabinet wouldn't have been lying about it right up until they quit or were fired after that evidence you claim doesn't exist came to light. Remember Manafort? Remember Flynn? Remember all those people who claim to have never met with any Russians ever until pictures of them with Kislyak or Putin or both came out? It's absurd that this sub believes anything someone says about Clinton, but never anything about Trump. It's clear partisanship and has been since early 2016.

      <p>
       Shills are one of the lowest form of scum humanity has ever produced.  A person who takes a job pushing a narrative is morally and ethically bankrupt, is a pathetic waste of meat, a burden on society who lacks the ability to do anything productive with his life.  The best thing a shill can do for society is to commit suicide.

       I don't know, I'd put rape, murder, genocide, infanticide, reckless endangerment, child abuse, jaywalking, grand larceny, and terrorism to be a bit higher on the list than pushing ideology online. Then again I suppose it depends on the ideology being pushed. They aren't paying me to do it but I push a lot of ACLU stuff online, and somehow that seems different from pushing Stormfront.

       You realize I'm mocking you, right? Also you're pulling a source from the height of the Cold War. I don't doubt that there aren't spies working in news agencies, even if you take away the idea of them secretly controlling the news it's just practical; reporters are granted access to things and people that nobody else is.

       You said that there was no hard proof that the CIA infiltrated the NYT. While that may be correct, there is hard proof that the CIA has, and probably continues to infiltrate media.

       There are not many things you just don't do in this sub.. But the first thing you do is come in here and start implying Seth Rich was just a fluke and then immediately start posting sources from the three news sources we trust the least.  I don't care, if you're right about this.  You look like an ass, and you need to lurk more.

       I look like an ass because I'm saying something this sub is reluctant to hear. It's direct to attacking the source, not the claims within, not the Press Secretary admitting to the claims within. You don't want to hear it so you say it doesn't count, not because of journalistic standards but because they say things you don't like.

       Nope it's mainly because their journalistic standards are dogshit and you're pushing a narrative that has been increasingly discredited and lacks any real evidence other than certain individuals having their own ties to Russia at various times throughout their career in public service or lobbying.

       0/10, you're too hamfisted to control the narrative here. Simple tactics like these aren't going to do it; your constantly saying things like "we don't believe that here" only works - even on those who have biases that align with your message - on individuals until that eventual moment when that jarring dissonance arises after you voice a statement which attacks their biases, in their voice.

       Frankly, your trust means nothing. A screencap of "Guccifer 2.0" telling some actress that it was Seth Rich is not proof.

       I trust the government's assessment of who Guccifer 2.0 really is.

with Julian where he discusses Seth Rich and slips, the press conference held on Seth's birthday, and the reward offered by Wikileaks for info about his death.  I mean, use your critical thinking skills.

       Let's not forget the Podesta email talking about "making an example" of the leaker just before Seth Rich was murdered.

       So your proof is basically "Wikileaks implied it." That is not evidence in the slightest... And I would hardly say their record is unassailable. They've shown an extreme bias for a long time. Their Twitter makes it this bias the most obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Podesta e-mail, which is
       <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36082">
        right here

        this Washington Post article

       which has nothing to do with the DNC leaks. How surprising,
       <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/792875315920048128?lang=en">
        here we can see Wikileaks taking a small part of that e-mail out of context to imply that it has something to do with Seth Rich

       . So "unassailable," totally not misleading.

       This is propoganda spread by literally the Russian government and the trump administration. There is no reason to go to the servers with a microscope because this isn't a Saturday morning cartoon.

      <p>
       An image of the servers was provided to the FBI which is what they wanted. There is nothing you can do at the server that you can't do with an image.

       Comey stated that in any investigation physical access to the servers is the preferred way of doing things. What you are failing to point out is, the DNC SERVERS are the basis of the whole Russian hack narrative. They were not allowed access to these servers and had to rely on Crowdstrike's report and that was it. The Hillary server was properly confiscated and that is why she tried to bleachbit it and destroy phones because she wasn't able to stonewall them from getting physical access.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strange the FBI didn't file one single official request for the server either. But I'm sure they are on the up and up about this Russia thing. Source of DNC server image provided? Heres good ole CNN if you don't believe they wanted the actual servers.

       Heh, but you dare call people out for spewing propaganda. Facts you don't like do not equal propaganda. I have done a preliminary search and can not find anything on an image being provided. Just that they relied on third party information. If they were provided this image, how can they verify it is authentic? That is the whole point of wanting physical access.

       People believe Seth was a hit because the motive is overwhelming, and that's the same reason many of us believe the Russian influence narrative is lie.  The only way we can ever go to war with Sierra is if Russia is the bad guy.  No matter what you think of trump, you mark my words.. They day he goes down for this is the day we invade Sierra, and likely the circumstances will be just as dubious as every other time they've sent us to war on a lie.

       Are you serious? The whole argument here is "How dare you say I need evidence for X when you obviously believe Y without evidence".  Nobody on either side of this has any evidence.  All you're saying is that being involved in this discussion we've been having for months is "A bad idea." Don't try and tell me what to believe on the Seth Rich matter.  That is absolutely not something I'm willing to debate.

       I don't think you're going to start a jihad. My point was just that believing things without evidence is dangerous. What you believe about Seth Rich is not founded in fact. You are entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts.

       You really think Wikileaks is in the business of murdering people? You think Russia would risk a diplomatic shit storm that would most certainly lead to the very war america is obviously trying to start, to create a patsy out of a lowly staffer? I have all the evidence I need to prove unequivocally that you are stupid.

       You know what, you're right. Now that I have given it more than a half second of thought, it is pretty retarded to think that anyone would murder a low level staffer who had no importance and no access to any information of value.

       How's the investigation going into the proven illegal wiretaps on Trump campaign by the Obama Administration?  Oh wait, there isn't one.  Even though we know it happened.  There is hard proof of this, unlike the Russia hack scenario.  Why is it not being investigated?  Because Washington DC and the establishment in general hate Donald Trump, and will do anything to get him out of power, that's why.  Like it or not he wasn't supposed to win and he represents an existential threat to their power structure.

       Everyone that would know about iy or can investigate it has already said there was no wiretapping let alone illegal wiretapping.

       And Trump just threatened that he secretly wiretapped Comey.

       Considering his administration's intent on cranking up the drug war to imprison more people, continuing weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, and cozying up to the religious right; how is Donald Trump a threat to the existing power structure?

       At one point he was enough of a wild card to make the establishment shit themselves in fear, but I think he's pretty much "on-board" with things now.  Those are legitimate concerns, as are his deep ties to Israel and his deepening ties to Saudi Arabia.  It's still a good thing that the Clinton-Bush-Obama power structure has been removed from power, though.  They all but promised to start WW3 with Russia and Iran and Syria, and Trump wanting better relations is a net positive for both countries.

       Yes, he most certainly was.  It a matter of public record that the Trump campaign was surveiled by the Obama Administration through multiple attempts at a FISA warrant and because of the nature of the NSA spying technology, EVERYONE is subject to surveillance, including politicians and citizens.  Do you even Edward Snowden?

        It's a matter of public record that Susan Rice and other unmasked surveiled individuals within the Trump campaign, which is illegal.
       </a>
       Right before leaving office, Obama changed the rules regarding the dissemination of NSA metadata allowing it to be shared with the entire IC - which happened to be saturated with his handpicked loyalists - with the intent to sabotage the incoming Trump administration by planting "evidence" of Russian collusion to hinder any efforts for Trump to have a positive relationship with Vladimir Putin.  Why?  Because these same IC/military-complex types want war with Russia, which they
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       have had with Hillary in office.

       You're questions are perfectly reasonable and the fact you're getting downvoted for asking for what the crime is and evidence and he's getting upvoted unusually high suggests they're either being supported by shills or TrumpRusconspiracy is a shill themselves.

       If someone lies to you and you have evidence that he lied to you, would you not think that person has something to hide? or will you think "hmm, that seems perfectly normal to lie about"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give the invasion of Iraq as an example; They lied about the reasons for the invasion and we know that. But I have no hard proof (direct evidence of collusion as you seem to require) to link it to the petrodollar, israeli influence, military industrial complex, etc... Yet it's a fact for most people.

       It was intended sarcasm.  So you're making the assumption that I'm a shill because I replied to sarcastic douchebags like a sarcastic douchebag in kind?  I don't even support Trump and I didn't even vote for the guy, but the MSM narrative of Russia affecting the election in any significant way is straight up bullshit and a cover for the incompetence of the Democratic Party to beat a fucking reality TV show star.

       It's not propaganda to say that the Russia-Trump narrative is missing a lot of actual proof to substantiate it.  Just common sense.  It doesn't require a political bias either way to see it.  Even in a worst case scenario, Russia doesn't have shit on Israel in terms of influence over our politicians.

       Get divorced, try to starve off the pain by wasting all your time on reddit while hoping your boss doesn't find out. It's scary to be alone with your thoughts, even though you think things will get better after the first few weeks. You'll get a lot more karma I promise.

       Look at his actions since the public release of the Steele dossier, look at the churn in the administration, look at the churn during the campaign when people realized something was going on. Look at the constant stream of easily disputed lies from everyone in the administration. The man has had literally THOUSANDS of court cases leveled against him for decades for defrauding customers and employees. If you think that there isn't something strange going on then I have a degree from Trump University to sell you.

       It seems more like a teenager to me, or maybe just a brainwashed fanboy. I've heard of of the "troll factories" and what not, but I've yet to see obvious signs of their work. That being said, LightBap's first comment was odd. The deflection was so forced, and the "SMH" abbreviation and emoji all seem out of place.

       of Trump's actions early on after the election when it looked like he might have actually had a backbone against the entrenched power structure, but ever since Kushner and Ivanka gained more power in the WH and Trump began hardcore flipping on even his moderate/centrist positions, it's hard to see him as any different from Obama, Bush, the Clintons or any other puppet of the ruling Cabal.

       All it took for me was to hear he was running, but I've always been pessimistic, so I never had any hope for him.  I hoped he'd at least have a somewhat cabinet that helped him run things, but he's not even capable of finding people to make suggestions thst would make the country better. I dont like hillary, but in the same situation she would at least have been a decent politician, even if she was only in it for herself.

       It's riding the market, not predicting it. If you assume the economy should always expand, it's a good investment. Gambling addicts might not agree because it isn't fun or skillful. It's also not hard to see that when interest rates are at zero, the stock market will explode. Nobody will use a bank to save when interest rates are zero.

       No, the proper thing to do is use that search engine called Google.  I'm not your teacher or your mommy, find the threads where I talk about it, be a big boy or girl and do your own work.  This has nothing to do with the dubious nature of the Trump-Russia meme.

       Maybe you should just decide what conspiracies are acceptable for the sub and kick everyone out who disagrees with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesuits, bloodlines and priesthood of Amun Ra. Good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump and Illuminati. Good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump and Russia. Bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how you can justify it in your mind that we shouldn't be talking about Trump/Russia because there is no hard evidence but you turn around and post dozens of Illuminati and bloodlines conspiracies that have
       <em>
        zero
       </em>
       evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like you only care about hard evidence when someone posts something that you don't like. Why the double standard?

       Maybe you can explain why it's ok to post about papal bloodlines but not about the Trump/Russia connection. Go ahead. Tell me with the straight face it's because there is no hard evidence.

       Don't let people like this discourage you. When their comments are less than a paragraph every time, they have no space to debate logically. Also do not forget people are polarized more than ever and Comey's firing has done nothing but make people clutch to their "sides" conspiracy theory even more. Logic and bias is at an all time low for people stuck in the left/right paradigm.

       Commenting, and I don't necessarily mean in a way to discredit people or be aggressive. But commenting and using rationale and logic is the best weapon against partisanship and "shills". They will discredit themselves every time. Welcome to the sub by the way.

       No, that is not what it is. It is a value judgement. People ran with pizzagate based on someone on 4chan screwing around.

       You put faith in something based on: "Someone eats pizza, it means they molest kids. Hillary!" Seriously, weak sauce. With the russians we have an entire country known for doing such things, a rich man and his family with ties to russia, etc.

       pizzagate has pizza and hanky and some dudes pissing away their time trying to make it into rape/murder/satan worship. It's a joke, but because people love trump and hate hillary they will rush to believe it with their whole heart.

Also, you know you're building a strawman with the false way you describe pizzagate. There is vastly more evidence about that. What evidence is there about Trump being a Russian spy? Just the existence of an investigation? Talk about weak sauce.

       If you aren't a paid shill, I really feel sorry for how gullible you are. Pizzagate is based on highly disturbing emails talking about little kids, and public instagram posts of people very close to the clintons in which Peadophilia is all but admitted.

       So if there's so much evidence for Pizzagate, why is it that after more than 6 months not a single victim has come forward? No victims, no witnesses, no evidence any crime was committed, just emails taken out of context, weird shit on social media, and code words made up by 4chan.

       He is right in a way. It started with the emails talking about spirit cooking. Just because it was heavily researched on image boards does not mean it originated from there. A lot of the initial investigation involved doxxing and other things that would be wiped from most forum boards.
      </p>

       I mention spirit cooking because I am sure you were going to retort with script #5, Cheese pizza = 4 chan, thus pizzagate = 4chan, case closed.

       Whats your stance on dyncorp? They are a part of pizzagate too, and have been publicly shamed and called out for human trafficking by a senator. Pizzagate has always been a movement to stop state sanctioned human trafficking. No amount of trying to focus it on a pizza parlor will change that. The clinton foundation is dirty in regards to this. Have you checked out George Webb's video's on this topic? They are well put together and if you're curious about it all I would recommend checking it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I knew victims of human trafficking I would take them to the authorities of course! Why even bring that up? Is that some attempt to discredit the theory because no victim has stepped forward yet? What about

       The same to you friend, sorry If I came off as hostile. But civilian investigation is a part of that. However it is plagued by confirmation bias, emotional appeal and all the other things we try to avoid on here. It is based on a good intention even though the road to hell is paved with them. See ya around.

       So many of his emails talk about little children very inappropriately. Together with the instagram posts made by Podesta's close friends, and his friendships with convicted pedophiles, an investigation is warrented.

       Really, who talks like this? If they were your friends kids you wouldn't list their ages. If they were random make a wish foundation kids, since they don't sound related, a normal person doesn't wouldn't refer to them as entertainment, whole listing their ages. Then you have tons of emails where Podesta is using pizza, cheese, and other words, which pedophiles have a history of using as codes, that don't make any sense in context and are highly suspect emails.

       Why would he drop his code words and start referring to children by full names and ages?
      </p>
      <p>
       In theory these code words would be used for plausible deniability so why would he allude to molesting children who can be conceivably tracked down? Why not say "hey, heat the pool some of the guests may want to swim and theyre bringing pizza"?

       Supposed secret code within the contents of his emails. And just general oddness, the biggest red flag was one where Tamera Luzzatto ( former chief of staff to Senator Hillary Rodham ) sent to him about young children being in a pool for his entertainment, " Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and  almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in  that pool for sure."
 (LINK:

       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, these are what appears to be her step grandkids, however it's just weird wording "for your entertainment." Tamera Luzzatto also apparently had a blog that said you can spend time with Evie, a newborn baby  "raw and uncut" (LINK:
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/dujvrwj3mzfy.jpg">

       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, an odd thing to say about a newborn... Again, no hard evidence, just lots of suspicion and weirdness surrounding them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though other interesting Podesta emails talk about ETI (extraterrestrial intelligence) and the vatican...

       All fair points. I'm not making any jump, I'm just sharing with you, what little knowledge I know about it and how I've seen them rationalize it. If you want to know more, you'll have to go down that rabbit hole yourself.

       Nah,  I don't believe the propaganda that everyone against Trump is pro sjws.

       They get you in cheering for him with easily hateable targets, like Hillary,  Muslims and feminists,  which honestly he's never shown any inclination of caring about, and you end up cheering for all his dangerous and stupid and divisive politics.

       I don't support Trump, haven't since he bombed Syria, so take your assumptions and go kick rocks.  I also don't believe anything the MSM incessantly shits out and hammers into our heads, no matter how hard they scream "BELIEVE THIS".  These are paid liars and political hacks that are selling an agenda and pushing for a war with another nuclear power.

       I'm all for government transparency. There's too much unknown right now, but the Republican party as a whole has been the least transparent apparatus in government I've ever seen.

       If they have nothing to hide, they'd be releasing as much info as they could. Not preventing investigations at all costs.

       It also stands to reason that after 8+ months including 5 with a controversial Administration in power with huge amounts of leaks, something definitive and concrete would come out to bury Trump hard with proof of collusion, wouldn't it?  Yet there's nothing but the Pissgate document that got BuzzFeed laughed out of a Press Corp and personal business and lobbying deals with Flynn/Manafort and possibly Page that are probably no different from any other routine government corruption, because these people are ALL thieves and liars.  It's just being blown tremendously out of proportion with Trump because the entire DC establishment and media apparatus hates him because
       <em>
        it was HER turn
       </em>
       and Trump fucked all that up.

       OP doesn't identify with either party, is registered Independent and has pretty centrist views with left-leaning personal / social views, but ok guy.  It's called having a nuanced viewpoint, able to call out either side for their bullshit and give credit when it's (rarely) due when they actually do their jobs as "public servants".  I rightfully treat any blatant political push of opinion and propaganda from known political hacks in the MSM as incredibly suspect, and likely lying to push an agenda.  These are discredited liars who exposed their bias and their hand throughout the 2016 election on BOTH sides.  A cursory look at history proves them to be mouthpieces for the CIA and other IC agencies, and supporting
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       they want is a terrible idea.

       But with all the leaks and the collusion of the establishment and the media to push narratives like they have done so many times in the past, its surprising that no damning evidence has been leaked or outed by now. With all the extremely powerful and influential people that want this narrative to be true, there still isn't anything.

       That's not necessarily true. If Obama was seen meddling with the transition that would be exceptionally damaging to Dems. It makes more sense to set a trap and let Republicans spring it. Drms have an excuse for the shit tier election they ran, republicans have stand up or run from the wreckage.

       How were they taken out of context? They are asked "Is there any evidence of collusion between Trump/his team and Russia" to which they reply "no". What more context do you need?

       Yes Nance has a decorative background but when he goes on shows like MSNBC and repeats their talking points, he has lost all credibility. He supported Hillary for fks sake!

       Pushing fake news claiming wikileaks publishes fake emails. This guy is a Clinton/Obama minion. He retweets articles from Salon, Politico, NYT, Slate, WaPo, MSNBC and CNN which makes him a political hack.

       The Feds are conducting their investigation and we will have answers in time. You have no idea what evidence they have or don't have at this stage of the game. If there were hard evidence of collusion known to the public there would be people in jail already.

       Know what I don't like? I don't like that secret meeting (by secret, I mean no one was allowed to listen, btw) that President The Donald&amp;trade; has with that fat bald rooskie dude the other day, when other reporters weren't out and President The Donald&amp;trade; had quite a negative reaction to the PUBLIC DISCOVERY of the photos.

      <p>
       Obviously, you are correct. There is no direct correlation between Donald Trump and any Russian Agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Flynn left, of course. You know him, the Top Security Advisor with access to everything Secret the US has? The one who DEFINITELY has direct connection to Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh but I am SURE that President The Donald&amp;trade; and Mikie Flynn NEVER EVER discussed anything about Russia, now did they, cousin?

       Or I just copy and pasted this from a list on 4chan?  And endless amounts of speculation doesn't equal proof of malfeasance.  Funny how all people ask for is proof and evidence to support these assertions, and you guys act like it's irrelevant to the larger story, you flip out on and discredit people and accuse them of being Russian spies or sympathizers with your insane red-baiting Diet McCarthyism and just assume that the allegations are true because of your own dislike for Trump.  No one here is saying Trump is a good guy or uncorrupted, we are saying that there is no actual evidence other than conjecture and speculation to say that Russia definitively had a hand in the outcome of the election.

       Pizzagate is just a red herring for the larger problem of high-level pedophilia within the ruling class, which is most definitely real, and there's plenty of evidence and proof to support it.  Personally I think James Alefantis is a pedophile himself and probably a procurer as well, there's plenty of circumstantial evidence linking him to a larger global ring.

       It's absolutely coordinated. Every time a major Trump/Russia story comes out, like clockwork there will be at least 2 posts on the front page within the next 24 hours made by accounts a few days old that are essentially "BUT HILLARY". This sub is very heavily brigaded by T_D and they don't even try to hide that all the "This sub isn't about politics, we hate both sides" posts are really "PLEASE STOP ATTACKING GOD EMPEROR" posts.

       No but there is a dedicated contingent to move specific messages to the front page. Whatever the current situation is they craft a headline that runs counter to that and upvote it in droves. See: This post, "Obama had 8 years to reclassify marijuana", "James Comey has a history of getting the Clintons off", etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch for any Trump scandal, within hours some counter-agenda concern troll will post either attempting to discredit the person Trump is battling with or blaming the previous administration for whatever Trump is currently fucking up. It happens over and over again.

       I'm of the opinion that the Anti-trump posts are legitimate news at this point. Jeff Sessions said some dumb shit about drugs, the FCC chairman really does want to fuck up net neutrality, Trump did fire the head of the FBI while his administration is being investigated etc etc etc. These are all real stories the counter-assualt is attempting to wag the dog and bring nothing new to the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Trump supporters are not used to being in power and accountable for that power, Trump is the president now and if he fucks up there is no one else to shift the blame to. It will be interesting to see if this sinks in.

       Even if it was Russia that hacked the DNC emails and forwarded them to Wikileaks, who cares? I say, thank you Russia! If exposing lies, corruption, and the rigging of a primary is what constitutes "hacking an election" or "interfering with and election, then I'm all for it. But we all know it wasn't Russia. The Russia angle was made up by Hillary Clinton, because she couldn't accept her defeat with dignity. She's a cunt.

       Whats about hating liberals. i hate "conservatives" and "liberals" smart people are a bit of both and somewhere in between. I dont have a team. If you havent looked into the coincidences around edgar welch then at least look. I doubt youll even question the narrative but i dont feel like explaining.

       Have you ever read anything about high-level pedophilia and how it's been an ongoing phenomenon for centuries with the rich and powerful?  Research the Franklin Scandals, Dutroux Affair, Dennis Hastert, Jeffrey Epstein, Cathy O'Brien's testimony, Jimmy Savile, or the former UK PM Heath and figure out that Pizzagate is only a distraction and a small part of a much bigger worldwide problem.  Try the internet?  I hear it's a good place for info.

       Have you? Let me guess you think pizzagare is simply "clinton running underage sex rings from a pizsa shop basement?" are you one of those that misrepresents what it even is and then tells everyone that misinterpretation is proven false.... Of course its false, thats not what people thought to begin with.

       What I'm saying is that there's not enough proof to substantiate the claims that Russia interfered with our election or colluded with the Trump Administration.  Anonymous sources and political hackery from sources that blatantly shilled and supported the political opposition should be looked at with
       <em>
        obvious skepticism
       </em>
       of a higher motive to discredit a hated political opponent.

       I think we can both agree here that the DNC are using 'Russia hacking the election' as a scapegoat for why they failed, so the DNC doesn't have appear responsible for their loss, which I think we can both agree that they should take responsibility.
      </p>

       This isn't

        /r/politics

       though, I find it hard to believe anyone here would reasonably be convinced that Russia hacked the election and made the DNC lose by doing so. By "just saying" there is no evidence, you are implying that people are not only stupid enough to believe that Russia was behind the hacks and caused the DNC to lose, but you are also implying that people are stupid enough to simply believe your "there is nothing to see here" statement. Let people see the lack of substantial evidence, and the agendas of each news outlet, and let them come to their conclusions themselves, otherwise, let them be sceptical of Wikileaks agendas, if any. If you are so confident there is no substantial evidence, you don't need to "just say" anything. Like I said, this isn't
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , no one is going to be taken seriously if they say "Russia hacked the election because CNN told me".

       Please post more of these kinds of posts.  Every time I see people post anti-Trump/Russia posts like this, it just makes me more and more convinced there's something there because why else would people go to such great lengths to make posts to deny a conspiracy on a conspiracy forum?  So I have to say thank you for re-affirming for me that there's collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign/administration.

       I heard Trump say yesterday on NBC in an interview on Comey's firing that Comey had informed Trump on three separate occasions that he is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       under investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying everything Trump says is true, but Comey is also a known liar. It's a bunch of smoke, and no one can be sure who is telling the truth, so I like to go with the facts, which is what I outlined previously.

But the first thing you do is come in here and start implying Seth Rich was just a fluke and then immediately start posting sources from the three news sources we trust the least.  I don't care, if you're right about this.  You look like an ass, and you need to lurk more.

       Most politicians are at the local level so saying 99.99% are controlled by big oil is just straight up wrong. Only the ones where their influence is worth buying, will be bought.

       Hmmm....a guy who goes around shit talking everyone all the time has made enemies you say?!?! What a surprise! Even if Trump was squeaky clean and a genius at his job (he is neither), if you go around insulting literally everyone, you make enemies. Basic fucking life skills.

       That's not necessarily true. If Obama was seen meddling with the transition that would be exceptionally damaging to Dems. It makes more sense to set a trap and let Republicans spring it. Drms have an excuse for the shit tier election they ran, republicans have stand up or run from the wreckage.

       If the FBI was actively investigating such a claim, I might consider it a possibility that Trump sheds his skin and takes vacations to the center of the earth or wherever the fuck the lizardkin supposedly live.

      <p>
       I don't think it's such an absurd notion that Trump used Russian money or is connected to Russia in less than legal avenues AND Democrats are blowing this up as chink in the armor, using the entire thing as a scape goat for their miserable candidate.
