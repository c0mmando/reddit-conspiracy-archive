<blockquote>
<p>Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan were IT staff hired by 31 House Democrats at a rate of 2.5-4x the median pay, yet were never really around.
They were fired earlier this year 2/2 for hacking House Intelligence Computers and on suspicion of stealing equipment.
They were concurrently running a front car dealership &quot;Cars International A&quot;, and driving dignitaries around while employed as fulltime staff in the Congress.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz managed them.
Jackie Speier petitioned for them to obtain TOP SECRET clearance.
Obama gave them VISAs when they went to the white house with a visa lawyer.
There is also Omar Awan, and 2 of their wives in this story.
All the &quot;Awans&quot; (suspected as a reusable &#39;spy name&#39; like &#39;Braverman&#39;) are alleged to have been involved in a burglary of 20 congressional offices--stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment including computers and servers;
The 3 brothers were fired for illegally accessing and downloading information to a private server (similar to Hillary and Abedin),
And have since fled to Pakistan after moving money from shell account to Pakistan, holding their stepmother hostage and preventing her from visiting her husband, allegedly bedridden and died without any trace of a birth (lol) Death certificate. Yet he lives on in Pakistan, where all the brothers are now, putting islamic extremist jihadi propaganda on their facebook pages. &quot;We are Awans, we break bones not hearts&quot;. You know, representative of the sunny DNC / California types you trust your daughter to go surfing with.
They have ties to Hezbollah -- &quot;Imran owed money to Hezbollah&quot;; they owed money to Dr. Ali Attar used to start Car Dealerships A
House Democrats – including former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz – are standing by the Awan family, suggesting that racism is the reason behind the prove and the allegations. Keep in mind, they are standing behind criminals who DID illegally access computers, and DID hold their stepmother captive and DID illegally empty their Dad&#39;s account (insurance fraud--Capitol police said) before fleeing to Pakistan (no power of attorney as it was unsigned). If you aren&#39;t guilty, why flee, taking everything with you?
Representative Gregory Meeks has said he maybe thinks they’re being framed because they’re Muslim,” answered Rosiak. “But we have a police report showing that their own step-mother called the police on them, and she’s of course Muslim
Awans had money troubles. Abid declared bankrupcy in 2012 with 1.1M in debt.
They had a front company called &quot;Cars Interational A (CIA)&quot; it had odd finances and was unable to repay a loan to Dr. Ali Al-Attar
Dr. Ali Al-Attar : Philip Giraldi, a former CIA officer, wrote that Attar “was observed in Beirut, Lebanon conversing with a Hezbollah official” in 2012–shortly after the loan was made.
Dr. Ali Al-Attar has also been accused of helping provoke the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq as a leader of Iraqi dissidents opposed to Saddam Hussein.
Dr. Ali Al-Attar was involved in accused of raping women while they were under his anesthesia.
WikiLeaks emails show that although Imran was employed by her taxpayer-funded House office, the Florida Democrat’s world — and iPad — mixed DNC, House and campaign business, and that Imran was on call for, and on a first-name basis with, top DNC staff.
The Capitol Police are investigating NOT the FBI. Isn&#39;t that weird? This is an international conspiracy handled by the police?
Paul Ryan says the police have enough to do their job
FBI have been slowfooting other investigations on Clinton&#39;s server, Huma Abedin&#39;s server, and now they aren&#39;t investigating the Awan server, even though it&#39;s clearly linked by way of Debbie Wasserman Shultz&#39;s IPAD which we know the Awans had the password for (ie: admin access)
This story is NOT being covered by the Media. Why not? It seems like a bigger deal than watergate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Black President that admitted to drug use sent people to jail for drugs &amp; let the FBI/Justice Dept give that White Bitch that lost to Trump - her handlers were given immunity deals while drug users who went to pridon for far less serious crimes.  A minority opressed other minorities for white people.  Cheryl Mills got immunity &amp; she is black.  But those poor people went to jail.  You are a fukin choad.</p>

<p><strong>Barrack Obama:</strong> <em>“I am a very strong believer that the path we have taken in the United States in the so-called war on drugs has been so heavy in emphasizing incarceration that it has been counterproductive,” he said. “You have young people who did not engage in violence who get very long penalties, who get placed in prison and then are rendered economically unemployable, are almost pushed into the underground economy, learn crime more effectively in prison — families are devastated. So it’s been very unproductive.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan were IT staff hired by 31 House Democrats at a rate of 2.5-4x the median pay, yet were never really around.
They were fired earlier this year 2/2 for hacking House Intelligence Computers and on suspicion of stealing equipment.
They were concurrently running a front car dealership &quot;Cars International A&quot;, and driving dignitaries around while employed as fulltime staff in the Congress.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz managed them.
Jackie Speier petitioned for them to obtain TOP SECRET clearance.
Obama gave them VISAs when they went to the white house with a visa lawyer.
There is also Omar Awan, and 2 of their wives in this story.
All the &quot;Awans&quot; (suspected as a reusable &#39;spy name&#39; like &#39;Braverman&#39;) are alleged to have been involved in a burglary of 20 congressional offices--stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment including computers and servers;
The 3 brothers were fired for illegally accessing and downloading information to a private server (similar to Hillary and Abedin),
And have since fled to Pakistan after moving money from shell account to Pakistan, holding their stepmother hostage and preventing her from visiting her husband, allegedly bedridden and died without any trace of a birth (lol) Death certificate. Yet he lives on in Pakistan, where all the brothers are now, putting islamic extremist jihadi propaganda on their facebook pages. &quot;We are Awans, we break bones not hearts&quot;. You know, representative of the sunny DNC / California types you trust your daughter to go surfing with.
They have ties to Hezbollah -- &quot;Imran owed money to Hezbollah&quot;; they owed money to Dr. Ali Attar used to start Car Dealerships A
House Democrats – including former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz – are standing by the Awan family, suggesting that racism is the reason behind the prove and the allegations. Keep in mind, they are standing behind criminals who DID illegally access computers, and DID hold their stepmother captive and DID illegally empty their Dad&#39;s account (insurance fraud--Capitol police said) before fleeing to Pakistan (no power of attorney as it was unsigned). If you aren&#39;t guilty, why flee, taking everything with you?
Representative Gregory Meeks has said he maybe thinks they’re being framed because they’re Muslim,” answered Rosiak. “But we have a police report showing that their own step-mother called the police on them, and she’s of course Muslim
Awans had money troubles. Abid declared bankrupcy in 2012 with 1.1M in debt.
They had a front company called &quot;Cars Interational A (CIA)&quot; it had odd finances and was unable to repay a loan to Dr. Ali Al-Attar
Dr. Ali Al-Attar : Philip Giraldi, a former CIA officer, wrote that Attar “was observed in Beirut, Lebanon conversing with a Hezbollah official” in 2012–shortly after the loan was made.
Dr. Ali Al-Attar has also been accused of helping provoke the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq as a leader of Iraqi dissidents opposed to Saddam Hussein.
Dr. Ali Al-Attar was involved in accused of raping women while they were under his anesthesia.
WikiLeaks emails show that although Imran was employed by her taxpayer-funded House office, the Florida Democrat’s world — and iPad — mixed DNC, House and campaign business, and that Imran was on call for, and on a first-name basis with, top DNC staff.
The Capitol Police are investigating NOT the FBI. Isn&#39;t that weird? This is an international conspiracy handled by the police?
Paul Ryan says the police have enough to do their job
FBI have been slowfooting other investigations on Clinton&#39;s server, Huma Abedin&#39;s server, and now they aren&#39;t investigating the Awan server, even though it&#39;s clearly linked by way of Debbie Wasserman Shultz&#39;s IPAD which we know the Awans had the password for (ie: admin access)
This story is NOT being covered by the Media. Why not? It seems like a bigger deal than watergate</p>
