       I see this argument thrown around in here every day. People claim that pro-Trump bots are manipulating the content here. Some claim this sub is overflowing with pro-Trump alt righters who downvote anything anti-Trump. It's complete nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       To start, are there
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       Trump supporters in here? Of course there are. Why would they not be? Trump has support from like 40 percent of the US population.
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nation-tracker-poll-does-trump-support-have-a-ceiling-or-a-floor/">
        About 20 percent are full Trump supporters, 20 percent are somewhat supportive, another 20 percent oppose him somewhat, and 40 percent percent are anti-Trump.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Given this, we should expect that some anti-Trump threads hit the front page of this sub, and some pro-Trump threads do as well. This is exactly what we see happening, except some people are ignoring all of the anti-Trump threads and pushing a fake talking point that these threads don't exist. There are tons of people in here who push literal mainstream media talking points that get massive upvotes, occasionally gilded, while claiming they will be downvoted for being anti-Trump. If anything, we should expect that mainstream media talking points won't be received well here since this is a conspiracy sub, but these talking points get upvotes and gold.
      </p>

       Top post this week is the current top post. "I'm fucking TIRED of the fucking WAR on drugs. Jeff Sessions Demands "Strongest Possible Charges" For Drug Users. Fuck Jeff Sessions, and Fuck the War on Drugs"
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6awhsy/im_fucking_tired_of_the_fucking_war_on_drugs_jeff/?st=j2ndg2p6&amp;sh=61617e28">

      </p>
      <p>
       I looked at the 2nd top thread for this week. It's a bit of a neutral thread, not necessarily pro or anti-Trump, but lets take a look at the comments:
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the highest upvoted comments, and most of the comments that followed, claimed there was an ulterior motive for Trump firing Comey (covering up a conspiracy with Russia.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a8k3o/president_trump_fires_fbi_director_comey/dhcm43s/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a8k3o/president_trump_fires_fbi_director_comey/dhcm43s/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The most upvoted comment claimed "paid shills are downvoting this juicy conspiracy."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a8k3o/president_trump_fires_fbi_director_comey/dhcm43s/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a8k3o/president_trump_fires_fbi_director_comey/dhcm43s/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another top comment was deleted, but I recovered it. It claims the FBI are going to start leaking dirt on Trump to the press.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       The comments are completely full of anti-Trump users with massively upvoted comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another anti-Trump thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       Upvoted to almost 4,000 points: "Michael Flynn resigns: Trump's national security adviser quits over Russia links."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5txzbc/michael_flynn_resigns_trumps_national_security/?st=j2mm8gbv&amp;sh=c38fdfb0">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5txzbc/michael_flynn_resigns_trumps_national_security/?st=j2mm8gbv&amp;sh=c38fdfb0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing. The comments are full of anti-Trump conspiracy theorizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one was stickied for a while: "Let me explain exactly how Trump is a Rothschild asset and has been for decades. How his advisers, policies, alternative media talking heads all emanate from the Cabal, via Rothschild financial influence. We'll begin with Alex Jones and make our way down."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61hfyi/let_me_explain_exactly_how_trump_is_a_rothschild/?ref=search_posts">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61hfyi/let_me_explain_exactly_how_trump_is_a_rothschild/?ref=search_posts
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even on pro-Trump threads, the comments typically swing anti-Trump. Here's one that was upvoted to 648 and gilded:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/68y3ez/hillary_clinton_just_called_wikileaks_russian/dh2jvtl/?st=j2ndo2wc&amp;sh=2e1deff0">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many other highly upvoted comments claim this sub is like T_D, very right wing, etc. Then how did you get upvoted?

       a single post hitting their pre-planned talking point on 18k+, they don't care how stupid they sound. (getting paid, so why should they?) The reason is they cant allow certain political forces and shifts to gain momentum. Hence drugs today! something civilised society will never tolerate. another week it will be le rothschilds meme.

       The most idiotic part of all of this narrative to those who've been here long enough, is Trump has always been a conspiracy theorist!   Of course there is going to be overlap between the stories/articles that get posted here and those that would be posted there.  Trump's entire campaign was largely centered around fighting the globalists, which was a pretty big deal here pre election cycle as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is actually happening is a coordinated attack on this sub by the same groups who took over
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/news">

       , and
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews

       .  They want to control the dialogue in all subs, and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       and
       <a href="/r/the_donald">

       are the last two large subs on Reddit where they don't completely control the message in the comments section.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think they'll ever control T_D, but it looks like they're getting really close to controlling this sub with the way the "Anti Trump Hysteria" fueled comments are now constantly reaching the top in most threads.

       Also, when any major Trump-Russia story is posted, and it seems like it could get sent to the front page, upvoting the post results in an immediate and equalizing down vote. There ARE bots aimed at keeping these big stories buried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, whenever the story picks up too much momentum to be buried, Reddit (especially r/conspiracy) is flooded with damaging posts towards the accuser/relevant facts.

       Any evidence of these bots? I provided examples of those kinds of posts that hit the front page. If there were pro-Donald bots, then why was this post downvoted so much? It's at 61 percent. Why do anti-Donald comments get such high upvotes?  Sometimes your posts don't make it. That is a fact of Reddit.

       I think the_d drops more redpills than the average subreddit, but try saying anything anti-Israel there. It won't bode well for you. They've clamped down on anything resembling disagreement under the name of "no concern trolling."

       I don't support Trump nor do I post/subscribe to that sub. I do lurk there now however as it's one of the only places left to read a message that isn't dictated from the major news networks.

       There's a lot of value to the_d still... I lurk as well, especially for things the livefeed of Comey's testimony. They also continue discussing pizzagate which is appreciated given the ridiculous backlash from a handful of (likely) shills in this sub. To be clear, I'm fine with people disagreeing with it as a conspiracy; however, the number of insults, ad homs, canned responses, etc, can wear a person down. And I'm sure that's their objective.

       I think this sub is actually a decent barometer for how people think Trump is doing. When he first came to power and had a few quick wins this sub was pretty heavily pro trump. He and his cabinet have been fucking up a lot lately between net neutrality, the war on drugs, and all of the FBI related drama, so the sub has turned against him some. IMO that is working as it should be if he's fucking up he does not deserve the same amount of support.

       are you even joking?  the most controlled sub is T_D.  There is no questions; dialogue; or debating on anything than the guided narrative.  Its sycophant madness over there.
       <br/>
       Trumps campaign was saying outrageous crap then slowly walking it back and blaming everyone for actually listening to him. He was a nationalist on talking points, but how anyone whose main products and business ventures are globalist ventures managed to trick anyone he was fighting the globalist is literally the funniest things that have come from this.  He is a billionaire who has pretty much given billionaires reign of everything now.  For a while there was this whole drain the swamp you are a cuck if you are against us until finally the fallacy has worn thin.

       Using top threads for this kind of analysis is pretty asinine.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they get high on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , they get to the front page of reddit, or close to it, and get flooded by non-regular readers of this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously most of Reddit is liberal leaning, so they spout off typical liberal talking points.
      </p>

       I think a better gauge is something like this
       <a href="https://trevor.shinyapps.io/subalgebra/">
        Reddit Subreddit Similarity calculator
       </a>
       . Put in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and the top most similar political subreddits are Libertarian (#6), The_Donald (#17), Political_Revolution (#22), Conservative (#26) SandersForPresident (#30).

       The strange thing is, Reddit isn't left-leaning as much as a blend of progressives and libertarian. For example, the site overwhelmingly supported Paul and Sanders both. Based on the complete 180 I saw of subreddits like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       during the election, I'm inclined to believe the main subs are now astroturfed and giving the illusion of rabid liberals.

       To be honest, I think most Redditors are just uninformed bozos that treat politics like a sports team, and they were just hopping on the bandwagon to cheer for the most popular "team". Whether that's Ron Paul, Bernie Sanders, or even Donald Trump.

       You aren't entirely wrong, but one of the general shill strategies is to get reddit to think of it's users this way. It is programming us to discredit our fellow users, and all it accomplishes is division and conflict. We should treat each other with respect and try to work together wherever possible.

       When they recruit these Portland transplant baristas to drop their vegan blog, this is the manifestation into organized shit posts like this. Probably took him at-least two adderall to finish this bad boy, they are some dedicated cucks man. Nevertheless  I don't support trump nor vote because it literally does not matter, trump has proven this pretty quickly.

       Maybe if shill mods of reddit, u/spez, etc... didn't censor differing political opinions in other subs, they wouldn't have had a need to come to this sub.  Also, with Google Facebook etc... blatantly censoring their news, it has pretty much officially turned pro Trump views into "conspiracy."  So it's annoying that this sub is more political now, but it's all a given considering the current state of reddit.  At least some of these trump thumpers might get redpilled lurking here.

       It's funny that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       seems to demand that everyone fall in line with one point of view and if they're not they're shills. The only problem is there is no agreement on what that one point of view is.

       So you end up with people being accused of shilling for the Zionists, the Illuminati, the NWO, the Aliens, etc..

       It's pathetic.

       The point you should take from this sub is shady shit happens, and we don't know the full truth of it, and probably never will. There are cover-ups and disinformation regarding what is going on.

       You're not going to be able to stop some giant nation state play or false flag, so have an idea about it, but don't worry so much. Instead work on the local level where you can actually have an impact stopping corruption. From there you might be able to open some eyes and create change.

       Arguments like "You think the Rothschild's run the world? Lol! They're just the front for X" do nothing for anyone.

       This sub is overrun with shills from both sides some days.  Shills: regardless of whom you're shilling for you're still scum who would be more useful to society as dog food.

       I hate to tell you this but when posts from this sub hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       people from outside the conspiracy cliques will post things you wouldnt normally see from the echo chambers that exist around here and other people that agree with it would upvote it where normally those posts would get downvoted to hell.
