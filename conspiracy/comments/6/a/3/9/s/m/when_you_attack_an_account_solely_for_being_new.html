       You're right.  Your original response doesn't

       I made a joke about a 5 month old account and you tried to equate to a karma pissing contest.

       So I replied that karma doesn't matter, nor does a high karma count equate to the intelligence of the poster.   You proved this with your shitty atheist dying and finding god post yesterday.

       You are correct.   I didn't watch the whole video.

       After the first couple of minutes it was easy to see how full of shit it was, so I stopped watching.   That dude's a real rocker, I'll tell you what.

       I'm wondering if I actually know you IRL honestly.   Based off your name and a few things you've said.  Don't have the motivation to actually go through your post history and try to confirm though.

       And you said my "shitty post" was about an atheist finding God. Now you make a post saying it wasn't about that. If you would have watched it or hell even read the headline to the post you would have know he talked about reptillians, cubes, Hitler, etc. I even made a comment saying I was pretty sure it wasn't real. 
And you DO NOT know me.

       Yet it seems like a lot of the people in the comment section were not intelligent enough to notice the use of the word "solely" so I will highlight it again for them:

      <blockquote>

       Solely (definition): not involving anyone or anything else;
       <strong>
        only

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the feigned ignorance of why a conspiracy user would not stick to one account is mind-blowing.

       Exactly. You for example engage and discuss. The accounts that had been pushing the Macron leaks this weekend didn't.

       98% of new accounts, from my observations are nefarious/suspicious. If you are banned here and create another account you are breaking rules. There is a reason, you were banned (and I've been banned myself - and never evaded said ban - no reason to). Right or wrong, tis' the rule here. New accounts, same as outsiders to a community will always be seen as suspicious. I'm not sure why people take such credence in creating new accounts to cover there tracks. You can't, in the grand scheme of things (ie. IP's/cookies/etc etc). Speak your mind, be yourself, and just roll with the punches.. People who have new accounts are either ignorant, or suspicious to me. Just my two cents...

       There really are none. You can appeal it, if you're not a dick and have a case... Trust me. Calling a mod a stupid cunt motherfucker, is not helping your case. Ask. 1 mod could ban you from here, and other mods may chime in based on what you said, and may disagree, leading to unbanning... Mods are humans as well, and they're not here just to be here. Most actually participate in one form or another and care about the community...

       Fun fact (that I am sure most of the people here will refuse to believe): You actually based your username on one of my old usernames. In another life I was Putin_Hates_Cats.
      </p>
      <p>
       And believe me, people like me often change usernames, here's why:
      </p>
      <p>
       I routinely make posts/comments all over reddit that go viral and get a lot of attention. This has led to people stalking my username and harassing me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I routinely make posts/comments that are well thought out, well sourced, garner site-wide attention, and (here is the important part) act as a giant "fuck you" to the powers that rely on the ignorance of the userbase. Just one example, have you heard of the "How Reddit Was Destroyed" series? Yeah, I created that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What did creating that lead to? It got me site-wide shadowbanned within 24 hours. Thats nothing though. It also led to people combing through my search history and trying to piece together where I lived, how old I was, analyzing screen shots I had taken for personal info, etc... Don't believe anyone who says "hurr durr, its just Reddit". Reddit is something like the 4th biggest website on the planet. And believe me, if you are not very, very careful, then people can find out a lot about you by scrolling through your history. And if you end up getting a large enough audience, they will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, being a person who routinely posts what I consider to be the truth onto front-page subreddit, despite the fantasy-reddit that the useful idiots want you to believe in, the reality is that you will get banned, and you will get banned
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And when I get banned for simply posting facts and sources that admins or moderators do not want getting traction, then no, I am not simply going to hang up my hat and say "Well, banned from worldnews, guess I am never going to post there again!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It has a very different effect. Trying to shut me up is only going to make me research more and change my approach. It is only going to make me analyze the rules and follow them to the letter. Don't get it twisted and think I am being banned for rudeness or spreading "da Jews" theories. And guess what, when I get banned even after following the rules, then I am going to make 10 new accounts and come with 10 times the force. Its just a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       So anyways, of course I am going to get hit with "OMG, this user is making all of this up, hurrrr" and then dismissals of the actual content I just wrote, but you know what, I don't give a shit. Everything I wrote is the truth and smart people will be able to learn from it. And you know what "Putin_loves_cats", I know you are one of the smart ones, because I remember when you created your account and I remember appreciating the nod. So I always made sure to check out your content and I find you to be a great member of this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wish I could say the same thing for the other 90% of users in this comment section.

       I  have been deleting my post history on a weekly/monthly basis for the last couple years. I hate when people go right into my post history instead of just addressing the point at hand. People on reddit will dismiss you and anything you say if they see you have been posting in this subreddit. I got sick of people digging through my post history instead of addressing  the point of whatever I was posting at the time. I also freely admit that I much prefer to have a clean posting history because it makes me a bit of an enigma to those who have not been in this sub for any length of time and who know me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately I have been finding that a clean posting history allows me to further my own point, and the ability to tailor my posting history with a clean slate allows me to emphasize whatever issue I am posting about that day in a different way. I see nothing wrong with using my own posting history as a means of creating a particular narrative and subtext to any potential discussion.

       Hey fellow shill. I too have no desire to be harassed at work or for posting on certain subs. I also don't want to make it easy for people to track my comments down IRL. But in order to make a new account, I had to ask George (you know,
       <em>
        George

       ) for permission and now here I am, shillin' for my daily bread.

       Heres the deal, I don't look at everyones time their account has been active or look at everyones karma unless someone says something stupid (or out of the ordinary). Then when I do 90% of the time its either a very new account or its a year or more old and has very low karma.

       Well, sport, if you have been an active member of this subreddit since 2012 then you should know that a 13 day old account is not given any credit. Either you are a shill or you are stupid. Think about it and do the math. Your account has to stick around a while and build some credit before we take you seriously - and you
       <strong>
        know
       </strong>
       that. So
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       buzz off until you can stop being so silly.

       Lol, and then an account showing up with no karma but an age of a year, two or more would look just as suspicious. You essentially are using the same logic employers requiring years of experience on an entry level position.

       Not to mention shadow-deleting individual comments you make so that only you can see them. A tactic that is so effective that 90% of the people on this website are not even aware of it.

       Unless you understand reddit mass-deception and are woke enough to routinely check the permalinks of your comments, most people have no idea of the hundred or thousands of comments deleted daily.

       Admins only shadowban with reason, although those reasons are sometimes stupid, such as messaging the mods too often.

       Shadow-deleting of users is a lot less common than shadow-deleting of keywords, IMO.

       I've had both happen to me. Although the shadow deleting of a comment was only on a heated civil discussion of 9/11 and how they designed the towers to withstand a fully loaded 707, fuel and all. I had to actually point it out to the guy I was arguing with and he found it quite strange as he was a total non conspiracy type of guy. At least well, he seemed very much to like the official story and arguing its merits. The shadowbans that I get are weird though, it's like I'm stuck in NP mode where I can only read and not reply to anything. But I found that sometimes you can get around that because it doesn't ban you from replying directly from your inbox.

       Exactly. I swear a bunch of people here seem to have no concept of just how absolutely corrupt the admins and mods of this website are.

       I guess thats an easy reality to have when you don't step "out of bounds".

       This is a very naive comment if you are the experienced old hand you claim to be. On this sub, of all subs, users are suspicious of shills, and that is why many people use RES to help sort who is a regular and positive contributor to this community, and who...is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whilst a brand new account is NOT evidence of a shill or a troll, most users (including myself) regard such accounts with added scepticism, mainly because such accounts are normally alts, and why would you be using an alt?

       I've never once checked someone's account to see how many days it's been in existence. I don't care. I take comments for what they are. I don't care if a bot, shill, CT, or debunker wrote it. I'm writing this with probably my 20th Reddit account in 5 years that I just started. I've been called a paid shill at least 3 times in this sub over the years because of a new account. My stock answer is "where do I get a shill job? Sounds like a fun thing to do for the money."

       Of course a post like this only gets traction after people started routinely calling out the account age of posters pushing rightwing talking points (mostly the Macron stuff).

       Not directing this at the OP, but you would never see a post like this make the front page a few months back when 90% of the account age accusations were used to shut down anti-Trumpers.

       this is my fifth account. Just for fun I am going to get this banned, it just feels fresh to start with a new account, like how you feel after a shower.

       Some guy complained about my new account which is a result of spilling a cup of coffee on my laptop and not remembering my old password. It was just simpler to make a new account.

       I  have been deleting my post history on a weekly/monthly basis for the last couple years. I hate when people go right into my post history instead of just addressing the point at hand. People on reddit will dismiss you and anything you say if they see you have been posting in this subreddit. I got sick of people digging through my post history instead of addressing  the point of whatever I was posting at the time. I also freely admit that I much prefer to have a clean posting history because it makes me a bit of an enigma to those who have not been in this sub for any length of time and who know me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately I have been finding that a clean posting history allows me to further my own point, and the ability to tailor my posting history with a clean slate allows me to emphasize whatever issue I am posting about that day in a different way. I see nothing wrong with using my own posting history as a means of creating a particular narrative and subtext to any potential discussion.
