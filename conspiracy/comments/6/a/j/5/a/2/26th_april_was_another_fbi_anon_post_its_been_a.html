I by no means have any reason to believe this to be anything more than a LARP, but I haven&#39;t seen it discussed here, so I thought a summary might be ok to post?<br/>
Been away a few weeks, apologies in advance in case of a repost.  </p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s Been a While /pol/</strong><br/>
But The Time is Right. FBI Anon Here. You know how this works AMA  </p>

<p>Q: Is anything actually going to happen with NK<br/>
A: Yes. At this point the wheels have already been sent in motion for a long time.  </p>

<p>Q: are we going to war with korea<br/>
A: Unless Trump decides to bite the establishment which now has him by the collar, yes.  </p>

<p>Q: Prove it!<br/>
A: Fake and gay for plausible deniability. But you knew that all ready right?  </p>

<p>Q: Where&#39;s the safest place to be in the US if shit pops off? stay safe<br/>
A: At home. Away from populated city centers and urban areas. Most of the elite hold residence in other countries so they will be far from the carnage they create.  </p>

<p>Q: Is it true that the letter agencies are molding, manipulating and for lack of a better word &quot;building&quot; the way that we think? To expand a little. I&#39;ve heard thrown around a lot that the deep state is actively using the internet to program the way people think via psyops and &quot;shilling&quot;. While this isn&#39;t something we didn&#39;t already know I feel like it goes deeper. Like the deep state is playing a game with reality and is trying to stack the deck in their favor.<br/>
A: It goes much deeper then you think. Image boards and other places of &quot;free talk&quot; are heavily controlled. Narrative often scripted and pulled away from topics critical of there goal. The other main image board is a known limited hangout  </p>

<p>Q: When is revolt against Comey ? When is Hillary Jailed ?<br/>
A: Hillary will never see a jail cell unless a revolution takes place. At one point there was a real chance, since then deep state has retained their grasp of Trump  </p>

<p>Q: Is <a href="https://i.4cdn.org/pol/1493239930793.jpg">this</a> the real alien pic? If not can you post the real one?<br/>
A: Very Fake, but expect these kind of psyops from project blue beam. Most of the elite are literally insane and expect the public will believe everything. Motions are already in place  </p>

<p>Q: Wtf is with the cards , more detailz plz<br/>
A: Can&#39;t say everything. Like always you have to read between the lines  </p>

<p>Q: What&#39;s happening in the Kuril islands straights? I overheard my line manager at work mention them, she&#39;d have no reason to if not a happening due to my line of work. If it really is you and not some faggot larper, give us the lowdown on /pol/ related items, like pizzagate. Also, post your badge and I&#39;ll post mine - t. work closely with UK defence minister in whitehall.<br/>
A: Not gonna happen buddy  </p>

<p>Q: Does the (((deep state))) have dirt on Trump?<br/>
A: Not directly but through his kids they have him. Kushner is bad news. Him and Ivanka are full blown globalist and on board the NWO plan. This extends to satanic and occult practices. Him purchasing 666 building is no coincidence. Expect to hear more from him as time goes by. Man behind the curtain  </p>

<p>Q: Are there internal struggles going on inside and between the intelligence agencies? How bad are they?<br/>
A: Most of the agents love their country and want to see it do well but the NWO does not want that. Like alway as you go up the ladder the stench increases.  </p>

<p>Q: Whats wtih project Gotham Shield and the Minuteman launch? this all seems to be planned at just the wrong time.<br/>
A: Another False flag to get us into war with NK. Drill goes on for weeks. Don&#39;t fall for the only today meme. Where&#39;s there&#39;s smoke and crisis actors you got fire  </p>

<p>Q: Is there anything we can do to stop WW3 from happening? Or is it set in stone now?<br/>
A: Yes. Keep pushing and investigating. This is a long game and they will not rest until every country is under their control. Places like this legit make them scared  </p>

<p>Q: <em>Unless Trump decides to bite the establishment which now has him by the collar, yes.</em> Have him by the collar how? Any particular groups?<br/>
A: Bill Kristol, deep state, Soros. Different players but they always play for the same team. Virtually all the leaks in the white house were coming from Priebus. That graduated into Kushner covertly giving dirt(sex tape) to deep state. In the family circle he has such pull they do not suspect him  </p>

<p>Q: Have you been to Antarctica?<br/>
A: Never been. But it&#39;s a great vacation spot, and not because of the weather  </p>

<p>Q: Why come back now? What is NK going to distract us from? what tech should I invest in?<br/>
A: To let you know to keep pushing. /pol/ really does have the power to change the world. NK is meant encircle Russia.That has always been NWO&#39;s goal and hasn&#39;t changed  </p>

<p>Q: Should i be stocking up on water and ammo<br/>
A: Yes. Not a religious man myself but for what the elite are into a bible wouldn&#39;t be a bad pick either.  </p>

<p>Q: Is Trey Gowdy currently in protective custody? Was he actually picked to be the next FBI director?<br/>
A: Can&#39;t comment on that right now.  </p>

<p>Q: What does the deep state have on Trump to control him? Trump made some remarks that made it sound like he plans on taking down Epstein, is that whole plan finished with? Also what&#39;s the likelihood that NK has nukes on its satellites and is planning on an EMP launch?<br/>
A: Trump literally has his whole cabinet working against him. Kushner is an Israeli operative as well as Powell. They are not playing for the home team. Kushner controls Trump and the narrative through his daughter, his reddit and 4X2 bots, and more nefarious blackmail. Look into Cadre&#39;s dealings. It&#39;s a good start. NK would never attack unprovoked. It would be game over for them. The media is building up their arsenal so people buy the upcoming false flag like they did in Syria  </p>

<p>Q: Is there any kind of development of investigation into pizzagate or paedophile rings and when can we expect to see something from this? You mentioned a possible revolution might help see Clinton behind bars but what with trey gowdy having missing investigators can we expect to see something happen in this corner and perhaps show the MSM as fools once more?<br/>
A: Until pressure to remove Kushner and Ivanka&#39;s appointments from the cabinet began nothing will happen on this front. Removing Kushner is the only way the ship straights itself peacefully and is the start to solving these problems.  </p>

<p>Q: Simple question will the wall be built? Trump made a lot of promises and this one will crumble him down.<br/>
A: As things stand now no. Trump always intended to build it but the wall is a huge thorn in the plan for open borders. The republican establishment and liberals will not go along with any plans to build it. Most of his entire cabinet now openly oppose him on it. Bannon and Mnuchin are the only two left on his side  </p>

<p>Q: <em>In the family circle he has such pull they do not suspect him</em> So basically Trump runs his business and became president because Kushner wanted it so? And he is a puppet for his daughter and his son-in-law? God thats disgusting and humiliating.<br/>
A: Kushner runs all of the campaigns online interests. That has turned into him controlling these so that Trump sees his narrative. Trump trusts him too much to see the knife  </p>

<p>Q: Never been. But it&#39;s a great vacation spot, and not because of the weather. is that where NWO Headquarters is?<br/>
A: Getting close </p>

<p>Q: Thanks for the encouraging. What do you think about Venezuela, is there any plans to intervene, or the CIA just decided to play fair all of the sudden?<br/>
A: CIA has been intervening there already for a very long time.  </p>

<p>Q: Can you give us a hint of how many people in congress are pedofiles?<br/>
A: Probably 75-85% engage in either children or men. Blackmailed through both.  </p>

<p>Q: To what degree is the alt-Right being monitored by the FBI? Are they worried about it?<br/>
A: Most of the alt-right sites are straight up honeypots or used for misdirection.  </p>

<p>Q: <em>NK would never attack unprovoked. It would be game over for them. The media is building up their arsenal so people buy the upcoming false flag like they did in Syria</em> I get this narative so why are they not using this unspent capitol from today to use it as a false flag? Was it because people noticed? It seems like a perfect change to put us on the course to war with NK with no objections.<br/>
A: Don&#39;t count em out yet. Preparations are already in place. Drills run all week  </p>

<p>Q: What is the Mormon / FBI role in &#39; The Great Work&#39; When does Alex Jones give up his NWO shilling ?<br/>
A: Jones is Jones. He&#39;s aware of the jewish question but can&#39;t talk about it without losing money. He&#39;s about 65% right on other things. Do your own digging  </p>

<p>Q: how can /pol change the world? /pol has exposed so much. Still, nothing happens<br/>
A: There was a joke over here a couple weeks ago how /pol/ mad Cadre change their free mason logo. It was funny because it was true  </p>

<p>Q: How close am I? <em>&gt;US false flags a nuke</em> <em>&gt;Benevolent alien holographs save the day</em> <em>&gt;we worship aliens now</em><br/>
A: Close. Not there yet but close. There were some posters here very close to Kushner&#39;s ties to project blue beam. looking into what lucent became is the next step  </p>

<p>Q: what did (((they))) do to put trump on a leash?<br/>
A: Ivanka.  </p>

<p>Q: which place on this planet would you say is the safest if all hell broke loose? e.g. Greenland or some remote islands in the pacific<br/>
A: The elite literally have steel castles underground. You can never match that. By exposing them you become stronger.  </p>

<p>Q: Is Spencer and his fags over at The Shoah honeypots? I feel like they&#39;re controlled opposition t b h<br/>
A: Yes. Most of these alt-right places are honey pots. Expose the truth everywhere. That other image board is on Cadre&#39;s payroll  </p>

<p>Q: If Antarctica is not NWO Headquarters then it must be the biggest sex tourism, pedo-island of them all. Closer?<br/>
A: Trans-humanism experiments is closer.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/FBIanon">PG Wiki</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To summarize how FBIAnon&#39;s got a reputation as being legitimate, there are a few obvious reasons; (s)he gave a lot of information that seemed to line up, and on top of that, the FBIRecordsVault twitter account releasing the Clinton Investigation document on Nov 1st at 11am after an anon on 4chan says &quot;Nov 1st at 11am the house of cards collapses&quot; and Wikileaks said phase 3 was hitting on nov 1. Even if that is all a coincidence, an FBI agent still released the Clinton Investigation document on Nov 1st out of the blue. At the least, the source is someone inside the FBI. FOIA requests are supposedly not added to their records vault, indicating that someone inside the FBI was involved in the unofficial leaks.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>but also:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Analyzing the FBIAnon 4chan Q&amp;A Transcript, there is no evidence FBIanon was an actual FBI insider [...]   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, to summarize my feelings:<br/>
I find it plausible, that at some point insider amused themselves by giving out veiled but real information into the chans. I find it absolutely inevitable, that people fake these kind of threads.<br/>
I think it is due dilligence of specifically this sub to keep track and catalog fake and real posts like these.</p>

Two of the primary reasons AT&amp;T Corporation chose to spin off its equipment manufacturing business was to permit it to profit from sales to competing telecommunications providers; these customers had previously shown reluctance to purchase from a direct competitor. Bell Labs brought prestige to the new company, as well as the revenue from thousands of patents. Lucent also operated from 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City.[13]</p>
