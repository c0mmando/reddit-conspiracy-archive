    <div class="md"><p>Try traveling a bit being an america comes with a ton of freedom. Your passport if you could transfer it to someone from almost any other country would be worth millions. Go to a country like Thailand that is even well off for south east asia and someone will drive you around in their car all day for $30 and not charge you for fuel.</p>

<p>Globalization comes with many problems one of which is that $7.25 an hour minimum wage in most of the USA is still upper middle class for most of the world. Even the luxuries you get from that wage is higher than you will get in most parts of the world. Time as a commodity is rapidly dropping in value in first world countries as it meets competition from countries where time is worth far far less. On the other side services and physical products are increasing in value.</p>

<p>This is why the rich are so rich and why those working for wages are making less and less every year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Minimum wage of 7.25 is not enough for people to survive in America (they literally starve), let alone provide any luxuries. Did you ever try to live on that wage? Companies that pay such miserable wages happen to be the most profitable companies in the world. Your argument is based on comparing standards of living between third world country and USA, 7.25 would go a longer way in Thailand because things are cheaper there. Basic necessities are much more expensive here, so that 7.25 (that&#39;s before taxes) is nothing. </p>

<p>Rich are getting richer in America, not because time is less valuable, but because there is widespread corruption which enables wealthy class to buy whatever they want. With diminishing of unions over time, workers lost their bargening power. Disappearing of unionized labor is directly ralated to stagnating and slipping wages. America was in the greatest shape when unions were strong. We are talking about 50&#39;s, 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, during those decades a household could live well of one income.  During those times, fast food jobs were mainly reserved for teenagers who wanted to makes some spending money. Today median age of fast food worker is  29 and they have to apply for public assistance just to survive. Germany faces same competition from countries like China, but unlike US, Germany protects it&#39;s industry and it&#39;s labor. Germans enjoy higher standard of living than Americans, unfortunately. </p>

<p>Majority of Americans are wage and debt slaves, too preoccupied with entertainment and sports to notice that they have been slaves for a while now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lived off that much in america for years and not at home with my parents. I spent $375 for a room in the city, ate rice and lentils lunch and dinner and oatmeal for breakfast $1.50 a day was my food budget. I went to trade school using city transit and after rent that was my largest expense. I did not have internet or a cell phone. I didn&#39;t qualify for food stamps because I was in school. I worked nights and weekends and did a 36 hour class load in trade school after I graduated  I was able to get a job that paid $25 an hour and now am arguably rich.</p>

<p>But yes for about a year of my life I lived off minimum wage and it sucked but again the standard of living I had was considerably higher IMO than that of poorer countries I now have the luxury of visiting around the world. I enjoy traveling both to see the sites and experience different cultures but also to remember what it is like to live with less and still be happy.</p>

<p>The rich get richer like me because they know that the american economy is powerful and that the &quot;poor&quot; people you are talking about spend every dime they have on luxuries they take for granted. Those luxuries make people who sell said luxuries very, very rich.</p>

<p>Both Reddit &amp; Facebook manipulate content; allow shills; collect your data &amp; know your preferences; allow you to distribute your ideas; limit your ideas; etc.</p>

<p>If Reddit would have just sued Correct the Record for tortious interference I think we&#39;d be in a lot better position to &#39;break up gridlock&#39;.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s better because it&#39;s easier to see and find content and the content is relevant for a <em>little</em> longer. It&#39;s also a global system and content isn&#39;t funneled into personal endless streams that are more like echo chambers. With FB you have the echo chambers if you want them or not. On Reddit it&#39;s a matter of choice. Chances are also high that you&#39;ll be confronted with content that you&#39;d not see otherwise because your friends-friends are not interested in the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is better because you can choose topics about which to converse instead of having the topics dictated by the news cycle.  I guarantee you that everything you see on Facebook right back is about something that was talked about in the news last week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true. You just need to know where to go. e.g. I have been following the DNC Fraud Lawsuit for months and they share articles that haven&#39;t been posted elsewhere on Reddit. So that&#39;s +2 for FB.</p>

<p>+1 for info straight from the source</p>

<p>+1 for content you can&#39;t find on Reddit</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DNCfraudlawsuit/">https://www.facebook.com/DNCfraudlawsuit/</a></p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t care too much either way. Neither site is anywhere near perfect. Neither site is unbiased. Both sites manipulate content distribution. There are obvious positives for anonymity from your friends &amp; family that we get on Reddit. But there are also <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2015/recommendations-from-friends-remain-most-credible-form-of-advertising.html">positives for being public about what you&#39;re posting</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cat topic actually brings me to one of my biggest pet peeves about Facebook.  I go in and set my feed to &quot;Most Recent&quot; so I can see what I missed.  It never saves.  Facebook always requires me to see what they want me to see.  It is similar to Reddit, but Reddit can search by New and it is less annoying to scroll through the results, and the topics can be discussed in more detail.  Having a discussion on Facebook with more than twenty posts is a nightmare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you want an honest answer? A lot of them are very talented people who will get huge amounts of money elsewhere. You want the government run by the smartest people don&#39;t you? FBI Director Comey is worth millions, but what they won&#39;t tell you was that he was in private practice for a decade as Chief Legal Counsel. That&#39;s a C-suite job, bound to pay you millions.</p>

<p>Susan Rice, everyone thinks swindled money .. well, she comes from money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She grew up minutes from the nexus of her present-day political saga, in Shepherd Park in Northwest Washington. Her father, Emmett Rice, was an economist who in 1979 became the second African American appointed to the Federal Reserve Board. Her mother, Lois Dickson Rice, was a corporate executive and a longtime member of the College Board. Rice’s parents divorced when she was 10.</p>

<p>They circulated among the city’s elite. Rice attended fancy schools — Beauvoir and the National Cathedral School. Rice, who played point guard on the basketball team, was such a jock that her family called her “Spo,” short for sport, a nickname that some family members still use. (Rice says she has not played hoops with Obama. “I know I can’t hang with him,” she says in an interview.)</p>

<p>Inheritances from Cameron’s and Rice’s families, as well as her own investments, are chiefly responsible for her $20 million-plus net worth, which has drawn attention this week because she holds stocks in Canadian oil companies that could benefit from construction of the Keystone Pipeline, a project that she might have some influence over if she were named secretary of state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, many of them also come from money which is also part of the problem. The cycle of money to power and power to money. This allows them to get into politics and continue to obtain more money and power. It&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to argue that they don&#39;t need more money or power if they came from that background without outright saying it because you know that is not the case.</p>

<p>Think about it. Why would such a talented person with so many prospects take a government job then? It isn&#39;t out of the kindness of their hearts. The government base salaries are nothing compared to the money they could be making elsewhere. But the fact is that government jobs provide other opportunities for power and money beyond that small amount.</p>

<p>If they were doing this out of the kindness of their hearts they wouldn&#39;t be joining the government. That is not the place for altruists and people wanting to make the world better. Instead they would make personal business reform and clean their family&#39;s money through better practices and investments and give back to the community.</p>

The YouTube censorship? Specifically designed groups designed to infiltrate and target groups like this? I mean the list goes on my friend, the world is waking up, the massive amount of leaks, how pizzagate became huge, you can only hide so much dirt under a rug before it lifts up the rug. Also it&#39;s never happened on this level either before, as of now, more humans are more awake than ever, and Clinton&#39;s wanted demise was higher than ever before. I mean you had crowds screaming lock her up, any other instances of that? Yea thought so, also stop complaining and spread info, with your head down Jesus </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember when i was 16 and my parents were asking me what i wanted to fo with my life and ad to make a choice for what to study.</p>

<p>At this point i was a huge conspiracy theorist and had just learned about Socialism and became class conscious. I really wanted to help change the world, abolish the secrecy and build a more socialist society.</p>

<p>So at this point i told my parents i wanted to go into politics and work towards becoming a big player in politics. My dads reply to that, literally verbatim was, &quot;how do you plan on supporting a family if you want to go into politics&quot;. pretty much insinuating that politicians make no money at all. Also he knows how corrupt and dirty politicians are even if they have a good heart.</p>

<p>Today i bug him about that comment constantly by mentioning the likes of the Clinton&#39;s. &quot;Hey dad, remember when you told me politicians make no money and i wouldn&#39;t be able to support a family if i went that route, well look at the Clinton&#39;s, life long politicians but somehow multi-millionaires&quot;.</p>

<p>He laughs and agrees with me that rich politicians are just corrupt as fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well who is going to hold them responsible? They govern the country. 
Everyone who goes against them gets removed from the major parties. They&#39;re so focused on protecting their own, and they get to make the laws different for themselves compared to average citizens. </p>

<p>So we find out one of them is embezzling? Doesn&#39;t matter one bit to all those making their money off of &quot;legal&quot; bribes. And again, they get to decide for themselves what counts as a &quot;legal&quot; bribe. </p>

<p>Both Reddit &amp; Facebook manipulate content; allow shills; collect your data &amp; know your preferences; allow you to distribute your ideas; limit your ideas; etc.</p>

<p>If Reddit would have just sued Correct the Record for tortious interference I think we&#39;d be in a lot better position to &#39;break up gridlock&#39;.</p>
