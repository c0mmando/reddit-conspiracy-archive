       One of the pieces got stuck in the whale's eye. Luckily we have three whales but 5 eyes now. That is why earthquakes occur. The semi-blind whale bumps into comets every once in a while resulting in disasters such as the fukushime tsunami disaster.

       Why do you care? It seems that more threads are created about the absurdity of flat earth than actual flat earth threads. If you were genuinely interested and not seeking confirmation bias you would research the topic.

       Proof the Earth is a sphere: 1. All astronomical bodies we can see with the naked eye are spherical: the moon, planets, the sun and stars. 2. The sun rises and sets. If the Earth were flat, the sun would shrink, and we would not have day or night. 3. You can see the shadow of the Earth on the moon during a lunar eclipse and at certain phases. The only shape that always produces a round shadow is a sphere. 4. Stars rotate around us. If the Earth were a flat disc, we would see the stars growing more distant, and they would never entirely move beyond our line of sight. If the stars are dipping under a disc-shaped Earth, you would have to explain why people on the other side of the world can still see them. 5. Certain stars can only be seen in the northern or southern hemispheres. Try calling someone in Australia. Ask them to take a photo of the night sky. Their stars are different. This is only possible on a spherical Earth. 6. Time zones are only possible on a spherical Earth. On a flat Earth, daylight would last the same amount of time everywhere. 7. In Scandinavia, night can last for 22 hours. This only makes sense on a spherical Earth. 8. It’s colder toward the poles, the further north or south you travel. Conversely, it tends to get warmer as you move closer to the equator. This only makes sense on a spherical Earth, as less sunlight reaches the upper or lower regions where the Earth curves away from the sun. 9. GPS can only work on a spherical Earth. 10. Satellite TV can only work on a spherical Earth. You can observe satellites with a store bought telescope, and you can see the International Space Station with the naked eye. 11. We have countless photos of a spherical Earth. It is statistically impossible to fake all of the photographic evidence, and commit tens-of-thousands of scientists who have worked for NASA, the European, Indian and Chinese space agencies, and private space agencies, to a world-wide conspiracy. Not to mention we have amateur astronomers who make the same observations on their own. It would also cost more to hide the truth than to simply go into space! 12. Ships at sea vanish from bottom to top. This is only possible on a spherical Earth. Don’t believe some crackpot’s YouTube videos. Go out to sea! Witness it for yourself! 13. You can see much further from a higher altitude. This only makes sense on a spherical Earth. Conversely, it is impossible to see things in the opposite hemisphere, whereas on a flat disc you should be able to see the Himalayas with the naked eye, or at the very least, with a telescope. 14. Airlines navigate using a spherical Earth model, which is why you can fly faster from New York to London, than say, from New York to Paris. 15. A flat Earth is not physically possible. Gravity pulls things equally in all directions, which is why every major astronomical body is spherical. If the Earth were flat, it would collapse back into a sphere. 16. You can see the Earth is a sphere from a high altitude or by simply looking out at sea. This is why the Ancient Greeks and Egyptians knew the Earth was a sphere. In fact, the Greeks correctly calculated the circumference of the Earth using nothing but two sticks and trigonometry. I have seen the curve of the Earth myself and you can too. Stand atop a high altitude overlooking the sea and turn your head from side to side. You can also use a straight ruler and line it up to the horizon

       You shoild format this better and save it in a doc that you can always cut and paste from.  So you can just slap this in every FE thread that shows up.

       Haha It's not even mine. I copy and pasted it from a youtube comment. I was just lazy as shit and didn't format it.

       I have it saved on a doc. I use it on most FE threads and usually mention that it isn't my work and that I got it from Youtube lol.

       Haha use it too. It's much easier than having to take out 2 or 3 minutes typing up some paragraph to a FE.

       I'm going to put a disclaimer going forward that it's not mine just so I don't try to steal credit.

       All the points in it are valid though. Let the Flat Earth people waste time trying to prove the statements wrong lol.

       As it has been explained to me by diehard FE's: The Sun, Moon and Stars are under the dome with us underneath all that...I think Eric Dubay said in one video that he's not really sure.

       I recently watched a video with Eric and he said he tries to stay away from guessing if we're in a dome or whatever. He's just trying to prove the earth has no curvature with observable math.

       I think you're correct, that he was talking about the
       <em>
        seemingly, always a side glancing trajectory
       </em>
       but that he wasn't
       <em>
        about dome or no dome
       </em>
       that he
       <em>
        just doesn't know
