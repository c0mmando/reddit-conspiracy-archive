<blockquote>
<p>There is no building that says “Establishment” on the door, but there is a century-old institution made up of wealthy and influential representatives of business, Wall Street, corporate law, academia and government. It is a creation of the elite ruling class to ensure their control over shaping policy for their own benefit. Their decisions result in funneling money – and, hence, power – into the hands of a small percentage of capitalists who exercise control over the political process. The elite have complete control over the media, so everything you see and hear has their stamp of influence on it. Among their members are select news anchors who routinely give scripted stories to influence public opinion, while they groom the next ‘chosen’ candidate for public office.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as “internationalists” and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>she pretty clearly says &quot;Al Qaida&quot;.  I&#39;m looking for a direct OBL quote. </p>

<p>The thing about Al Qaida is that I&#39;m willing to entertain the idea that the command level of the group is actually much more... diverse... than just islamic extremists.  Therefore, if she says &quot;Al Qaida attacked us on 9/11&quot;, it&#39;s still an accurate statement, we just have to remain open-minded as to who is actually a member of the Al Qaida command group...  For example, I could be convinced that Dick Cheney is a member of Al Qaida... or any number of people from past/present presidential administrations...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden">Bin Laden co founded Al Qaeda.</a>. As Carter&#39;s Foreign Secretary, CFR member Brzezinski was instrumental in the decision to offer CIA support and funds to the Mujahideen in the fight <a href="http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/52a1c37869bedd476f5aaefd-960/independent-1993%20(1">against the USSR</a>-1.jpeg). As we know that group morphed into the Al Qaeda that CFR -Bush/Cheney/Rumsfield/Cheney/Rice tell us attacked the UD on 9/11. Later down the line, we see  ISIS that  provided Brzezinski&#39;s protege Obama, justification for endless wars in the region. Now here&#39;s Gabbard.. signing the same song. Given her membership of the CFR, knowing the origins of the fable originate and are perpetuated by fellow members, are you really surprised?</p>

<p>She&#39;s 100% not legit.</p>

<p>She&#39;s on the CFR... name a single person to sit on that board that isn&#39;t a NWO shill. Based on what she &quot;does&quot; or &quot;says&quot;? What has she done that&#39;s so great &amp; amazing? &quot;I wonder if Kissinger likes cheese pizza.&quot; &quot;The US created ISIS.&quot; The only people that understand or believes these things, are the conspiracy community. She&#39;s playing us and telling us what we want to hear, to boost support. If she was a REAL threat to the power structure, she would&#39;ve been suicided. She reminds me of Bernie Sanders. Remember when Bernie promised he fight against the establishment &amp; had the whole nations support? How did that go? He folded in the first 5 minutes of pressure from the establishment, but everything he &quot;did&quot; and &quot;said&quot; lead us to believe the opposite, &amp; he didn&#39;t even sit on the fricken CFR. All I&#39;m saying is, that if you think she&#39;s any different from any other politician, time will prove you wrong. You don&#39;t just end up in powerful political positions by chance, your true owner always holds the leash. Politicians no longer look out for our best interests, &amp; haven&#39;t for a long time now, haven&#39;t you been paying attention? Democracy has been dead.</p>

<p>This is the definition of a witch hunt. </p>

<p>I generally look for information to support my ideas. I look at what she says and does, NOT what lists her name is on.</p>
