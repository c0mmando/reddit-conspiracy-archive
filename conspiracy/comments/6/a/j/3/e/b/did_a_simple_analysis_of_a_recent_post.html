<p>I <em>could</em> go on, and I have screenshots of the main ones for proof, but I won&#39;t bother. It&#39;s clear what&#39;s going on in this sub and has been since the influx of $40m for shilling efforts in the form of reformed CTR outfit now named ShareBlue.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just one group. They only appear to be a single group from the outside but there are groups within the group for sure.

<p>Easy. There are many groups that behave just like you said and fight it out.</p>

<p>In civilised countries we tend to boil them down to political parties and the hierarchies within. </p>

<p>To go with a US example, anyone claiming that the Republicans and Democrats are two sides of the same coin needs a long walk in the fresh air and a reality check.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a nasty &quot;TPTB&quot; pulling the strings. The world is much more complicated than that.

<p>In the case of the US, the 2 party system was intentionally put in place with the goal of controlling  the effects of faction. This is a form of manipulation which allows the masses to believe that they can influence political outcomes while TPTB actually just continue their own agenda. This explains how the parties can appear to be at odds while carrying on the agendas of the last administration. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a perfect system and the founding fathers were aware of the possibility of corruption. This system if corrupted also has a failsafe of gun ownership. The purpose of our right to bear arms is so that we might overthrow our oppressors be they foreign or domestic. </p>

<p>I think the point is that that group isn&#39;t really successful over the long term. There will always be people who have more power than others, but it isn&#39;t like there is some cabal deciding who will have power for the entire world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Yes, financial domination can be achieved by over extending loans but there are other ways to go about it too. Inflation and deflation of currencies can be used to strangle an economy. With all the control over monetary values and how much is printed you could buy corporations and manipulate global trade. Theres not a lot you couldn&#39;t do if you really wanted and people with that much power tend to wield it.</p>

<p>&quot;For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&quot;- David Rockefeller</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you give any examples of outside nations unduly influencing nation&#39;s exchange rate? The chaos inflation and deflation can cause is usually caused by nation&#39;s printing too much, and exacerbated by currency controls and spending reserves they take to prevent inflation. I don&#39;t see the groups that print money buying corporations, or influencing trade to their specific benefit. Maybe if you had any evidence you could give me a source, although previous experience makes suspect you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Greece is a perfect example of the debtor nations I was talking about, although it pushed it so far that in needed outside help just to be able to import food and oil, which it got generously from the ECB, IMF, and European Commision. </p>

<p>Do you not want a more politically and economically integrated world? It makes everyone wealthier and make wars pretty more difficult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that someone with the amount of money and influence we&#39;re talking about would be so obvious as to leave us with evidence like you&#39;re asking for. They have all of the tools I&#39;ve mentioned and many more. Like previously stated, they can control trade deals and leverage other countries to act on their behalf.

<p>&quot;And I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale.&quot; - Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>&quot;It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.&quot; -Henry Ford</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Greece is an example of financial manipulation but it&#39;s pretty interesting that the bank stepped in and took over. There&#39;s also the revolving door between banking and politics to take in to account. Apparently handling other peoples money qualifies as political experience.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t want is a one world government. Who would be in control of it? Looking at governments around the world, I don&#39;t see any good examples to model such a system after. Ya, global trade CAN be good but it&#39;s honestly hurt the US in a lot of ways and the US government allows it to continue and helps perpetuate the problematic side. Less war sounds good but it wouldn&#39;t truly vanish. If there is ever a time when governments can&#39;t go to war then they will manufacture one. War on drugs and terror are a couple of examples. Check out project bluebeam for a theory that seems likely in this scenario (would certainly explain what the Pheonix lights were all about). The current race baiting narrative we see in the US is another example. Without someone to fight we will be turned on eachother and wage wars on ourselves.</p>
