<p>I sincirely ask mods not to delete this theme for at least a day. This is not a commercial but an attempt to concentrate our efforts and gather people.</p>

<p>My story is that I have always had interest in religion, society, history etc. but never actually studied anything deeply before the last year when everything started to make sense somehow.</p>

<p>I now have an understanding of ancient myths, meaning of words a cryptic message in some of the holy books, gnosticism, numerology, science, kaballah, esoteric teachings, understanding of lesser and great work, alchemy and a lot of similair teachings.</p>

<p>For some reason it became very easy to me and I understood a lot of this information in a single attempt.</p>

<p>An entry point for me was actual Pizzagate (not the research) but occult part behind it which started to influence my research through Saturn and Moloch.</p>

<p>I have came through a long way since last 9 month when it first occured to me.</p>

<p>I have yesterday found another redditor who was influenced the same way and was &quot;forced&quot; to study the same stuff in last 9 month.</p>

<p>I believe that we could not be the only two here.</p>

<p>If you have been influenced by something which forced you to heavily study the occult knowledge and if you are on the path to gather wisdom please join my in the following subreddit:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/awakening_2016/">https://www.reddit.com/r/awakening_2016/</a></p>

<p>no commercials or anything, the only reason for it&#39;s creation is to study information in more effective way. I don&#39;t believe there would be more than a hunded guys who were influenced the same way. For now it is empty as I want only to gather everyone. We will continue our research there.</p>

<p>There should be more people like me and this guy from another thread. We should unite.</p>

<p>Thank you and I wait for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might be the &#39;&#39;right candidate&#39;&#39;. I had the worst year in my life and everything was filled with synchronicities. Something bad happened to a person that was mentally (energetically) attacking me, after I had a thought. i admit, I got fucking scared and stopped reading into the occult for two months. Everything became better after. I am into no magic spells and shit but more in understanding the spiritual science it bears, or at least that is what I think. I mention the year 2016 jokingly in my friend circles as the year we became aware of the simulation. I can&#39;t continue because my rabbit hole will become bottomless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 year ago I was a strict atheist and now I can&#39;t get enough of religious texts. Christianity Islam hinduism Buddhism as well as all the Pagan religions on earth (I live near Wales so I have studied druidism in an attempt to reach my local culture). I still don&#39;t believe in an bearded man in the sky, but this past year something has changed in me. When I read the book of genesis it all makes sense to me - when I read the Bible as a kid I was confused by it to say the least. But now, I can&#39;t help but learn about the religious texts because it seems to me, that they are all connected or have a common origin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from religious texts have you spent much time studying logic, logic structures and logical fallacies? These help you sift through the garbage easier. Read a sentence find the premise, figure out if there&#39;s evidence for it, yes then continue on, no it&#39;s garbage.</p>

<p>Take genesis, &quot;in the beginning ... god ...&quot; is there any evidence for god? Nope, so it&#39;s not a logically structured sentence. It&#39;s meant to fill in a gap in your brain but it offers nothing really than emotions. Even if there was evidence for such a being it&#39;s a piece of shit because it gives little children cancer so fuck it. If you could cure cancer and you walked through a children&#39;s cancer unit would you just let them suffer and die? Probably not unless you are a sick piece of shit, that&#39;s what god is except it&#39;s even worse. It gave them cancer in the first AND refuses to cure them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t really studied logic in the way you describe (I probably should do) but when I read religious texts I am always analysing them in a way that links with my world-view and I never take them literally. I understand where you&#39;re coming from about god however I think the entire concept of God was made up fiction to try and convince people they are always being watched. </p>

<p>This is why I prefer the Hindu and Greek God&#39;s because the religions describe what they do in a clear way, and then you realise that they aren&#39;t &quot;Gods&quot; so to speak, but different spirits of human emotion that drive our realities </p>

    <div class="md"><p>... not that I disagree but you seem a tad bit personal here.. </p>

<p>May I suggest looking elsewhere for the reason cancer hasn&#39;t been cured and you&#39;ll see there is definately a good and a bad.. </p>

<p>And YOUR definition of &quot;good&quot;.. has been doing a great job at turning around any religion or situation it has come to face with.. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be so blinded by hate, they want that.. </p>

<p>Do I believe in a physical god - no.
Their is a &quot;devil&quot; and &quot;god&quot; (dark/light) in all of us.. 
Make your choice wisely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>.. I&#39;m saying cancer wasnt created by some fictitious depiction of a &quot;god&quot;.. it&#39;s your governments that have twisted history in every aspect. 
Am I religious..? No.. Do I believe in a god..? No.. but many of your politicians support interesting religions.</p>

<p>This is the only thing that even makes me consider a god.. is that most of my politicians worship darker entities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes cancer is likely an anomaly in genetics and evolution. At least that&#39;s what the evidence currently says. I&#39;m not blaming cancer on a god, I&#39;m pointing out how ridiculous the idea of a good god is when something like cancer exists.</p>

<p>Just because the elite are religious nutbags doesn&#39;t mean I will be one. If there is anything else to their religion it might be extraterrestrials who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A little less than a year ago, I was coping with huge emotional turmoil; a depression that became suicidal. I attribute a lot of it to the fact that I was deep into philosophy at the time, but rather than committing suicide, my mind opened, and my ego dissipated completely. It felt like awakening out of a dream. You know that feeling you get, experientially, when you&#39;re in a dream (either good or bad) and you wake up out of it? But all that was happening was that <em>my</em> story, or narrative, of <em>my</em> life was completely silent for seemingly the first time in my conscious experience. Apparently, the mind dissipates in moments of &#39;awe&#39;, where we literally feel the beauty, which also makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Since that experience, I&#39;ve let go of every dream I&#39;ve ever had (largely due to the fact that my motive, prior to the awakening experience, was based solely on self-hatred or &#39;need&#39;), and I have been living a pretty isolated life, no job, living on savings, sort of &#39;loafing&#39; through life as Walt Whitman called it. But I&#39;ve let go of these dreams only because, once you experience that true letting go of ego and literally become the moment, you realize there&#39;s no going back. The body, it feels, senses that the awakened state (in which ego is no longer controlling reality) is fundamentally the true state of being. So, there is really no desire to go back to the conventional lifestyle. It&#39;s a tough process, though I&#39;ve learned, because I&#39;ve had to really come face to face with certain egoic aspects of who I&#39;d become that my conscience, or soul, or spirit (or whatever you want to call it) fundamentally opposes.</p>

<p>But, anyway, I went through this awakening experience and a few months later, Pizzagate unfolded. That didn&#39;t &#39;help&#39;. Brought back wicked fear and anxiety, sort of ineffable honestly. But that&#39;s what has pushed my inner journey. Like, once you see the truth, once you embody who you really are, you then see <em>as fact</em> that there&#39;s nothing to fear, ever. Fear is something we create in the mind, often when we feel we might lose something. But it isn&#39;t &#39;real&#39;. What&#39;s real is this moment, which is always OK. That guideline helped me get through the tough times of coping with the pizzagate revealings. And it&#39;s what pushed me to let go of my &#39;personal will&#39; more and more. I know there&#39;s nothing more beautiful than existing through the intimacy of heart, rather than of mind, and pizzagate has helped to recognize fear for what it really is. It brought fear to my face, and I had to stare it down.</p>

<p>I should also add that I&#39;ve had more thirst for knowledge in the spiritual department more than ever. I have sort of a craving for physics, too. I want to know how things work. And I think this happens for a reason. The mind is recognizing that everything is One thing, so if you understand the ins-and-outs of something very intimately, it is then able to relate it to all other aspects of experience. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just irony that awakening is a naturally and vitally curious process. Consciousness has been peering through the veil of &#39;me&#39;, the mind, the controller, and has massively limited its ability to experience being. So, it wants to know more. It wants to know itself more. But, yeah, a year ago I had literally no clue about spirituality whatsoever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m amazed how quickly this is growing as well. I always thought this was a post 2012 thing with all the &quot;Mayan Calendar End of the World&quot; racket that was going on back in 2010/11. But the real calendar story was clearly stating it was end of one era and a beginning of a new, some sort of an enlightenment era or eon I think. I was always into the conspiracy since Chariots of Gods or Raiders of the Lost Ark but you&#39;re right, the stuff that&#39;s been coming out and cultivating around in the last year ties everything together so well. I saw The Story Never Been Told mid-2016 and it completely changed my views on Nazis and the Western Civilization altogether. For me it then connected to Antartica via Flat Earth and hologram universe to ET reptilians living among us. It also makes me watch movies with a new fresh eye, I&#39;ve been watching a lot going back to oldtimers and everything is so up there it seems. Latest blockbusters especially the super hero franchise in my opinion draws heavily from esoterizm and the occult. I just watched Alien Covenant and all I can think of was the Annunaki all throughout the film because of the symbology. With this scepticism i also consider this is all a sham and somebody pushed the button in 2016 to confuse the shit out of people, at least the ones who investigate. Also, I can&#39;t really explain most of this stuff to everyone, not everybody comprehends or even cares about what&#39;s going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I began researching religion, society, and history deeply on the internet in April of 2016. So deeply that I was hospitalized for 9 days due to lack of sleep. I was diagnosed with mental disorders and it was the worst time in my life. But the research I was doing in April 2016 was the most incredible experience - I dove into hundreds of theories about religion, existence, prophets, space.. I became too obsessed and eventually went crazy. I cannot ever get to that level again, but I also had an awakening in 2016.</p>
