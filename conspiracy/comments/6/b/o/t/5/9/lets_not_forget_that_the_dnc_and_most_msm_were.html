       Meanwhile the Seth Rich narrative is being laughed at, because that would implicate the DNC in some pretty heavy shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's say the Russia narrative is right: good old John podesta falls for a phishing email and since the Russians hate Hillary they release the TRUE information to swing public opinion. Why are you against calling out true evil?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to have (real) information leaked on Trump, but we didn't get that. I don't understand why so many people literally support outright dishonesty and evil like the DNC cheating Bernie, cheating debates, all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course they were fucking pissed at the leaker. WHOEVER IT WAS COST THEM THE ELECTION. Through the Project Veritas videos we saw how DIRTY they can be. Why wouldn't they have someone killed in addition to voter fraud, election subversion, and taking over the MSM?
      </p>
      <p>
       And how do you draw eyes away from that narrative? You need a doosey. Something that the people who are keeping your girl out of trouble, oh shit, I mean the Intel agencies, will agree with. Let's say all 17(HA) of them. Something that will scare people. A big lie. Like that Russia has taken over the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just seems like a huge cover-up to me, but the worst case is I'm wrong. That still leaves the option that Trump got in with help from someone who hates his opponent more than they hate him.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR until I see proof of the Russia narrative in the same way I see proof of the DNC and MSM working together and lying, I believe Seth Rich was killed for leaking to WikiLeaks.

       You're right, and you can already see this happening.

       Look at the Trump-Russia classified info situation. Multiple officials have come out to say it's false. "The story as reported is false"

      <p>
       Yet, MSM twisted it so those that hate Trump say it's a coverup rather than the report is bogus.

       Great contribution. You should, like, open your own thread about it! I'd love to read it. Like I said, I also dislike Trump. This had nothing to do with the post, though. DNC still evil as fuck, and it seems like you're defending/deflecting for them. I guess that makes you as evil as Trump, lol. On its own I'd genuinely love to read about it, but as a response to the topic it's literally, "b-but.. the other guy...." No one cares. Your guys are evil, too.

       It's being laughted at because:
      </p>
      <p>
       *Nothing new was released right after a major story broke about Trump in the media
      </p>
      <p>
       *The source of the info, Wheeler walked back his statement to say that he was only repeating information given to him by Fox
      </p>
      <p>
       *Even if it is credible the connection to Hillary is circumstantial at best

       I believed this theory well before wheeler. I hate Trump as much as Hillary, but there's no direct proof of his shit (yet) like there is for Hillary. I do not think Hillary personally gave the order to kill Seth, or least there's no evidence to suggest it. Have fun applying your made up opinions to me, they don't fit.

      <p>
       So you're defending people who lie, cheat, and try to steal elections, because you think someone else stole the election from them? I think they're both shite, and I don't believe either one. I do, however, think Julian assange has left enough of a statement on the matter for me to take the hint. You don't have to agree, but you certainly assumed a lot of untrue shit for your well thought out breakdown.

       No, I'm addressing the "Hillary killed Seth" brigading that's going on on conspiracy today.  I assumed that's what you were talking about when you said the Seth Rich thing was being laughed at.  I agree the DNC was involved in some shady stuff regarding the media and giving Bernie a fair shot.  I don't think the fact that they were behaving in a shady manner in these regards means that anyone at the DNC had Seth killed.  That's all.   We just don't have any evidence to point to it.  It's all just based on motive and the DNC isn't the only party that might have a motive for killing him.

       You're assuming Assange is trustworthy.  Yes he has released a lot of verifiable information, but that doesn't mean he's not releasing information that only hurts the Democrats at this point.  There's plenty of reason to believe Assange might be a Russian asset.  He first sought refuge in Moscow and now he's in the embassy of a Russian ally.  He had his own show on Kremlin state sponsored media, RT.  He only seems to release leaks that damage politicians and segments of the parties that oppose Russian interests.  He doesn't release anything major on Trump despite Trump's White House being exceptionally leaky.   I don't know one way or the other, but there's enough for me to be highly suspicious of his motives.

       That's a fair assessment. I think you raise a good point in saying that I think assange is trustworthy. I do. I think that is probably where our opinions divide most. I don't trust the media whatsoever, and there's a lot who feel the exact same about assange.

       Either way, it's r/conspiracy, and they're both conspiracy theories. Lol. Only time will tell what the truth may be, but I'll remain skeptical of the major narrative just in case.

       I agree, but I lean more towards the idea that Wikileaks has not been in Assange's control since October 2016. Their twitter account has since been being manipulated to look pro-Russia/pro-Trump, in order to further discredit and distract from the absolutely scathing truths about the DNC and Hillary Clinton's entire operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But either way, who's more politicized than the MSM?? At least everything Wikileaks has published has been true, which 100% can not be said about the mainstream media, who have been known to intentionally mislead, cover up, and even outright lie to their audiences.

       Being that his freedom has depended on help from the Russians and continues to depend on help from a Russian allied country that is hostile to the US, I don't think it's that far fetched to speculate that they might have considerable leverage on him.  By working for RT, who gave him his own show, he was essentially on the Kremlin payroll.

       Of course there is no basis in reality for any of this. Just throw out the blame Russia idea and wait until it sticks. Its like you live in a bubble. 90% of the country knows the Russian angle is bullshit.

       No basis for reality?  You need to research the history of Julian Assange.  He first sought refuge in Moscow.

       This is not a new idea. The guy has never released leaks damaging to Russia. He claimed to have some once, and that he'd release them soon, but never did. He has also criticized the Panama papers, which showed the corruption of the Russian state.

       Jesus Christ you people have no shame. The private investigator fucking said he doesn't stand by anything be said. The family has pretty much begged you people to stop trying to use thier sons murder as the means of a political witch Hunt. The source the PI had was anonymous, but somehow that's okay when it's anti liberal, yet you all want the hard evidence of an ongoing FBI investigation and any anonymous source about Trump is deep state lies.
Also literally everyday on this sub is some long text post telling everyone to group think and disregard everything the evil media says about Trump. I wonder why.

       Blame the media. If they hadn't lied and gotten caught colluding with the DNC, people would be inclined to believe them. Now they're clearly willing to lie for political means, so their narrative means nothing anymore. Especially when it clearly defends their buddies at the DNC. I want DNC AND RNC to come crashing down. I'm fine starting with either, but your side fucked up first. Get the fuck over it. Your evil assholes let their private take leak all election. I can't wait for the RNC to do the same, but I'm not going to ignore the fucking plain in sight evil that has been laid out in front of us. Keep defending it by attaching Trump, it means nothing to me. Because YOUR side got caught doing EVIL shit I no longer trust them, plain and simple. You trust liars. You defend them. I don't defend Trump, a liar, and I don't defend almost anyone in MSM, DNC, RNC, or Hillary. I don't defend evil. I also clearly stated I could be wrong, and if I am I'll only be upset because the DNC will get away with rigging elections and Trump will get away with selling out to the Russians. All of the evil will get swept under the rug, AGAIN, because people like you have to take every attack at the system as an attachment against themselves personally. I know you wear blue, you made that clear. Now get the fuck out of the way so we can burn everything blue and red. It's time.

       You're right. We should ignore everyone else because you know more then them. It doesn't matter that you don't have any evidence to back your claims up, we should just trust you because you're so smart!

       What do you expect when the people in charge of the last case say they don't see a reason to pursue charges, though? Now we've all decided it's no big deal. It's what happens when you don't follow through on politicians doing illegal shit. It keeps going and becomes practically accepted.

       I do, however, agree that this is absolute bullshit and they should all be equally charged both in the court of public opinion and the court of law. No question about that one.

       Totally disagreed. She was a shit candidate who was plagued with scandals and every time people tried to deflect to other's misconduct. Then when people stayed on topic they get called Trump supporters. If she wasn't a lying, pay for playing, cheating cunt we wouldn't have had those issues. If they hadn't cheated Bernie we wouldn't be having this discussion. Yes, Trump sucks. But that doesn't defend Hillary's actions, she I'm sick of people acting like it does. I'd love for them to go after Trump hard on that, but unfortunately your girl already got a break and set the bar at "it's cool, use any server you want. We sent classified shit and it didn't matter."

       And your defense for this is "well now Trump is doing it." Great.

       its hard to take anything you say seriously when every line you have throws out TD propaganda points.

       hur dur news anchor says something stupid, CNN retracts his statement, he apologizes, then TD, 4chan, and the alt right get to parade that line around relentlessly. you have no shame or independent thought.

       That's the problem. I don't visit TD, I dislike Trump, and I happen to still see this as a reasonable conspiracy. You're so deep in the other side all you see is Trump supporters or people who agree with you.

       Nice ad hominems, bro. You've stated one important thing here: you think they're "Russian" talking points, I don't. That's really all there is to it, but you have to resort to attacking people personally because you can't stand someone simply disagreeing with you. That's a disgusting trait, imo. But hey, you do you. I'll keep being me. You certainly didn't say anything that would change my mind, and I'm a pretty open dude. You can repeat Russia all day, but it doesn't prove anything.

       Why did you respond to a random comment I left instead of the one I left you four hours ago? You're going out of your way pretty far to defend Hillary, and I notice you haven't brought a single thing to the conversation. You're just mad that I disagree with you and you're going out of your way to find shit to bitch about. You don't even explain yourself.

       Okay, thanks, guy. You're really making your points clear and winning hearts and minds out here without any refutation of the things I've said.

      <p>
       You haven't even made it clear WHY you disagree with me. All you've said is that you do disagree. Great. I've laid out why I believe my side in this thread. If you're not adding anything new, why comment?
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite frankly, no one gives a flying fuck what you think. They only care what you know, and the only thing you've shown you know is how to cry when people are saying things you don't like. Good for you.

       They can pretend the Russians hacked their servers until the reindeer come home, doesn't matter.  The DNC went into court and argued they are under no legal obligation to provide a neutral process.  The vast majority of the corporate media (I don't like msm because that legitimizes them) leans left, and so it is no surprise they would get behind this in lockstep.

       Again, I don't agree with Bernie's policies, but I didn't agree with Hillary or Trump, either. I do, however, think Bernie would have been easy to predict and defend against. I don't think the same of the other two. I'm glad you found someone you liked, but you're putting a lot of words in my mouth that I'm not saying.

       If the Mainstream Media were colluding with the DNC to rig the Democrat Primary, how can we trust them when it comes to covering the death of the whistleblower that exposed it or the platform that was used to expose it for that matter (Wikileaks/Julian Assange)?

       Of course there is no basis in reality for any of this. Just throw out the blame Russia idea and wait until it sticks. Its like you live in a bubble. 90% of the country knows the Russian angle is bullshit.

       So what happens if we negotiate a peace with Russia and China, and they help us deal with North Korea, is this a bad thing too?

       Nice ad hominems, bro. You've stated one important thing here: you think they're "Russian" talking points, I don't. That's really all there is to it, but you have to resort to attacking people personally because you can't stand someone simply disagreeing with you. That's a disgusting trait, imo. But hey, you do you. I'll keep being me. You certainly didn't say anything that would change my mind, and I'm a pretty open dude. You can repeat Russia all day, but it doesn't prove anything.

       The same liberal MSM that supported the Bush administration's lies about Afghanistan and Iraq, the Patriot Act et al?

       It's not a liberal or conservative issue. It's a propaganda issue wrought on by the deregulation an subsequent monopoly on media in this country.
