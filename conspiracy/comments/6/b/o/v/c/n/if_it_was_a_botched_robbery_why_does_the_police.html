<p>Hillary Clinton spoke about Rich on Tuesday morning, amid remarks in New Hamphire on gun violence.</p>

<p>&quot;Just this past Sunday, a young man, Seth Rich -- who worked for the Democratic National Committee, to expand voting rights -- was shot and killed in his neighborhood in Washington. He was just 27 years old,&quot; she said. &quot;Surely we can agree that weapons of war have no place on the streets of America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my problem with the &quot;She had him off&#39;d&quot; narrative:</p>

<p>Why leave evidence that would point back to them and aid investigators, unless some other party had Rich Shot and have no interest other than muddying the waters and introducing doubt? Maybe someone in the DNC did it, but not for the reasons espoused, ( like a personal vendetta ) or it was another party altogether.
It&#39;s increasing hard to imagine the Clinton foundation employing amateurs when they are already under the microscope especially considering their wealth and reach, while I imagine the DNC would have the Clinton foundation&#39;s resources at their disposal and would likely leave them to choose who to employ.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s more likely that if either group is guilty, the decision was taken and executed by a compartmentalized group within the organization that might have the implicit support of whoever is in charge ( they would be an invisible part of that organization ) but operates outside their purview to contain the possible collateral damage and fallout.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how a group like that would operate within any of the letter agencies and those agencies would be the most likely sources of those groups personnel.</p>

<p>And if that is the case, any investigation would see these people charged with the crime, as Hillary or whoever would have plausible deniability. Whoever is in charge might not even know Themselves if it was someone within their organization as they would never be part of the decision process or even have personally met the people involved. They might not even be aware the threat assessment group (TAG) exists within their organization, it&#39;s not like they&#39;ll be at the company picnic.</p>

<p>Something tells me that if this democrat couldn&#39;t be used to smear Clinton then people wouldn&#39;t give a shit.

I saw an almost gang fight in a gas station this week... over one guy(non gangster) looking at the other guy&#39;s face for too long.... he had a tattooed face (indicating gang affiliation).<br/>
The police have all the facts, like a video I guess... I don&#39;t have much info and I&#39;m just reminding you there&#39;s still a reasonable explanation <em>other</em> than leaker being assassinated.<br/>
WikiLeak&#39;s interest in the case makes it seem a lot like the latter... but that kind of senseless violence sure as fuck occurs in america all the time. I&#39;m not fucking kidding you.<br/>

<p>By definition, an attempted robbery is an unsuccessful one. They happen all the time.</p>

<p>If the perpetrators tried to mug him, but he fought back (signs of struggle per his family) and one of them shot him, it is very possible they would flee in a panic knowing that gunshots at ~4am <em>will</em> draw attention (which they did within minutes).</p>

<p>These scenarios happen. <a href="http://www.winonadailynews.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/two-sought-after-botched-robbery-over-weekend/article_2ce8b140-024f-5552-bf22-272189353f2e.html">Here&#39;s a recent botched robbery</a> where no property was stolen (it&#39;s just one example, I&#39;m sure there are plenty more).</p>

<p>Likely to obfuscate who the real leaker is. If WL has <em>any</em> source protecting integrity, they wouldn&#39;t be winking and nodding at the real source.</p>

<p>Just think about it, if you were a potential leaker, would you want WL/Assange &quot;hinting&quot;, &quot;implying&quot;, or &quot;insinuating&quot; that you were the leaker? Fuck that. Even if I was dead, I wouldn&#39;t want my family or partners at risk.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make any sense - Wikileaks saying anything at all puts this into play. It&#39;s not like potential future leakers all know that Seth Rich truly wasn&#39;t involved and will recognize Wikileaks&#39; action as an obfuscation tactic.</p>

<p>You bring up a good point. I think most people would agree with this.</p>

<p>This is why I said that if you believe he has <em>any</em> integrity as a person protecting his sources, he wouldn&#39;t be winking and nodding at the <em>real</em> source.</p>

<p>I, personally, believe WL works or has worked with Putin, but I don&#39;t believe Assange is cartoonish levels of evil. I give him the benefit of the doubt in that he is not endangering Seth Rich&#39;s family/partners with these &quot;hints&quot;. Otherwise, we&#39;d have to believe that he&#39;s willing to just throw his sources out there while pretending that he protects them.</p>

<p>To speculate why as he would do this, he may be trying to &quot;weed out&quot; potential leakers who don&#39;t trust him or who are fickle. There could be other reasons I haven&#39;t considered.</p>

<p>However, the fact of the matter is that he &quot;Wikileaks saying anything at all puts this into play.&quot; We can only speculate as to why, but I believe he has enough integrity to mean when he says that he protects his source and doesn&#39;t just throw them out there with &quot;hints&quot; and &quot;insinuations&quot;.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some kind of hypothetical situation. Gunshots will cause people to look out their windows. It will cause police to respond. It leads to witnesses and other loose ends.

<p>Likely to obfuscate who the real leaker is. If WL has any source protecting integrity, they wouldn&#39;t be winking and nodding at the real source.
Just think about it, if you were a potential leaker, would you want WL/Assange &quot;hinting&quot;, &quot;implying&quot;, or &quot;insinuating&quot; that you were the leaker? Fuck that. Even if I was dead, I wouldn&#39;t want my family or partners at risk.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve thought from the start.  Assange is trying to say the dead guy did it to stop the FBI/DNC from looking any further.  &quot;case closed; no need to look for the leaker any more&quot;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>My hands and wrists are sore from painting and typing all day, but I agree with you, and this is another comment explaining my position, if you&#39;ve seen it, sorry, ignore please. </p>

<p>Why leave evidence that would point back to them and aid investigators, unless some other party had Rich Shot and have no interest other than muddying the waters and introducing doubt? Maybe someone in the DNC did it, but not for the reasons espoused, ( like a personal vendetta ) or it was another party altogether.</p>

<p>It&#39;s increasing hard to imagine the Clinton foundation employing amateurs when they are already under the microscope especially considering their wealth and reach, while I imagine the DNC would have the Clinton foundation&#39;s resources at their disposal and would likely leave them to choose who to employ.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s more likely that if either group is guilty, the decision was taken and executed by a compartmentalized group within the organization that might have the implicit support of whoever is in charge ( they would be an invisible part of that organization ) but operates outside their purview to contain the possible collateral damage and fallout.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how a group like that would operate within any of the letter agencies and those agencies would be the most likely sources of those groups personnel.</p>

<p>And if that is the case, any investigation would see these people charged with the crime, as Hillary or whoever would have plausible deniability. Whoever is in charge might not even know Themselves if it was someone within their organization as they would never be part of the decision process or even have personally met the people involved. They might not even be aware the threat assessment group (TAG) exists within their organization, it&#39;s not like they&#39;ll be at the company picnic.</p>

<p>did your read any of those links? Those were just the top ones that show up on google. Their narratives are all similar to this one. Im not going to say theres zero chance of assassination BUT until there is, Im saying just a coincidental robbery gone wrong.</p>

My friend whos an avid believer of the assassination theory sent me the police report(which I dont have anymore but he found it online somewhere) and its practically blank so I guess that does give some credence to the theory. I guess I just see this as a very hard narrative to convince people he was assassinated. Like JFK or even Oswald himself, theres soooooo many people and motives that all point to the same thing where as with this, I dont see anything connecting really.</p>

If they didn&#39;t steal anything and you don&#39;t have a confession, all you know is 2 guys murdered another guy. It&#39;s rushing to a conclusion that itself is unproven. No facts point out it was an attempted robbery besides you saying people get robbed. You can also say people get murdered. It&#39;s not uncommon. With the facts that are know I wouldn&#39;t rule out a botched robbery, but I wouldn&#39;t call it a botched robbery either.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s called botched.   Botched robbery was their original speculation for motive because they could not find any other motive.   They haven&#39;t changed it because they have not found any evidence supporting anything else.  The ramblings of Bernie bros and Trump tards in conspiracy forums does not count as evidence.  </p>

I also think that they probably <em>have</em> investigated.  Questioned friends, family and coworkers and <em>found nothing,</em> so they have stuck with their original conclusion.  If your buddy Assange has real evidence of motive, and not just sly insinuation, maybe he should turn it over to Metro DC PD, and that would give them the probable cause they need to get warrant for the DNC.

<p>The simple facts are two guys murdered another guy. That&#39;s all you know. That&#39;s what the investigation is. Maybe after you get a lead on the suspects you could find out more of what happened. Until then all you know is two guys murdered another guy. </p>

<p>After interviewing his family and friends. Asking everybody he knows if he had any enemies, anybody wanting to kill him. This is standard detective work. Just because somebody&#39;s dead and they still have all their belongings and it&#39;s in DC apparently means that you are a victim of a botched robbery. Why would the police do their job when they can just say &quot;nothing to see here move along.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, the DC cops just blank face when asked about this. And his family is probably angered at the complete lack of investigation, blatant coverup with loss of evidence and a cop/likely shooter with no bodycam being first on the scene, or the MedAnon who sounded pretty legit and operated on him. TBH they are probably frightened. Do you think they just accept the &quot;It was a simple robbery, they took nothing, but we just can&#39;t let you have his laptop, we are so very sorry for your loss, we gave it our best go, hope no more tragedies befall you&quot; reach around from the corrupt police?</p>

Im completely fine with the idea that he leaked emails about 7 DNC officials (none of whom were hillary or podesta) because thats not even that important since those emails contained nothing about pizza, Bernie, or anything it seems really. You need to convince us that Seth had something worth killing him for, as well as who killed him.

    <div class="md"><p>For all TPTB&#39;s machinations and technology and guns -- and your scoffing -- the fact that they attach so much importance to controlling public perception imparts the extent to which they respect and fear its power.</p>

<p>The public is toothless when they feel, as individuals, that they&#39;re acting alone.  That&#39;s why you don&#39;t see anyone rioting for Manning, Snowden and Assange -- the media are controlling the perception, making them figures of controversy (not to mention they&#39;re still alive -- unless that&#39;s a controlled perception as well).  In such conditions, if you decide to take meaningful action, you aren&#39;t assured of anyone having your back or of your sacrifice having any real consequence.</p>

<p>But to know without ambiguity or controversy that your leaders are complicit in murder-- and <em>knowing that everybody knows it</em>-- takes it to a whole new level.  You would know that everyone is questioning their pillars of trust and breaking free of the spell that the media has over them.  And then you realise you know that noone would reproach you for snapping the neck of one of these gangsters, who&#39;s necks break as easily as anyone else&#39;s -- you would not then be an unsung hero rotting in a jail cell who&#39;s motives are lied about, but just the opposite -- and people would fight over who gets to draw first b lood.</p>

<p>The reason mafia methods gain so much traction is that they&#39;re able to isolate individuals, make them feel that they&#39;re acting alone against many who are organized around a common purpose (which is true).  Change that, and the rest is easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ditto. This, as I&#39;ve said before is my problem with the Assassin theory. My hands and wrists are sore from painting and typing all day so I&#39;ll just past my other comment here:</p>

<p>Why leave evidence that would point back to them and aid investigators, unless some other party had Rich Shot and have no interest other than muddying the waters and introducing doubt? Maybe someone in the DNC did it, but not for the reasons espoused, ( like a personal vendetta ) or it was another party altogether.</p>

<p>It&#39;s increasing hard to imagine the Clinton foundation employing amateurs when they are already under the microscope especially considering their wealth and reach, while I imagine the DNC would have the Clinton foundation&#39;s resources at their disposal and would likely leave them to choose who to employ.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s more likely that if either group is guilty, the decision was taken and executed by a compartmentalized group within the organization that might have the implicit support of whoever is in charge ( they would be an invisible part of that organization ) but operates outside their purview to contain the possible collateral damage and fallout.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how a group like that would operate within any of the letter agencies and those agencies would be the most likely sources of those groups personnel.</p>

<p>And if that is the case, any investigation would see these people charged with the crime, as Hillary or whoever would have plausible deniability. Whoever is in charge might not even know Themselves if it was someone within their organization as they would never be part of the decision process or even have personally met the people involved. They might not even be aware the threat assessment group (TAG) exists within their organization, it&#39;s not like they&#39;ll be at the company picnic.</p>

<p>If something happened to spook the robbers and they ran before they could get anything that&#39;s another story, but the description does not say that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>well what did you mean by this then? I thought you were referring to something else too.</p>

<p>did your read any of those links? Those were just the top ones that show up on google. Their narratives are all similar to this one. Im not going to say theres zero chance of assassination BUT until there is, Im saying just a coincidental robbery gone wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not plausible. Its not likely. If you actually really do believe that he is the leaker then your not Media Matters. Your just a fucking moron. I actually live in a city where the possibility of getting robbed is a reality. People do not get shot for running. They get shot for fighting back. Which, based on the locations of the bullets, and the fact that there was no report of muzzle burn(which would indicate the shots were point blank) is not possible. </p>

<p>I guess it is plausible, but it is incredibly strange that Seth&#39;s wallet was not taken at the very least. </p>

It&#39;s rather unlikely he had his laptop on his person, and even so if he tried to run he wouldn&#39;t get far.
