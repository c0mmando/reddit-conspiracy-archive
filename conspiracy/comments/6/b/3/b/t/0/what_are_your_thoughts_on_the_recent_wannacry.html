       I fell victim to this ransomware myself. There have been over 100 payments made to the 3 BTC wallet addresses, and yet not a single report from anyone that paid the ransom (neither "I paid and got my data decrypted or "I was cheated out of my money"). I've spent over 30 hours looking for a single report from a victim that has paid the ransom, no luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Set that aside, do you think it could be an attempt to divert our attention from something even bigger? Thoughts?

       I don't have much of an opinion on the whole ordeal outside of the fact that I think the MSM may try to turn this away from the NSA and its mistake and focus it on WikiLeaks somehow.

       Monday's just around the corner, I believe this thing will spread further when people get back to work. Media's all over it already and this seems to be a number one story in many countries. I also suspect that this ransomware might have a different, hidden agenda such as collecting information for example. Hackers could also gain full control over infected computers at a later time and do whatever they please..

       Yet another conversation about civilian transparency on the internet? I mean, what's really going to stop them from making literally everything we do online recorded automatically, more so than it already is?
      </p>
      <p>
       When will we need to register social security numbers with our computers and devices? That could happen. And I don't think it'll raise a red flag for most people, but I could likely be wrong.

       I would say that the scale and impact of this attack has one good side to it, which is raising people's awareness about how vulnerable everyone is to potential threats such as this one.

       Looks like a classic case of distraction to me. Instead of bombing a third world country like we used to do, we just cyber-bomb the world. Probably too many questions about Comey and Russians in the media.

       This exploit could only be effective in environments with very lazy IT security. Any IT security department not keeping their company's infrastructure patched is just asking for this kind of problem.

       Yep. First thing I did was remote into our office and verify all of our workstations had received the latest patches from our update server. Even though I knew they had, news like this always sends that shiver of fear down the spine. I feel bad for all of the admins mired in this mess.

       I feel for them too. I've lost plenty of data as well that is basically unrecoverable. I'm most sorry for the patients that couldn't receive proper healthcare because numerous hospital systems went down. I read about one case of a heart surgery that had to be cancelled/postponed. This attack put some people's lives at risk, serious, serious stuff.

       If the attackers are ever identified and captured, I doubt they will ever see daylight again. Set aside the finacial damage they've caused, they messed up a number of public organizations, governments and put peoples lives at risk. And it's been only 3 days since the attack. Wait till people get back to work and launch vulnerable machines - this is far from being over.

       Assuming this wasn't a distraction created by political entities, I would put money on the culprits trying to find a deep dark hole to hide in. They probably did not intend to get this many intelligence agencies hunting them down.

       I think it could be a couple of things. Either a distraction to something else (my first thoughts upon seeing the news was about the incident in Rome that was not getting any news coverage or any mention on any of the main UK news channels for some bizarre reason yet it was being picked up by media outlets)
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/12/emergency-services-respond-explosion-outside-post-office-rome/">
        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/12/emergency-services-respond-explosion-outside-post-office-rome/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there could be other stories that were buried but this was the first thing that came to mind for me as I was trying to find out more information about the incident (I have friends holidaying there)  when the cyber attack hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or it could be another way for the Tories to force privatisation on the NHS. Wait until they win the election and see them use this as an excuse for privatisation, saying some bollocks about how it will "safeguard the NHS from further attacks".
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do find this story slightly bizarre. The 22 year old hacker who claims to have found the Kill switch for the attack says we can expect another one tomorrow (Monday) morning and "we won't be able to stop it".
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/14/uk-could-suffer-another-major-cyber-attack-on-monday-6636082/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       1) how did he's know where to find the kill switch? Is he responsible?
2) that's some pretty specific timing information, what does he know that we don't?
      </p>
      <p>
       Apologies if this is a bit jumbled. Currently fighting off a skull crusher of a headache. I hope I kind of make sense it what I was trying to get across.

       First of all, sorry about your headache, I feel for you, since I've suffered a crippling one myself yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen a reasonable amount of coverage on the Rome incident in various media, I think if this is a distraction, it must be something much bigger than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NHS narrative prevailed in the first hours after the attack, but eventually even Theresa may stressed out the attack wasn't targetted at NHS, so this narrative changed pretty fast as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the hacker that found the exploit, I think I might have an explanation for this as well (I am keeping an eye on a few twitter accounts associated with hacking, fighting malware etc.). The most basic explanation is that on Monday morning people will get back to work and launch vulnerable computers that will be infected and the ransomware will spread rapidly with their help. As for the killswitch, it's unclear to me how he found it, but I've read reports that a new version of the ransomware has been released that doesn't have a killswitch enabled. This is my opinion only, but based on these facts I think it's unlikely that the guy who found the killswitch is the one responsible..

       I just found the Rome thing really strange. Something like that would normally get a ticker tape "breaking news" banner at the bottom of the screen, even if it never gets a mention again but it didn't even get that. I made a post about it on here too but nobody replied to it. When a story breaks I tend to go straight for here or other conspiracy sites to verify it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I know next to nothing about hacking. The back to work on Monday argument does make sense I guess.

       Initially I thought the same of the Rome incident. Apparently it turned out to be a not very sophisticated, home-made explosive that thankfully didn't harm anyone. Authorities seem to think local anarchists might be responsible. I don't know much more than that, since I've been focused on the recent ransomware attack throughout the weekend though.

       If you're running Windows so you can play games then you deserve it.  Windows is a toy operating system. Nothing critical should run on it.  There are plenty of Unix based systems you can use.  Try Linux mint if you're a user,  and centos if you're a company.  Otherwise you will always be more vulnerable to this kind of shit.

       Seriously? You're saying that someone deserves to get screwed solely because of an OS choice? What's wrong with choosing Windows for the purpose of playing games, do all gamers deserve to get screwed by malicious software? I use Windows because I need Windows-based software for work. And I also play games occasionally when time allows. I don't see anything wrong with that.

       I think the threat was overblown, as all similar threats of malware have been in the past. I think MS Windows should use a kitchen sieve as their emblem. I think malware is mainly a threat to those who don't practice safe computing, not to those who fail to update the OS or fail to use a virus checker.

       Over $30000 as of now and nothing collected. I considered myself an aware PC user until just recently. I've employed a range of anti-malware tools, had an active antivirus, used a popular adblocker, haven't visited any shady websites, haven't received any suspicious e-mails, haven't installed any new software in a long while and yet fell victim to the attack, only because I have not cared to update my Windows for a couple of months. Let this be a lesson to everyone.

       Monday's just around the corner, I believe this thing will spread further when people get back to work. Media's all over it already and this seems to be a number one story in many countries. I also suspect that this ransomware might have a different, hidden agenda such as collecting information for example. Hackers could also gain full control over infected computers at a later time and do whatever they please..
