<p>I admit that I went and double checked, but you really didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have much of an opinion on the whole ordeal outside of the fact that I think the MSM may try to turn this away from the NSA and its mistake and focus it on WikiLeaks somehow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it could be a couple of things. Either a distraction to something else (my first thoughts upon seeing the news was about the incident in Rome that was not getting any news coverage or any mention on any of the main UK news channels for some bizarre reason yet it was being picked up by media outlets) 
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/12/emergency-services-respond-explosion-outside-post-office-rome/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/12/emergency-services-respond-explosion-outside-post-office-rome/</a></p>

<p>Obviously there could be other stories that were buried but this was the first thing that came to mind for me as I was trying to find out more information about the incident (I have friends holidaying there)  when the cyber attack hit.</p>

<p>Or it could be another way for the Tories to force privatisation on the NHS. Wait until they win the election and see them use this as an excuse for privatisation, saying some bollocks about how it will &quot;safeguard the NHS from further attacks&quot;. </p>

<p>But I do find this story slightly bizarre. The 22 year old hacker who claims to have found the Kill switch for the attack says we can expect another one tomorrow (Monday) morning and &quot;we won&#39;t be able to stop it&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/14/uk-could-suffer-another-major-cyber-attack-on-monday-6636082/">http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/14/uk-could-suffer-another-major-cyber-attack-on-monday-6636082/</a></p>

<p>1) how did he&#39;s know where to find the kill switch? Is he responsible?
2) that&#39;s some pretty specific timing information, what does he know that we don&#39;t?</p>

<p>Apologies if this is a bit jumbled. Currently fighting off a skull crusher of a headache. I hope I kind of make sense it what I was trying to get across. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, sorry about your headache, I feel for you, since I&#39;ve suffered a crippling one myself yesterday. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a reasonable amount of coverage on the Rome incident in various media, I think if this is a distraction, it must be something much bigger than that.</p>

<p>The NHS narrative prevailed in the first hours after the attack, but eventually even Theresa may stressed out the attack wasn&#39;t targetted at NHS, so this narrative changed pretty fast as well.</p>

<p>As for the hacker that found the exploit, I think I might have an explanation for this as well (I am keeping an eye on a few twitter accounts associated with hacking, fighting malware etc.). The most basic explanation is that on Monday morning people will get back to work and launch vulnerable computers that will be infected and the ransomware will spread rapidly with their help. As for the killswitch, it&#39;s unclear to me how he found it, but I&#39;ve read reports that a new version of the ransomware has been released that doesn&#39;t have a killswitch enabled. This is my opinion only, but based on these facts I think it&#39;s unlikely that the guy who found the killswitch is the one responsible..</p>

<p>I just found the Rome thing really strange. Something like that would normally get a ticker tape &quot;breaking news&quot; banner at the bottom of the screen, even if it never gets a mention again but it didn&#39;t even get that. I made a post about it on here too but nobody replied to it. When a story breaks I tend to go straight for here or other conspiracy sites to verify it. </p>

<p>To be honest, I know next to nothing about hacking. The back to work on Monday argument does make sense I guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the threat was overblown, as all similar threats of malware have been in the past. I think MS Windows should use a kitchen sieve as their emblem. I think malware is mainly a threat to those who don&#39;t practice safe computing, not to those who fail to update the OS or fail to use a virus checker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over $30000 as of now and nothing collected. I considered myself an aware PC user until just recently. I&#39;ve employed a range of anti-malware tools, had an active antivirus, used a popular adblocker, haven&#39;t visited any shady websites, haven&#39;t received any suspicious e-mails, haven&#39;t installed any new software in a long while and yet fell victim to the attack, only because I have not cared to update my Windows for a couple of months. Let this be a lesson to everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you never said it.</p>

<p>I admit that I went and double checked, but you really didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have much of an opinion on the whole ordeal outside of the fact that I think the MSM may try to turn this away from the NSA and its mistake and focus it on WikiLeaks somehow.</p>

<p>Either way, there media will do something with it to ruin something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Monday&#39;s just around the corner, I believe this thing will spread further when people get back to work. Media&#39;s all over it already and this seems to be a number one story in many countries. I also suspect that this ransomware might have a different, hidden agenda such as collecting information for example. Hackers could also gain full control over infected computers at a later time and do whatever they please..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet another conversation about civilian transparency on the internet? I mean, what&#39;s really going to stop them from making literally everything we do online recorded automatically, more so than it already is?</p>

<p>When will we need to register social security numbers with our computers and devices? That could happen. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll raise a red flag for most people, but I could likely be wrong.</p>
