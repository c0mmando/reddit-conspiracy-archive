       So I was talking to a coworker who is a disney freak and somehow it got brought up that the most exclusive members will rent out the secret rooms inside the park and have sex parties in them. I just want to know if anyone else has heard of such stories and can add on to see if this is real or not lol

       in 2008 i worked at a local nightclub attached to a kids party/play place; both owned by same guy. at night women we picked up would get taken in the playplace to have some fun. its not like that stuff got cleaned before start of business next day. If it happened in that small town and the appeal of fucking in an area meant for kids to play in was there, its definitely in the minds of the sick elite that would pay top dollar for the novelty im sure.

       Yeah exactly but those private hotel rooms would be hidden on rides. Theres a bunch all around the park i know there one inside the castle and one above pirates of the Caribbean for sure.

       Not a good idea, since you just posted evidence of premeditation. It would be unlawful and dangerous to fly a drone around a Disney park.

       You can't rent the room in the castle (supposedly). Disney claims they save it for prize winners. I suppose if you have enough money though..

       <p>
        In the early 1960s as construction of New Orleans Square was proceeding, Walt Disney decided he needed a bigger entertaining facility for various VIPs that came to the park.
        <strong>
         He already had an apartment above the Fire Station on Main Street, U.S.A.
        </strong>
        , but it was too small to host elaborate events. Walt decided to place the suite in New Orleans Square, set back from the hustle and bustle of the park.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In Disney theme parks, the utilidor system is a system of some of the world's largest utility tunnels, mainly for Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in Florida. The utilidors, short for utility corridors, are a part of Disney's "backstage" (behind-the-scenes) area. They allow Disney employees ("cast members") to perform park support operations, such as trash removal, out of the sight of guests to avoid ruining the illusion that is being created.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For many years, a basketball half-court existed inside the structure above the coaster, near the top of the mountain, where the mountain climbers could play between climbs. As internal access to the mountain was locked for safety reasons, the court was accessible only to the climbers. The court was relocated slightly during the installation of the Tinkerbell flight equipment prior to the 50th anniversary celebration; the hoop and playing area remain intact. There is a cast member break room inside the mountain at the base. The court is said to still be there today by many cast members and the mountain's climbers.

       Disney World is full of hidden things. For instance, under the Magic Kingdom I'm pretty sure there is a massive underground facility where they supposedly put all the stuff for floats... And Walt's frozen body.

       I just want to say for the record im not trying to say disneyland is having sex parties but club 33 members or people with a lot of money and a weird fettish will rent these rooms for like $25,000 and then have an orgy in them while families are all over having a good time. Thats just wild to me!

       yea, true. Disney himself was involved in mind control and even now all the little pop stars begin their weird, MKULTRA careers as mouseketeers .

       Disney fans hate its existence. 
example,,, It is shameful to write a book of lies about someone who is dead and unable to defend their name. Nobody would have dared write this during Mr.Walt Disney's lifetime because he could have sued them for liable. Fortunately one of the ones who loved him the most, his daughter, did defend him against this trash. Sadly she's no longer with us either. This author should be ashamed of himself. Fortunately there are plenty of TRUE accounts of his life to make up for this mess.''
       <br/>
       That's all anyone has to question the book's integrity.
       <br/>
       I was impressed with it's lack of opinion and solid documentation of the experiences of those who knew and worked with him..

       I would guess this is two separate stories.  To get into Club 33 you need to be a very heavy hitter. No doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I imagine if you were a heavy hitter and had access to these rooms you might bring along a high priced whore. That would not be surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Disney supplying the whores? No way. There are plenty of folks in Vegas and LA for that. Plenty of private concierges who will facilitate all that and keep casinos and hotels at arms length.

       It's been mostly dismantled/404ed, but there was a site with some crayon drawings made an alleged child trafficking victim. There was a bit about being forced to dress as Alice in Wonderland in Disneyland... and some sort of VR headset made by Disney.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I was trafficked to the USA, to Bohemian Grove where I was drugged &amp; raped by the Rev BILLY GRAHAM – Richard Nixon’s pal, in a pink bubble room. I was also made to dress up like a teddy bear and play hide, seek &amp; rape. I also witnessed the ritual murder of a person by politicians dressed up in robes. I was taken via Sydney airport, in a crate like an animal. On the way home I was drugged, raped and beaten at an exclusive, after hours, pedo gathering at Disneyworld. Yes, Walt Disney was a pedo. Why do you think the Mickey Mousketeers go nuts and shave their heads? Why did pedo ‘Whacko Jacko’ build a Neverland based on Disneyland?"

       I heard Walt was a racist boy loving twisted man, so it makes sense if that's the agenda he's trying to push. He'd create a land made to lure children to his place. I was watching this video on mk ultra and child sex trafficking and this girl who lived through that lifestyle said they'd use virtual reality on the kids while being raped and molested and they had Disney logos all over the programs they used.

        In the early 1960s as construction of New Orleans Square was proceeding, Walt Disney decided he needed a bigger entertaining facility for various VIPs that came to the park.
        <strong>
         He already had an apartment above the Fire Station on Main Street, U.S.A.
        </strong>
        , but it was too small to host elaborate events. Walt decided to place the suite in New Orleans Square, set back from the hustle and bustle of the park.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In Disney theme parks, the utilidor system is a system of some of the world's largest utility tunnels, mainly for Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in Florida. The utilidors, short for utility corridors, are a part of Disney's "backstage" (behind-the-scenes) area. They allow Disney employees ("cast members") to perform park support operations, such as trash removal, out of the sight of guests to avoid ruining the illusion that is being created.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For many years, a basketball half-court existed inside the structure above the coaster, near the top of the mountain, where the mountain climbers could play between climbs. As internal access to the mountain was locked for safety reasons, the court was accessible only to the climbers. The court was relocated slightly during the installation of the Tinkerbell flight equipment prior to the 50th anniversary celebration; the hoop and playing area remain intact. There is a cast member break room inside the mountain at the base. The court is said to still be there today by many cast members and the mountain's climbers.
