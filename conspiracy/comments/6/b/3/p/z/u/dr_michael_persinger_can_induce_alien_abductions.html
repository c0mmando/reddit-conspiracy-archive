<p>Susan Blackmore states: “Suddenly, prospects of magnetic mind control seem an awful lot worse than the idea of being abducted by imaginary aliens”. The history of Michael Persinger, the scientist around whose work her article is based (“Alien abduction: The inside story”, 19 November) bears this out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Persinger was employed by the US national security establishment to develop behaviour-modifying electromagnetic weapons under project “Sleeping Beauty”. He came to the attention of the defence industry after he published a paper entitled “Possible cardiac driving by an external rotating magnetic field” in 1973. Captain Paul Tyler, the Director of the US Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, wrote in 1986 of a technique employed by the national security establishment to disrupt “the electrical signal in cardiac muscle”, to produce “complete asystole with a resultant fatal outcome”.</p>

<p>With knowledge of Persinger’s involvement in this field, his role in “alien abduction” research could perhaps be assessed in a different light.</p>

I never heard of him, but just found this.<br/>
&#39;&#39;The name Hendricus G. Loos does not belong to a person, its a fictitious name. Perhaps the person working behind this name is Professor Ross Adey , who qualified in Medicine from Australia, then came to Oxford University to study brain physiology . Then he joined University of California in 1954, later joined the Brain Research Institute in 1961. He mainly studied the effects of ELF &amp; microwaves on human brain and nervous system. He developed several devices for remote mind control and manipulation of nervous system which were later patented in US. There could be a few other such professionals and scientists, who developed the Mind Control devices under a single fictitious name &#39;Dr Hendricus G. Loos&#39;, actually working for DARPA or CIA, so as not to attract the attention of the Media or investigators.&#39;&#39;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence does not fit this hypothesis at all. The alien abduction phenomenon has been part of the human experience for a long, long time. It occurs with indigenous people in times far separated from the modern MK ultra programs. </p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t explain a multitude of phenomenon related to the abduction phenomenon: Multiple witnesses, physical evidence such as implants with exotic metals of the high strangeness that comes after such encounters. </p>

<p>Military abductions are certainly a thing and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they used the cover of the alien abduction syndrome to conceal their agenda. </p>

<p>But not, MK ultra does not in any way explain the entire abduction phenomenon. and That&#39;s from a real assessment of the facts not from reading some articles on the internet. </p>

<p>Just copying and pasting something from my website:</p>

<p>In 1985 CNN did a special report on radio frequency weapons. They hired an engineer who built an “RF Mind Interference” machine based on Soviet schematics. The machine successfully transmitted images into a CNN reporter’s mind. The stunned engineer said that, given three weeks time, he could scale up the machine to use on a whole town, causing them to do things against their better judgement, see and hear things that weren’t there, etc. The pentagon said it was too sensitive a subject to comment on. Remember, these effects were achieved by civilians over 30 years ago! One can speculate that they’ve made great advances in the past decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first heard about this group while looking up information the Satanic Temple organization (yes those atheists who tried to put a statue of Baphomet in Oklahoma). I found some information claiming that Lucien Greaves, the leader of the temple, is actually named Doug Mesner. This Doug Mesner is connected to the same foundation. In a Vice interview, he talks about false memory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found instead was a twisted subculture of licensed therapists, and their clients, who subscribe to a pseudoscientific belief in “dissociative amnesia”: The theory that some events—particularly sexual abuse—can be so uniquely traumatic that the conscious mind cannot comprehend it, and thus those memories are “repressed.” This school of “therapy” breeds conspiracy theory and literally indoctrinates clients into false beliefs in a Satanic threat.</p>

<p>...So one of my own goals is to destroy this harmful pseudoscientific practice, and dispel the myth of an international Satanic conspiracy. </p>

Brion Gysin&#39;s tale of developing an alpha wave induction machine is fascinating.<br/>
&#39;&#39;&quot;Had a transcendental storm of colour visions today in the bus going to Marseilles. We ran through a long avenue of trees and I closed my eyes against the setting sun. An overwhelming flood of intensely bright colors exploded behind my eyelids: a multidimensional kaleidoscope whirling out through space. I was swept out of time. I was out in a world of infinite number. The vision stopped abruptly as we left the trees. Was that a vision? What happened to me?&quot;</p>

<p>Extract from the diary of
Brion Gysin
December 21, 1958<br/>

An amazing 1962 book, way ahead of its time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly know it as a foundation that exists to discredit abuse victims - especially those with dissociation disorder. That&#39;s how the information came into my life on a personal level, because these things touch my life personally. Nothing angers me more than the railroading victims get from the psychiatric community, media and society at large. This foundation went a long way to cover the tracks of abusers and cement in the mind of the public that these things don&#39;t Actually happen.</p>
