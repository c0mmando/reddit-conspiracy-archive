        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The increasingly popular show, Rick and Morty, has included a large amount of references to a specific Mcdonalds Sauce in their latest episode. The first episode of season 3 includes a fast paced narrative tying up all loose ends from the previous season with the main conclusion being &quot;the only reason any of this happened is because of a McDonalds Sauce from 10+ years ago&quot;.</p>

<p>While McDonalds has blatantly denied that it had anything to do with the reference, it happens to timed coincidently with the release of the new upcoming remake of Mulan (Which the Sauce originally was used as a promotion for). Couple this with some tweets back and forth from both parties, it is almost an insult to its viewers. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mcdonalds/status/848573499874709506?lang=en">https://twitter.com/mcdonalds/status/848573499874709506?lang=en</a></p>

<p>Despite this I have seen almost no negative reviews or any complaints regarding the episode. In fact i&#39;ve seen quite the opposite with almost every popular review suggesting the episode as genius. I believe there is too much money floating back and forth between these parties.</p>

<p>Does anyone else feel like everything they see is an advertisement? How can we escape?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t enjoy the product placements and advertisements within the shows I watch (and actively avoid commercials by using streaming services that aren&#39;t Hulu), I also am not going to let said advertising keep me from enjoying otherwise funny and creative content. I will still argue that it&#39;s ridiculous and intrusive to allow advertising in this manner and do my best to not support companies that lack integrity and human-decency.</p>

<p>tl;dr I agree that it&#39;s stupid and annoying they advertise this way, but I&#39;m not going to avoid certain shows I enjoy because of it.</p>

And it know whats about to go down when its living its life in a cage. Just waiting there for what you attribute with death, horrid squealing, hearing that all day. Cant be a stress free life at all. Id imagine it to be locked in a room hearing screams on one side while you await what only your imagination could conjure up. Tried the vegan thing and as a power lifter my body wasn&#39;t to happy with the new game plan. Ive found that lots of fish GREENS like kale and spinach (broccoli sprouts too) and some lean red meat are what my body functions best on. Everything digestive wise is fine. My worry is the air quality. My sinuses produce so much mucus throughout the day and night i through up mucus throughout the day/night from the drainage in the back if my throat. Yay aluminum. Its only been getting worse too since 2010-2011 ish for me and my residency is phoenix az. Huge city for spraying... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A strange interaction I had at the train station the other day really made made me think about branding. A strange man, likely druggie, saw my bike and made a comment about the logo on it &quot;aw it&#39;s an old pacer! That&#39;s cool&quot; despite the fact that the bike is a Citation Pace, he misread the logo and had internally convinced himself that the bike had significance just from the logo he didn&#39;t even read. Branding and logos are nothing but constructs used to falsify value. I find even myself not immune to this but lately I&#39;ve tried to really think about what a product really offers rather than what logo or branding it uses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this was clearly &quot;Branded entertainment.&quot; They handled it deftly, just like the show&#39;s co-creator Dan Harmon did with Subway and Honda in his last show &quot;Community.&quot;</p>

<p>It was funny. But it was whoring. It could&#39;ve been JUST as funny without the corporate shilling, especially since McVomit&#39;s is cancer on to the body and brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just confused on the general consensus that it was Genius and satirical. It&#39;s quite clearly McDonalds behind it yet I&#39;ve only seen people say how funny the episode is and how hilarious the McDonalds gag is. Has the population become so accustomed to advertisements that they&#39;ve become a form of entertainment themselves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The episode was smart and funny, wouldn&#39;t call it was genius (like I would with the season 2 premiere). You gotta give them credit for tying up so many loose ends from the cliffhanger--Rick escapes, alien invasion repelled, everything&#39;s back to normal-ish; and it didn&#39;t feel rushed or forced.</p>

<p>The McVomit&#39;s thing was a small part of it to me, and so absurd in context I thought it funny. Not genius, and falls on the wrong side of wanting to have it both ways--the Subway tie-in on &quot;Community&quot; was far more effective brand placement that didn&#39;t really hero-ize the corporation or product--but it didn&#39;t ruin the rest of the show for me. </p>

<p>I will say: My teen nephew who watches the show talks about it with me a lot, and we talked about this episode. He even texted me special to note that someone had started a petition to bring back the &quot;Mulan&quot; sauce. I had told him earlier that it was a canny new form of advertising and not to fall for it, and I repeated it in the text back. He wrote, &quot;I know, I know. But I&#39;d still like to try it.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest the episode felt very rushed and sub par compared to the first 2 season. Too many loose ends tied up as quickly as possible in order to allow the next episodes a blank canvas. I think once the show has sold out it&#39;s insulting to its fanbase. Especially a cartoon with such a wide variety of ages watching. Many children wouldn&#39;t understand McDonalds is behind it and would assume Rick likes the sauce so it must be good. It&#39;s only targeting impressionable people who don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re actually watching. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are in disagreement on the quality of the episode, but not the marketing mechanizations. </p>

<p>I do think it&#39;s possible the show could go downhill this year, as it moves from cult fave to mainstream hit, and suffers from whatever forced social programming the folks who control entertainment want to inflict on us this year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was purposeful product placement, then I don&#39;t really care cause it was hilarious. I watch that show to laugh, and it made me laugh.</p>

<p>Also I think it&#39;s worth noting that if they this was just a promotion then wouldn&#39;t it be released a little closer to the Mulan remake? I haven&#39;t heard anything about that movie besides the announcement that they&#39;re filming it.</p>
