    <div class="md"><p>I was a student in her previous school. It was great. Implemented alot of anti-bullying stuff and lead the way to inclusion of people with handicapp, blacks, etc, it wasnt a diverse townlol. She was dead before the Boston marathon.  </p>

<p>As for the Sandy Hook school, I don&#39;t know how it ran.  I have family in Sandy Hook, but no one was affected. Dawn was great, but I forget exactly but I do know there was something fucking weird about the school. let me try to remember. </p>

<p>After she had left our school district we did not keep tabs. If you are interestd in more information I can find out for her. I wasnt the closest, but some of my family friends were like legit family friends with her. I just knew her from being a student /living in the community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Question about death self.Buddhism
Submitted 4 months ago by orange_fuckin_peel
My dog recently died, and it was my <strong><em>first experienced death</em></strong>. I mourned over her thinking her life throughout and ups and downs and coming to terms with reasons of death and moving on.
My question is should I, before I forget, log the great memories of her (or any person that dies) to be remembered later, or does Buddhism recommend that one moves on forever so that past memories does not inflict suffering&quot;</p>

<p>You could be telling the truth, but you say you &quot;Saw her dead body&quot;</p>

<p>but 4 months ago your dog dying was your first experience? I love my animals but I think I would have remember pretty significantly seeing a dead human body, oh yeah I have, every time, and it wasn&#39;t even anyone &#39;infamous&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are lying. lol.</p>

<p>They supposedly attended a funeral of someone who was killed by a gunman in a horrific way. First off... they open casketed this woman?</p>

<p>Secondly... OP knew this woman. He knew her and then viewed her dead body... knowing how brutally she died and the fear she had at her end... nope didn&#39;t phase him.</p>

<p>His grandfather dying didn&#39;t bother him too much either. He has seen 4-5 dead bodies. 4 to 5??? I used to work in a field that had me come into contact with dead bodies. On average once every two years. I never knew these people and I remember every single one. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a number you are give or take on. Especially with family or people you personally know.</p>

<p>This guy is a liar.</p>

<p>Sure is a contradiction. How can you be certain her body was in the casket if you didn&#39;t know her that well?  Seems to me all the cues were in place so you didn&#39;t question what you were seeing and skeptics have no reason to think your story is any different than what was on CNN.</p>

TBH, I see why people dont come out with info cause this feelsbadman. I had her as principal, saw her many times a year. Not only that, but my friends who lived next to her also confirmed it was her body. I didnt see a shred of doubt. It was very eerie to know she had seen some of the worst events in American 21st century, but also knew all of us small town folk.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like coming in here saying you saw the moon landing on the monitors at NASA. Doesn&#39;t matter if your were really at NASA at the time because the video on the monitor was staged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, this is super hard without revealing my identity on the internet. To keep it vague, one of her past schools (you can google it) that wasnt Sandy HOok (however not if she was in on the conspiracy its crazy that I could be one of those kids). The vigil was in the town Church, literally 15 minutes away. My parents worked with her in those parent-teacher conference things to setup events. There used to be alot of events at schools before terrorism/PT language/gender neutrl/everything is offensive happened everywhere. MY friends parents knew her from in town, they were part of the community closer to her outside of the school</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It definately was a fake shooting... Maybe a few people died, but it wasn&#39;t the imaginary Adam lands character.. And there are literally 100s of extremely gushy things about the whole situation.... Don&#39;t forget that we live in an amazing time.. Bodies can be faked... I know that&#39;s outlandish but it&#39;s quite possible given the technology available today.. </p>

<p>The school wasn&#39;t even in operation, there were puddles in the hallways, mold on the walls, flood damage in multiple classrooms, boxes stacked up in multiple classrooms, windows boarded up in classroom, there was mold growing on the walls in multiple areas of the building.... </p>

<p>This discussion is all on tape in the wolfgang halbig videos... The higher ups in your town were all turning different colors in the court hearings... They are on tape... Watch those characters in your town with a conscious mind and tell me they don&#39;t show many signs of something suspicious.. </p>

<p>The sad thing is alot of the people directly involved in the case are dead, all the supposed victims and their families moved in the year before... Their houses were paid for... They all then moved right after the shooting... </p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about the sheer stupidity of the official story.... A 21 yr old autistic kid who weighs 120lbs.. Is carrying 40lbs of weapons and ammo,,, he shot 154 bullets, he hit all 26 victims between 3 and 11 times, all fatalities, 0 injuries..... Do you realize that&#39;s better shooting than most soldiers.. 
Highly unlikely for an autistic kid portrayed in the fake photoshopped pictures they released... And they are photoshopped (I&#39;m a graphic designer) I know for a fact they are fake.. </p>

<p>I could go on about the state of the parking lot, or the LIBOR scandal, or the inconsistencies in the photos of his house and the official story of how he killed his mother.... 
Or we could talk about the fake parent who is seen on video dressed up in military gear... <a href="https://youtu.be/xaHtxlSDgbk">https://youtu.be/xaHtxlSDgbk</a> </p>

<p>Or the hand signals given by this fake parent to her supposed daughter.. <a href="https://youtu.be/7CehORG-JVg">https://youtu.be/7CehORG-JVg</a> </p>

<p>Or this kid.... <a href="https://youtu.be/j-pi-HQsXtk">https://youtu.be/j-pi-HQsXtk</a> </p>

<p>Adult. 21yrs old is no kid. Was he going on a hike? 40lbs isn&#39;t much. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you realize that&#39;s better shooting than most soldiers..</p>

<p>Most soldiers don&#39;t shoot unarmed civilians in such close quarters. </p>

<p>Does autism make people wildly inaccurate? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Sandy Hook were a false flag, it would take incredible resources to pull off to the fullest degree - even duping friends of friends is very possible. </p>

<p>Operations like the witness protection program, would be a vital resource in making this stuff pan out for them. </p>

<p>Again, if it were a false flag, events such as the funeral you experienced would be an easy thing for them to fake. Crisis actors, hollywood makeup artists, legit real looking &quot;mannequins&quot; in place of deceased - technology and peoples abilites are forever growing and evolving, and they do this sort of thing for movies all the time - think about how many real looking corpses you have seen throughout movies and TV shows. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not discrediting your story - I&#39;m just saying, a business like the US govt is prepared and certainly have ALL the resources to make this happen. You see more and more arguments supporting both sides of it - so it is hard for the average person to know what to believe. </p>

<p>Either way ... for you, this experience was very real. But, as you&#39;re asking people here, you should be open to the concept that something like this is easily doable with the right resources and the power to get things done. </p>

<p>Sandy Hook will be a mystery for a bit - but, you can guarantee, it&#39;s not black or white right at this point in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are lying. lol.</p>

<p>They supposedly attended a funeral of someone who was killed by a gunman in a horrific way. First off... they open casketed this woman?</p>

<p>Secondly... OP knew this woman. He knew her and then viewed her dead body... knowing how brutally she died and the fear she had at her end... nope didn&#39;t phase him.</p>

<p>His grandfather dying didn&#39;t bother him too much either. He has seen 4-5 dead bodies. 4 to 5??? I used to work in a field that had me come into contact with dead bodies. On average once every two years. I never knew these people and I remember every single one. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a number you are give or take on. Especially with family or people you personally know.</p>

<p>This guy is a liar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You absolutely didn&#39;t at all. All of which were a bit silly and totally made up. The irony of calling me simple is too much.</p>

<p>You realize we&#39;re on a thread about a woman who the whole community knew. Who who all attended her funeral. Yet you think she didn&#39;t exist because you read some things on the internet. Good job</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you cry when your principal of your elementary school died? No?  ou guys will go to anything length to spin anything. No wonder you are all paranoid. No common sense. I knew her person to person level, not that I was in love with her.</p>
