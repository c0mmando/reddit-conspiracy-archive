<p>The government does not need to collect tax in order to spend, the reason they do is to widen income inequality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. Look at Japan. They have a law set in place that doesn&#39;t allow the CEO of a company to make more than like 9 times the lowest paid employee. Unlike the US where CEO make over 200x the lowest paid employee.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re talking ethnically, well Japan and South Korea are pretty ethnically homogenous, but the other ones not so much. Go to Singapore and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s way more diverse and less ethnically homogenous than the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the root of all of your grievances is the State. You can be patriotic and completely oppose what the government is doing.  When government is causing immeasurable harm as you have described, and particularly when it no longer represents the will of the people - then it becomes especially important for patriotism to spur action.</p>

<p>It is high time we distinguish between patriotism and nationalism. America represents certain ideals, and an American patriot is loyal to those ideals above and beyond loyalty to flag and country. Ideals like liberty, equality of opportunity and justice, and (this is the heart of the &quot;Great Experiment&quot;) individualism. </p>

<p>Nationalism is mindless. It is the result of conditioning primarily by the media and the public schools. It is rallying around the flag despite the government&#39;s betrayal of American ideals. It is thanking the military for their service despite their service expanding the bounds of empire. It is that religious reverence for office and monument, the blind deference to the institution of government and politicians despite the evidence of harm it&#39;s doing. </p>

<p>A patriot has a responsibility to uphold humanitarian values. A nationalist is blinded by his own unfounded arrogance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think exactly like you, until I started traveling the world a few years ago... To be honest America really isn&#39;t THAT great, and while I agree that we have a lot of freedoms compared to many countries, there are still many countries that have our same freedoms PLUS some. Just take healthcare for example, every single developed country has universal healthcare, except for the US. That&#39;s just one example. The prison rates in the US compared to all the other developed countries.. I don&#39;t even want to get started. The US is NOT number 1, and I don&#39;t think it ever was.</p>
