       Eiffel Tower Mural Explicitly Celebrating The Genocide Of White People

        The Mural itself is rather ambiguous at first, but when you look closely it is revealed to have six white figures holding hands and dancing, six black figures holding hands and dancing, and a black (male) figure and white (female) figure in the middle, wrapped in romantic embrace. 
The title of the artwork is ‘The Endless Sleep’. 
When it debuted, many people were outraged, and suggested the image and its title were celebrating the end of native Europeans as a result of mass-immigration and intermarriage with non-Europeans. 
This could be dismissed as an over-interpretation.. however, let’s look a little more closely at its creator.
Cleon Peterson, it turns out, is a former heroin addict and three-time felon who has since become a renowned and successful artist. Now, I have absolutely nothing against former drug addicts- half our generation has been addicted to heroin and opiates. 
However, since getting clean and becoming an artist, Peterson’s entire career has been based off the ongoing creation of very specific drawings, all stylistically similar, all portraying horrific violence and degeneracy. It also turns out that all that violence involves black figures murdering, torturing, and raping white figures.

       We don't. The white hate seed has been planted too deep worldwide and there's seemingly a big effort being made at the very top for it to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just enjoy your time while you can. People will scoff at any suggestion of it happening because white people were historically in a position of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       With how rapidly globalisation is happening worldwide, paired with how much resentment there is towards white people, the future is not pretty.

       I'm sorry I don't believe "white culture" (whatever that is) is inherently better than all other cultures. For example: Eastern societies have developed some of the most profound technological advancements and wonderful, peaceful, religions that promote self awareness and growth.

       I'm willing to consider the idea that some forces would be interested in a "divide and conquer" strategy but I don't believe that there is actually some master plot to attack white people.

       It really doesn't matter what you believe. Western culture, by far, has a better quality of life by virtually all empirical measures than any other place in the world.

       Hypothetical: let's assume your base premise is sound, and that the western world has the best quality of life, period. Now how can we prove that's because of its culture and not some other multitude of factors including, but not limited to, luck, natural economic cycles, colonialism and subjugation/suppression of other societies (not just some inherent "greatness" of Western culture)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's also ask what exactly gets to be considered white culture? Is it your skin color? Is it being European? Because there are a multitude of distinct cultures (and physical appearances) found within Europe itself, so to lump them all together seems lazy at best and certainly disingenuous.

       Great question. In my opinion, you have to look at what distinguishes  the frameworks countries operate off of from one another. In the case of the United States, the framework our country operates off of is derived from a judeo-christian value system, and heres how:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Every man is equal under the eyes of the law. This obviously does/did not happen all the time, but it's a declaration that has it's roots in judeo-christian religious values that human beings are all God's creation, and was quite revolutionary at the time. Obviously we didn't operate under this creed as a nation while we had legalized chattel slavery, however, the first and most committed non-slave abolitionists were christian societies, who operated off those same judeo-christian values.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Free speech. America, by far, has the most liberal free speech laws in the world. This came from the concept of Logos, first popularized by Heraclitus 2500 years ago, expanded upon in the Gospel of John, and toyed with by philosophers throughout western civilization. One definition of Logos is: refers to the rational principle governing the universe and it also refers to the governing principle in human individuals, that is, in particular, to their power to see connections, understand laws, and use language.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Are human beings naturally good? No, says George Washington, Locke, Hobbes, and other philosophers that were heavily influential in the founding of the United States. A country must have a moral framework to operate off of, as GW and Locke claimed, through inalienable rights granted to us by a divine creator. That is Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.

       You have cited principles of our founding fathers as examples of what you think makes Western Culture great, are we then defining Western culture as American culture? This is relevant because typically the “western world” includes more than just America, but at the same time includes a great amount of different cultures and values within it. This is more a rhetorical question to point out the level of mass generalization this sort of discussion takes, and hopefully highlight the idea that the more we have to generalize, the less the generalization really tells us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typically, if you are looking at Western vs Eastern cultures (again, acknowledging we have to make very broad assumptions to even create these two groups) we are going to come up with some running themes:
      </p>
      <p>
       West tends to value: Individuality, assertiveness, creativity, courage, freedom
      </p>
      <p>
       East tends to value: Family unit, self-growth, politeness, promoting the good of society, diligence
      </p>
      <p>
       When I look at these two dichotomies I don’t see one that is inherently superior. I see one that focuses on the belief that everyone should have a right to the pursuit of happiness and other traits that go hand in hand with that. Then I see a culture that values families and holding up others, while at the same time emphasizing the importance of being the best person one can be to improve their own lives and the lives of those around them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see benefits to both, if we take the best of what all cultures have to offer instead of focusing on the differences we would be in a far better place as a society and species as a whole. I don’t believe in ranking cultures because I think it misses the point of culture entirely. Culture is not a contest of “who’s living the best” it’s the way that different communities learned to adapt to living together and there is something valuable that can be taken from all of them. I think ranking cultures also runs the inherent risk of saying that the people within those cultures are not equal. I don’t think anyone is inherently better than anyone just because they were raised on one part of the globe vs the other.

       Are Heraclitus, Hobbes, Locke, Plato, Jesus founding fathers? Were they not all philosophers who contributed to the knowledge use to found the framework of the United States?

       I probably should not have used the phrase “founding fathers” as you did cite more than that, but my point more generally was that you clearly emphasized American values. In many European nations you will find a much stronger belief in societal benefit over personal gain than we see in America, particularly among those with socialized healthcare or strong family traditions. My point was to demonstrate that “western culture” is a big generalization and really does not accurately define the diversity found within it.  English and Italian culture are not the same. Spanish and Swedish culture are not the same. American and French culture are not the same. To lump all of them together requires us to erase many of the unique (and valuable) aspects they bring.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to outline the two points I’m making:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) I don’t think it’s appropriate to lump all of the western world into one culture. I think it fails to accurately reflect the actual cultures it contains.
2) If we have to lump them together for argument’s sake, then the general characteristics found in each (as outlined in my previous post) do not lead me to believe that the West is inherently superior, only that it values different attributes

       The topics are not mutually exclusive. Divide and conquer is a real world operational tactic. It is also true that Western culture has produced the greatest standards of living and societal advances the world has ever seen and deserves preservation.

       I mean the implications behind it were that if he is this pushy and confronting online I bet he is confronting at parties if you want to get real technical. Which really doesn't matter but as a non-confrontational kind of person it can off-putting. Like I said it was just a simple turn of phrase. No need to get angry about it.

       Read about the Etrusks. If by race you meant culture (typical American semantic flip). If by race you meant genetic makeup, then bad news: Long term, if globalization proceeds, there will be a multiracial pure top and a mixed mongrel base of poors.

       Sounds silly, but highly likely. The groups who program, direct and process power today are highly segregated too. There are many groups who feign and are oh so sanctimonious about everybody is the same but then they have offspring and look what happens. Every fucking time. 
Interracial groups are mostly located in media and creative areas, fringe of society and the bulk of mass culture.
I project what I see in Switzerland, where there are highly segregated upper class areas in (inner/dense parts of) cities and some areas where second generation doesn't give a fuck. But the moment money comes into the equation, race pulls. Another are IT-expats from India. They all marry with their caste (!) abroad. Maybe England has a problem with Asians being a block (or not in that case, who knows anymore), but (s)low level mass impoverishment will change attitudes. 
What I left out at the beginning are the state directing groups. Most states except Germany for some such reasons not to be discussed here keep their inner core of power to a specific group or kind of humans. The American concept or "race" captures it quite good in this specific case, because there are states where religion or education is more important. This pool will reproduce itself, as those who are "liberal" breed/marry outside and those who want to remain marry within. 
Now the 10 trillion dollar question is: Do the power groups trust the newly formed globalized expat groups and marry with
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       or not? What is to gain/loose, are they compatible? Do interests align?

       Other than it seems, it's not exactly about the death of european/"white" people by "blacks" such as dark skinned Africans.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is supposed to be the "victory" of "Black"(evil) over "White"(good).
      </p>
      <p>
       The EVIL Rothschilds are white skinned themselves and are treating "black" Africans like trash, for them they are subhuman garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look how many Africans in former british/rothschildian colonies are suffering because of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should they support non-white supremacy ?
-&gt; To create artificial conflict, from which they benefit.

       This is
       <strong>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sometime during the months after Hillary Clinton had stepped down as secretary of state and before she announced to the country that she would mount another run for president,
        <strong>
         Lynn Forester de Rothschild said this to her longtime friend: “I just want you to know I pray every night that I die before my children and after you are president.”
        </strong>

      <p>
       [...]
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        [Lynn Forester De Rothschild's] friendship with the Clintons dates back to the early ’90s, to Bill Clinton’s first campaign and administration. Lynn Forester was already a powerhouse Democratic fundraiser and played a small role in his administration.
        <strong>
         It was Henry Kissinger who introduced her in 1998 to Sir Evelyn de Rothschild at the Bilderberg Group conference
        </strong>
        , an annual confab of industry and political leaders, in Scotland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two years later they were married, and Lynn Forester from Bergen County, New Jersey, became a bona fide Lady.
        <strong>
         Sir Evelyn and Lady de Rothschild spent part of their honeymoon in the White House, a stay during which Bill Clinton told the couple that Sir Evelyn was the first Brit to be so invited since Winston Churchill
        </strong>
        , a fun fact that made a lasting impression on the newlyweds. De Rothschild has been an ardent Hillary supporter ever since, and though she was bitterly disappointed when Obama took the nomination in 2008 and she very publicly decamped to John McCain, she’s never stopped being a Hillary person.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Rothies are at the top Power Players - at least in the "visible dimension".
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think Sir Evelyn de Rothschild was "impressed" by his stay at the White House?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not likely - he and his family own (or have owned - and dumped) MANY mansions that would put the White House to SHAME in terms of both worth and grandeur. A few of these are shown here:

       The actual mural is two rings of people holding the hands of their own color, then one of each color embracing in the middle.  But that's not the kind of thing people would get angry about, so they've got to call it white genocide (it's not) and show art that isn't even included.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess if you're a racial purist you'd get upset at the idea of two different colored people embracing but.....oh I see why this sub has a problem now.

       The 4th image (the one actually on display outside the Eiffel Tower) in no way depicts white genocide. What a misleading OP.

       If we take out the whole Rothschold portion of the conversation I have no problem with this art whatsoever. If you Trumpsters had it your way we would be banning art and books because of your reees. Who gives a fuck. Are you honkeys scared or something?

       people need to understand this is not white genocide.
       <br/>
       This is total genocide.
       <br/>
       Wen the white,s are mostly mixed / no majority country any more.
       <br/>
       Then they will try and do the same to asians and africans.
       <br/>
       Best to keep a country as divided as possible ( multi culture is devision )

       And see that outrages both sides....

       Caucasians see it as "African Americans killing all of my race as an act of Genocide"
      </p>
      <p>
       Africans see it as "Heroin addict accusing my people of being savages"
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it as "What the fuck?! The Corruption is spreading and is now turning the feeble-minded sheep against their friends, and also depicting a lawless world (like this is a depiction of the revelation) because there's a girl who's being force to suck a corrupted guy's dick in what looks like a classroom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe that's a depiction of "sheep eventually giving way to the shepherd" because usually sheep will trust their shepherds-even if they murder all sheep in the end, and that girl sucking that person's dick may be a depiction of the now-where people are doing anything for certain objects or currency.
