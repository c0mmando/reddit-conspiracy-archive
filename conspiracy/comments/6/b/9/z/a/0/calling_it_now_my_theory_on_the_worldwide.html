<p>It was created by the NSA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack#Background">we, apparently, already know this to be true</a> and it was actually RELEASED and CAUSED TO SPREAD by the same entity as an &quot;Inside-Job-Operation&quot;.  (Think about just exactly HOW FAST this thing went around the World, hitting important institutions such as Britain&#39;s hospitals, FedEx, Deutsche Bahn railways, and LATAM airlines.)</p>

<p>The end result of them doing this is to have a wedge of opportunity <strong>to attack the anonymity of Bitcoin.</strong>  </p>

This site works for <em>many</em> packages.<br/>
Updates fail, machines break, this is life on all platforms :D</p>

<p>Another way: Take a virtual machine (e.g. virtual box) take a <a href="https://virtualboxes.org/images/ubuntu/">preconfigured virtual box</a> set available RAM to half of your machine and boot it up. Begin to use it, if you break something, reset the machine or download another system, click and look around. It takes about three hours and you begin so see that normal user stuff (browsing, mail, video, p2p, office) works almost the same.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>That&#39;s propaganda designed to make you compliant to cybersecurity laws that infringe on your privacy, much like the patriot act in response to terrorism.</p>

<p>This is why we need to stop the intel agencies from engaging in cyber espionage. Security and Defense are the best offense. Better detection, better analysis, responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. If you really care about your data, switch to linux and store valuable data externally.</p>

<p>I still think that this ransomware attack is an escalation though. Vulnerabilities in the Internet of things has still not been resolved and remain open to attack. Mirai was the bot net I learned about, the one released open and free for anyone to take.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but the reason this attack is occuring is 2 fold, A) Lazy IT Admins and B) Nation states manufacturing cyber weapons. Without both of those, this would not be possible. Besides, this isn&#39;t even that bad. Code red attacked the exact same protocol. It had over a million infections. There are other worms out there that have affected multiple millions of machines. 100k is nothing. The problem is that the victims are all infrastructure related, because the companies that run the machines are too cheap to upgrade from windows XP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually they <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/05/12/customer-guidance-for-wannacrypt-attacks/">provided the update</a> for Windows XP (and other versions that wouldn&#39;t normally be able to apply this patch like Windows server 2003 and windows 8). </p>

<p>Note that on the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx">page for this update</a> you won&#39;t find the download links for those versions though. This lead me to believe what you said (force people off of XP) but with the update being available for XP I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the plan here. </p>

<p>With that said it could&#39;ve still been a general scare to cause people to update, I&#39;m not too sure the general consumer is going to go download and apply a specific patch from the Microsoft website when there&#39;s a catch all update tool built in they can use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The speed of spread is not due to some kind of organized operation. This is a remote vulnerability. If you&#39;re vulnerable, they just have to scan you and send the attack. It&#39;s different from other vulnerabilities, where you have to download a file, or click a link. Each time a computer is infected, it can be leveraged as a scanning agent, looking for the next target to attack. That is why this is called a &quot;Worm.&quot; </p>

<p>Luckily, you, and likely everyone here, is not vulnerable. The worm uses MS17-10 which affects SMBv1. If you don&#39;t know what that is, then you&#39;re safe. That&#39;s because this is off by default. It has to be turned on manually. The only reason you would EVER do this is if you have windows xp machines that you want to be able to access network shares. Even if you did turn this on. 99 percent of US internet service providers block these ports because SMB has never been a secure protocol.</p>
