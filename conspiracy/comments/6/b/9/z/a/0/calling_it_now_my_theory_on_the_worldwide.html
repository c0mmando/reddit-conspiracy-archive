       You can correct me if you think I'm wrong, but my theoretical thought on this whole ransomware issue that spread like wildfire around the World over the past few days is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       It was created by the NSA
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack#Background">
        we, apparently, already know this to be true
       </a>
       and it was actually RELEASED and CAUSED TO SPREAD by the same entity as an "Inside-Job-Operation".  (Think about just exactly HOW FAST this thing went around the World, hitting important institutions such as Britain's hospitals, FedEx, Deutsche Bahn railways, and LATAM airlines.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The end result of them doing this is to have a wedge of opportunity
       <strong>
        to attack the anonymity of Bitcoin.
       </strong>

       Legit conspiracy theory there. Bitcoin is probably one target. Also, think of the multitudes scrambling to update. Gotta ask yourself, who benefits most from that, and how?

       I said this yesterday, Microsoft had announced that they released a patch for this back in March and made it a point to note that if you updated (and turned on automatic windows update) this wouldn't be an issue
      </p>
      <p>
       I was considering the idea that maybe theres some serious government software in Windows 10 and this is partially a ploy to encourage people to mass update

       I don't think you are wrong, but what about CIA vs NSA? I believe NSA screwed up by allowing their weapons to slip into the wrong hands, but who gave them to the Shadow Brokers? I wouldn't be surprised to learn Of CIA meddling in these events in order to gain control of the Intelligence Community.

       So, the The Shadow Brokers are CIA, and the NSA is leaking CIA vectors to Wikileaks? Mutually assured destruction or carefully crafted collaboration? I'm going with the latter. They both have new and improved exploits to exploit.

       What is Snowden's part in this? Is it possible he is a CIA agent deep undercover to bring ruin to the NSA? It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the next weeks.

       I have noticed a huge push to upgrade systems. I agree that it does seem sketchy we are being forced to do the patches, and I wouldn't put it past Microsoft to be involved. If we don't do the patches though, we become targets of the cyber attacks happening right now.

       They have us right where they want us. A modern computer is essentially useless when not on the Internet. They're good for testing, and spreadsheets and writing your manifesto. Everyone reading this, do an experiment. Unplug your computer from the Internet. Now, what can you do with it? It's really eye opening.

       I'm sorry, but you're mistaken. Every single Windows is vulnerable with the exception of mobile Windows. The XP and server 2003 patches only came out a day or two ago, but another patch came out a month ago for all the other versions of Windows. That's because all those other versions of Windows were vulnerable too - and are still vulnerable now unless they have that specific patch.

       They are almost useless offline. Even word processors need a subscription or connection. I use my computer mainly for editing videos and recording music which I throw onto an external to upload using my cheap, connected computer. Other than that it is useless to me, which is upsetting because I spent hard earned money on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaming is impossible. So is writing. Even having it offline, warnings come up constantly about the need to update and the security risks it has. It drives me crazy to be honest.

       At work we have computers behind the firewall. No Internet. Those 'update now' warnings are obnoxious. I'm like "this computer hasn't been updated in 10 years. It's fine." At work it's a tool. If it was good enough to do the job when they bought it it's still good enough. Do you have to update a wrench? You may want a better one, but until it breaks its just a waste of money to mess with it.

       I get that and I know I am not at risk from this attack. What about the next one though? Is this the last attack we are going to see? My information is valuable, because I have spent years creating it. I could live without it but I want to try and keep it if I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this attack and the bot net army  are signs of what is to come. I get that there is fear being pushed onto the public when they are at no risk. This time though I believe it to be reasonable. The cyber war is about to begin and I want to protect my information.

       This is why we need to stop the intel agencies from engaging in cyber espionage. Security and Defense are the best offense. Better detection, better analysis, responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. If you really care about your data, switch to linux and store valuable data externally.

       Yeah, I agree with what you say and apologize for the cyber war comment. I would just like to keep this conversation open so I can learn. My information is really only important to me so no big loss. I am interested in getting into Linux but it is like learning a new language.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think that this ransomware attack is an escalation though. Vulnerabilities in the Internet of things has still not been resolved and remain open to attack. Mirai was the bot net I learned about, the one released open and free for anyone to take.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the propaganda end goal of achieving cybersecurity laws, but It is hard to ignore the risks of inaction. So much of our world today relies on a functioning Internet.

       Right, but the reason this attack is occuring is 2 fold, A) Lazy IT Admins and B) Nation states manufacturing cyber weapons. Without both of those, this would not be possible. Besides, this isn't even that bad. Code red attacked the exact same protocol. It had over a million infections. There are other worms out there that have affected multiple millions of machines. 100k is nothing. The problem is that the victims are all infrastructure related, because the companies that run the machines are too cheap to upgrade from windows XP.

       One of two ways I can look at it. One is that Wikileaks etc is correct. It's been a hacked and modified code used as a warning shot. Two, it was an inside job to force people away from XP (pay for an upgrade.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Both seem viable but I want to go with number one. Shots fired to get the US to come clean.

       Actually they
       <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/05/12/customer-guidance-for-wannacrypt-attacks/">
        provided the update
       </a>
       for Windows XP (and other versions that wouldn't normally be able to apply this patch like Windows server 2003 and windows 8).
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that on the
       <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx">
        page for this update
       </a>
       you won't find the download links for those versions though. This lead me to believe what you said (force people off of XP) but with the update being available for XP I don't think that's the plan here.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said it could've still been a general scare to cause people to update, I'm not too sure the general consumer is going to go download and apply a specific patch from the Microsoft website when there's a catch all update tool built in they can use.

       Bitcoin transactions do not record the computer/files, though, just the keys.  I get the concern stories like this make Bitcoin [falsely] look bad, but I'm not clear on how a Bitcoin transaction could reveal the device from which it's sent/received.

       If the computer is already hacked enough to lock out until you send money via bitcoin I would be surprised if it could recognize which ip sent which transactions(if anybody even sent any). but this is pure speculation on my end

       The speed of spread is not due to some kind of organized operation. This is a remote vulnerability. If you're vulnerable, they just have to scan you and send the attack. It's different from other vulnerabilities, where you have to download a file, or click a link. Each time a computer is infected, it can be leveraged as a scanning agent, looking for the next target to attack. That is why this is called a "Worm."
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily, you, and likely everyone here, is not vulnerable. The worm uses MS17-10 which affects SMBv1. If you don't know what that is, then you're safe. That's because this is off by default. It has to be turned on manually. The only reason you would EVER do this is if you have windows xp machines that you want to be able to access network shares. Even if you did turn this on. 99 percent of US internet service providers block these ports because SMB has never been a secure protocol.

       Bitcoin is the biggest threat to the International Banking cartels, aka the ones who actually rule the world. If they lose control of the global money supply, they lose all of their power. They'll try and kill the internet before they let bitcoin truly go mainstream.

       Falls flat on its nose because the killswitch was so easy to find and activate. Maybe this whole thing was a playground test of some org out there. 
Most known services to do such a thing don't have to do it, they

       </em>
       that it works - especially the NSA. Most CTO and military leaders know about how way behind patch levels and old systems are. They don't have to be proven right. 
So who could it be? Mafia, cartels, triads

       My guess is the jerry springer final thoughts are going to be along the lines of 'see, we need to bend some rules and give up some privacies to find out who the bad guys are'. That, or this is just a distraction from the Comey story and the Hillary emails.

       I'm sorry, but you're mistaken. Every single Windows is vulnerable with the exception of mobile Windows. The XP and server 2003 patches only came out a day or two ago, but another patch came out a month ago for all the other versions of Windows. That's because all those other versions of Windows were vulnerable too - and are still vulnerable now unless they have that specific patch.

       What is Snowden's part in this? Is it possible he is a CIA agent deep undercover to bring ruin to the NSA? It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the next weeks.
