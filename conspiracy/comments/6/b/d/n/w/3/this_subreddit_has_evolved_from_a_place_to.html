        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is very easy to see who are the true truth seekers. A truth seeker is one that questions everything, and I mean everything. When someone posts a video about donut earth, a true truth seeker takes the time to look at both sides of the theory. When someone talks about bigfoot, there should be no immediate downvotes. Each thread should be it&#39;s own hub. If you don&#39;t like a topic, do not downvote and say &quot;hurr durr you are a retart&quot;. Same goes with flat earth. Same goes with Pizzagate. Same goes with Reptilians. Same goes with ghosts.</p>

<p>I understand that this world kind of fucking sucks, but look at what we&#39;ve become people. We talk about divide and conquer, yet here we are arguing over the most trivial shit. Stop arguing, and start working together. We are literally a dying breed. Do you understand how important our roles are? I get that each one of us here is probably incredibly cynical in a way, because we see through the bull shit, but we need to use our abilities for good. </p>

<p>Start entertaining all possibilities. Stop attacking your brother. Stop attacking your sister. Start attacking our common enemy. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re demons. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re reptilians. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re vampires. But I do know that what we are battling is pure evil itself, and I guarantee you your enemy is not going to be found in a Pizzagate thread. Keep your eyes out for shills, for they run rampant here. </p>

<p>Please guys, our civilization literally depends on OUR cooperation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I&#39;ve been noticing it over the years. I know politics is important because it goes hand in hand with conspiracies, but hot damn, it seems like now if it doesn&#39;t specifically deal with what&#39;s happening now, it&#39;s labeled a &quot;distraction to what&#39;s really going on&quot;. I swear to god, that has to be a phrase coined by Shill INC, and the useful idiots just spread it. smh...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought it would go one of two ways, all the fresh meat from the pol subs would get redpilled and rabbit holes. Instead it seems they&#39;ve taken over the sub and made it surface level, the need for more mods, many of whom are banning/removing like crazy, and all the good stuff rarely makes it to front page</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a combination of the two, and in fairness some fringe content that is obvious to have no basis in reality (flat earth theory, for example) only serves to make the other content here, actual research into conspiracies with facts and evidence (i.e. 9/11) appear equally fringe and easy to dismiss by association. </p>

<p>I believe there are other subs better suited to such content, <a href="/r/AlternativeHistory">/r/AlternativeHistory</a> as <a href="/u/Putin_loves_cats">/u/Putin_loves_cats</a> mentioned, as well as <a href="/r/HighStrangeness">/r/HighStrangeness</a> (disclosure: which I currently moderate) and <a href="/r/OccultConspiracy">/r/OccultConspiracy</a> (which I also moderate). Anything pertaining to the paranormal, cryptozoology, UFOlogy, etc is welcome at <a href="/r/HighStrangeness">/r/HighStrangeness</a>, no matter how obscure or fringe. As for <a href="/r/OccultConspiracy">/r/OccultConspiracy</a>, I welcome any and all perspectives pertaining to the occult, esotericism and secret societies, whether supportive or critical of the three, with open arms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, youd be surprised to know how many people those posts affect (note I did not say &quot;read&quot;).   Take me for example, PLC.  Ive been a regular here for years, but under different names.  Ive read some of the things youve posted and at first the concepts seemed History Channel quality to me.  Then, the more I read the more things started to make sense to me.  Then they turned interesting. Then they turned believable. And Ive told many people, including my own offspring, about those ideas.  You plant seeds that themselves grow and plant seeds.  Many times we do not know about the seeds we plant and we never see the fruit those offspring bare.</p>

<p>PS: I also love cats.</p>

<p>Feel good that you are doing good and spreading good.  Good seeds take root in good soil and grow good things!  Peace.</p>

<p>Your words…not mine. </p>

<p>Btw…the topic of this post was the &quot;belief&quot; in the &quot;supernatural&quot;. If you can provide some verifiable &quot;evidence&quot; of the &quot;supernatural&quot; then your comment makes sense. In the context of this post/thread there is no &quot;evidence&quot; for the &quot;belief&quot;.</p>

<p>Not THE government, all governments in the entire planet, and all organized powers throughout human history. They thought the world was flat, certain astronomers were brave enough to prove otherwise, and now we&#39;re back to square one with some people.</p>

<p>The magnetic compass was invented in like 300 BC or some shit (I&#39;m not gonna Google, but it was a long ass time ago.) That&#39;s one hell of a conspiracy for the 2 over millennia worth of governments and feuding countries to agree on keeping the giant magnet they all colluded to bury in the center of the flat earth at the North Pole a secret.</p>

<p>This is the main problem that I have with flat Earthers, since there are many different theories by flat Earthers, which one is correct? To them is the moon also flat or is it round? Is the moon in the center of the &quot;flat Earth&quot; or off to the distance? These questions are important because our current model has answers and explanations for everything I listed so far. The only theory that makes sense is the globe theory.</p>

<p>Incorrect. I just gave you an example of something your model cannot explain, a lack of observable curvature between distant landmarks. Whether or not you think you can &quot;see&quot; curvature, it literally must exist at a constant and observable rate if we live on a giant ball.

<p>I&#39;m sorry mate but you&#39;re wrong here. The earth, as you think it exists has a well defined size, so we know what we should expect to see. There have been numerous high altitude balloon videos created in the last couple years, none of which show any perceivable curvature where there should be. </p>

<p>Why would the government launch a psy-op that:
1. Would potentially destroy their own credibility.
2. Threaten the scientific paradigm they&#39;ve established.
3. Potentially reconnect people with lost spiritual truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the FE theory is so far-fetched and ridiculous that it doesn&#39;t actually pose any threat <strong>whatsoever</strong> to the first two points you listed? The whole reason the government would &quot;launch&quot; the psy-op is because the earth is round and none of these are actually risks.</p>

<p>And since the third point you listed is very out of place, I suspect you are not grasping what people mean when they call it a psy-op. What is meant when people say that is FE theory is being pushed by people with an anti-conspiracy/freethinker agenda to create cognitive dissonance; the average person can see that the earth is not flat, and now that this theory is pushed the flat earthers can be lumped in with other theorists and can be used to discredit them. </p>

<p>There was a perfect example of this on the front page not too long ago, the thread was something along the lines of &quot;this sub is being ruined by psy-ops, this is not a flat-earth sub nor an anti-jewish one&quot;. It was highly upvoted; most people here do know that flat-earth is stupid and it is embarrassing to be linked to them, but by upvoting it they also discredit anti-zionist conspiracies which the OP conveniently lumped in with them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And <em>yet</em>, there was a post on the front page yesterday about how alien abductions can be induced by EM radiation.  Which, honestly, is kind of a major breakthrough in &quot;paranormal&quot; conspiracy theory, at least on this sub.</p>

<p>When I point out to someone here that it&#39;s more likely they had a stroke while sleeping than that little green men traveled millions of light years across the galaxy in order to land outside their window and paralyze them and shine bright lights in their faces, for some reason I get the idea that I&#39;m being quietly lumped into the category of &quot;government shill&quot; or &quot;paranormal denier&quot; or even &quot;transdimensional reptile&quot; by many of you.</p>

<p>And, yet, there it is, right on the front page of this sub.  A simple conspiracy that is <em>much</em> more likely than &quot;aliens&quot;.  Perpetrated by the CIA, no less -- your old foe.</p>

<p>You know, one of the first posts I made on this sub (several years ago) was on the topic of the reptilian complex, and how the character of the Incredible Hulk personified all of the traits of the &quot;reptilian&quot; psychology of the lizard brain.  I made that post just to point out one of the basic, old psychological truths that isn&#39;t necessarily taught in schools, but which has become institutional knowledge, in regular use today by all sorts of groups engaged in subtle mind-control -- religions, government, media, military, etc.  I also made it because I have had first-hand experience with some people who use the &quot;reptilian brain&quot; theory towards a potentially nefarious end, in practice.  And I thought some of you might need to learn about it.</p>

<p>Do you know what happened to that post?  A mod deleted it.</p>

<p>I know most of you think that you&#39;re solving some kind of grand conspiracy &quot;puzzle.&quot;  But you don&#39;t seem to consider the possibility that someone created that puzzle in the first place.  And that there are people guiding you along (even here) in the process of &quot;solving&quot; it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the <em>real</em> conspiracy.  Why is there even a puzzle, at all?  What game is really being played?</p>

<p>It&#39;s because <em>every</em> news outlet has only been raving about Trump and how he&#39;s &quot;literally Hitler&quot;.

I&#39;ve been posting a bit more recently after I stopped caring so much haha, but I try and keep all my discussions and debates healthy and constructive. And if I find my self engaged in conversation with someone who may use insults or ad homenim attacks, I simply calmly call them out on it, and continue the discussion without attacking them back. The point of discussion is to learn, right? Every now and then I let a bit of a deep-end crazy bomb comment drop in one of the main default subs just to see the responses I get. I have maybe a 10-20% chance of those getting upvotes haha, sometimes with a couple nasty messages, but who cares? It&#39;s just words from people who don&#39;t know me. I choose to not let that upset me. I&#39;m aiming those types of comments at the lurkers who are too nervous to reply, but curious enough to read through despite the automatic downvotes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in them, but I love reading about them and <em>never</em> shit on them. I&#39;ve been fascinated by them for a long, long time and have been reading this sub for them since well before this screename. I never crap on people who share and discuss them because <em>I like reading their stuff</em>, whether or not I actually believe myself.</p>

<p>So needless to say, I think it&#39;s a real shame that most of that stuff has disappeared and been replaced by the same damn political circlejerks day in and day out. This sub used to be filled with interesting people talking about interesting things. Now it&#39;s full of jackasses.</p>

<p>There has always been political stuff here - you can&#39;t separate discussions of politics and conspiracies, <em>nor should you</em> - but it came from a much different point of view than it does now.</p>

<p>The sub has taken a pretty bad turn.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you often can&#39;t say that, either. Comments like this are more and more getting removed by the mods. You can&#39;t openly discuss the state of the sub. It&#39;s weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Months? Try years. Believe it or not the amount of astroturfing and trolling / ridicule levied against this sub and its users was actually worse a few years back, when I was still a mod here. I attribute this largely to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> being allowed to link here directly at the time, and the subsequent brigading that would take place on pretty much a daily basis, so rampant and blatant that sub is now prohibited by the admins from posting links to here directly. Unfortunately, r/TopMindsOfReddit is still allowed to do so, in spite of the routine brigading as a result, and now for some inexplicable reason they are no longer required to append &#39;np&#39; (no participation) to their threads, pretty much inviting their userbase to brigade here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At times we just have to accept that some people are so heavily indoctrinated in their beliefs, whether it be religion, politics or what have you, they are unable to reasonably consider any alternatives. For some, it&#39;s simply due to their own lack of information on the subject, for others a result of conditioning. A portion, on the other hand, know what they say is deceptive and insincere, and will do so solely for personal gain or to promote an agenda, these are the individuals I have little respect for. As for the rest, and perhaps even those who do so with an apparent agenda, I don&#39;t really take any of it personally, and see no reason to hate them for their beliefs, over something as trivial.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you&#39;ve answered your own question.

<p>Note, I also qualified that statement with the words &quot;I suspect they are comprised of&quot; implying this is what I suspect is the case but am not entirely certain of, objectively.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I would like to make it clear I am not one automatically proclaim anyone who disagrees with me is a &quot;shill&quot; by default. My interactions in this sub and on reddit reflect this as well, as I do not refer to others as such, nor consider it appropriate to do so in the spirit of open debate and civil discourse. What I was describing, and what you took out context to make the aforementioned claim, was what I believe be the bulk of the userbase of a particular subreddit to be comprised of, a subreddit whose sole intent is to make a mockery of this sub, its subscribers and anyone with vaguely similar beliefs, by cherry-picking unfavorable examples of a minority of its nearly half of a million subscribers and making them all as well as anyone with similar beliefs appear fringe, racist and illogical by association.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a point. He is quite literally obsessed with this subreddit and ridiculing conspiracies, not occasionally, but on a daily basis. I suspect a form of mental illness. It isn&#39;t healthy for one to obsess over a group you are diametrically opposed to, and dedicate that much time and effort to &quot;mocking&quot; or discrediting them, at least not to that extreme. I would actually find it amusing and enjoy a laugh with them, were it not such a sad state of existence.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, it would appear <a href="/u/Shredder13">/u/Shredder13</a> didn&#39;t like his sub being called out as it was, and decided to cry about it to <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> (as usual):</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/6bjhjp/top_minds_try_to_blame_others_for_their_safe/">https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/6bjhjp/top_minds_try_to_blame_others_for_their_safe/</a></p>

<p>Since that post was created, the vote count in this thread has been skewed in favor of their point of view. In other words, he and his sub have been caught brigading here, yet again, a blatant violation of Reddit&#39;s terms of service, and an offense that will typically result in one&#39;s account being banned (or shadowbanned).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What has happened is the Mandela Effect is still gaining traction by the day and so now it seems the paid shills target post in the sub that are easiest to make a joke out of. </p>

<p>I know many think it&#39;s a false memory thing, but I know it&#39;s more than that at this point and it seems the &quot;professional&quot; propagandist are out to suppress the whole thing as people are stupid and that it&#39;s a product of collective false memory. </p>

<p>We have kind of become a mini R/conspiracy with a focus on the Mandela Effect as it seems no other place wants to even talk about the subject other than YouTube and ton&#39;s on there often make a joke out of it. I thought for a while this was a joke as well, but there are some things one doesn&#39;t forget and also &quot;Flip-flop&#39;s&quot; are really something else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s a term for when a memory first goes &quot;wrong&quot;, then goes &quot;right&quot; again. Flipping between two memories. For example, a famous movie quote would seemingly be said differently in the film but then a few months later it&#39;s correct again.</p>

<p>A MandelaEffect -term, for the side that believes it&#39;s more supernatural than something more grounded like memory issues.</p>

<p>Personally I feel it&#39;s a memory thing but possibly amplified by something like a &quot;bad chemical&quot; in a daily product or maybe spending too much time online which does actually affect our long and short term memory. Something we think is not dangerous but a 100 years from now people will laugh at how stupid we were, kind of like cigarettes being good for you.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t talked about enough and to me it&#39;s the only thing that makes sense if we wanna talk about it being more than &quot;oops I forgot&quot;: We stare at a blue screen all day (which affects our sleepcycle hence the popularity of apps like Flux which reduce the blue light from our flat screens), all of the &quot;Effects&quot; started around when smartphones became popular (early 2010s) - what I mean is most people seem to feel that&#39;s the time period when things started to feel weird, it&#39;s a fact that the more you place your trust on &quot;Google/Wikipedia remembering&quot; the facts you forget the less your brain prioritices keeping anything in your memory since it thinks you can just Google that shit. That is why people&#39;s memories are going to shit. You no longer require effort to remember things so your brain just lets dumb memories of a 90s tv show dialogue just say &quot;bye&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying being online is the issue, it&#39;s the current tech/screens we stare. Blue light is not healthy to look at for hours a day, you&#39;re essentially staring at a led flashlight.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like a news aggregation site for conspiracy theorists. Think Drudge Report, but for people who are not partisan. that is potentially important for sharing information. We are able to reach a lot of people. That is worth staying here for, to wake people up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beautifully written. I know you may not know me well, and have disagreed over my PG thread removal, but this paragraph you wrote is why I agreed to mod here. I don&#39;t think conspiracy theorists need this sub for our own learning; we already have a pretty good idea of where to look for sources. It&#39;s still of benefit to us in learning more and questioning our own preconceived notions, but I think the largest benefit is to provide a counter-narrative to the defaults on reddit, to share the information we know with those who have never seen it, ideally in a way in which they won&#39;t just write us off. </p>

<p>This is why I echo your &quot;fuck leaving&quot; sentiment. Reddit is still the biggest public forum of it&#39;s kind, and if we leave en masse, we leave the narrative to be spun by who are left. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And fuck the censorship of Pizzagate material while we&#39;re at it...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, and we are trying to reach a solution with the admins on this. I generally try to leave PG material up, but there are those within the admins and a group of power mods on the defaults who would love nothing more than to use PI as an excuse to shut this sub down, or perhaps worse, put it in the hands of mods who would be much more censorious than us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a rather simple explanation for it.</p>

<p>People, in general, need to feel connected. In order to achieve this, they need to find something in common with those around them. The subscribers of this sub are no different. Everyone wants to feel like they are part of something. It doesn&#39;t matter if that <em>something</em> is small or big; it&#39;s about the individual perception of importance.</p>

<p>This sub is in a way unique because the notion of a conspiracy in itself holds no connective fibers in terms of party, creed, race, or ideology. Anything and everything can possess a measure of conspiracy as the they all possess one singular unifying factor; Power.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many people in this are connected to things outside of it that are very polarized; some are for abortion, others are not. Some are republican, others are democrats, some are independent. Some are straight, some are gay, some are trans. Every one of these things are hot button right now, especially on this website. Taking up a position or viewpoint is without fail going to attract someone who holds a contrary position; either to defend that position or to undermine the original topic.</p>

<p>This is where that need to feel connected to one another becomes an issue. Sure, if you&#39;re anti-abortion or pro-climate change, you&#39;re going to find someone who shares your views and if you see them those who share your view challenged, you&#39;re going to intervene, either by a simple upvote/downvote or by inserting a comment of your own. As the rivalry spreads, the original message gets lost among the numerous people getting caught up in posturing themselves to feel right and get the last word in. However, stop and ask yourself, &quot;Is what they said worth adding my two cents when we should be focusing on <em>&#39;this&#39;</em>?&quot;</p>

<p>It is, in itself, an irony in that the powers that be, the forces you so adamantly fight against want this very thing to happen; infighting and polarization. The longer you fight amongst yourselves is the longer the issues matter go unnoticed, unchallenged, and most importantly, unchanged.</p>

<p>The popularity of the Flat Earth theory doesn&#39;t bother me one bit, because all it means is there&#39;s more people who are opening up to ask even bigger questions about the world we live in. (Sure, it gets annoying how few of them will admit they&#39;re applying the curvature formula incorrectly, but we can all agree that NASA is definitely full of shit, right?)</p>

<p>So seek on, fellow truthers! Fighting over the questions we ask about our past and our present isn&#39;t helping us answer the questions we need to resolve about our future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much of this came from the mods giving Trump and the monsters over at The_Cheeto a full throated reception. It shouldn&#39;t be a surprise that this place went to shit when the mods happily let the place be overrun by all that trash. Once the backlash started, they either pinned stickies that had nothing to do with anything or actually tagged megathreads in a way they never had to that point. </p>

<p>The entire decline of this subreddit points right to the mods and their open willingness to bend over backwards for that specific Trump subreddit. Now that the backlash is in full effect, you never see those mods discussing what they did, taking ownership for it, or trying to repair the subreddit. They&#39;re just sitting back and hoping it&#39;ll all blow over without anyone holding them responsible for the downfall that they helped cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I have noticed that anything supernatural related is basically laughed at by the perceived &quot;majority&quot;. Or at least that&#39;s what they want it to look like. In my opinion I think they are trying to disrupt the conversations that make us question what we are the most! It is almost like if there isn&#39;t some kind of hard 100% undeniable fact then it should be laughed out of this sub. I can understand that sentiment because at the end of the day we want these crimes brought to justice and that cannot be done without cold hard evidence and facts. </p>

<p>But do you go in to churches in real life just to call everyone stupid for believing in god? Or do you just walk on by and let them do their own thing while you do yours? That is the attitude people need to take on. People need to stop caring about what people &quot;think&quot; this community looks like to the world. Because when they stroll in and see a bunch of insults being hurled instead of discussion that is a worse look than any of the &quot;crazy&quot; topics that get brought up.</p>

<p>Some of it I think is just people newer to this mind set because the recent political scandals drove a lot of people to the truth and the communities that seek it.  But other times I just can&#39;t fathom some of the hostility other than it either being an immature 14 year old or a paid disruptor. The professional narrative shifters at least are civil and try to feign credibility in the sub. But you can definitely see when their hot button topic comes up that they only have one answer for it and will not under any circumstances take another viewpoint on it.</p>

<p>I think it is to keep people from really embracing and understanding how much these talmud worshipping satanic elites are in to their sick ritualistic practices. But hey that&#39;s just my opinion and stuff. It is easy to just say &quot;damn shills&quot; but really I think it is just closed minded people believing they are &quot;awake&quot;. Anyone even 1/4 awake realizes they know NOTHING!</p>

The various CIA projects, Downing Street memo and related, the connection between American foreign intervention and the petrodollar, connections between CIA, toppling American democracies, and drug running to generate black funds, Mockingbird, Chomsky&#39;s ideas on manufacturing consent and the notion that our media is perhaps controlled in key aspects, bohemian grove and the bilderberg group... this shit is fascinating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just here, it&#39;s all of Reddit and it&#39;s pretty much cultural as a whole. </p>

<p>It is the categorical denial of the individual on a social level. </p>

<p>So if we are not individuals but rather a composite of all the groups we belong to, then we have to &quot;clean up&quot; the groups we belong to because they define us. </p>

<p>It&#39;s happening everywhere. </p>

<p>So when someone &quot;wakes up&quot; and starts to believe a few Conspiracy Theories, then they come here and don&#39;t agree with all of them. Instead of thinking &quot;I am an individual and that person is an individual, we can <em>both</em> be Conspiracy Theorists and both believe different things&quot;, They think, &quot;we are <strong>both</strong> conspiracy theorists, therefore we are both defined equally by the collective belief&quot;</p>

<p>So if they are going to join the group, they feel a need to make the group fit exactly what they believe, because they are socially defined by the group and not by their personal actions. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, there is clear evidence that other subs (pro-Trump) have been pushing these &quot;revelations&quot;. One of the mods from T_D even got busted when he forgot to switch accounts. Yet, this very sub just stopped talking about it all of a sudden...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dozens and dozens of threads happening because a paid private investigator says that there&#39;s more that he should be paid to investigate. Which leads to not only the conclusion that it must be true, but also that it can only mean one thing, regardless of whether that thing actually seems true. I don&#39;t care how insecure your email server is, a random staffer having access to everyone&#39;s mailbox files is laughable. And if your email server IS that insecure, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d actually be technically capable of telling who accessed it.</p>

<p>I happily invite everyone on Reddit that believes this is doable to try and download their company&#39;s mail files, see what happens.</p>

<p>Just don&#39;t spread the info about CST existing <em>too wide</em>, we don&#39;t want too big of an influx of users from main subs into our quiet little abode. </p>

<p>But anybody with an open-mind, willing to abide by the rules of that sub (especially the premise rule, where you cannot argue against a thread with a premise flair, as those threads are used for brainstorming purposes) and willing to be 100% respectful (no exceptions) is welcome for sure :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the discussion steers towards psudoscience and assumptions without real world grounding then I get annoyed at shitposting. Flat earthers, donut earther as OP called it, have been proven wrong time and time again, their claims do no pasd the basic shit tests and there for it is time to move on. The &quot;fake&quot; moonlandings for example, sure is a lot of effort to go and create so many fake images and vides from the time when special effects were not that great, esp considering todays top tier millions of dollars cgi in AAA blockbuster films still looks odd. The claims that need fewest assumptions and that are backed by reasonable logic, scientific basis and grounded in this wordly ongoings deserve to be discussed. Things that carry little proof, or have stacks of proof against them are not worth the time to be spent going over and over again. Claims of exsestantial existence, gods, aliens, lizard people also need some sort of grounding in the real world and not hearsay and psudoscience, and what ifs. </p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with discussing aliens visits, flat earth manga, but the discussion should go further than opinions and personal attitudes on the matter. So many videos are posted that are just one person stating a claim and nothing is presented to back it up, or something is presented that is questionable valifity or carries little value in being beyond reasonble doubt. This isnt a court so to state a claim and not have it backed up is just opinions. And opinions that have been stated hunders of times and now are well known shitposts deserve to be downvoted. There is no sense going over and over the same irrelevent bullshit. </p>

Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve all but given up on r/conspiracy for anything even remotely related to the supernatural. I miss the days when conspiracy meant all conspiracies, not just political. If you want any good conversation on the subjects of paranormal (mainly personal experiences,) go check out r/thetruthishere. There&#39;s also r/aliens and r/ufos, although those aren&#39;t as active as r/conspiracy.</p>

I know politics is important because it goes hand in hand with conspiracies, but hot damn, it seems like now if it doesn&#39;t specifically deal with what&#39;s happening now, it&#39;s labeled a &quot;distraction to what&#39;s really going on&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a combination of the two, and in fairness some fringe content that is obvious to have no basis in reality (flat earth theory, for example) only serves to make the other content here, actual research into conspiracies with facts and evidence (i.e. 9/11) appear equally fringe and easy to dismiss by association. </p>
