    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it is journalists who are the problem. The problem is the handful of companies who hire the journalists they want to be reporting for MSM. A journalist is my most respected kind of person as they truly understand the necessity of what they do.</p>

<p>Government muzzling, black outs, and propaganda is why I find it hard to trust MSM. Horrible editing, click bait headlines with unsourced material, outright lies and irrelevant opinions make MSM entertainment not news.</p>

<p>I agree with all of that, although I would point out that the most nuanced, carefully researched journalism comes from MSM journalists and institutions: Christopher Hitchens-Vanity Fair, Chris Hedges-The New York Times, Glenn Greenwald-The Guardian <em>and</em> TMZ, Fox News, RT, Al-Jazeera, Buzzfeed and all the rest of that &quot;infotainment&quot; stuff all come under the umbrella of MSM don&#39;t they? </p>

<p>So would I, and I think David Simon should be in charge of it! (seriously he really should be), the problem i&#39;m interested in is: What could such an organization do to avoid being discredited, undermined, smeared or simply dismissed out of hand by conspiracy theorists?</p>

<p>Hands-on in the field reporting like how Vice used to be would be preferable. I want perspective and why people believe what they believe. Not the same talking heads who spew the same shit out everyday. </p>

<p>Let me ask you something OP, what makes you think the MSM has your interests in heart? All you are to them is an eye on television to sell advertising to. So here&#39;s the thing, is the media more geared towards the interests of advertisers or what you actually think?</p>

<p>Our media is bought and paid for by corporations, not people. However, there are independent journalists out there who are self-funded without advertiser influence. So maybe our media should be crowd-funded through Patreon or whatever, rather than corporate advertising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By using the phrasing &quot;you who dismiss the MSM out of hand,&quot; you are displaying a great example of what an ideal journalist wouldn&#39;t do: they wouldn&#39;t assume a position <em>before</em> searching for the facts. You are implying, from the get-go, that any dismissal of the MSM is out of hand. But you came here to find out the reasoning behind dismissing the MSM. Frankly, I don&#39;t believe any of us here will convince you of anything, it seems you&#39;ve already made up your mind about the situation.</p>

<p>But to address your concern directly, it isn&#39;t that MSM journalists aren&#39;t doing things that an &quot;ideal journalist&quot; would do; it&#39;s that many of them are doing things that an &quot;ideal journalist&quot; would <em>never</em> do.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s use pedogate as an example (whether you believe in the theories or not doesn&#39;t matter for this). An ideal journalist would look at the claims being made, do some investigating, and then report on exactly what they found without any theorizing or biased assumptions. </p>

<p>However, you might notice that many MSM articles, including even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory">wikipedia entry</a>, are more than happy to declare the issue &quot;debunked.&quot; Many journalists report with very high confidence that there is no truth to any of it.</p>

<p>And how are they so sure? Well, a journalist from the New York Times had an interview with James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong Pizza, the man at the center of the conspiracy theory, and asked him if any of it was true.</p>

<p>And lo and behold, he said no. From the NYT:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>None of it was true. While Mr. Alefantis has some prominent Democratic friends in Washington and was a supporter of Mrs. Clinton, he has never met her, does not sell or abuse children, and is not being investigated by law enforcement for any of these claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, maybe you agree with the NYT article, maybe you don&#39;t. But think about what is happening here: a journalist is investigating a claim that someone is a trafficker of children. They investigate this claim by going directly to the person being accused, asking them if it is true, and then blindly accepting his answer. And what further backs up Mr. Alefantis&#39; story? The fact that the police <em>aren&#39;t</em> investigating the claims!</p>

<p>If you told me that someone may have committed a crime and I responded by saying &quot;I know he didn&#39;t do it&quot; you may very well ask &quot;But how do you know?&quot; And if my answer was &quot;Because I asked him. Also, the police didn&#39;t ask him yet.&quot; Would you accept that as good enough? Is that &quot;ideal journalism&quot; at work? How is the fact that an official investigation <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been done proof that there is no crime? If anything it is proof that nobody really knows.</p>

<p>Many in the MSM are very, very far from ideal journalists, and almost anyone can see that if they look at the fine details. It is one thing to do an interview and then report exactly what was said in that interview. It is another thing completely to throw around words like &quot;debunked&quot; and &quot;fact-checked&quot; when all you have to go on is one interview with a person who, if truly guilty, would have every reason to lie to you.</p>

<p>I have no doubt you have come across someone in your life who didn&#39;t want to hear anything from the MSM, who really did dismiss them, or yourself, out of hand without careful consideration. And I&#39;m sorry about that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the MSM should be dismissed &quot;out of hand&quot;. I just don&#39;t believe they can be trusted. At best they can be rushed, lazy, or desperate to push sensational stories. At worst, they are working towards their own, or someone else&#39;s, agenda.</p>

<p>I hope that helps.</p>

<p>The question is addressed to people who do just that.
I&#39;m certainly not assuming a position on any particular news story and I like to think i&#39;m more cautious about verifying something before repeating it to others than the average guy. 
Again, the question is addressed to people who, if all the major networks and media outlets suddenly adopted the position that man-made climate change isn&#39;t happening....would suddenly decide that it is, after years of saying &quot;Al Gore gave an incorrect figure during one part of the presentation can&#39;t remember which, therefore man-made climate change is bullshit, and have you heard of Prof. James Lovelock?&quot; would suddenly turn around and decide that man-made climate change <em>is</em> happening. (people who see what they wish to see, hear what they want to hear, I want them to walk me through how their ideal journalist would operate).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are implying, from the get-go, that any dismissal of the MSM is out of hand</p>

<p>I certainly didn&#39;t mean to imply that and I certainly wouldn&#39;t agree with it, the prevelance of &quot;out of hand dismissals&quot; and consequences of that are what interests me.</p>

They investigate this claim by going directly to the person being accused, asking them if it is true, and then blindly accepting his answer. And what further backs up Mr. Alefantis&#39; story? The fact that the police aren&#39;t investigating the claims!
If you told me that someone may have committed a crime and I responded by saying &quot;I know he didn&#39;t do it&quot; you may very well ask &quot;But how do you know?&quot; And if my answer was &quot;Because I asked him. Also, the police didn&#39;t ask him yet.&quot; Would you accept that as good enough? Is that &quot;ideal journalism&quot; at work? How is the fact that an official investigation hasn&#39;t been done proof that there is no crime? If anything it is proof that nobody really knows.</p>

<p>This is an example of the MSM doing an atrocious job, not an out of hand dismissal of the MSM, we&#39;re on the same page with this one particular example of terrible investigative journalism btw </p>

<p>I have no doubt you have come across someone in your life who didn&#39;t want to hear anything from the MSM, who really did dismiss them, or yourself, out of hand without careful consideration</p>

<p>more than one..........many.....many more</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t believe the MSM should be dismissed &quot;out of hand&quot;. I just don&#39;t believe they can be trusted. At best they can be rushed, lazy, or desperate to push sensational stories. At worst, they are working towards their own, or someone else&#39;s, agenda.</p>

<p>Not much to disagree with there haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody can be truly objective with advertisers backing them, or with higher-ups enforcing a narrative. I don&#39;t know what the solution is because people need to make a living. </p>

<p>I just know that when one reporter says one thing happened, another will say something else, and if you watch the whole video it&#39;s usually nothing as sensational as the headlines. </p>
