<p>If the school was closed, were those all faked? Is the conspiracy so big that they got the local newspapers to print fake articles 3 and 4 years in advance of the shooting? And if that was the case, does every single person in the town have to be in on it, since as soon as they read the article they would have known it was faked?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following it since the very first thread about it that appeared on this subreddit during the DNC leaks. And I&#39;ve been discussing it with people on here ever since, and have seen all the new &quot;evidence&quot; as it comes in on here, 4chan, and voat. You&#39;ll have to accept that you and I probably just see the &quot;evidence&quot; very differently. The emails, the instagram/facebook pictures, and everything else that has come out since...none of it do I find even slightly convincing that they are pedophiles or running a child sex trafficking ring.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea we do see it differently. I was open to it being real (I didn&#39;t really think it was realistically possible at first, But there&#39;s simply too much of it). </p>

<p>And you aren&#39;t open to it being real. You are probably unconsciously assuming it <em>has</em> to be fake since you are worried of looking like a loony. You didn&#39;t actually explain why you don&#39;t think the evidence isn&#39;t convincing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If something does eventually come out that&#39;s actually solid, then I&#39;m open to seeing things differently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This argument is hilariously dumb. The only thing that could be more solid of evidence is if a video of Podestas raping kids came out. And <em>then</em> you become <em>open</em> to the possibility of it being real is.... Yea...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is becoming typical. The people shouting loudest &quot;X is happening&quot; are the ones doing it in the first place. Half the posts on the front page of this subreddit right now are also on the trump subreddit, same links and titles and everything. I see very little here about the negative Trump news when it dominates discussion almost everywhere else except, you guessed it, the Trump subreddit. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has become another place they can manipulate. And I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s negative motives for the mods, but based on their beliefs and opinions they&#39;re probably happy about the obvious change in this community over the past year. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s censorship going on here, I think the majority of the users here are Trump supporters and just voting as they would anywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe because Israel and Saudi Arabia are our #1 and #2 countries we export arms to. Not only do we supply Cluster munitions that we manufacture (illegal to use, but not sell!) to the Sauds but we give them up to date satellite feeds when they drop them on Yemen. To date the U.S. Airforce has provided over 3,000 in air refueling missions for Saudi planes while they drop (banned cluster munitions) on another sovereign nation (Yemen) and the international community / UN looks the other way. The UN also doesn&#39;t mind that US and Saudi have imposed a naval blockade on the country blocking everything including food and medicine. The reason given? The medicine &#39;might fall in to the wrong hands&#39;.  20 Million civilians are starving as a result, and now there is a cholera outbreak, hundreds infected in the last few days alone. The UN is apparently okay with this. Iran hasn&#39;t invaded anyone since the late 1700&#39;s. Get your shit straight.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s possible, but not for the reason you and/or most people who believe the Russian/Trump administration stuff probably think.</p>

<p>If Hillary <em>had</em> won then yeah, there would probably be lots of posts about her here specifically because the mainstream media and the rest of reddit would absolutely <em>not</em> be talking about her doing anything that might be even remotely suspicious. Not even necessarily anything Trump has done or is doing.</p>

<p>Part of the reason this sub comes off as being resistant to the Trump/Russia stuff is because it&#39;s being talked about literally <em>everywhere else.</em> It&#39;s incredibly mainstream. It&#39;s probably the only &quot;conspiracy&quot; that&#39;s being shoved down everyone&#39;s throats everywhere and all the time.</p>

<p><em>That&#39;s why</em>. 99% of us come here to talk about the stuff that isn&#39;t being talked about everywhere else. The stuff that isn&#39;t constantly on the front page of reddit. The stuff that isn&#39;t being talked about 24/7 on the news.</p>

<p>Because of that, it gets incredibly frustrating when all of a sudden everytime we try to talk about stuff that isn&#39;t being talked about everywhere else, there&#39;s the same people downvoting and telling us that we&#39;re distracting from what &quot;needs attention&quot; as if it&#39;s not already the focus of basically the <em>whole damn worlds</em> attention.</p>

<p>We&#39;re called Trump supporters or Russians for not wanting the front page of this sub to be nothing but the same exact articles and conversation that&#39;s on politics, news, or worldnews. Or we&#39;re called &quot;comrade&quot; and spoken to in broken English by people who think they&#39;re not <em>actually</em> calling us shills as long as they don&#39;t use the word &quot;shill&quot; when that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re doing - and it&#39;s because we like the sub the way basically every other conspiracy forum in the history of forever has been: for stuff the mainstream media doesn&#39;t <em>want</em> to talk about.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are Trump supporters who understand what I&#39;m saying and agree, but there&#39;s plenty who aren&#39;t. Everytime I, or someone else try to explain this, we aren&#39;t believed by the people who want us to only talk shit about Trump or Russia, but I&#39;ve been subbed here for probably about 7 years now, and other conspiracy forums before that and I&#39;m telling the truth. That&#39;s all I can do, really, and hope that at some point the people coming here just for Trump and Russia understand that it&#39;s not that all of us just love Trump and Putin. It&#39;s not even because a lot of us don&#39;t believe it, I&#39;m sure there are people who do believe it and who would also agree with what I&#39;m saying. It&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t <em>need</em> to be here, it doesn&#39;t <em>need</em> this subs attention, it&#39;s literally everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Parts of the MSM would be talking about her 24x7 as they did before (fox/brietbart/washington times/etc).</p>

<p>As far as being called things I am called a shill/etc when I don&#39;t agree with people. Mods/others say things are being bridaged when others upvote/downvote things. But they don&#39;t care if that brigading is done by pro-trump people.</p>

<p>And sure, I get you don&#39;t want the front flooded with trump stuff - but no one cares if it is hillary shit. And the mods don&#39;t flair those posts.</p>

<p>What I (and my uncle) have seen over time is that this sub has went from being conspiracy based about TPTB and Obama/etc to totally laying down and believing the TPTB (I mention my uncle because I live with him now and he turned me onto conspiracies over the years and has done radio shows and such on them - but was banned here because of a trump post before the election).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why. 99% of us come here to talk about the stuff that isn&#39;t being talked about everywhere else. The stuff that isn&#39;t constantly on the front page of reddit. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can partially get that, but my thoughts when I came here were that those things would be talked here but in a different light. Just because some other place talks about news doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t. I don&#39;t trust the man (don&#39;t trust hillary either but she isn&#39;t the one with power now). </p>

<p>I see this sub less and less as focusing on conspiracies and more now about defending the most powerful man in the world against any criticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now here&#39;s a comment I can get behind. Very well put. As I let your words sink in, I started to wonder about something else though, that the current administration and GOP houses are so absurdly run atm it simply has to be all over the place because most people can&#39;t make heads or tales out of it. The denial of facts and calling everything that doesn&#39;t fit a narrative &#39;fake news&#39; makes the search for truth a lot harder and people crave for an basic level of understanding for what&#39;s going on. Hence the &#39;polluting&#39; of this sub with posts about the current administration, mostly because, I believe,  Trumps antics go beyond previously considered possible. Hence truth has become stranger then fiction at this point.</p>

On the contrary I&#39;ve seen anti-democrat posts with no comments on the front page while real time news of this real or fake conspiracy.
