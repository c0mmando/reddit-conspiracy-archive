        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s consider the article as truth.... I&#39;m still plagued with so many questions. And for fucks sake please don&#39;t call me T_D 2.0 because I&#39;m questioning this story... I&#39;m not denying that there MIGHT POSSIBLY be some kind of Russia-Trump link- however, after reading this article, any critical thinker should be left scratching their head... </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Were the US officials cited in the story sitting in the meeting with Trump and the ambassador to hear him share this information? By basic deductive reasoning, we can assume that at least some of the officials weren&#39;t because WaPo cites current and FORMER officials. Why would FORMER officials be allowed in that meeting? How are they still getting information if they&#39;re no longer in the White House? Wouldn&#39;t it be considered a breach to give intel to people who are no longer government officials? How can they remain privy to this kind of info but other intel agencies are not? </p></li>
<li><p>Why did they think it was a good idea to go to the WaPo about it and give them all of the information they need for a headlining story?? Obviously this news will reach ISIS and give them a warning that the US and now Russia have some kind of intel related to a laptop and a plane.. That&#39;s pretty specific information for a newspaper to be sharing, and to me seems more dangerous to our operations than the information being shared with an ambassador in a private meeting since it&#39;s much more publicly available... but what do I know</p></li>
<li><p>If we’re arming ISIS to fight Assad’s soldiers (we are), while fighting ISIS at the same time, does that make us an ISIS ally or enemy? If Russia is helping Assad defeat ISIS, does that make them ISIS allies or enemies? If Trump shared critical information about ISIS with the Russians, couldn’t that be seen as sharing intelligence on a common enemy? If Russia is fighting ISIS, why would sharing intel on them be a danger to American intelligence or America in general for that matter? Why would a source reconsider cooperating if their info was shared with a country whose allegedly fighting the enemy they provided the info on? Tagging onto that - WHO ARE OUR ALLIES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS? Israel?... </p></li>
<li><p>Who is this US partner that provided us with the information? If the partner isn’t a governmental body, why do they get to determine how their information is used? Would they have even known that this information was shared with the ambassador if it weren&#39;t for this article? If so, how? Do they have a mole inside the WH or some kind of bugs? I can&#39;t come up with a logical explanation as to how the source would have ever found out about this if it weren&#39;t for some kind of WH insiders leaking info... </p></li>
<li><p>How did the author/officials know that the partner who provided the info didn’t give permission to share the information? Have they been in contact with the partner? If the officials (former and current) had been in contact with the partner, wouldn&#39;t that mean that the source themselves and their info isn&#39;t as classified as we&#39;re being told they are? Did the partner allow the WaPo to write an article about the sharing of this classified info since it clearly gives away some key details to what they shared with us?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have some more thoughts that I&#39;ll try to add later but I gotta get back to work for now... Keep your critical thinking caps on guys and gals, the information war keeps getting better by the day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Than you have no real understanding of how politics, the intel community, Washington D.C. and human psychology work on a massive scale. Insiders talk to relorters of the record for many reasons, mainly money or to further agendas. Thats how it has always been and will always be. Its how human beings work, and you really need to understand that quickly. I&#39;m so sick of hearing people suggesting that there is anything wrong with that. Notice how the press was used as evidence at the last Russian-Collusion hearing, referring to Trump being warned by Obama not to hire Flynn. Its because people DO say things off the record, for personal gain and patriotism. This &quot;shoot the messenger&quot; rhetoric thats been spreading around the far right subs (like this one now i guess), is fucking AWFUL for everyone and goes against everything this sub used to stand for.</p>

Except its not? Its not organized and its not everyone. But people do talk be it secretaries, janitors, IT guys, FBI guys, senators, presidents, etc. The only way to get THAT out of politics is to get humans out of politics considering its human error. As for me, Id rather know as many facts as possible about as many things as possible rather than accept we live in a world where shady things never surface because we stopped all of the surpremely &quot;evil&quot; leakers and sent them all to jail. Dont be ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s so many red flags with this whole situation</p>

<p>Seth Rich&#39;s story was clearly pushed here, but the Trump story was clearly pushed to everyone else, and they all have a <em>lot</em> of inconsistencies or otherwise reasons to be wary of the information, but this probably is the biggest red flag of them all.</p>

<p>If this was such privileged information, why would this be a good idea to give to the press? And why on Earth would you go into that much detail? No one would&#39;ve known the details to the intel if this wasn&#39;t ran in the news and blamed on Trump. Trump didn&#39;t tell the entire planet what the intel was, he told Russia, who is a common enemy of ours against ISIS. This intel SOUNDS like it should&#39;ve been shared to everyone, including our allies, I don&#39;t understand why it wasn&#39;t shared more openly.</p>

<p>The fact that WaPo felt the need to say &quot;The source might be in danger&quot; just tells ISIS they have a leak they wouldn&#39;t have known about if it wasn&#39;t for this story</p>

The only piece of evidence Wheeler provides to Fox, other than his own belief, is an anonymous source in the police department who &quot;looked at me straight in the eye and said, &#39;Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can&#39;t share any information with you.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Think about it... they admit that the President has the authority to declassify any secrets he wants and thus has broken no laws. Nothing in this story can lead to his impeachment.</p>

<p>Every member of ISIS that has spoken to another member about using a laptop to attack an aircraft is now looking at the other people involved and wondering if they&#39;re a CIA mole.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a straight up denial. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/16/donald-trump-russia-shared-information">“As president, I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled WH meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety,” Trump wrote. “Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against Isis and terrorism.”</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s one or the other.</p>

<p>Of course there might be- but they are grasping at straws trying to find evidence of it.  If there&#39;s an illegal connection- the NSA KNOWS about it.  And if it&#39;s true, they should have nipped that shit in the bud well before we got to this point.  </p>

<p>And even if it&#39;s NOT an illegal connection, but just an unsavory one, like business deals- how the hell are we in this position where he is allowed to simultaneously be allowed to maintain a shady business empire while playing figurehead of US politics.  This stinks!</p>

<p>But the idea of him making some comment to Lavrov about a laptop plot being some national security fiasco, is so overthetop ridiculous.  And that WaPo supposedly knowns even more details than trump gave in his meeting- but is unwilling to release it to the public, is infuriating.  Is the media supposed to protect the people from a corrupt and abusive government?  I always thought to- but it seems like their goal is to distract and incite and provoke flame wars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the official felt that they had to prove that there was some meat to this and felt the risk of leaking it to WaPo was worth it in order to hinder Trump releasing information in the future.  McMasters evasive defense was also suspicious; denying things that weren&#39;t claimed in the article and neither confirming nor denying the things that were claimed.  Then right on cue we had Trump&#39;s ambiguous tweet of the day which seemed to imply he has the &quot;absolute right&quot; to leak whatever he wants.   </p>

<p>Every day feels more and more like a reality TV show with scripted cliffhangers at the end of every episode. We get just enough dirt on both sides of the drama to leave us in suspense, not knowing who is the good guy and who is the bad guy; or if there even is a good guy and instead it&#39;s all just about either faction&#39;s malevolent agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trump/Russia narrative has been fraught with logical inconsistencies since its inception.</p>

<p>Is that because &quot;the establishment&quot; is actually fighting for their lives, and are clinging to the one angle that could neutralize their enemy, vis-a-vis impeachment?</p>

<p>Or is that because &quot;the establishment&quot; is in full control, and this is presented to make us think that they&#39;re fighting for their lives, all while eating as many numbers of their own as necessary to maintain control?</p>

<p>Or is there no &quot;establishment&quot;, and this is simply a different sect of Oligarchical interests, fighting a clandestine war for control of the purse strings and law books of this country, and both sides are trying to exterminate the other through the facade of foreign policy, tax codes, and intelligence agency feats of espionage?</p>

<p>Or, are the glaring plot holes attributable to human nature and confirmation bias, and Trump really did sell us down the river to Russia (to pay off some outstanding debt he had accumulated through numerous bankruptcies, in the same way that the Clintons have used the mechanism of the state to enrich themselves and cover for their nefarious business dealings) and no ones driving this ship and the world is run by the same type of idiot fuckups as your boss at work, and there is no all seeing eye controling your day to day life because that person probably can&#39;t even control their own idiot teenage son, the way none of us can do much because we&#39;re all clueless souls walking around in quickly decaying meatsacks trying to give meaning to an otherwise mind boggling existence seemingly born from the dust of nothingness into the mystery that is life?</p>

<p>Who fucking knows man.</p>

<p>Possibly. Per CNN: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/16/politics/trump-russian-officials-meeting-what-we-know/"><strong>Who was in Trump&#39;s meeting with the Russians?</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be considered a breach to give intel to people who are no longer government officials? How can they remain privy to this kind of info but other intel agencies are not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SEE BELOW</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did they think it was a good idea to go to the WaPo about it and give them all of the information they need for a headlining story?? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed - the info was SO SENSITIVE that it was DANGEROUS to give it to <strong><em>DA RUSSIANS!</em></strong>, but it&#39;s perfectly cool for the Washitn&#39; Post to MEGAPHONE it to the world? Suspicious motives at work here. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obviously this news will reach ISIS and give them a warning that the US and now Russia have some kind of intel related to a laptop and a plane.. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you see the <strong>source</strong> of the &quot;intel&quot;, this might all make more sense. </p>

<p><strong>Also, does Russia not have airliners? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrojet_Flight_9268">Didn&#39;t one of those planes CRASH under &quot;suspicious circumstances&quot;</a> over Egypt on On 31 October 2015?</strong> If the threat is real <em>(IF)</em>, why would we NOT want to give <strong>other countries</strong> a heads-up - including Russia? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s pretty specific information for a newspaper to be sharing, and to me seems more dangerous to our operations than the information being shared with an ambassador in a private meeting since it&#39;s much more publicly available</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously neither the &quot;leaker&quot; nor the <strong>WaShit Post</strong> cared about any damage to intel and security from divulging the info - or they would have kept their mouths shut. They were interested in doing damage to Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we’re arming ISIS to fight Assad’s soldiers (we are), while fighting ISIS at the same time, does that make us an ISIS ally or enemy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Yes to both. </p>

<p>ISIS was Bred and Fed by the US to give the &quot;West&quot; an excuse to stay active in Syria after the botched False Flag attack - <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-Syrian-rebel-forces-trained-by-West-are-moving-towards-Damascus-324033"><strong>perpetrated by the US and Israel</strong></a> - in Ghouta, 
Syria in 2013. Before then, no one had ever HEARD of &quot;ISIS&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Russia is helping Assad defeat ISIS, does that make them ISIS allies or enemies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russia is TOTALLY HATED by ISIS - who was doing <em>just fine</em> playing the little proxy-war game while the US pussy-footed around - pretending to fight them... But when Russia came back (after being <em>distracted</em> by the Ukraine fiasco), <strong><em>Russia and Assad kicked ISIS ass</em></strong>. Totally pissed the US, the Turkey and ESPECIALLY the Israelis off!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Trump shared critical information about ISIS with the Russians, couldn’t that be seen as sharing intelligence on a common enemy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if the US is <em>really</em> fighting ISIS. Remember, this whole &quot;Syrian Civil War&quot; is fake - it was started as a COUP by the Mossad, CIA and other &quot;Western&quot; nations to get rid of Assad for <strong>ISRAEL&#39;S BENEFIT</strong>.</p>

<p>Former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas explains in this 2 minute clip from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz-s2AAh06I"><strong>live French television.</strong></a></p>

<p>It seems possible that Trump is either VERY STUPID - or - that no one has TOLD him that this whole thing is Israel&#39;s charade - and in this case, Israel and Russia DO NOT share common interests. Israel is VERY UNHAPPY that Russia is fucking with their Game to take out Assad and snatch part of Syria.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Russia is fighting ISIS, why would sharing intel on them be a danger to American intelligence or America in general for that matter? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would a source reconsider cooperating if their info was shared with a country whose allegedly fighting the enemy they provided the info on? Tagging onto that - <strong>WHO ARE OUR ALLIES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS? Israel?...</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, Israel is NOT &quot;fighting ISIS&quot; - indeed, they have been underhandedly SUPPORTING and actively aiding <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/06/israel-s-ties-to-syria-s-rebels-provoke-mob-violence-in-the-golan"><strong>Jihadist groups such as al Nusra</strong></a> (an al Qaeda branch) that the US considers TERRORIST organizations because these are fighting Assad - and <a href="https://archive.is/U3S1B">Israel wants Assad DEAD.</a> </p>

<p>So, Who is REALLY fighting ISIS? Primarily Syria, Russia, Hezbollah, Iran, and Iraq - all enemies of ISRAEL.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who is this US partner that provided us with the information?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NY Times - Today: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/world/middleeast/israel-trump-classified-intelligence-russia.html">Israel Said to Be Source of Secret Intelligence Trump Gave to Russians</a></p>

<h1>SURPRISE!</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>If the partner isn’t a governmental body, why do they get to determine how their information is used?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they&#39;re Israel. Duh! /s</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would they have even known that this information was shared with the ambassador if it weren&#39;t for this article? If so, how? Do they have a mole inside the WH or some kind of bugs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Israel has moles in EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY of every facet of the US Government - in the White House, in Congress, in the Military, in Intelligence, in every bureau you can think of (and some you can&#39;t). They also have moles and agents in EVERY major news media organ - including the WaShit Post.</p>

<p>You can bet that it was a Zionist mole who reported the <em>&quot;leak to da Russians&quot;</em> to the WaShit Post. On the bright side, if the &quot;intelligence&quot; came from Israel, there&#39;s a VERY good chance that it was eiher fabricated or tainted. Remember, Israel is not fighting ISIS, their enemies are fighting ISIS - and that includes Russia. </p>

<p>Finally, Israel is NO ALLY of the United States. They and their Zionist operatives are a back-stabbing, abusive, duplicitous leech that uses the US as a $ugar Daddy and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem"><strong>Golem</strong></a> to fight their wars FOR them (Iraq, Libya, Syria), and as a Political Tool to pressure OTHER countries into serving Zionist interests.</p>

<p>They are embedded to the HILT in the US - and have similarly infested all of Europe, and many other countries around the world.</p>

<p>It seems that lately, the media, both political parties and government are all working full time and in cooperation to <strong><em>distract enrage, confuse, divide and conquer</em></strong> aimed at the Peasantry.</p>

<p>And it seems to be working - people are so overwhelmed that they are becoming dull-eyed and exhausted.</p>
