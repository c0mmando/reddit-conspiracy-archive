    <div class="md"><p>Cause if you get digging into Hillary you actually hit paydirt... it is satisfying to sift thru stuff and make some interesting connections... but we went thru all of that with Trump here like 7 months ago... and we hit some connections... but nothing new... every conspiracy theory ya see on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or on the news... we made those connections long ago... old news... and not nearly as juicy as what you find on HRC. </p>

<p>In the end... digging up HRC&#39;s dirt is immensely more satisfying because of the huge amount of data to sift thru... and she&#39;s spent much of her life in a more influential and well documented position. </p>

All authority should be questioned, but Donald really gets a pass here, and I really am disappointed this is T_D lite. </p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t he come out with Clinton&#39;s crimes? He clearly doesn&#39;t mind sharing classified info, and is with in his means to do so. How about 9/11? Barrack being a Kenyan? Benghazi? </p>

<p>But no, don&#39;t question the god emperor. I know I swing left and questioned Obama and could understand why some people hated him, but damn if I&#39;m not watching the rise of orange Hitler, or the fall of America, or the rise of a new generation of Americans and all we can talk about is how a failed presidential candidate may be tied to a murdered staffer.</p>

<p>I think r/t_d is basically nothing but paid shills and Russians.

<p>Trump dealings with Russia if true, are nothing interesting, yet.</p>

<p>There is no underlying conspiracy about Russian government controlling the world or w/e. Not to say that there aren&#39;t ways to think of it, but for the last 50+ years the massive MSM machine has been blasting people with anti-Russian propaganda, that much is recognized here.
