       Cause if you get digging into Hillary you actually hit paydirt... it is satisfying to sift thru stuff and make some interesting connections... but we went thru all of that with Trump here like 7 months ago... and we hit some connections... but nothing new... every conspiracy theory ya see on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or on the news... we made those connections long ago... old news... and not nearly as juicy as what you find on HRC.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end... digging up HRC's dirt is immensely more satisfying because of the huge amount of data to sift thru... and she's spent much of her life in a more influential and well documented position.

       Kinda cause we have CNN, CBS, ABC, MSNBC and about every other major news outlet already drawing spurious Trump/Russia connections all on their own... They burnt thru all of our research already... and I guess now they are just making shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But late last year on this sub had some great Trump conspiracies we dug deep into... good times... I fondly remember comparing tarmac design and tree patterns with images from google maps to try to prove Trump and a Russian oligarch were at the same airport at the same time... fun fun fun.

       That is not what I am saying. You are making a different argument so that you can discredit my statement in the title.

       Anti-Trump = Russia conspiracy, obviously.

       You took care of discrediting yourself while also revealing your intent by stating the Seth Rich story broke today in your title.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had you actually taken a few minutes to confirm your theory, you'd have seen the Seth Rich story broke yesterday, an hour before the WaPo dropped their CIA distraction piece.

       Seriously, it's past due time we as Americans sat down with each other and said the R's and D's don't have the common man at heart any longer. You're not my enemy you are my fellow countryman, a brother or sister. I do too want to see this country fail anymore than you do. But we have to bring back working  with each other. We are all going to hang if we can't do this very very Soon.

       Agreed.  We all have to be mentally strong enough to see passed this petty stuff.  It's hard. I'm not immune to bias myself, but I try to check myself when I want to call someone out or talk shit.  It's just not helpful.  We gotta look at things from all angles and move in a more constructive direction.

       It's clear that conspiracy is being rigged. What the DNC did is fucked up, but this is a blatant "ooooo look at me" tactic. I'm really disappointed that this sub Reddit isn't digging into Donald more. All authority should be questioned, but Donald really gets a pass here, and I really am disappointed this is T_D lite.

       Why hasn't he come out with Clinton's crimes? He clearly doesn't mind sharing classified info, and is with in his means to do so. How about 9/11? Barrack being a Kenyan? Benghazi?

       But no, don't question the god emperor. I know I swing left and questioned Obama and could understand why some people hated him, but damn if I'm not watching the rise of orange Hitler, or the fall of America, or the rise of a new generation of Americans and all we can talk about is how a failed presidential candidate may be tied to a murdered staffer.

       Trump dealings with Russia if true, are nothing interesting, yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no underlying conspiracy about Russian government controlling the world or w/e. Not to say that there aren't ways to think of it, but for the last 50+ years the massive MSM machine has been blasting people with anti-Russian propaganda, that much is recognized here. So it's just not interesting to listen to the same old message.

       The moment something interesting about Trump dealings with Russia comes up, this sub will be all over it.

       The whole thing with Russia and Trump has been interesting for a while. I don't know what it takes, perhaps a giant list of every murder that Trump is connected to six degrees of Kevin Bacon style to get people here interested anymore

       I was talking in terms of those subs coming to r/conspiracy, not simply existing.  You're more than welcome to discuss Russia- go to any one of the hundreds of subs outside this one dedicated to that discussion- most people on conspiracy who have been here for a substantial amount of time see it for what it appears to be- a false narrative.

       Do you think bring down the president is as easy as herke is the evidence. Republicans threw a fit when Obama wore a grey suit, but half the shit that Trump is doing gets by with out a word said because his name ends with (R) party before country.

       While I will agree trump does and says some dumb shit,( I'm by no means a die hard for the guy ) he is at the same time getting slammed too hard for petty nonsense.  And that in and of itself is counter productive to what dems actually want.  When everything he does is scrutinized and blown out of proportion (two scoops ect)  people become numb to it all.  So when there's merited reason to be angry, it falls on deaf ears because people are getting used to it.

       It's so ridiculous how people can't grasp this. It's not right vs left. It's actually looking at the issues. One has more merit and is massively interesting with signs of people trying to cover it up, the other is similar shit that other presidents have done with media whipping up a new slant every other day......but, but, but we need to be mad because the TV told us so!
