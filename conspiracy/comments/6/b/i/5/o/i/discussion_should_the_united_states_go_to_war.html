       I know that generally we aren't fans of the Military Industrial Complex, foreign intervention, and war.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I also, as a prepper, am quite concerned about the ability of North Korea to attack our critical infrastructure with either a cyber attack (a la Stuxnet) or an EMP (either via submarine launched ballistic missile or one of their two satellites).
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this topic came up through the Gotham Shield discussions and threads, but I was wondering what the folks here have to say about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should we go to war with North Korea? If yes, should we go preemptively? If no, why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: aren't fans, not are

       Why would you want to go to war with a country who's only reason for posturing, is assholes like the US prodding them with a stick?

       Leave them alone, you wont even notice that they're on the planet with you... but of course nobody can ignore the US' thirst for Empire.

       First because there is no need for a war at all...period. Second because that would snowball into a war with China. Despite all you "John Wayne wannabe's" and "patriots" going to war with China is a
       <em>
        colossally bad
       </em>
       idea. The United State would end! Remember three things. One, China has a lot of Nuclear Weapons and the delivery system to make good use of them, unlike North Korea. Two, China has nearly twice as many military personal as the United States. Three, China is much closer friends of Russia then of the US. In short, the US will get their collective asses handed to them.

       I am chilled. Don't you know sarcasm when you see it? Obviously not. Besides, it's bad manners to correct small errors of that nature. As long as

       North Korea is good for comic relief. They obviously can't launch a missile correctly to save their life. China, on the other hand,
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are not to be fucked with - ever. Remember that in the Korean War of 1950 - 1953 the United States
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       defeat China.

       I don't think the missiles are the threat for us. Their threat is derived from the two supposed non-transmitting satellites that are orbiting - which don't need to transmit until they receive an attack order. They do have SLBM capability though. The easiest method of attack is, by far, a cyber attack from them. Our critical infrastructure is woefully prepared for it.

       The reality is that all this is just posturing and chest beating. Nothing will come of this. The websites/newsrooms/newspapers gain an audience and the advertisers gain attention. Also, some of the lesser educated people wet themselves a little - for nothing. Relax. Enjoy the show.

       Of course there is posturing involved in this, as is the case with all geopolitical events. BUt I do think this onehas a different air to it. I think if Lil' Kim has been in that echo chamber long enough, he might actually think he can win. That's where it gets dangerous.

       Before, they would just use it to get some from the international community. Just has a different feel these days, especially since they used to sit when China told them to - which isn't the case these days.

       I too was worried about an EMP from NK. Until the news started "warning" us that it's a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media has had over ten years to be warning us of the dangers of the 90% death toll of an EMP (which could literally happen at any time from the sun without warning). Over 50 years since they've known it could happen via a nuke. And over 150 years since they've known it could come from the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       They choose
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       to warn us? Why?? And why NK (or Iran)?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If
       </strong>
       an EMP hits us, the last thing any American citizen will be worried about is who's responsible. By that time, it won't matter who did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, if there were a
       <em>
        failed
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        partial
       </em>
       EMP attack, then having an assumed culprit in the back of your mind will keep you from investigating much further. Thus creating an immediate scapegoat for
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       An EMP over Atlanta, DC, wherever that doesn't envelop the entire country, could conveniently wipe out some sensitive data
       <em>
        permanently
       </em>
       and at the same time be a justification for war.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ask yourself. Who benefits from the American people fearing an EMP from one of the last countries that doesn't have a Rothschild style bank?

       Yes, a Carrington Style event could also have the same effect. But as you know, the US government is terrible at being proactive. We are more reactive, which is why I think it is being discussed now (when it could possible be too late).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the reason they choose those actors is because they are less rational than a Russia or a China. China and Russia would combine an asymmetrical attack (as a first strike) with a convention one IMO. Wouldn't be much effort to launch Stuxnet against our critical infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the self-inflicted false flag you suggest is certainly an option for exactly those reasons. It would be a hell of a messy false flag, but it would get the job done. I also think a North Korean attack is still a likely avenue though.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a prepper, I don't particularly care where it comes from, though attempting to mitigate the threat by pre-emptive strikes isn't particularly bad to me. I am just more concerned about being ready for it.

       I agree about the govt being reactive vs proactive. I haven't ruled out the possibility that it could be a part of a bigger plan. The few preppers who know about it might be one step ahead, but if enough people start to catch on, they'll start demanding action (hardening). Which in a rational persons mind, would be a great thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in an evil person's mind, why let the people tell you to spend a couple billion dollars to protect them against a weapon you've been hiding from them in your own arsenal? The greatest destructive weapon man has ever seen that could effectively wipe out 90% of any developed country, including your own, for whatever the reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it very well could be too late for all we know. That is definitely the scary part. And truthfully, even after something happens, it's likely we'll never know the real story. But for now it absolutely doesn't hurt to keep stacking water and shove some seeds in the back of your freezer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the only reason NK has lasted as long as they have is because they haven't used their nukes. The moment they use one, (or the moment people
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       they used one) their weird little universe of power will be over forever. Which is why I think they're the least likely. They've got the most to lose

       Yeah, if they are keeping it soft for a reason, they will find ways to burying the funding for the hardening. I see it as a can being kicked down the road. It isn't going to happen until we get hit with either  cyber attack probe or localized attack.

      <p>
       Scarily accurate. At that point, it probably doesn't even matter. I would imagine us getting hit by an EMP or cyber attack is going to trigger our own cyber weapons and/or nuclear weapons if they aren't disabled by this.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do have the most to lose, but I still see them as a very irrational actor. That means that logic may not apply.

       There's just one thing that's been getting my goat about the whole North Korea thing. I'll copy and paste from an older comment..
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The only things we know about NK are the things our own government, SK, or 'defectors' have told us. Is there any actual irrefutable evidence of slave labor camps? Starvation? How do we all
        <em>
         know
        </em>
        these things to be true?
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       If we can't believe what they tell us about anything else, why believe what we've been told about North Korea?

       I think that China or Russia would be quick to call bullshit on it. They would love nothing more than to prove we are lying, which would hurt our credibility. So either everyone is in on it or it is the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the same argument about why I believe in the moon landings. If we had faked it, the USSR would have called our ass out so quickly.
