The public school system in America might not be designed to educate, but instead to condition children for the labor force.      </p>

<p>Think about it:
-school days run between 7-8 hours<br/>
-5 days a week, Monday-Fri<br/>
-You&#39;re taught to take orders and not question authority<br/>
-You are scolded or reprimanded for tardiness 
-You&#39;re not taught how to think but instead <em>what</em> to think (don&#39;t want the employees outsmarting the boss)<br/>
-30 minute lunch breaks      </p>

<p>I could be completely off base here guys, but I couldn&#39;t help but seem some similarities. Did I leave anything off the list? What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was always my understanding of the education system as well.</p>

<p>We still see unfortunate remnants of it today in college through the idea of majors. In business school, for example, they do not teach you to be business owners. They teach you to be an accountant through an accounting major, or a finance exec through a finance major, an econometrician via economics, and so on. Not a single ounce of entrepreneurship is taught in the majority of business schools, which is crazy when you think about it. </p>

<p>The same thing can be said of engineering and how they train you to work for somebody else. In other countries, they offer a much more well-rounded approach to each discipline (electrical, mechanical, etc) so that if you wanted to be an inventor and create your own product, it was easier to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is silly.</p>

<p>One of the most useful projects a business school could do is say, &quot;your tuition costs $10,000 extra because you are going to come up with a business, and your capstone project is to run it for the next year. You are graded on how well the business performs, how well you run the metrics, business plan, etc.&quot; They then have to do stuff like get the permits, figure out the tax rate, etc.</p>

<p>This would be so incredibly useful. </p>

<p>Oh, and I actually meant econometrician: businesses don&#39;t really hire economists (which is broad and could mean anything) as often as econometricians, or, those who run math models and statistics while incorporating economic variables.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, the prophet Muhammad lived through his entire prophethood in poverty, by choice. He did not want to be answerable to God for living a life of luxury while the majority of his followers were living in poverty. Try reading a biography or two about him before making such bullshit statements. The rulers that came after him may have used their power in the ways you describe, but that is not because of Islam or Sharia, but rather because absolute power corrupts absolutely. The same has been true all throughout history.  </p>

<p>I agree with everything else you said though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve taught public school for 26 years but I just can’t do it anymore. For years I asked the local school board and superintendent to let me teach a curriculum that doesn’t hurt kids, but they had other fish to fry. So I’m going to quit, I think.</p>

<p>I’ve come slowly to understand what it is I really teach: A curriculum of confusion, class position, arbitrary justice, vulgarity, rudeness, disrespect for privacy, indifference to quality, and utter dependency. I teach how to fit into a world I don’t want to live in.</p>

<p>I just can’t do it anymore. I can’t train children to wait to be told what to do; I can’t train people to drop what they are doing when a bell sounds; I can’t persuade children to feel some justice in their class placement when there isn’t any, and I can’t persuade children to believe teachers have valuable secrets they can acquire by becoming our disciples. That isn’t true.</p>

<p>Government schooling is the most radical adventure in history. It kills the family by monopolizing the best times of childhood and by teaching disrespect for home and parents.</p>

<p>An exaggeration? Hardly. Parents aren’t meant to participate in our form of schooling, rhetoric to the contrary. My orders as schoolteacher are to make children fit an animal training system, not to help each find his or her personal path.</p>

<p>The whole blueprint of school procedure is Egyptian, not Greek or Roman. It grows from the faith that human value is a scarce thing, represented symbolically by the narrow peak of a pyramid.</p>

<p>That idea passed into American history through the Puritans. It found its “scientific” presentation in the bell curve, along which talent supposedly apportions itself by some Iron Law of biology.</p>

<p>It’s a religious idea and school is its church. New York City hires me to be a priest. I offer rituals to keep heresy at bay. I provide documentation to justify the heavenly pyramid.</p>

<p>Socrates foresaw that if teaching became a formal profession something like this would happen. Professional interest is best served by making what is easy to do seem hard; by subordinating laity to priesthood. School has become too vital a jobs project, contract-giver and protector of the social order to allow itself to be “re-formed.” It has political allies to guard its marches.</p>

<p>That’s why reforms come and go-without changing much. Even reformers can’t imagine school much different.</p>

<p>David learns to read at age four; Rachel, at age nine: In normal development, when both are 13, you can’t tell which one learned first — the five-year spread means nothing at all. But in school I will label Rachel “learning disabled” and slow David down a bit, too.</p>

<p>For a paycheck, I adjust David to depend on me to tell him when to go and stop. He won’t outgrow that dependency. I identify Rachel as discount merchandise, “special education.” After a few months she’ll be locked into her place forever.</p>

<p>In 26 years of teaching rich kids and poor, I almost never met a “learning disabled” child; hardly ever met a “gifted and talented” one, either. Like all school categories, these are sacred myths, created by the human imagination. They derive from questionable values we never examine because they preserve the temple of schooling.</p>

<p>That’s the secret behind short-answer tests, bells, uniform time blocks, age grading, standardization, and all the rest of the school religion punishing our nation.</p>

<p>There isn’t a right way to become educated; there are as many ways as fingerprints. We don’t need state-certified teachers to make education happen–that probably guarantees it won’t.</p>

<p>How much more evidence is necessary? Good schools don’t need more money or a longer year; they need real free-market choices, variety that speaks to every need and runs risks. We don’t need a national curriculum, or national testing either. Both initiatives arise from ignorance of how people learn, or deliberate indifference to it.</p>

<p>I can’t teach this way any longer. If you hear of a job where I don’t have to hurt kids to make a living, let me know. Come fall I’ll be looking for work, I think.</p>

<p>John Taylor Gatto wrote this article for The Wall Street Journal, July 25th, 1991. Gatto was a New York State Teacher of the Year. An advocate for school reform, Gatto’s books include Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling, the Underground History of American Education and Weapons of Mass Instruction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been the entire point of public education since its inception in the early 1800s.  As the industrial revolution took off, machines replaced unskilled laborers.  Everything left for humans to do began to require basic literacy and numeracy skills.  Hence public education became a necessary institution to give workers the basic tools they need to perform the minimum job requirements of the labor force (but no more).</p>

<p>This hasn&#39;t changed in 200 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think the same thing is happening with higher education now? As computerized automation rises, even people with high school level literacy and math skills are losing jobs to robots, so now only people with college education get good jobs.</p>

<p>But now there&#39;s a push for free community college and even free university education. Is that productive and beneficial for everyone, or is free higher education more ominous in the face of automation? </p>

<p>We institute a universal basic income because unskilled jobs are all but obsolete, completely lost to automation. Then, we make college free so that government can train the remaining smart citizens to work with the computers and robots that are now running everything. But if college is free and universally available, what&#39;s to stop it going the way of public high school education?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes sir, it does. I got lucky and was homeschooled all the way through. When my buddies would complain about the school system all I could do is laugh. They had the power to leave school and teach themselves like I did and still get their highschool diploma. </p>

<p>And the sad part is (I&#39;m not trying to toot my own horn here) everyone who goes through the school system is basically retarded. I mean that in the nicest way possible. They all do the same things and want to be the same people and are incapable of their own thoughts (for the most part).</p>

<p>If you ever meet someone who is quite intelligent, seems fairly normal​ but something is just slightly off and you can&#39;t put your finger on it, ask them if they were homeschooled. We ALL have that &quot;this guy&#39;s a bit weird. What&#39;s up with him?&quot; vibe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the reason most Americans feel that way about homeschooling is because of the demographics that tend to homeschool in the US. It&#39;s overwhelmingly people who believe religion should be the center of education, people who don&#39;t believe in evolution and don&#39;t want their children being taught about evolution in school or anything else that contradicts their religious beliefs. Of course I&#39;m not saying all homeschooling is like this, but this is why you&#39;ll find this attitude so prevalent here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first well known reference in western culture to this idea as a whole is probably allegory of the cave.</p>

<p>The public school system is an assembly line factory based on the prison industrial complex. You are on base.</p>

<p>Private schools teach the same stuff in mostly the same way. The key difference being that instead of being workers you&#39;re tailored to be the worker&#39;s boss; or warden depending on how you want to look at it.</p>

<p>The point is controlling thoughts. This way you don&#39;t look for the strings and hands, essentially the entities with real power. If they control thoughts, even if you share truth with everyone around you, you still can&#39;t affect change. If you somehow manage to get close you&#39;ll be neutralized. Especially in this age with so many nuanced ways to do so, far less circumspect than death. Tragically that&#39;s how you know you did it right.</p>

<p>The same groups have been in power for over 500 years, nearly uncontested for the last 100 years. Believe it or not at this point, the last 50 years, those in control aren&#39;t even the same species anymore.</p>

<p>Welcome to the rabbit hole I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should see some of the studies of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. The best place to start is &quot;Some Principles of Mass Persuasion&quot; were the US Air Force and Tavistock conducted experiments to see the most effective way to sell war bonds.</p>

<p>Mass persuasion is achieved in three easy steps.</p>

<p>1) Create a cognitive system</p>

<p>2) Create a motivational system</p>

<p>3) Call to action</p>

<p>These types of think tanks decide curriculums and &quot;change consultancy&quot; for all types of government mandated institutions. This includes police departments, universities and your children&#39;s school.</p>

<p>There was an effort to archive a lot of Tavistock&#39;s work, but they intentionally left out &quot;war time studies.&quot; This is the &quot;grey literature&quot; that started with ideas from the minds of the Wednesday Psychology Club and the Coefficients Dining Club.</p>

<p>Point being, the rabbit hole goes deep, but the aim isn&#39;t that hard to understand.</p>

<p>The media, the schools and every other government agency is out to tame the population and sell you authoritarianism so you are willingly tamed.</p>

<p>Not that tameness is necessarily a bad thing, but it comes at a drastic cost to mankind because of the assault on logic and reason where even the scientific community is compromised and even professors at our most prestigious university are on the payroll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been obvious to me for quite some time. </p>

<p>Most of what you&#39;re taught in school (at least middle/high school) is mostly useless bullshit that you&#39;re never going to need to know in real life unless you want to become a mathematician or a chemist or something. </p>

<p>History isn&#39;t real history and its usually taught in such a boring and uninteresting way that nobody gives a shit to learn about it. They dont teach us how to manage finances or to understand what money even is or where it comes from. </p>

<p>Our school systems in America are a joke. Proven by the steep decline in American academic achievement comparative to the rest of the modern world. And inner-city schools? hahaha well fuck those n****s. Just pass them along until they either drop out or wind up dead or hopefully in jail (good for business). </p>

<p>This country is so fucked. School teaches you how to memorize facts and formulas but what are you actually <em>learning</em>? Learning to get ready for that 9-5 grind (except its not really a 9-5 grind anymore is it? Now its more like a 7-6 grind). Learning to blindly believe whatever authority tells you. To always think within the confines of the box. </p>

<p>It is a literal indoctrination system. And a shitty one at that thanks to the 500 million dollars a day we spend to be in the Middle-East.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>unless you want to become a mathematician or a chemist or something</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the point is actually to dissuade this. </p>

<p>Differential calculus is conceptually useful, but when it&#39;s given to you without much of a context or basis for why you&#39;re using it, then &quot;taught&quot; by having you solve equations ad nauseum until your eyes fucking bleed, that&#39;s going to sabotage your ability to integrate the knowledge at a more appropriate later stage of your mathematical development if you pursue that path--but it&#39;s probably going to make you fucking hate maths altogether.</p>

<p>That&#39;s convenient, because if consumers in general could apply algebra to finance the system would fucking collapse.</p>

<p>Similarly, chemistry is REALLY IMPORTANT--but really inconvenient for consumers to have a functioning knowledge of if you want to lie to them about carcinogens, nutrition, or pharmacology. By poisoning the well here and in related sciences you also prevent people from developing a basic understanding of evolutionary biology, which is brilliant if your social control mechanisms rely on dividing people along broad lines like sex and race. </p>

<p>Ostensibly &quot;advanced&quot; shit is deliberately taught out-of-sequence in order to burn out an organic interest in some really important shit that everybody should know. You could learn a hell of a lot of science without having to crunch a single formula, but we get exactly the opposite: lots of mind-numbing work, very little fundamental information.</p>

The only thing you&#39;re missing is that public education is designed to feed children propaganda about war and politics and to indoctrinate children into believing they have it good and their country knows what&#39;s best for the world and that they can do no wrong.</p>

<p>Tools of propaganda in school: war past, war present, multiculturalism, patriotism</p>

<p>All things designed to create a mindset of complicity and to allow the future generation of elites the control they require to ensure the population is no threat.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s fairly common knowledge that school serves to indoctrinate young people into a top down management system that rewards obedience. More and more it is just baby sitting for kids who will not have the capacity to contribute or function in contemporary society. The cream that floats to the top are brought into systems of management or specialization, but only is they can maintain passivity and obedience.  </p>

But like....the M-F 8 hours aspect of public school is just a function of the rest of society in the sense that people are at work and childcare of some kind is a necessity during work hours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the longest and most difficult struggles throughout human history was the ongoing battle against the aristocrats, priesthoods, and wealthy elites by all the ordinary people who wanted to learn how to read and write. It represented the greatest single advantage that those in control had over everyone else. An advantage that was big enough to actually prevent everyone else from learning how to do it for centuries on end.</p>

<p>Although we take our present day literacy for granted, if it wasn&#39;t for the large numbers of workers that were needed during the industrial revolution who could read and follow simple written instructions, public schools would never have been created and most of us would still be struggling to acquire that ability.</p>

<p>Our overlords miscalculated when it came to that. They never actually considered that once we acquired the ability to read and write that we might actually want to read just about anything we could lay our hands on or even write articles and books for ourselves. They didn&#39;t think we were smart enough for that. When they realized that they&#39;d let the genie out of the bottle and that there were plenty among the common people who were just as intelligent as any of them once they knew how to read they focussed their attention and plenty of money on using and controlling the public education system to support their own interests and by carefully filtering what would and wouldn&#39;t be taught to ordinary people, both about themselves and the world they live in.</p>

<p>Statists everywhere.</p>

<p>Coincidence?</p>

<p>Imagine if Walmart owned a school. And in that school they taught everyone about all the past CEOs and how great they were. Kids stood every day and pledged allegiance to Walmart. The teaching curriculum was all written by Walmart employees.</p>

<p>Would it surprise any of you that kids who graduated from that had a preference for Walmart?</p>

<p>This is Republicans, Democrats, Socialists, and Progressives. Love the State. It has taught you everything you know. Worship it. For the common good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s pretty clear that school attempts to get us ready for the working world in more ways than just learning. This means adjusting the minds of children to be able to take orders and attend school during &#39;working hours&#39;. I don&#39;t see how this is really bad though. The alternative is some sort of individual schooling that will lack the same sort of effectiveness if there&#39;s no routine. Discipline is really important in regards to time management. </p>

<p>Also, teachers are only available to work during those working hours so of course kids go to school fro 9-5. I went to elementary school from 9-3:30, middle school from 8-3, and high school from 7-2. I don&#39;t even think that these particular time ranges prepared me at all for the working world in terms of time spent working. College did even less for that. </p>

<p>I have my criticisms of the education system, but the amount of time Americans spend in school is far less than most Asian countries. I live in Asia right now, and the school children basically live at school and get tutoring after school (China). </p>

<p>Also, if a child is constantly questioning a teacher&#39;s authority (and for no good reason most of the time...not sure if you have kids...) then there&#39;s going to be a more problematic environment. You can&#39;t have 20 kids going apeshit. There would be some sort of other system in place obviously, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s too much that&#39;s nefarious here. </p>
