        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Seth Rich conspiracy is yet another fake conspiracy invented by conservative outlets, and in this case none other than Fox News.</p>

<p>Firstly, the &#39;investigator&quot; was a private PI hired for the Rich Family to investigate Seth&#39;s murder, however his services were being paid for by none other than a Fox News financial advisor and contributer <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/millionaire-fox-news-analyst-reportedly-funding-the-private-investigation-into-seth-richs-murder/">Ed Botowsky</a></p>

<p>The investigator is Rod Wheeler, the same guy who  was interviewed on the Bill O&#39;Reilly show and stated that <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2007/rod-wheeler-claims-o%E2%80%99reilly-factor-lesbian-gangs-are-raping-young-girls">Lesbian Gangs are raping young girls all over the country</a>, which was proven to be false.</p>

<p>The credibility of Rod Wheeler is even more suspect now, because he has already recanted and admitted that his <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/hold-fire-on-those-stories-about-seth-rich-the-slain-dnc-staffer/article/2623263">source is a Fox news reporter</a>. </p>

<p>So we can easily see that this hoax was created by none other than Fox News</p>

<p>Rod Wheeler on Hannity destroying all your fake news links, confirms massive cover-up:</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Rod Wheeler: “Here’s one other thing that is going to be startling…I’m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn’t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.</p>

<p>Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC–check this out–a high ranking official at the DNC–when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around?”</p>

<p>Per the Washington Examiner, Rich&#39;s family issued the following statement, via a &#39;spokesman&#39;, regarding the recent Fox News reports saying they have seen no evidence of the alleged emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rich family immediately pushed back against the claim that they hired Wheeler, saying in a statement that &quot;the services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.&quot;</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t hire the investigator. This is coming from the family and not a spokesman. Care to try and fail again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The family agreed to let this PI who approached them look into the matter, but he would have to discuss any disclosures with them. He failed to do that because he&#39;s a loudmouth who is trying to make a name for himself and quickly retreated like Alex Jones does when anyone calls him on his bullshit.</p>

<p>As for Assange, he&#39;s called on his bs by the interviewer and he stumbles around trying to avoid saying yes or no. 
Saying yes means a motive is established for the murder Seth Rich (JA says his name in the interview) and there would be greater pressure on the police to investigate, which would lead to the arrests you so greatly desire.
Saying no ends the narrative.
So given the choice between justice or honesty, JA chooses to dodge the question.</p>

<p>which means your entire argument was bullshit from post one. thanks.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>he confirmed it national television with hannity multiple times.  only a change in story days later, most likely after being threatened, as is the usual case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for Assange, he&#39;s called on his bs by the interviewer and he stumbles around trying to avoid saying yes or no. </p>

<p>assange never stumbled.  he was the one who brought up the &quot;27 year old dnc staffer&quot; in the first place.   he is also not violating wikileaks official policy of not confirming whistleblower identities.  you&#39;re just a liar in full blown denial.</p>

<p>Assange: &quot;Whistleblowers go to very significant risks. There&#39;s a 27 year old who works for the DNC who was shot in the back, murdered...&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>and what, exactly, was this 27 year old dnc staffer whistleblowing? :)</p>

<p>assanage and wikileaks have never been wrong.</p>

<p>Assange doesn&#39;t just refer to him as some 27 year old dnc staffer, he calls him by name later in the interview. But he doesn&#39;t say Seth Rich is the leaker because then JA and WikiLeaks &quot;never been wrong&quot; record would end. Instead, he throws out a red herring that you&#39;re more than willing to grasp on to with a level of desperation that shows you realize trump is going down and you&#39;re fighting it until your last breath. So keep on trying to misdirect, keep on screaming about the Clintons. They are as irrelevant as you, and I am not here to defend them. I&#39;m here to try and keep you honest while you fail and flail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;ve lied on multiple occassions, all documented below.</p>

<p>but first, the Rich family says screw you: LOLOL.</p>

<p>Rich Family thanks everyone for investigating seth&#39;s murder, contradicting dnc goon family spokesman.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6cdt4h/seth_richs_parents_speak_out_thanking_us_for/">https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6cdt4h/seth_richs_parents_speak_out_thanking_us_for/</a></p>

<p>here are your lies for all to see again :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you are scared. Got it. You aren&#39;t confident that Hillary would be arrested before trump. You don&#39;t have much faith in your god-emperor, do you? All you have is hate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>nah, because as i&#39;ve stated before, a proven cover-up is in progress, and an internet bet is useless.    and because you&#39;re an unhinged proven liar.  why are you dodging the $10k charity challenge to seth rich&#39;s family by the way?  your shillary has been proven to have destroyed subpoenaed evidence.</p>

<p>why is it you keep dodging every single argument of yours that was destroyed?  you keep peddling fiction that the PI wasn&#39;t working for rich family, when in fact he was and was contractually obligated to report to them.  wasn&#39;t selected, still working for them.</p>

<p>keep dodging everything else too :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you cannot provide one instance where I lied</p>

<p>rofl coward. they didn&#39;t select him, but consented to using him.  gtfo, scab. keep dodging.</p>

<p>&quot;The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party.&quot;</p>

<p>oops.  you lose again, lying scab. the rich family consented to the PI, and destroys your entire bullshit argument, just like you&#39;ve been dodging all the links and posts destroying your bullshit russia collusion narrative.</p>

<p>LOL.  keep dodging, proven liar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Except I have never said that there is Russian collusion, just that it is alleged</p>
</blockquote>

<p>sure you have. you said collusion plenty of times.  you even supported the bogus recent reuters story while failing to acknowledge the fact the article even stated there was zero evidence for collusion.</p>

<p>“The people who described the contacts to Reuters said they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion between the campaign and Russia in the communications reviewed so far,” states the report.</p>

<p>No collusion between Trump and Russia. you liar.</p>

<p>Kinda like the proof I provided, waaaaay back at the beginning of this thread that the family said they didn&#39;t hire the PI, and then linked to an article where the family stated they didn&#39;t hire the PI. </p>

<p>wrong.  the PI is part of the investigation.   why is there a contract if the rich family never wanted an investigation to begin with?  LoL you proven liar.  you&#39;ve been dodging that response for days as well. </p>

<p>&quot;Rod Wheeler</p>

<p>Washington, DC</p>

<p>May 22, 2017</p>

<p>Statement Regarding the Seth Rich Investigation</p>

<p>To whom this may concern,</p>

<p>In March of 2017, I was introduced by way of a telephone conference call, to Joel Rich, Mary Rich, Aaron Rich and Molly Rich, surviving family members of Seth Rich. Seth Rich was murdered in the District of Columbia in July of 2016.</p>

<p>The Rich’s were aware of my background as a criminal investigator, specifically as a former police homicide investigator. They indicated that they had seen my many appearances on the Fox News Channel commenting and analyzing dozens of criminal cases and have always been impressed by my knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>The Rich’s engaged my services to assist with gathering information and evidence, in an effort to try to assist the Metropolitan Police Department identify the person(s) responsible for the murder of Seth.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been much discussion in the national media surrounding my revelation that I believe that Seth’s death could be possibly linked to his former employment at the DNC, or with relationships with others connected to his employment. I am still of the personal opinion that his murder may be tied to his employment.</p>

<p>Currently I am prohibited to go into any detail surrounding my investigation and its findings.  However, I do want to say this:</p>

<p>Since accepting the request of the Rich family to assist them in this investigation, I have always been focused on one thing, and one thing only; finding out who is responsible for the death of Seth. I feel as if I was making good progress and getting very close to developing a motive. Further, I can say that I have developed what I believe to be persons of interest, that I essentially would like to talk to further regarding information that they may have surrounding Seth’s death. I am of the personal opinion that the information/article reported by FoxNews Channel last Tuesday was essentially correct and worthy of further investigation. That is exactly why when I first learned of this new information developed by a FoxNews investigative journalist, I immediately called the DC Police to inform them.&quot;</p>

<p>Since accepting the request of the Rich family to assist them in this investigation,</p>

<p>oh, nice of you to finally reply after dodging for so long while posting elsewhere. kek.</p>

<p>wheeler never retracted. his statement was pulled after high dnc officials intervened and put on pressure, including donna brazile. ouch. proven criminals hiding much?</p>

<p>The acting spokesperson for the Rich family, Brad Bauman, is connected to Democratic propaganda czar David Brock according online observers. The discovery is the latest in a long line of revelations showing deep Democratic National Committee (DNC) involvement in the Seth Rich case.

<p>let&#39;s note for the record, you are now BACKPEDALING away from your claim that PI/DC Homicide Investigator Wheeler ever issued a retraction in the first place, correct?  because that&#39;s exactly what Wheeler clarified when he stated fox5 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcwTF-ObV_g#t=2m30s">&quot;manipulated and sliced that video&quot;</a> of his interview with fox5, and that he never issued a retraction.  you were dead wrong :) now, let&#39;s see you acknowledge that.</p>

<p>furthermore, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcwTF-ObV_g#t=5m38s">Wheeler reiterates that he was &quot;stonewalled&quot; and &quot;got stopped&quot;</a> in his investigation.   again, no retraction from Wheeler, and completely contradicts the lies you tried to push.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2017/05/bombshell-donna-brazile-probing-seth-rich-murder-says-private-eye/">http://www.wnd.com/2017/05/bombshell-donna-brazile-probing-seth-rich-murder-says-private-eye/</a></p>

<p>.==========</p>

<p>oh, what else have you dodged from yesterday because it exposed more of your lies, just like your callous disregard for the truth by refusing to disavow your BS russian claims? :</p>

<p>.===========</p>

<p><a href="http://disobedientmedia.com/pastorum-group-spokesperson-in-seth-rich-case-tied-to-democrat-propaganda-chief/">http://disobedientmedia.com/pastorum-group-spokesperson-in-seth-rich-case-tied-to-democrat-propaganda-chief/</a></p>

<p>&quot;The acting spokesperson for the Rich family, Brad Bauman, is connected to Democratic propaganda czar David Brock according online observers. The discovery is the latest in a long line of revelations showing deep Democratic National Committee (DNC) involvement in the Seth Rich case.&quot;</p>

<p>oops.</p>

<p>.===========</p>

<p>also, the DNC is lying to the rich family about kimdotcom:</p>

<p><a href="https://contraspin.co.nz/someone-is-lying-to-seth-richs-family-about-kim-dotcom/">https://contraspin.co.nz/someone-is-lying-to-seth-richs-family-about-kim-dotcom/</a></p>

<p>&quot;It is abundantly obvious that people close to the Rich family are lying to them for reasons of political expediency and that is simply not OK.&quot;</p>

<p>.===========</p>

<p>inc another dodge from you.</p>

<p>enjoy your crow.</p>

<p>wheeler was indeed hired by the rich family, as there is a contractual agreement between them.  that runs in addition to wheeler&#39;s own statements stating the rich family spoke to him and agreed to hire him.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>and from your dnc/shillary media matters:  &quot; Rod Wheeler, a Fox News contributor and former Washington, D.C., homicide detective <strong>who was employed by the family</strong> and earlier this week told a Fox affiliate that he believed police were covering up details about the crime.&quot;</p>

<p>.=======================</p>

<p>Kim Dotcom doubles down. 400 Pound Hacker writes open letter to Seth Rich&#39;s family, debunking claims that he tried to hack into Seth&#39;s email account and offers to share his evidence that Seth was in contact with WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>Turns out the Rich family was HAPPY Rod Wheeler had made progress with the investigation before he broke the story. Only corrected the record when Brad Bauman DNC crisis consultant manger intervened .</p>

<p>KDC makes demands he knows will not be met so he does not have to provide his &quot;proof.&quot;</p>

<p>Furthermore, how would Seth have even gotten the emails if he was the leaker? He was a data analyst, not a sysadmin. He would not have access to the mail server. No matter what way you look at it, an honest person would see that this is ridiculous.</p>

<p>As for your line of defense, of course the Reuters article would say no evidence of collusion. If there were reports providing evidence of collusion and trump and co were not on trial, there would be rioting in the streets. You see, the difference between you and adults is adults will wait until all the evidence comes out before drawing a conclusion. Children like you develop fantasies an only listen to &quot;evidence&quot; that supports your fantasy.</p>

<p>and from the atlantic: wheeler was <strong>HIRED</strong> by the rich family. you lose again.</p>

<p>let&#39;s also note you couldn&#39;t come up with a single piece of evidence to support your proven lies of russian &quot;collusion&quot;.  do you disavow your bogus russian claims since you can&#39;t provide a single piece of evidence? get owned harder, kid!</p>

<p>As for the alleged Russian collusion, there&#39;s nothing to disavow. The odds are still in favor of evidence existing rather than not existing. I mean, why has the Special Counsel (that Wheeler was used to distract from) been selected? Possibly because non-partisan prosecution that the president cannot interfere with is necessary?</p>

<p>fake news without a shred of evidence of collusion.  if you can&#39;t even admit sessions&#39;s meetings were already all out in the open and on the public record, then that&#39;s just more proof you&#39;re fabricating a fairytale.  more lies? tsk tsk.</p>

<p>kusher fake news has long been debunked (dailycaller).  and even the fbi admitted there was no collusion of flynn&#39;s calls/meetings.   get owned again!</p>

<p>no evidence of collusion, but you&#39;re still pushing that baseless proven to be false claim.  why haven&#39;t you disavowed the fact there is zero evidence supporting your bullshit claim? yea, more lies from you.</p>

<p>The evidence will come out as the arrests are made. Still afraid of the bet?</p>

<p>Saying Hillary lost solely because of Russia is baseless. She lost because she&#39;s a terrible candidate. A good candidate could have won, even with the Russian interference because trump is an even worse candidate than Hillary. Russian interference is known and acknowledged. But was the trump team in on it? We are in the process of finding out.</p>

<p>Go back and read the source I provided. Wheeler had no evidence because he was repeating talking points provided to him by Fox. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>false, liar.  </p>

<p>wheeler&#39;s own words via hannity interview:</p>

<p>&quot;there was a federal investigator that was involved on the inside on the case... but i can&#39;t say the person&#39;s name because that person would be thrown under the bus... but, this person, we checked him out, very credible, he said he laid eyes on the computer and on the case file [of seth rich]&quot;.   nice try, ya proven liar.  another repeat instance you&#39;ve repeatedly lied.</p>

<p>funny how you&#39;re also continuously dodging the fact the DNC repeatedly called the seth family to quash wheeler&#39;s investigation.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump revealed classified intel from an ally, an ally which intentionally shared the intel with us and not Russia, in a meeting that US media was barred from but Russian media wasn&#39;t. If it was as much of a nothingburger as you think it is, why was the white house issuing statements (first denying it happened, and then coming up with excuses why it was perfectly fine) about it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you citing fake news anonymous sources the claimed anyone in the trump admin outed sources or methods is a proven falsehood.  you don&#39;t have any evidence supporting that bogus claim besides citing anonymous fake news sources from outlets that were proven by wikileaks to collude with the clinton campaign LOL.  why do you continuously lie without a shred of evidence or proof?</p>

<p>let&#39;s note everything else you&#39;ve dodged because the destroys the lies you&#39;ve been peddling:</p>

<p>let&#39;s note for the record, you are now BACKPEDALING away from your claim that PI/DC Homicide Investigator Wheeler ever issued a retraction in the first place, because that&#39;s exactly what Wheeler clarified when he stated fox5 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcwTF-ObV_g#t=2m30s">&quot;manipulated and sliced that video&quot;</a> of his interview with fox5, and that he never issued a retraction.  you were dead wrong :) now, let&#39;s see you acknowledge that.</p>

<p>furthermore, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcwTF-ObV_g#t=5m38s">Wheeler reiterates that he was &quot;stonewalled&quot; and &quot;got stopped&quot;</a> in his investigation.   again, no retraction from Wheeler, and completely contradicts the lies you tried to push.</p>

<p>.=======</p>

<p>“at no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.”  seems the fake news media that colluded with shillary were the ones to &quot;reveal israel&quot;, and not anyone from the trump admin.  LoL at you citing fake anonymous sources, proven liar.</p>

<p>As for the Senate Intel hearing, trump/Russia was not the subject of the hearing and the answers were all &quot;I will not say in a public hearing&quot; instead of the &quot;no&quot; Republicans were hoping for.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re picking and choosing what you want to believe from the testimony, and calling everything else lies.
Comey said trump lied multiple times, and was under oath when he said it. Which means he is 100% confident trump lied.
The Russia investigation is still ongoing (just like he had to remind McCain multiple times. Are you sure you&#39;re not McCain?)
Comey said that trump urged him to drop the Flynn investigation.
Lynch did not urge Comey to drop any investigation, just use a more favorable term.</p>

<p>Did you actually listen to the hearing? Or are you just reading headlines from your usual trash sources? So far, you have failed to show that you have any idea what was actually said.</p>

<p>wrong.  comey has perjured himself before. that&#39;s not news.  his entire credibility is shot.   also, if you&#39;re going to believe him, then you&#39;ll have to admit trump never was and never will be under investigation for collusion since there is zero evidence.  LoL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How did he perjure himself? I&#39;ve seen a couple posts about the tapes tweet and a NYT article about the dinner, but that wasn&#39;t the memo he sent to a friend.
Trumps lawyer accused Comey of leaking, but the only information he released was unclassified, so it wouldn&#39;t be a leak.
Comey said he was not given an order, but that doesn&#39;t mean trump didn&#39;t try to influence him. ;)
The Russia investigation is still ongoing. If it was so phoney as you claim, it would have been finished by now.</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t trumps lawyer or the white house arguing that Comey lied about trump lying?</p>

<p>Comey said trump urged him to drop the investigation. Then trumps lawyer confirmed that trump said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation. That is trump, ever so delicately saying &quot;yo... Drop this please.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trumps vindication is Comey saying that he was not personally under investigation during Comey&#39;s tenure. That does not eliminate the collusion investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there was no evidence of collusion to begin with, unlike the clintons LoL.</p>

<p>edit: too fun:</p>

<p>Hoping or wishing for an outcome bears no resemblance to the crime of obstruction as defined not just by statute, but by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2005 case of Arthur Anderson v. United States.</p>

<p>Intelligence Committee Chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., asked Comey quite directly, “Was the president trying to obstruct justice?”  As expected, Comey demurred by claiming, “It’s not for me to say.”  While there is no legal basis for declining to answer the pivotal question, Comey dodged it for a reason.  If he said, under oath, that he regarded the president’s words as obstruction, Comey would have incriminated himself in a crime known as “misprision of felony.”</p>

<p>As explained in an earlier column, the law imposes an affirmative duty on federal officials, like Comey, to immediately report knowledge of a felony such as obstruction to a person in authority.  In the case of an FBI Director, his superior is the Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice.  Comey admitted he did not tell anyone at DOJ.  His excuses were legally vacuous.</p>

<p>Thus, one can conclude that Comey either did not believe the president obstructed justice (and, therefore, had no duty to report it) or he did not want to put himself in legal jeopardy.</p>

<p>Comey was pressed on the issue.  Unbelievably, he claimed he did not know whether FBI agents have a duty to report a crime that has been committed:</p>

<p>Question:  “You’re unsure whether they would have a legal duty?”</p>

<p>Answer: “That’s a good question.  I’ve not thought about that before.  (pause)  There is a statute that prohibits misprision of a felony -- knowing of a felony and taking steps to conceal it.  But this is a different question.”</p>

<p>No, Mr. Comey, it is not a different question.  It is a fundamental legal obligation for all people who serve in law enforcement.  The head of the FBI should know that.</p>

<p>Regardless, the entire question of obstruction was rendered moot and meaningless by Comey himself when he endorsed what constitutional scholars, including Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz, have long maintained.  That is, the president has the constitutional authority to stop investigations and prosecutions.</p>

<p>“I’m not a legal scholar…but as a legal matter, the president is head of the executive branch and could direct, in theory, that anybody be investigated or not be investigated,” admitted Comey. </p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>as for the rest of your bullshit drivel, i&#39;m not doing your homework. you&#39;ve dodged every single one of these links, proven liar.</p>

<p>educate yourself before dodging again.  here&#39;s everything else you&#39;ve dodged, including wheeler. you coward.  get owned harder!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re picking and choosing what you want to believe from the testimony, and calling everything else lies. Comey said trump lied multiple times, and was under oath when he said it. Which means he is 100% confident trump lied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>wrong.  comey has perjured himself before. that&#39;s not news.  his entire credibility is shot.   also, if you&#39;re going to believe him, then you&#39;ll have to admit trump never was and never will be under investigation for collusion since there is zero evidence.  LoL.  he also waited to report his memos for supposed wrongdoing?  that&#39;s breaking the law, champ.  </p>

<p>comey also perjured himself again this time around, as pointed out by trump&#39;s lawyers.  fail, you proven liar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comey said that trump urged him to drop the Flynn investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;hope&quot; isn&#39;t an order, therefor zero obstruction.  you lose again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you actually listen to the hearing? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>do you? you just dodged comey flatly saying &quot;no&quot; to trump ever issuing him a cease order.  you lose, proven liar.  you also are still dodging the fact he outed collusion between himself, lynch, shillary, and failbama. LOL.</p>

<p>get wrecked.  t_d is having a field day. You lose again! LoL RIP russian collusion.  funny how you dodged all of the below again, just like the fact you dodged wheeler&#39;s own words proving fake news lied about him ever retracting.  never happened you proven liar!</p>

<p>is this you? bahahahaha</p>

<p>here&#39;s everything you dodged:</p>

<p>rofl you&#39;re a proven lying clown.  nice nothingburger from comey today, except for the fact he englightened us all to lynch/failbama/shillary obstructing justice.  ha. the irony.   it&#39;s also a proven fact failbama&#39;s rice unmasked, and the fun&#39;s just getting started, kid.</p>

<p>“Although Mr. Comey testified he only leaked the memos in response to a tweet, the public record reveals that the New York Times was quoting from these memos the day before the referenced tweet, which belies Mr. Comey&#39;s excuse for this unauthorized disclosure of privileged information and appears to be entirely retaliatory,” </p>

<p>Comey himself has said. And he declassified others. Face it, trumps lawyer was talking out of his ass, trying to be intimidating, but nothing will become of it because he knows he has no case. </p>

<p>LoL nice backpedal you lying clown.  &quot;matter&quot; is insignificant? that&#39;s going to put lynch and or comey in prison.  it proves collusion and obstruction of justice, you lying clown.  nothing comey stated damages trump in any way, and completely exonerates trump on russia.  can&#39;t obstruct on &quot;hope&quot; and when you&#39;re not even under fbi investigation LOL.</p>

<p>LoL at you, proven liar:</p>

<p>you mean this piece of shit mueller?:  <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/864994472492453888">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/864994472492453888</a></p>

<p>you&#39;re still dead silent on where the memos are.  why did comey delete/not have the originals?  a repeat perjurer with no evidence for the basis of his testimony?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comey himself has said</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and you&#39;re still dodging all the numerous instances of comey committing perjury.  backpedal some more, you proven liar.  funny how you dodged 90% of the facts in my post proving multiple instances of perjury.  why are you dodging the fact mccabe&#39;s testimony contradicts comey&#39;s? LOL.</p>

<p>just like Clapper and many others lying under oath. LoL at you, proven liar.</p>

<p><strong>Comey perjures himself again, and did in fact record notes under previous presidents</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bartongellman/status/864654941167779841">https://twitter.com/bartongellman/status/864654941167779841</a></p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Comey&#39;s also insinuating Mccabe lied under oath as well.  LOL.  </p>

<p><strong>MCCABE: As you know, Senator, the work of the men and women of the FBI continues despite any changes in circumstance, any decisions. So there has been no effort to impede our investigation today. Quite simply put sir, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing, protecting the American people, and upholding the Constitution.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You claim perjury, but the only &quot;proof&quot; you have is a tweet by JA, that cannot be verified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong, you just dodged all the other instances where comey repeatedly perjured himself, including the justice department statement, emails, etc. etc.  Hasn&#39;t been the first you&#39;ve been dead wrong, nor will it be the last.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lynch asked him to refer to the investigation as a &quot;matter.&quot; That isn&#39;t obstruction. Furthermore, he didn&#39;t follow her request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LoL at you, proven liar.  ahahahaha.  it is indeed obstruction/collusion.   and comey did in fact follow Lynch&#39;s orders. ahahahha, just more and more of your proven lies, proven liar:</p>

<p><strong>Despite his concerns, Mr. Comey avoided calling it an investigation. “I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter,” Mr. Comey told reporters days after the meeting.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think a former lawyer/director of the FBI would announce under oath the existence of memos, but they not exist, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and nobody seems to have the memos at this time, even after numerous weeks.  pathetic, you proven liar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was the director of the FBI. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>irrelevant.  the laws still apply to him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the memos were his personal notes, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>written on classified devices. you lose again, proven liar.</p>

<p>why is it you dodged all the instances comey committed perjury anyhow?  given how we proved again you lied in point #1 above, let&#39;s see you continue dodging, proven liar. boy , this is fun and hilarious:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no collusion with Lynch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>wrong.  both he and lynch broke the law. comey refused to stand up to lynch&#39;s obstruction of an ongoing investigation to achieve political gain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like he said, &quot;legally? Not really, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>wrong again, proven liar.  can&#39;t claim obstruction later on when you&#39;ve failed to mention it months ago at the time of alleged memos (which are still missing), which is why nothing is happening to trump while comey&#39;s heading to prison with Lynch LOL :)</p>

<p><strong>Seems strange that Comey wd give his memo to friend to give to NYT but not give to Congress; now says he has no copy</strong></p>

<p><strong>Guess Jim Comey didn&#39;t read the FBI&#39;s employment agreement.</strong> LOLOLOLOL.</p>

<p><strong>The FBI’s employment agreement reads:</strong> </p>

<p>factually, comey leaked supposed memos, which nobody has actually seen, and which didn&#39;t qualify for obstruction when he wrote them as admitted during testimony, solely for the appointment of his longtime friend, mueller. LoL.  no conflict of interest there.</p>

<p>ouch. even liberal rags even admit mueller too close to comey.</p>

<p><strong>Robert Mueller should recuse himself from Russia investigation.  Former FBI director is too close to his successor, James Comey, to be impartial.</strong></p>

<p>The news would only be proven fake if Mueller makes a statement saying trump is not under investigation.</p>

<p>If trump fired the special counsel it would only strengthen the obstruction of justice claims. You don&#39;t fire the person investigating you if you&#39;re innocent.</p>

<p>And funny how trump Jr is linking an email dated in march. Comey said that during February he and other senior FBI had determines that sessions would be recusing himself. That only serves to confirm Comey&#39;s statement.</p>

<p>sessions parroting the same fact-less and evidence free &quot;intel&quot; community that also fabricated weapons of mass deception for iraq isn&#39;t perjury.  try again.</p>

<p>no such confirmation.  &quot;anonymous sources say&quot; isn&#39;t real, and is the same reason you no longer have a &quot;collusion&quot; argument and are backpedaling to MUH OBSTRUCTION.  flushed. toilet. you lose again.</p>

<p>wtf are you smoking? once again, you make no sense.  comey/sessions  stated there was no collusion/investigation of trump, you moron.  that&#39;s a big difference between the bogus claim of interference, which you still can&#39;t provide a single piece of evidence for.  assange also put a nail in that coffin, but you&#39;ll just keep dodging him LoL.  how does it feel to completely botch collusion vs interference again? you proven liar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you agree with the opinion, doesn&#39;t make it fact.</p>

<p>No, you quite literally did not deny that trump isn&#39;t going to drain the swamp, because you know he won&#39;t.</p>

<p>They presented a side of the story that does not &quot;call him out,&quot; but tries to cover Sessions&#39; ass. In February Comey knew that Sessions would likely be recusing himself, and behold! In March Sessions recused himself.</p>

<p>What storybook is telling you Rice or Lynch is going to be testifying? Rice has already testified and it has already been shown that there was no unlawful unmasking. And Lynch has been irrelevant since she met with Clinton on her plane. Keep trying buddy. One of these times you might actually have correct information.</p>

<p>Next, let&#39;s look at the NBC article.

It continues on to say, &quot;Rich&#39;s family only hired Wheeler on the urging of a conservative Dallas financial adviser and Fox News regular named Ed Butowsky, who offered to cover Wheeler&#39;s fees, as NBC News first reported.&quot;
Hrm... Interesting. Someone else is paying the PI &quot;hired&quot; by the Rich&#39;s. I wonder what details that original NBC report has...</p>

&quot;The Dallas-based financial adviser, Ed Butowsky, a Fox News regular who has written articles for Breitbart News, contacted the parents of Seth Rich and urged them to hire a private investigator to look into the death of their 27-year-old son, who was shot and killed last July in what police say was a robbery gone wrong. Butowsky offered to cover the fees and connect them with an investigator&quot;</p>

<p>So you mean a fox contributor hired a fox contributor to &quot;investigate&quot; on behalf of the Rich&#39;s? And fox broke this amazing story proving Seth was the leaker? And then fox retracted the story because it was all fake?! Shocking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, the family has been quoted as saying they did not hire the PI. You have linked articles stating the PI was hired by a 3rd party. And the PI has admitted that he has not ever actually come even close to any of the actual evidence because he&#39;s not part of the investigation. That&#39;s why he is a PI, and not a detective. Are you really this disconnected from reality? That the family saying &quot;we did not hire him&quot; somehow means that they absolutely did? Seriously, there gets to be a point where you&#39;re a danger to yourself because you have lost touch with reality. Maybe you should seek help.</p>

<p>LoL what?  still lying about how your argument failed miserably?</p>

<p>let me repost, since you&#39;re a liar:</p>

<p>&quot;fail logic, proven liar. trump hasn&#39;t broken any laws, unlike shillary, who again, has destroyed subpoenaed evidence. try harder, scab.</p>

<p>JA/wikileaks dropping names isn&#39;t a workaround. It&#39;s bait that you took. Until there is proof, it isn&#39;t true. If you, or anyone else, can provide proof then I will agree with you. But until them, you&#39;re being played.</p>

<p>nah, because as i&#39;ve stated before, a proven cover-up is in progress, and an internet bet is useless.    and because you&#39;re an unhinged proven liar.  why are you dodging the $10k charity challenge to seth rich&#39;s family by the way?  your shillary has been proven to have destroyed subpoenaed evidence.</p>

<p>why is it you keep dodging every single argument of yours that was destroyed?  you keep peddling fiction that the PI wasn&#39;t working for rich family, when in fact he was and was contractually obligated to report to them.  wasn&#39;t selected, still working for them.</p>

<p>&quot;The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party.&quot;</p>

<p>oops.  you lose again, lying scab. the rich family consented to the PI, and destroys your entire bullshit argument, just like you&#39;ve been dodging all the links and posts destroying your bullshit russia collusion narrative.</p>

<p>LOL.  keep dodging, proven liar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Except I have never said that there is Russian collusion, just that it is alleged</p>

<p>sure you have. you said collusion plenty of times.  you even supported the bogus recent reuters story while failing to acknowledge the fact the article even stated there was zero evidence for collusion.</p>

<p>“The people who described the contacts to Reuters said they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion between the campaign and Russia in the communications reviewed so far,” states the report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The articles clearly say Butowsky hired Wheeler <em>for</em> the Rich&#39;s. Who is Wheeler working for? The person paying the bills? Or the family he is using to become famous? If he was working for the Rich&#39;s, he never would have broken the NDA in the first place. Instead, he was used to distract from Mueller being made Special Counsel.</p>

<p>As for the alleged Russian collusion, there&#39;s nothing to disavow. The odds are still in favor of evidence existing rather than not existing. I mean, why has the Special Counsel (that Wheeler was used to distract from) been selected? Possibly because non-partisan prosecution that the president cannot interfere with is necessary?</p>

<p>you citing fake news anonymous sources the claimed anyone in the trump admin outed sources or methods is a proven falsehood.  you don&#39;t have any evidence supporting that bogus claim besides citing anonymous fake news sources from outlets that were proven by wikileaks to collude with the clinton campaign LOL.  why do you continuously lie without a shred of evidence or proof?</p>
