       The Seth Rich conspiracy is yet another fake conspiracy invented by conservative outlets, and in this case none other than Fox News.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, the 'investigator" was a private PI hired for the Rich Family to investigate Seth's murder, however his services were being paid for by none other than a Fox News financial advisor and contributer
       <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/millionaire-fox-news-analyst-reportedly-funding-the-private-investigation-into-seth-richs-murder/">
        Ed Botowsky
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The investigator is Rod Wheeler, the same guy who  was interviewed on the Bill O'Reilly show and stated that
       <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2007/rod-wheeler-claims-o%E2%80%99reilly-factor-lesbian-gangs-are-raping-young-girls">
        Lesbian Gangs are raping young girls all over the country
       </a>
       , which was proven to be false.
      </p>
      <p>
       The credibility of Rod Wheeler is even more suspect now, because he has already recanted and admitted that his
       <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/hold-fire-on-those-stories-about-seth-rich-the-slain-dnc-staffer/article/2623263">
        source is a Fox news reporter
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So we can easily see that this hoax was created by none other than Fox News

       Maybe OP is thinking that this "investigation" is a politically motivated witch hunt started by Fox and perpetuated by Internet sleuths who have no criminal justice experience and who are rabidly looking for any story to take attention away from Trump's spiraling descent into impeachment? Idk, just guessing.

       Rod Wheeler: “Here’s one other thing that is going to be startling…I’m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn’t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC–check this out–a high ranking official at the DNC–when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around?”

        The Rich family immediately pushed back against the claim that they hired Wheeler, saying in a statement that "the services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family."

       The family agreed to let this PI who approached them look into the matter, but he would have to discuss any disclosures with them. He failed to do that because he's a loudmouth who is trying to make a name for himself and quickly retreated like Alex Jones does when anyone calls him on his bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Assange, he's called on his bs by the interviewer and he stumbles around trying to avoid saying yes or no. 
Saying yes means a motive is established for the murder Seth Rich (JA says his name in the interview) and there would be greater pressure on the police to investigate, which would lead to the arrests you so greatly desire.
Saying no ends the narrative.
So given the choice between justice or honesty, JA chooses to dodge the question.

       assange never stumbled.  he was the one who brought up the "27 year old dnc staffer" in the first place.   he is also not violating wikileaks official policy of not confirming whistleblower identities.  you're just a liar in full blown denial.

       Assange doesn't just refer to him as some 27 year old dnc staffer, he calls him by name later in the interview. But he doesn't say Seth Rich is the leaker because then JA and WikiLeaks "never been wrong" record would end. Instead, he throws out a red herring that you're more than willing to grasp on to with a level of desperation that shows you realize trump is going down and you're fighting it until your last breath. So keep on trying to misdirect, keep on screaming about the Clintons. They are as irrelevant as you, and I am not here to defend them. I'm here to try and keep you honest while you fail and flail.

       They cannot prevent him from looking into the matter, but they can have him sign a contract that he will not be reporting any "discoveries" without first getting their approval. And he 180s when they call him on his claims of being hired by them, so there's no point in bringing up any hannity "interviews." Nothing to dodge ;)

       Why did you avoid linking the Reuters story? So the tidbit you quoted won't have any context?
"But the disclosure could increase the pressure on Trump and his aides to provide the FBI and Congress with a full account of interactions with Russian officials and others with links to the Kremlin during and immediately after the 2016 election."
      </p>
      <p>
       Y'know, those contacts that the trump team keeps saying never happened, but days later there is proof that they lied. Kinda sounds like a bit of projection there where you keep calling me a liar despite me not lying.

       The quote doesn't prove anything. There will not be anyone saying that there is proof of collusion until arrests are made. Going on record stating something means you'd have to be prepared to be subpoenaed. That, or the statement will be retracted in a day or two like the Seth Rich PI.

       See, the difference between law enforcement and everyone chanting "lock her up" is law enforcement has to provide concrete evidence to press charges.

       What lie have I made? Pointing out that things don't align with your views? That if any congressperson said that there is collusion, the FBI would need to proceed with arresting trump, whether they are finished with their investigation or not? I mean, you can read an entire novel into a retweet by JA, but you can't comprehend that there is an active investigation and details of the investigation won't be leaked until charges are ready?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, by your own logic, since the trump campaign isn't being prosecuted, there is a cover-up in progress? Well, they're trying but are doing a bad job of it.

       Don't interpret me calling you on your BS as support for Hillary. I didn't vote for her, and would really appreciate it if your trumptards would stop bringing her back into the public eye. I realize trump does it because beating Hillary was his only accomplishment since running for president, but why you?

       I will make this incredibly simple for you. Provide a quote of mine (not a link to this thread, but the actual words I typed) that is false, and link the proof that what I said is false. Do that, and I'll say you're right and you did your god-fearing duty, telling those gosh-darn liberals what for. That is it. No copy pasta, no name-calling, nothing but a quote from me and proof it is wrong. Until then, you sir are wrong.

       Likelihood, as in it is probable, there is a strong possibility, it would not be out of the realm of possibility. I did not say that the undisclosed meeting that the trump campaign had with Russia (and the lied about) were proof positive of collusion. In other words, you lost yet again. And I made it so very easy for you too.

       nah, because as i've stated before, a proven cover-up is in progress, and an internet bet is useless.    and because you're an unhinged proven liar.  why are you dodging the $10k charity challenge to seth rich's family by the way?  your shillary has been proven to have destroyed subpoenaed evidence.

      <p>
       why is it you keep dodging every single argument of yours that was destroyed?  you keep peddling fiction that the PI wasn't working for rich family, when in fact he was and was contractually obligated to report to them.  wasn't selected, still working for them.

       You're using a family who lost their son as political cannon fodder, you're using a source that has come out and retracted all of their statements because they were untrue, you're claiming the investigations that have not completed are over with no results, and you're giving absolute faith to an attention whore who has a history of making false claims. You are a disgusting excuse for a human being, and you're either willfully spreading misinformation or you're beyond ignorant and believe everything the alt-right media tells you. I would suggest that you should be ashamed of yourself, but you lack the dignity and cognition to experience shame.

       Statement Regarding the Seth Rich Investigation
      </p>
      <p>
       To whom this may concern,
      </p>
      <p>
       In March of 2017, I was introduced by way of a telephone conference call, to Joel Rich, Mary Rich, Aaron Rich and Molly Rich, surviving family members of Seth Rich. Seth Rich was murdered in the District of Columbia in July of 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rich’s were aware of my background as a criminal investigator, specifically as a former police homicide investigator. They indicated that they had seen my many appearances on the Fox News Channel commenting and analyzing dozens of criminal cases and have always been impressed by my knowledge and experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rich’s engaged my services to assist with gathering information and evidence, in an effort to try to assist the Metropolitan Police Department identify the person(s) responsible for the murder of Seth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, there has been much discussion in the national media surrounding my revelation that I believe that Seth’s death could be possibly linked to his former employment at the DNC, or with relationships with others connected to his employment. I am still of the personal opinion that his murder may be tied to his employment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently I am prohibited to go into any detail surrounding my investigation and its findings.  However, I do want to say this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Since accepting the request of the Rich family to assist them in this investigation, I have always been focused on one thing, and one thing only; finding out who is responsible for the death of Seth. I feel as if I was making good progress and getting very close to developing a motive. Further, I can say that I have developed what I believe to be persons of interest, that I essentially would like to talk to further regarding information that they may have surrounding Seth’s death. I am of the personal opinion that the information/article reported by FoxNews Channel last Tuesday was essentially correct and worthy of further investigation. That is exactly why when I first learned of this new information developed by a FoxNews investigative journalist, I immediately called the DC Police to inform them."

       The acting spokesperson for the Rich family, Brad Bauman, is connected to Democratic propaganda czar David Brock according online observers. The discovery is the latest in a long line of revelations showing deep Democratic National Committee (DNC) involvement in the Seth Rich case.

       And the authors of the oped are the parents. If they weren't the ones to write it, there are more than enough conservative PACs to pay for them to denounce the oped.

      <p>
       To whom this may concern,
      </p>
      <p>
       In March of 2017, I was introduced by way of a telephone conference call, to Joel Rich, Mary Rich, Aaron Rich and Molly Rich, surviving family members of Seth Rich. Seth Rich was murdered in the District of Columbia in July of 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rich’s were aware of my background as a criminal investigator, specifically as a former police homicide investigator. They indicated that they had seen my many appearances on the Fox News Channel commenting and analyzing dozens of criminal cases and have always been impressed by my knowledge and experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rich’s engaged my services to assist with gathering information and evidence, in an effort to try to assist the Metropolitan Police Department identify the person(s) responsible for the murder of Seth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, there has been much discussion in the national media surrounding my revelation that I believe that Seth’s death could be possibly linked to his former employment at the DNC, or with relationships with others connected to his employment. I am still of the personal opinion that his murder may be tied to his employment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently I am prohibited to go into any detail surrounding my investigation and its findings.  However, I do want to say this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Since accepting the request of the Rich family to assist them in this investigation, I have always been focused on one thing, and one thing only; finding out who is responsible for the death of Seth. I feel as if I was making good progress and getting very close to developing a motive. Further, I can say that I have developed what I believe to be persons of interest, that I essentially would like to talk to further regarding information that they may have surrounding Seth’s death. I am of the personal opinion that the information/article reported by FoxNews Channel last Tuesday was essentially correct and worthy of further investigation. That is exactly why when I first learned of this new information developed by a FoxNews investigative journalist, I immediately called the DC Police to inform them."

       Lol, did you read the statement or listen to the video you linked? He never says he was hired by the family, his statement says he is being invited to share info with the police (so he wasn't talking with them before), and then he goes on to say the police will be handling the investigation without external help. Your own "evidence" contradicts your point. Seriously, the sources you link are as garbage as you are.

       let's note for the record, you are now BACKPEDALING away from your claim that PI/DC Homicide Investigator Wheeler ever issued a retraction in the first place, correct?  because that's exactly what Wheeler clarified when he stated fox5
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcwTF-ObV_g#t=2m30s">
        "manipulated and sliced that video"
       </a>
       of his interview with fox5, and that he never issued a retraction.  you were dead wrong :) now, let's see you acknowledge that.
      </p>
      <p>
       furthermore,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcwTF-ObV_g#t=5m38s">
        Wheeler reiterates that he was "stonewalled" and "got stopped"
       </a>
       in his investigation.   again, no retraction from Wheeler, and completely contradicts the lies you tried to push.
      </p>

       I never backpedaled, I just replied to what you posted. The Wheeler statement was crafted by a lawyer and very carefully avoids stating that he was hired by the Rich family because that is not true. Furthermore, Wheeler said that he only had a personal belief that SR was killed because of DNC leaks, he had no actual evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep posting these garbage sources from unheard of "news" sites. Garbage sources that are posting information that was already debunked, quite literally fake news.

       wheeler was indeed hired by the rich family, as there is a contractual agreement between them.  that runs in addition to wheeler's own statements stating the rich family spoke to him and agreed to hire him.

The letter cuts off without definitive proof that Wheeler was hired by the Rich family.

       You don't provide a link to the mediamatters article, which means I would have to take the word of a proven liar (you) that the article did say that.

       KDC makes demands he knows will not be met so he does not have to provide his "proof."

       Furthermore, how would Seth have even gotten the emails if he was the leaker? He was a data analyst, not a sysadmin. He would not have access to the mail server. No matter what way you look at it, an honest person would see that this is ridiculous.

       wheeler was indeed hired by the rich family, as there is a contractual agreement between them.  that runs in addition to wheeler's own statements stating the rich family spoke to him and agreed to hire him.

      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       and from your dnc/shillary media matters:  " Rod Wheeler, a Fox News contributor and former Washington, D.C., homicide detective
       <strong>
        who was employed by the family
       </strong>
       and earlier this week told a Fox affiliate that he believed police were covering up details about the crime."

       Now you're starting to get the point! They didn't hire the DNC spokesman, they didn't hire the PI, they didn't hire the lawyers. They are being used in a political tug-of-war and idiots like you love nothing more than to keep them in the middle.

       Potential election collusion? No one said Russia hacked the votes or the the Trump campaign was stuffing the ballot boxes. The potential collusion is in regards to manipulation of voters through fake news (the kinds you keep linking) and financial benefits for both groups that are not publically visible.

       All KDC did was embarrass himself by announcing he had the evidence to send Hillary to prison, and then ran away with his tail between his legs when called on it. You really choose the worst possible "heroes." Wheeler, Trump, KDC, all have been caught lying to the public but you love nothing more than prostrating yourself before them.

       That's not a link to an article. That's the last resort for frauds like you who are unable to come up with a response. You defend your argument by refusing to provide sources because you know the source would unravel your narrative. Sorry son, you've played yourself. All you do now is make increasingly hostile remarks about everything but your argument, which you conveniently leave out of your rebuttals because if you were forced to defend it, you know you could not. How about you get back to class, and when the summer break starts next week, you can do a little more research and come up with a valid point. Children like you should stay on the playground until you're ready to speak with the adults.

If there were reports providing evidence of collusion and trump and co were not on trial, there would be rioting in the streets. You see, the difference between you and adults is adults will wait until all the evidence comes out before drawing a conclusion.

       You keep demonstrating your ignorance as if you are proud of it. You've totally avoided the context of my reply and are only snipping out the bits that match your confirmation bias.

       The articles clearly say Butowsky hired Wheeler
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       the Rich's. Who is Wheeler working for? The person paying the bills? Or the family he is using to become famous? If he was working for the Rich's, he never would have broken the NDA in the first place. Instead, he was used to distract from Mueller being made Special Counsel.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the alleged Russian collusion, there's nothing to disavow. The odds are still in favor of evidence existing rather than not existing. I mean, why has the Special Counsel (that Wheeler was used to distract from) been selected? Possibly because non-partisan prosecution that the president cannot interfere with is necessary?

Second, there is evidence of the Russians interfering with the election. That isn't even being disputed by Republicans. The question is, was the trump campaign working with them. That is still being investigated.
Third, why is it that every day more damning information comes out regarding links between Russia and the trump campaign? Or more importantly, why are you so vehemently ignoring the information?

       The Rich family signed a contract, since they would have to give Wheeler access to information the average Joe would not have access to. Wheeler was hired by Butowsky.
      </p>

       Except Session's meetings were not already all out in the open. That's what's the big deal. He lied once about having no contacts, was caught red-handed and recanted saying that he was mistaken and he did have those contacts, and now a new undisclosed contact has been found.

       Subpoenas have been sent. No subpoenas for the "Seth Rich was the leaker and was assassinated!!!!" theory, but several related to trump and Russia. Kinda obvious which of us is chasing fantasy.

       non of your drivel contradicts the fact the rich family officially "hired" and employed" wheeler,as stated by everyone. you're a proven repeat liar.

      <p>
       sessions's meetings as a member Senate Armed Services Committee isn't hidden.  wrong again, proven liar.
      </p>
      <p>
       subpoenas have turned up nothing, as even the fbi has cleared flynn. LoL at you, proven liar.  your kusher claims were already debunked too, which you've conveniently dodged.
      </p>
      <p>
       no subpoenas were sent for dnc servers either, which is part of the cover-up.  keep on dodging those basic facts, proven liar.

       Saying Hillary lost solely because of Russia is baseless. She lost because she's a terrible candidate. A good candidate could have won, even with the Russian interference because trump is an even worse candidate than Hillary. Russian interference is known and acknowledged. But was the trump team in on it? We are in the process of finding out.

       Go back and read the source I provided. Wheeler had no evidence because he was repeating talking points provided to him by Fox. It had nothing to do with his possession of the evidence, it was a matter of there being no evidence. The job he was hired by Butowsky to do was serve as a distraction during a period of bad press for trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump revealed classified intel from an ally, an ally which intentionally shared the intel with us and not Russia, in a meeting that US media was barred from but Russian media wasn't. If it was as much of a nothingburger as you think it is, why was the white house issuing statements (first denying it happened, and then coming up with excuses why it was perfectly fine) about it?

       LoL, false.  Wheeler has more credibility than proven liars like you and the Comey-led FBI that covered up Clinton's crimes.

Also hilarious is how you're still dodging the fact Assange has repeatedly dropped Seth Rich's name as the DNC leaker.

       you citing fake news anonymous sources the claimed anyone in the trump admin outed sources or methods is a proven falsehood.  you don't have any evidence supporting that bogus claim besides citing anonymous fake news sources from outlets that were proven by wikileaks to collude with the clinton campaign LOL.  why do you continuously lie without a shred of evidence or proof?

        "manipulated and sliced that video"

       of his interview with fox5, and that he never issued a retraction.  you were dead wrong :) now, let's see you acknowledge that.

       The FBI (the Feds) are not investigating SR. They have publicly stated this is solely in the jurisdiction of the DC police. So Wheeler has no inside FBI connection. That means all of his claims regarding having any evidence of SR being the leaker are bogus. You keep repeating the point I have made. NO FEDS INVOLVED. Wheeler was only there to lie on camera to distract from trump's team lying on camera.

       LoL, false.  Wheeler has more credibility than proven liars like you and the Comey-led FBI that covered up Clinton's crimes.  You'll also have to explain away why the DC police are in possession of Rich's laptop to begin with.  It is also entirely plausible the FBI is lying once again, as they have numerous times.   Also hilarious is how you're still dodging the fact Assange has repeatedly dropped Seth Rich's name as the DNC leaker.

       funny how you're also continuously dodging the fact the DNC repeatedly called the seth family to quash wheeler's investigation.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trump revealed classified intel from an ally, an ally which intentionally shared the intel with us and not Russia, in a meeting that US media was barred from but Russian media wasn't. If it was as much of a nothingburger as you think it is, why was the white house issuing statements (first denying it happened, and then coming up with excuses why it was perfectly fine) about it?

       The source of the Wheeler interview says that Wheeler has since backpedaled on his statements during the interview, and his "claims" of an FBI informant have been proven to be laughably false since the FBI is not involved with the investigation. Wheeler went on camera and provided a distraction like he was supposed to.

       Your only retort is, "but he said it, so it must be true." I know this is r/conspiracy, but sometimes when everyone is telling you the same thing, they're doing that because it is true. Everyone is telling you that Wheeler lied on camera. That's because it is true.

       Wheeler isn't going to any reputable news outlets. He's talking to a guy who is hosting a YouTube channel out of his garage. (that isn't you, is it?) The reason no one else will host Wheeler is because he is just lying on camera.

       The edited interview does not matter. Do you know why? Because the "edited" part was Wheeler saying that the FBI was involved in the investigation. That is factually incorrect. The FBI is not involved, so all of your arguments are invalid because they all revolve around Wheeler having an FBI insider giving him details. No FBI involvement means no FBI insider means Wheeler is lying.

       LoL, false.  Wheeler has more credibility than proven liars like you and the Comey-led FBI that covered up Clinton's crimes.  You'll also have to explain away why the DC police are in possession of Rich's laptop to begin with.  It is also entirely plausible the FBI is lying once again, as they have numerous times.   Also hilarious is how you're still dodging the fact Assange has repeatedly dropped Seth Rich's name as the DNC leaker.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trump revealed classified intel from an ally, an ally which intentionally shared the intel with us and not Russia, in a meeting that US media was barred from but Russian media wasn't. If it was as much of a nothingburger as you think it is, why was the white house issuing statements (first denying it happened, and then coming up with excuses why it was perfectly fine) about it?

       Dude, I think you need to see a doctor. You're pretty sick in the head. You are believing Wheeler (who has a history of being placed in front of a camera so he can make a ridiculous and false claim) over countless sources, including pro-trump sources, saying the FBI is not involved so Wheeler is lying about an FBI source. You are beyond delusional. If the FBI was investigating the death of Rich, they would be subject to government oversight, and the current government would love nothing more than to blast that info everywhere. But they aren't. Because the FBI isn't involved. Wheeler lied, and you fell for it.

       Comey's testimony is tomorrow. Only his opening statement has been posted. I wonder why he only detailed a couple of the meetings he had with trump despite saying he documented all of them? Could there be more that will be said tomorrow? I guess we will have to wait and see.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Senate Intel hearing, trump/Russia was not the subject of the hearing and the answers were all "I will not say in a public hearing" instead of the "no" Republicans were hoping for. Know what was proven wrong though? All of trump's "Obama was spying on me" and the unmasking claims.

       He flat out called trump a liar. Did ya miss that? Also, you're saying "hey, use this term instead" is obstruction but "hey, he's a nice guy, so drop the investigation" isn't? You're making as much sense as McCain did.

       You're picking and choosing what you want to believe from the testimony, and calling everything else lies.
Comey said trump lied multiple times, and was under oath when he said it. Which means he is 100% confident trump lied.
The Russia investigation is still ongoing (just like he had to remind McCain multiple times. Are you sure you're not McCain?)
Comey said that trump urged him to drop the Flynn investigation.
Lynch did not urge Comey to drop any investigation, just use a more favorable term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you actually listen to the hearing? Or are you just reading headlines from your usual trash sources? So far, you have failed to show that you have any idea what was actually said.

       wrong.  comey has perjured himself before. that's not news.  his entire credibility is shot.   also, if you're going to believe him, then you'll have to admit trump never was and never will be under investigation for collusion since there is zero evidence.  LoL.

       How did he perjure himself? I've seen a couple posts about the tapes tweet and a NYT article about the dinner, but that wasn't the memo he sent to a friend.
Trumps lawyer accused Comey of leaking, but the only information he released was unclassified, so it wouldn't be a leak.
Comey said he was not given an order, but that doesn't mean trump didn't try to influence him. ;)
The Russia investigation is still ongoing. If it was so phoney as you claim, it would have been finished by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why isn't trumps lawyer or the white house arguing that Comey lied about trump lying?

       Trumps vindication is Comey saying that he was not personally under investigation during Comey's tenure. That does not eliminate the collusion investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump/Russia theory is still open, it's just that trump was not being investigated for any collusion that he himself partook in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey said trump urged him to drop the investigation. Then trumps lawyer confirmed that trump said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation. That is trump, ever so delicately saying "yo... Drop this please."
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, point out how Comey perjured himself. Oh? You just have the talking points T_D gives you because you can't think for yourself? Yeah, I figured that.

       wrong.  comey has perjured himself before. that's not news.  his entire credibility is shot.   also, if you're going to believe him, then you'll have to admit trump never was and never will be under investigation for collusion since there is zero evidence.

       Are you unable to point out where Comey perjured himself? Looks like it. Looks like you're lying again, just like you've been lying every other time you send a reply. Point out the perjury, or go back to your circle jerk in T_D. Ya'll can keep jerking until the charges are filed.

      <p>
       there was no evidence of collusion to begin with, unlike the clintons LoL.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: too fun:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hoping or wishing for an outcome bears no resemblance to the crime of obstruction as defined not just by statute, but by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2005 case of Arthur Anderson v. United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intelligence Committee Chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., asked Comey quite directly, “Was the president trying to obstruct justice?”  As expected, Comey demurred by claiming, “It’s not for me to say.”  While there is no legal basis for declining to answer the pivotal question, Comey dodged it for a reason.  If he said, under oath, that he regarded the president’s words as obstruction, Comey would have incriminated himself in a crime known as “misprision of felony.”
      </p>
      <p>
       As explained in an earlier column, the law imposes an affirmative duty on federal officials, like Comey, to immediately report knowledge of a felony such as obstruction to a person in authority.  In the case of an FBI Director, his superior is the Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice.  Comey admitted he did not tell anyone at DOJ.  His excuses were legally vacuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, one can conclude that Comey either did not believe the president obstructed justice (and, therefore, had no duty to report it) or he did not want to put himself in legal jeopardy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey was pressed on the issue.  Unbelievably, he claimed he did not know whether FBI agents have a duty to report a crime that has been committed:
      </p>
      <p>
       Question:  “You’re unsure whether they would have a legal duty?”
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer: “That’s a good question.  I’ve not thought about that before.  (pause)  There is a statute that prohibits misprision of a felony -- knowing of a felony and taking steps to conceal it.  But this is a different question.”
      </p>
      <p>
       No, Mr. Comey, it is not a different question.  It is a fundamental legal obligation for all people who serve in law enforcement.  The head of the FBI should know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, the entire question of obstruction was rendered moot and meaningless by Comey himself when he endorsed what constitutional scholars, including Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz, have long maintained.  That is, the president has the constitutional authority to stop investigations and prosecutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I’m not a legal scholar…but as a legal matter, the president is head of the executive branch and could direct, in theory, that anybody be investigated or not be investigated,” admitted Comey.
      </p>
      <p>

       There was no collusion with Lynch. He said that she asked him to use a different term for the investigation, not that he did anything.
      </p>

       Like he said, "legally? Not really, there's no legal precedent for an agent to report a crime if they see one. Ethically? Yes, the agent is expected to."

       Lynch asked him to refer to the investigation as a "matter." That isn't obstruction. Furthermore, he didn't follow her request.

       If you think a former lawyer/director of the FBI would announce under oath the existence of memos, but they not exist, you're an idiot. Maybe you should be asking Mueller about the memos and not congress.

       He was the director of the FBI. He wasn't an intern or contractor. Additionally, the memos were his personal notes, not official FBI documents.

       Not all were written on classified devices, and Comey declassified those that did not contain classified material. You're still grasping at straws like trumps attorney. If Comey knew he would get in trouble, he wouldn't have testified under oath.

       You claim perjury, but the only "proof" you have is a tweet by JA, that cannot be verified. Face it, this spin is dead. I guess you'll have to wait for the Sessions session to come up with new propaganda.

       So, I admit that I did not know Comey used the term "matter" but provide points for why that is insignificant in comparison to what Comey had to say about trump, and you think that makes me a liar?

       Mueller's investigation is still underway. I wonder if you will be singing the same tune when he's done. (hint: You won't be)

       Comey himself has said. And he declassified others. Face it, trumps lawyer was talking out of his ass, trying to be intimidating, but nothing will become of it because he knows he has no case.

       LoL at you, proven liar.  ahahahaha.  it is indeed obstruction/collusion.   and comey did in fact follow Lynch's orders. ahahahha, just more and more of your proven lies, proven liar:

       <strong>
        Despite his concerns, Mr. Comey avoided calling it an investigation. “I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter,” Mr. Comey told reporters days after the meeting.

       wrong again, proven liar.  can't claim obstruction later on when you've failed to mention it months ago at the time of alleged memos (which are still missing), which is why nothing is happening to trump while comey's heading to prison with Lynch LOL :)

       Comey said that during his time in the FBI, trump personally was not under investigation. Mueller came after Comey's tenure, largely due to trump firing Comey. Do you really think trump isn't being looked into now? And while trump may not have been the focus of any of the other investigations, the dealings of his companies certainly were, which could bring him down as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I've said, if your claims against Comey were as air tight as you think, he would have already been charged.

       factually, comey leaked supposed memos, which nobody has actually seen, and which didn't qualify for obstruction when he wrote them as admitted during testimony, solely for the appointment of his longtime friend, mueller. LoL.  no conflict of interest there.

        Robert Mueller should recuse himself from Russia investigation.  Former FBI director is too close to his successor, James Comey, to be impartial.

       Sessions statement under oath. Are you now going to say Sessions committed perjury?
      </p>
      <p>
       The news would only be proven fake if Mueller makes a statement saying trump is not under investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If trump fired the special counsel it would only strengthen the obstruction of justice claims. You don't fire the person investigating you if you're innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And funny how trump Jr is linking an email dated in march. Comey said that during February he and other senior FBI had determines that sessions would be recusing himself. That only serves to confirm Comey's statement.

       So you go from Comey/Sessions "destroying"  trump/Russia collusion to "Sessions was only parroting the lies." Well, which is it? Did Sessions perjure himself, or are you delusional?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not both? It's already established that you are a pathetic delusional liar who is so oblivious to reality that the only thoughts in your head are the thoughts the alt-right pundits tell you to think. And Sessions has continued to lie about his interactions with Russian agents. I'm going with both.

       wtf are you smoking? once again, you make no sense.  comey/sessions  stated there was no collusion/investigation of trump, you moron.  that's a big difference between the bogus claim of interference, which you still can't provide a single piece of evidence for.  assange also put a nail in that coffin, but you'll just keep dodging him LoL.  how does it feel to completely botch collusion vs interference again? you proven liar.

       Comey and Sessions confirmed that Russia interfered with the election (y'know, that "muh Russia" thing you keep saying) and that the trump campaign is a focus of the investigation. Trump was not personally under investigation (until he fired Comey) but Comey refused to make a statement on it solely because there is a very high likelihood that the Russia investigation would eventually involve trump as a person of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for your half-truths and fake news you keep spamming, Comey did not commit perjury, Lynch and (I don't know why the hell you're trying to rehash this old narrative) Rice will not be prosecuted. You're desperation is showing. And it is pathetic.

       The Russian interference is 100% known and acknowledged. Even Putin has tried to say "oh, it's just some patriots." The collusion investigation is investigating to see whether the trump campaign knew/approved/assisted with the interference. With the ever increasing number of Russian ties between the trump team and Russia, there will be a lot that has to be investigated. Speaking of the investigation...

       Looks more like the fake news site your posting is taking a quote out of context and attempting to twist the meaning. Schiff states that they are far to early in the investigation to be ready to go to a jury. Go spread your lies in T_D where they are wanted.

       Every single intelligence official and politician who has been asked about Russian interference (many of which were under oath) has confirmed it. Even trump appointees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your fake news sources that take snippets of quotes, twist them around a single word, and then try to spin the quote as the exact opposite of what was said do not count as anyone being "forced to admit" anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Comey had committed perjury, why hasn't the republican controlled congress had him arrested? Because he didn't. Your fake sources are the only ones saying he did, and they are only saying that because idiots like you will believe any pro-trump garbage they post.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you want to call anyone a coward, go find a mirror. You're still scared of a wager over a cup of coffee.

       There are ongoing intelligence investigations. They will not reveal what intelligence they have gathered, because their methods may be discovered.

       I think it was stupid of the DNC to deny FBI access to the servers. The only possible reason I can see for why they would have said no is if the servers would be down while the FBI investigates.

       If you're so sure of Clinton's wrongdoings, then take the bet. Scared? You dodge it like you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't prove any of it? ALL OF IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED MULTIPLE TIMES BY MULTIPLE OUTLETS. There's no "can't prove it," there's only you not believing it because it doesn't suit your narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, you're just reading propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does that even make sense? Comey won't be arrested for perjury because he perjured himself due to some unnamed Clinton or Obama thing?

       Was Clinton corrupt? Yeah, but she was also a lawyer who ensured her corruption was within the law. That's why your propaganda sources have to come up with such harebrained accusations of what she did. That's also why she isn't in handcuffs, but Donnie has the FBI ordering a special set that will fit on his tiny hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, you are accusing Comey of something that you claim is easily provable, but the Republican controlled congress is not pressing any charges. Maybe you should take a moment and ask yourself why that is. Could it be that you're being lied to and Comey didn't commit perjury?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you ready to grow a pair and stop crying every time the wager is mentioned? Or are you still a coward who is afraid of anything that could have ramifications?

       If you honestly believe trump will "drain the swamp" then calling you a fool is an understatement. Trump played you like a fiddle son. And if your Comey claims haven't been addressed because you're just spouting propaganda. If what you say is true, then Comey would be under arrest.

       Just because you agree with the opinion, doesn't make it fact.

       No, you quite literally did not deny that trump isn't going to drain the swamp, because you know he won't.

       They presented a side of the story that does not "call him out," but tries to cover Sessions' ass. In February Comey knew that Sessions would likely be recusing himself, and behold! In March Sessions recused himself.
      </p>

       What storybook is telling you Rice or Lynch is going to be testifying? Rice has already testified and it has already been shown that there was no unlawful unmasking. And Lynch has been irrelevant since she met with Clinton on her plane. Keep trying buddy. One of these times you might actually have correct information.

       You are presented with a list of quotes, each referencing when it was said, and all you can say is it is fake news? Are you intentionally avoiding it because you don't want to admit what a fraud trump is, or do you know what a fraud he is and you are just here to cause commotion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are none of the "major" right-wing rags running the McCabe story?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if Russia is such a hoax, why have so many trump reps come out and said, repeatedly, under oath that Russia interfered with the election? Why are there so many undisclosed ties between trump folks and Russia that they lie about and then backtrack and admit to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me guess, now you're going to say that there isn't anything wrong with collusion.

       There's nothing to dodge. You're just so oblivious to reality that there's no point in replying to you. I give you exact quotes, and you say they are fake. You give me actual fake news sources, and act like they have actual information. I point out time and time again why Wheeler is wrong, why trump is bad, but all you can do is repeat debunked talking points you got from t_d. But don't worry, I'll be back when the handcuffs are busted out. Unfortunately, it'll just be to say "I told you so" instead of to claim the cup of coffee you were too afraid to wager.

      <p>
       Next, let's look at the NBC article.
       <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/slain-dnc-staffer-s-family-orders-blabbing-detective-cease-desist-n762211">
        http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/slain-dnc-staffer-s-family-orders-blabbing-detective-cease-desist-n762211
       </a>
       It continues on to say, "Rich's family only hired Wheeler on the urging of a conservative Dallas financial adviser and Fox News regular named Ed Butowsky, who offered to cover Wheeler's fees, as NBC News first reported."
Hrm... Interesting. Someone else is paying the PI "hired" by the Rich's. I wonder what details that original NBC report has...

       Oh look! Here it is:

       </a>
       "The Dallas-based financial adviser, Ed Butowsky, a Fox News regular who has written articles for Breitbart News, contacted the parents of Seth Rich and urged them to hire a private investigator to look into the death of their 27-year-old son, who was shot and killed last July in what police say was a robbery gone wrong. Butowsky offered to cover the fees and connect them with an investigator"
      </p>
      <p>
       So you mean a fox contributor hired a fox contributor to "investigate" on behalf of the Rich's? And fox broke this amazing story proving Seth was the leaker? And then fox retracted the story because it was all fake?! Shocking.

       Again, the family has been quoted as saying they did not hire the PI. You have linked articles stating the PI was hired by a 3rd party. And the PI has admitted that he has not ever actually come even close to any of the actual evidence because he's not part of the investigation. That's why he is a PI, and not a detective. Are you really this disconnected from reality? That the family saying "we did not hire him" somehow means that they absolutely did? Seriously, there gets to be a point where you're a danger to yourself because you have lost touch with reality. Maybe you should seek help.

       Show me a quote where the family says they hired him. I can provide one where they said they did not. You cannot even meet that one little criteria, which is where this entire thread started. The PI said they hired him, they said no, he admitted they didn't. You're still peddling a ridiculous narrative that has been destroyed by the source.

One of us loses $5 after a specific set of criteria is met. You resort to demanding a substantial payment to a charity at no risk to yourself. Like a coward.

       As for ignoring your nonsense, it's because I proved you wrong ages ago. NDA dies not mean hired, and the family has said that they did not hire him. You are relying on reports that have been proven false as the base for your argument. You've failed to provide an example of me lying. You've lost. You can keep spamming the same drivel, but the facts won't change. ;)

You're still a coward. There's a huge difference between $5 and $10k, and you're not willing to enter a deal where you run the risk of losing. You see, the whole point of choosing reasonable terms is it is reasonable for both parties to participate. But you lack reason, confidence, and courage. Then again, I guess that's why you're a trump fan.

        That was stated by you. The trump campaign isn't being prosecuted right now, so does that mean a cover-up is in progress? From some of the articles that have come out recently, it certainly sounds like a cover-up is being attempted.

      <p>
       no crimes have been committed by trump, whereas shillary has admittedly broken the law by destroying subpoenaed classified evidence.

      <p>
       your comparison is a completely failure, just like you =) LoL!

       JA/wikileaks dropping names isn't a workaround. It's bait that you took. Until there is proof, it isn't true. If you, or anyone else, can provide proof then I will agree with you. But until them, you're being played.

       Having a NDA still doesn't prove that the PI was hired by the family. I'll take their word over his, especially since he changed his story.

       Wheeler literally came out a day later and said not only has he never seen any emails between Rich and Wikileaks, he has no knowledge of them, and his statements were all just promotion for the Fox News article where this bullshit fictional story originated.

       Sure thing, here's video footage from the exact same people who he made the original claim of having a link between Rich and Wikileaks to, who reached out to him again and he responds that it was all just a "miscommunication", meanwhile Rich's own family denies everything this man has said and are now looking to possibly sue

       There's no fucking evidence Seth Rich and Wikileaks were ever in contact. There's one fucking Fox news article, which has absolutely no confirmed sources or evidence, just "Oh we heard from this one random anonymous tip..."

       1) Seen the video several times. He does not imply even once that Rich was one of their sources, all he's saying is that Wikileaks is concerned about the issue of whistleblowers facing violence for their actions. They're discussing a news story. You are making shit up, literally. You're hearing whatever you want to hear. YOU HAVE NO FUCKING PROOF.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Why the fuck are you ranting about Russia, I haven't mentioned Russia once in any of my comments, why are you spamming shit about the Trump-Russia story? We're not talking about that at all right now.

      <p>
       And just for shits and giggles oh yeah did I mention THE MAN'S OWN FUCKING FAMILY SAYS HE WASN'T IN TOUCH WITH WIKILEAKS. How unbelievably narcissistic of a person are you that you think you know more about a man who you never met or even knew existed until two weeks ago's personal dealings than his own family? Assange didn't say jackshit and everyone involved in this bullshit Fox News story has backtracked away from it in the last 24 hours because they know they have zero evidence whatsoever to support their claims. It's fucking clickbait for people as gullible as yourself.

        1) Seen the video several times. He does not imply even once that Rich was one of their sources, all he's saying is that Wikileaks is concerned about the issue of whistleblowers facing violence for their actions. They're discussing a news story. You are making shit up, literally. You're hearing whatever you want to hear. YOU HAVE NO FUCKING PROOF

       LOL  triggered much?  why on earth would assange bring up seth rich's identity "27 year old dnc staffer murdered" if he wasn't trying to equate him to a whistleblower/one of his sources contrary to the official bullshit story you're peddling that rich hasn't done anything and was just a victim of random violence?  moron much?

       They were talking about whistleblowers. The Seth Rich story had just come into the news. He was commenting on a news story. At no point does he ever imply that Rich was working Wikileaks. Ever. You show a fundamental lack of reading comprehension if you can read the transcript of that interview and come to your conclusion.

      <p>
       And I haven't said one thing about Rich's murder's motivations. Shove words into people's mouths they've never said much?

       a dnc staffer being murdered doesn't make him a whistleblower.  nor does it imply he is a whisteblower.  why else would assange drop his name and refuse to deny a seth rich connection unless he was a whisteblower?

       that's irrelevant. you seem to be too dumb to understand that basic fact.  a dnc staffer being murdered doesn't imply he is a whistleblower.  the interviewer was not even discussing anything related to seth rich's murder, and clearly asked assange about an october surprise.  moron much? you fake news parrot.

       It's funny though that no MSM is going after the bread crumbs on this story, sure there are no facts, just theories, but that has never stopped the MSM before. You would think it's a juicy story and would bring in ratings.

       The FBI came out and said that that Seth Rich did not email Wikileaks, the family responded to the Fox broadcast by stating unequivivally that their son did not leak any emails to Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only media pushing this hoax is conservative media that have a history of publishing fake news (Fox, Breitbart, Infowars, Zero Hedge etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the "source" of the "evidence" is Fox's own reporter quoting their analyst who quotes their reporter, it becomes an endless loop of them quoting each other, something that conservatives do a lot of.

       No offense, but how can the FBI know for sure if he didn't leak it to WikiLeaks or another source.  Given how the FBI is in Shambles , not sure if I should I take anything they say as gospel. Plus, it's understandable that the family would want to keep Seth out of the spotlight. Why would they want to admit that he did anything wrong

       Because the "leak" came from a hack probably some sort of phishing scam that they identified. The FBI would have traced the link and looked at the source code, which was probably in Russian, and the most likely reason why they are confident the DNC were hacked by Russia.

       Show me a quote where the family says they hired him. I can provide one where they said they did not. You cannot even meet that one little criteria, which is where this entire thread started. The PI said they hired him, they said no, he admitted they didn't. You're still peddling a ridiculous narrative that has been destroyed by the source. Now, are you going to stop being a coward and accept the bet?

       The articles clearly say Butowsky hired Wheeler
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       the Rich's. Who is Wheeler working for? The person paying the bills? Or the family he is using to become famous? If he was working for the Rich's, he never would have broken the NDA in the first place. Instead, he was used to distract from Mueller being made Special Counsel.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the alleged Russian collusion, there's nothing to disavow. The odds are still in favor of evidence existing rather than not existing. I mean, why has the Special Counsel (that Wheeler was used to distract from) been selected? Possibly because non-partisan prosecution that the president cannot interfere with is necessary?

       The FBI (the Feds) are not investigating SR. They have publicly stated this is solely in the jurisdiction of the DC police. So Wheeler has no inside FBI connection. That means all of his claims regarding having any evidence of SR being the leaker are bogus. You keep repeating the point I have made. NO FEDS INVOLVED. Wheeler was only there to lie on camera to distract from trump's team lying on camera.

       “at no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.”  seems the fake news media that colluded with shillary were the ones to "reveal israel", and not anyone from the trump admin.  LoL at you citing fake anonymous sources, proven liar.

       wtf are you smoking? once again, you make no sense.  comey/sessions  stated there was no collusion/investigation of trump, you moron.  that's a big difference between the bogus claim of interference, which you still can't provide a single piece of evidence for.  assange also put a nail in that coffin, but you'll just keep dodging him LoL.  how does it feel to completely botch collusion vs interference again? you proven liar.

       rofl nope.  another nothingburger, which is why it couldn't even make it onto any major fake news front pages.  of course, you can't explain away why random hackers would need to contact several supposed intermediaries instead of just handing over clinton's deleted emails directly to wikileaks.  you lose again, proven amateur liar.
