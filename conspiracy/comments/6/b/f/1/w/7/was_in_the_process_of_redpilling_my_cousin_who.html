    <div class="md"><p>September Clues is a big part of the equation, for sure. Excellent documentary that explains the media misdirection.</p>

<p>But the demolition itself was thermonuclear, not conventional. Conventional demolition is not feasible on a building that size -- the current world record is only 33 stories, and the WTC were predominantly steel construction. Nuclear demolition, OTOH, explains quite a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious, I dont understand the nuclear 9/11 thing, like how is that even possible or nessessary? I still think they were just heavily modified remote controlled planes rigged to blow for max damage and the buildings rigged with thermite? Wouldnt there be radiation after? I never got that theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WTC was heavy steel construction. At worst, a plane full of explosives would have blown a charred hole in the top, leaving the lower part wholly intact. Probably wouldn&#39;t have even done that. There&#39;s a reason high-explosives are used on infantry while armor piercing is used on tanks.</p>

<p>At any rate, it wouldn&#39;t have reduced each building to billowing clouds of radioactive dust, as is what happened. Yes, radioactive. Explains the thousands of cases of radiogenic cancers in WTC responders and NYC residents:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do understand that many common building materials have somewhat high levels of radioactive elements in them, most notably concrete. </p>

<p>I would guess that a huge amount of Radon was released into the air when the towers fell. All buildings are radioactive to an extent, more so if built from stone. </p>

<p>You&#39;d have to be an idiot to think there was a nuclear device used to bring the twin towers down. </p>

<p>Also, the Twin Towers were built in the 70&#39;s so were almost certainly chock-full of asbestos, which is the reason so mane firefighters get cancer. </p>

<p>So yeah, a big cloud of radon and asbestos dust is what caused the cancer rates amongst responders and residents. To instantly jump to it being a nuclear device is absolutely absurd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to slowly open as many peoples minds to conspiracy as i can... I start by telling them about the fear MSM floods us with an how they use fear like (false flags) an terrorists constatly inorder for people to feel the need for goverment to protect us, i explain how the Federal Reserve keeps society in a debt based life to enslave us into work an i try with 911 but often get alot of pushback on that topic, so i jus tell them to watch building 7s collapse when they get home an hope that something that i say or they watch will lead them to poke around some more an more, leading to them talking to other people an it snowballing to more an more people investigating things on there own instead of taking wat &quot;news&quot; spoon feeds them everyday... I never believed anything except the narritive i was giving thru childhood, but all it took was the 911 attacks  (the pentagon was wat woke me first) i jus remember looking at the caved in side of it an saying to myself there was no way an airplane could be what hit it, An from there i went, after about 5 years i really realized the sad state powerful people have surppressed our minds too... Never give up spreading truth, it can be  a slow proccess but i truly believe once people do a little investigating on there own that there will be something they read or watch that will trigger the feeling people get when, something jus dont seem right, an they will procced to open another door, then another an other</p>
