       The breaking news with Seth rich is obviously huge.  Seemed like there was really nothing that would ever come from it but could the news of his laptop and WikiLeaks be what puts this whole thing over the top and takes down Trump and his administration?? On top of everything we've already seen, if there is some way Trump and his campaign were really related to a murder that would do it but the question is how likely is it?

       Huh? The Trump campaign.  How would it not make sense? I agree it's still farfetched and shouldn't be a conclusion we start to focus on this early but it could be story that propels Trump followers to really open their eyes to see what has happened here.  We don't need it to be connected either way to be rid of trump at this point but this would be expedite the process lol.

       Mike pompeo went in on Julian assange and WikiLeaks just a month ago.  Who is pompeo?  Only Trump's pick for CIA director.  He was very harsh on WikiLeaks.  Have you not been paying attention to fox news MSNBC or CNN for the past year?

       If Cambridge Analytica has a hacker contingent/if the GRU did the hack...
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Kill Seth Rich and launch a counter-conspiracy that not only adds to the "Clinton Body Count" narrative just in time for the election, but also refutes the hacking claims. You could take out any DNC connected person and achieve the same goals. Rich, a tech guy, is perfect though-- not only would he conceivably have access to the type of stuff that was eventually leaked (though his access level has been debated) but he might have been one of the few in a position to notice malicious outsider network action/the hack itself.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I still need a motive for Rich to leak, nothing about him indicates a willingness to torpedo his own party, I thought he was about to go work for the Clinton campaign as is. This whole story is just too easy to turn into a 'pede or GRU disinfo campaign, lacks depth. That multiple iterations of this story dominate the_d right now also gives me pause, like those guys really care about a dead Democrat. The willingness to just keep the story floating around, promoting it like an advertisement without asking more questions or doubting the evidence-free assertions this article suggests...very much like pizzagate, but somehow less convincing. And yeah, WL twitter promoted that one too.

       Look at his photo. Do you think he supported Hillary, Bernie or Donald? He was a Bernie bro working for the Democratic Party.
He was not working for Hillary. So when he sees the primary being stolen, he does a bit of hacking in the office and gives Wikileaks a USB drive.

       Does that bevy of assumptions come solely from looking at his photo? Where's social media support of Sanders? Where are quotes from friends saying he was a Berniebro? Is there anything beyond optics that suggests he was a Sanders diehard? I'm legit curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was actively rooting for a Clinton indictment of some type and subsequent Sanders candidacy BTW. In general, my post is just spitballing, Rich was the leaker and thus was killed is still on the table, just seems awfully convenient for me. Law enforcement/PI claiming he's seen evidence is virtually the same as "FBI insiders" saying there's evidence of pay for play and sex crimes on Weiner's laptop = Clinton indictments are coming! = pizzagate is real!

       If he was a fully professional employee of the Democratic Party, he would know not to openly display his support of any candidate. 
 So, yes based on his photo I am assuming he was secretly a Bernie bro. 
However, assuming he was a professional, he was probably appalled at the way the Hillary wing was manipulating the primary election.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the more reason for him to be the whistleblower.

       This is the second mention I have seen in the last hour that insinuates Trump, the RNC, or both had something to do with Rich's murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely a misinformation campaign going on since I don't think I have ever heard someone suggest such a thing until tonight. Not even a hypothetical mention of it until tonight.

      <p>
       And the last person that did became quite a sad and pathetic douche nozzle when I disagreed with them.

       I don't think it's a campaign or brigade. I think it's just users trying to get a popular post by stating their little opinion on the matter. At least check their profile history before accusing them of being part of a campaign

       As I stated in a previous post, Mike pompeo is on tape just last month speaking very critically of WikiLeaks.  It is very damning, basically calling WikiLeaks and assange enemies of the united States.  If you kept up with information, you may be aware of who Mike pompeo actually is.  This is Donald Trump's selection for CIA director.  So tell me, do you think it is bullshit to think Trump would not feel the same as his choice of CIA director?  This administration is painting assange and WikiLeaks as enemies of the state and I'll damned if people want to disregard anything that doesn't play to some liberal talking point.  If this turns out to be true and Trump goes down for it then so be it.  The man deserves justice and the country needs to escape this long national nightmare of trump.

       When was Seth Rich murdered? Do you know? 
July 10, 2016. 
If the DNC could have stopped the leaks, they would have won.
How do you stop leaks? Kill the first guy who leaks is an effective method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now explain to me how the Trump administration's current shitty attitude towards Wikileaks caused them to murder some IT guy they knew nothing about in JULY 2016!!!

       Don't even start with it unless you can connect Jones with them.  Can you? With proof?  Won't get far with seiu narratives without tying in all of the Jones shit.  Come serious or don't waste our time bro.

       I concur OP.  The FBI needs to open a large, high profile investigation into this.  All the information found on this case should be shared with as many law enforcement agencies as possible, especially the stuff on Rich's labtop.  There should be daily updates on the investigation in the NYTimes and WaPost, including as much evidence from the case as possible - without compromising the case or revealing anything classified, of course.
