       Basically what happened is that Israel wanted to create a false flag using ISIS (which they control) and so Trump told the Russians about it and thwarted the false flag. Netanyahu is rampaging in his office and demanding the US cabal to impeach him. The whole purpose of ISIS was to ultimately destroy Russia, Syria, and Iran while draining the US of its wealth. If ISIS dies, Israel will lose much of its support. The budget we have allocated for fighting ISIS is really going to support Israel. We aren't even fighting ISIS. We are supporting ISIS and supporting Israel's sinister plans.

       Former Mossad Chief responds to Trumps "betrayal" to Zion and threatens to punish Americans:
      </p>
      <p>
       A former Mossad chief says Israel should punish the US for President Donald Trump leaking intelligence to the Russians, because his acts could endanger Israeli sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       “We need to punish the Americans, it’s possible, so that we don’t put Trump in a position where he is again tempted, we need to abstain from transferring information to him, or to only give him partial information so that he can’t endanger any source,” says Danny Yatom, who headed the Israeli spy agency between 1999 and 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though it is Trump’s right to declassify information, if he keeps doing it Israel wills “stop sharing in the future,” Yatom estimates, speaking in an interview with Radio 103 FM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yatom also says he is “sure that the Mossad will do all in its power so that the source can keep giving information, but would try to extract him if need be.”

       UPDATE - Jim Stone unravels Israels evil plan for another 9-11:
      </p>
      <p>
       BOOM: HERE IT IS - THE REASON THEY ARE TRYING TO BUTCHER TRUMP RIGHT NOW, AND THE CULPRIT IS ISRAEL
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel hatched another new 911 terror plot, and Trump shut it down. Here is how the story line was supposed to go
Terrorists were going to board a U.S. bound plane from Europe, with laptops. They were going to hack the plane with their laptops, and do a second 911. When Trump mentioned terrorists with laptops to Russia, and to get them off of planes, and then Trump banned laptops on flights to the U.S., he shut down the Israeli terror plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plot was obviously as fabricated as 911. I do not know who leaked it to Trump, but Kushner is close enough to all of it to do it. And even if Trump did not know it was Israel (highly probable he did not know) even if Trump thought it really was an independent terror plot, the end result was that him telling Russia to get laptops off their planes, shut it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO THAT is the HUGE "Trump Russia intelligence leak" and Israel is PISSED AS HELL ABOUT IT, because they had a whole new plan, and now it will not go forward.

       I'm certain I'll be viewed as a nazi also, so go ahead and check my post history also.  I do wonder when that smear will no longer have any effect, you all use it so much.  **People have legitimate problems with Apartheid FASCIST Israel, their stealing land from the Palestinians and keeping them oppressed and imprisoned for many decades.  There is also the fact that Israel controls this country from the inside, which cannot be denied at this point.  Whine more please.  People have legitimate issues that have been swept under the rug for far too long.  There's also the fact that Israeli Mossad did 9/11.  If you truly care about Israel and its reputation, perhaps you should fight against the psychopath that currently runs that country.

       The source is not what I was refuting, it's the person. But when he posts in r/NationalSocialist (self explanatory), r/weissSturm (that's German for White Storm and it's a White Nationalist subreddit), and r/pussypass (after r/alt-right got banned), it's pretty evident what group he belongs to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I didn't scope his post history. He was in here when r/altright got banned complaining about how the admins were out to get them and was totally not about doxxing, that's why I'm familiar with him.

       Where did I ever defend israel? You know 0 about me, yet accuse me of being a Trump supporter (a nice change to being accused of part of ShariaBlue, I admit) and an Israel supporter. I am neither, and in very pro-palestine. Just informing you that a White Nationalist telling you "look at what the evil jew did" might be a bit skewed in his judgements.

       I'm not smearing him, he's a self admitted neo-nazi, and proud of that fact. He advertizes it and doesn't see it as an insult. You can only smear someone with stuff they are ashamed of. I'm simply stating a fact, and he would come in here and agree with me. Why do you think he isn't proud of this and sees the term White Nationalist as an insult? He mods the alt-right and White Nationalist subreddits. I'm simply calling him by the name he likes to go by.

       "Bibi".  You're on a first name basis?
      </p>
      <p>
       My quote: "If you truly care about Israel and its reputation, perhaps you should fight against the psychopath that currently runs it" is clearly pointing toward Netanyahu, which is not Trump.  You keep trying to drag Trump into this discussion though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, I don't care what that person does outside of this subreddit.  I do enjoy the things they post here though, quite often.  For someone who claims to be pro- Palestinian, you have an odd way of showing it though.  Israel is our true enemy, and I can see why some people would become white nationalists here, (9/11 and the near sinking of the Liberty among other things).  It's only a mirror image of the extreme nationalism that is very apparent in Israel.  Have a good day.

       The New York Times report said Israeli officials refused to confirm that Israel was the source of the information. But BuzzFeed News quoted two Israeli intelligence officials as saying that Israel had shared information with the United States on an Islamic State plan to sneak explosive-laden laptops onto planes. The New York Times' report that the U.S. president had shared Israeli intelligence with Russia was Israel's "worst fears confirmed," one of the officers was quoted as saying.

       How does telling the Russians stop a false flag? - The MSM broke the story and if anything they jeopardized the asset (and if you are correct broke a false flag). The Trump admin was going to cover this up. (Unless Trumps playing play 20D Checkers or something)

       This was literally my read of events when all I knew was Washington Post was the outlet and the heavy focus on "betraying out allies in the region".
      </p>
      <p>
       From these couple details I knew A) the story was put there by the CIA in the interest of Mossad, and B) they are mad because they wanted to weaponize this information against either Russia or their allies (like Syria). The only reason you wouldn't want to share anti terrorism intel is to leave other countries vulnerable to terrorism attacks, and remember this means innocent citizens of those countries, not military targets.
