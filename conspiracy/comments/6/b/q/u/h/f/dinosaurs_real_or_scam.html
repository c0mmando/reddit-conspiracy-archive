       There's lots of things

       dinosaurs that you could call a "scam".  Incomplete, fabricated reconstructions, speculating a on how they lived, what they are, sometimes even what they looked like, etc...

      <p>
       But to say that dinosaurs, as a whole, are a scam...  Yeah...  That something I only hear from dimwitted fundamentalist religionauts.

       No, I'm not saying all dinosaurs are fakes. There are so many unanswered questions when it comes to what dinosaurs really looked like and behaved like. I guess I just always thought that it was fact when I would read about dinos. Then I find out how little is really known. It kind of mind fucked me I guess.

       Yeah.  There is alot of mystery there.  I even have my own "ridiculous" theory on what actually killed them off, too, so I'm not at all opposed to "unconventional" ideas.

       I was responding to the way you phrased your OP, implying that even the existence of dinosaurs was a scam.  They're pretty confirmable, obviously :)

       I don't think there was an "event" for most of them.  Lots of species go extinct, all the time, even in modern times.  Over millions (billions?) of years, lots of them are just going to die off naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with that being said... Something killed off the large dinosaurs very thoroughly.  I suspect it was an increase in Earth's gravity :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up expanding earth, Neal Adams on YouTube for a nice little graphical presentation on it.  It's about 10 minutes long.  He sounds like an ass often, when he talks, but he's made some good animations on an interesting idea.  If you find "expanding earth" to be worth a closer look, James Maxlow does an excellent lecture on it, which is over an hour long.  He's written books on it too, but I haven't got around to reading them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I've put my "quack" hat on for all to see, I'll see myself out ;)

       skeletons have been put together wrong on occasion.  Other than this, all I have ever seen on this subject is wild speculation and things like

       Ok I'm not going to lie, u/western_red this (the link) was something along the lines of that which I was referring. I clearly need to step up my dinosaur game, beyond having read Jurassic park several times. u/MiltownKBs, I don't have definitive proof of this theory. I hope dinos are real tho.

       Fair enough.  I enjoy conspiracy even if I do not always think they hold water.  But enough of them have been proven true that I feel it often warrants further investigation and an open mind.  Even if it is sometimes for my own entertainment.  Cheers!

       I work in museums, and have worked with many a fossil.  No, I don't believe them to be fake.  Fossils themselves are pretty common.  What isn't common though is finding complete skeletons.  So many of the fossils you see in museums are actually casts made from complete or nearly complete skeletons.

       No, I've seen that conspiracy theory (about the giants?).  I have never - or anyone I've ever met - has seen any skeletons like that.  I don't believe that one to be true.

       So one thing I read says that many of the larger species that have been found were only tiny pieces. How can they know what a complete skeleton looks like from a single bone. I'm not sure if this is true, but another article was talking about how only one or 2 people have found the majority of the larger species. Sorry if I'm not putting this very clearly.

       They don't know what a skeleton looks like from a single bone (and to be clear, I'm not a paleontologist, I've just worked with them).  One issue is that a single bone is sometimes used to indicate a new species - this is controversial even in paleontology (the discovery of a new species is a big deal, there are definitely some later found not to be new species because a researcher jumped the gun so he could get his name out there).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bones are not just found in tiny pieces.  I'm sure that happens sometimes, never in any of the cases I've seen.  Many, many more than just two people have found the larger species. What article are you talking about?

       A lot are fake.  But you have to keep in mind what museums put on exhibit is not typically part of the research collection.  That's just for show, so of course they want the big complete ones.  What's in storage is a whole other ballgame.

       They're fake. The first dinosaurs are complete fantasy. They found 3 teeth and then imagined the rest of the animal.

       At one point there were two 'scientists' discovering over 100 dinosaurs per year.
