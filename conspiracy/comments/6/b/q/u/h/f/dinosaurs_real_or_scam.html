    <div class="md"><p>Oh, yes.  I&#39;ve heard of it.</p>

<p>It approaches flat earther levels of stupidity, but it doesn&#39;t get spammed nearly as much.</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of things <em>about</em> dinosaurs that you could call a &quot;scam&quot;.  Incomplete, fabricated reconstructions, speculating a on how they lived, what they are, sometimes even what they looked like, etc...</p>

<p>But to say that dinosaurs, as a whole, are a scam...  Yeah...  That something I only hear from dimwitted fundamentalist religionauts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m not saying all dinosaurs are fakes. There are so many unanswered questions when it comes to what dinosaurs really looked like and behaved like.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  There is alot of mystery there.  I even have my own &quot;ridiculous&quot; theory on what actually killed them off, too, so I&#39;m not at all opposed to &quot;unconventional&quot; ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there was an &quot;event&quot; for most of them.  Lots of species go extinct, all the time, even in modern times.  Over millions (billions?) of years, lots of them are just going to die off naturally.</p>

<p>But with that being said... Something killed off the large dinosaurs very thoroughly.  I suspect it was an increase in Earth&#39;s gravity :)</p>

<p>Look up expanding earth, Neal Adams on YouTube for a nice little graphical presentation on it.  It&#39;s about 10 minutes long.  He sounds like an ass often, when he talks, but he&#39;s made some good animations on an interesting idea.  If you find &quot;expanding earth&quot; to be worth a closer look, James Maxlow does an excellent lecture on it, which is over an hour long.  He&#39;s written books on it too, but I haven&#39;t got around to reading them.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve put my &quot;quack&quot; hat on for all to see, I&#39;ll see myself out ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So one thing I read says that many of the larger species that have been found were only tiny pieces. How can they know what a complete skeleton looks like from a single bone. I&#39;m not sure if this is true, but another article was talking about how only one or 2 people have found the majority of the larger species. Sorry if I&#39;m not putting this very clearly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t know what a skeleton looks like from a single bone (and to be clear, I&#39;m not a paleontologist, I&#39;ve just worked with them).  One issue is that a single bone is sometimes used to indicate a new species - this is controversial even in paleontology (the discovery of a new species is a big deal, there are definitely some later found not to be new species because a researcher jumped the gun so he could get his name out there).</p>

<p>Bones are not just found in tiny pieces.  I&#39;m sure that happens sometimes, never in any of the cases I&#39;ve seen.  Many, many more than just two people have found the larger species. What article are you talking about?</p>
