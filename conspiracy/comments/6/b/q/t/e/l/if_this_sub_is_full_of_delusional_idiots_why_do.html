        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It has seemed to pick up more and more as time has went on since the election but it appears that comments bashing this sub and it&#39;s users are heavily upvoted even in posts not making to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.  Surely regular contributors in this sub wouldn&#39;t do this to themselves so who are all these people upvoting these comments?  I don&#39;t remember ever seeing this many remarks concerned with what we are discussing, what we should be discussing, and that we are trying to cover up certain discussions with other discussions.  There seems to be more meta derogatory comments about the subs users than discussion about the actual conspiracies posted.  This is supposed to be a sub that promotes independent thought.  I don&#39;t understand why there are so many comments trying to get us to fall in line with the narrative they are trying to push and derail any constructive discussion that was taking place</p>

<p>There was no holocaust. Many innocent people died, yes. But that is war. Give me some evidence for a holocaust and a final solution. There is none. Do the US Japanese get reparations for their internment? What about US Germans?</p>

<p>So you think they want war? Why has Putin been denouncing Clinton&#39;s war speak for over a year now? Why has he repeatedly said he does not want conflict despite being indirectly attacked in Syria?</p>

<p>You act like the US government can commit no crime or do something they shouldn&#39;t. The sanctions placed on Russia from the start were questionable to begin with. Look at Ukraine - it is just like Libya; broken but with new oligarchs. The Russians have a right to be self-interested - the US already took a run at destabilizing them once and did a pretty damn good job. Putin understands more than anybody that War would only continue the paradigm and keep those in power entrenched that way. It is through war economies that they have carved out this much power in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They want to recover land that has been taken from them - you cannot argue with that. With that said, I think it&#39;s more for that community to handle. I&#39;m not sure us in North America should have that strong of an opinion, but oil.</p>

<p>No, you just dismiss anything negative about Trump because it utilizes anonymous sources. In a rather hypocritical manner, I might add. </p>

<p>When the conspiracy gets brought up here there is rarely ever actual discussion. It&#39;s just immediate dismissal because &quot;MUH FAKE NEWS!!!!! ALEX JONES AND THE PRESIDENT TOLD ME IT&#39;S FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I apologize in advance for the wall of text. </p>

<p>Actually, I&#39;d argue that the criteria for the Russia/Trump conspiracy is really no different from any other conspiracy that&#39;s generally accepted in this sub. Mainstream news sources aren&#39;t accepted here, because they&#39;re not seen as credible sources. Do you really think anyone here sees the 4chan LARP&#39;s &amp; immediately accepts them as fact? You wouldn&#39;t be much of a conspiracy theorist if you did. The LARPS/MSM have equal credibility here, because they&#39;re both almost always wrong, &amp; rarely ever right. This sub started leaning right around the time Wikileaks released the Podesta emails. It&#39;s because the information was 100% credible &amp; undeniable. So it served as a starting point to connect events together &amp; see what&#39;s really going on. Pizzagate/Left Hate/HRC hate wouldn&#39;t be as prevalent in this sub if it wasn&#39;t for Wikileaks. If Wikileaks released emails on Trump&#39;s campaign manager, things would be completely different here. We just work with what we&#39;re given. If evidence is presented that cannot be denied, this sub would turn on him in a heartbeat. But believing Trump&#39;s a Russian mole &amp; our intelligence community has direct proof of this fact, yet they let a traitor/spy run wild in the most powerful public office in the land? There&#39;s just so much that&#39;s logically wrong with that narrative, that I honestly don&#39;t even know where to begin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The contractor, CrowdStrike, produced the only report on the server breach after the DNC denied the FBI the opportunity to examine the server. That alone is weird. Subsequently, they revised and retracted statements they used to buttress claims of Russian hacking after they misrepresented data about another report. It calls their credibility into question.

    <div class="md"><p>Easy.  If Russia wasn&#39;t responsible, then they&#39;d have suffered serious hits to their credibility when the real leaker came forward.  </p>

<p>Deliberate dishonesty is off the table.   If the Russia narrative is wrong, then it must be an honest mistake or a lie by the contractor or some other kind of bluster.</p>

<p>There <em>was</em> evidence that couldn&#39;t have been misinterpreted, and the DNC putting their reputation on the shoulder of an untrustworthy contractor is also possible.</p>

<p>But the FBI, NSA, and CIA all at once?  </p>

<p>There is no way that you can identify who hacked you by observing the hacked server.  You can identify where they hacked <em>from</em>, but that server could be a proxy or a VPN host or just a member of a botnet.  </p>

<p>The only way to know for certain would be to monitor the device they were hacking from.</p>

<p>And the critical <em>public</em> piece of evidence, the bitly account, could not have been any kind of bluster, and is very strong evidence that hackers acting on behalf of the Russian government were trying to hack the DNC.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s public evidence and there&#39;s <em>implied</em> evidence, but you can&#39;t ignore motive.</p>

<p>BernieBros have motive.  Russia has motive: the government  openly lauded Trump and had connections to his campaign.</p>

<p>Berniebros couldn&#39;t have faked the bitly account, so the Podesta emails were probably Russia.   The Guccifer2.0 documents are allegedly Russian leaks, but it&#39;s plausible that the persona was created by a disgruntled DNC operative with access to the documents. </p>

<p>All things considered, Russia had the motive, Russia had the method, and while the evidence isn&#39;t <em>proof</em>,  there isn&#39;t any exculpatory evidence (mind, I&#39;m not convinced the Guccifer2.0 leaks weren&#39;t an insider taking advantage of the Russian hack to get away with leaking dditional documents.)</p>

<p>Overall there&#39;s one overwhelmingly guilty-looking suspect in the leaks.  The extent of their connection to the Trump campaign is the only thing we don&#39;t have enough info to speculate on, but we know that there was a connection because the Podesta (most credibly Russian) leaks were known by roger stone before they happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a fundamental concept in cybersecurity and digital forensics that it is extremely difficult after a cyberattack to definitively name a perpetrator. As I said before, it&#39;s unlikely that a state sponsored cyberespionage group linked to the Russian government would leave such obvious hints at their origin. That we know the CIA uses malware collected from &quot;the wild&quot; to obfuscate their own attacks is an even further indicator that we should be skeptical here. I don&#39;t personally have a horse in this race. I don&#39;t really support Trump, but it&#39;s clear that the deep state has politically weaponized the USIC. </p>

<p>Of course the motive was there for Russia to do these things. Hillary Clinton wanted a no-fly zone in Syria which would have put us into direct conflict with Russia. And there&#39;s no doubt about whether or not Russia tried to influence the outcome of the election. Our country does this as well. This is not new behavior. This is a given. Nikita Khrushchev famously bragged about helping to get JFK elected. But when most of the evidence comes from a dubious report by a paid 3rd party, and we know that Podesta&#39;s e-mails were obtained through an easy phishing operation, I don&#39;t take that as evidence that there was direct collusion with Russia.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not dismissing your points, and I&#39;m certainly willing to entertain that, I just happen to be highly skeptical of the political establishment is peddling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The podesta phishing operation is one of the strongest links to Russia; the bitly account used for the phishing URL was controlled by a group with a long history of attacking opponents and potential opponents of the Russian government, both domestic and international   Whoever owned it was either acting specifically to further Putin&#39;s goals, or was running a month&#39;s long campaign to appear so.</p>

<p>And while it&#39;s difficult to name perpetrators, remember the NSA spies on <em>everyone</em>.  Remember that Obama kicked out a number of operatives in the US and the <em>public report mentioned their code-names</em>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re spying on the guilty party when they act, it <em>is</em> very easy to definitively name a perpetrator.</p>

I wouldn&#39;t say that T_D was intended to be a safe space, but when you are literally outcasted by friends and family based on your election vote.

    <div class="md"><p>I find myself often playing the skeptic here, but Im genuinely interested in conspiracy. For example:</p>

<p>-I believe the US government likely had for knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and allowed them to proceed in order to get a &#39;new pearl harbour&#39;. I believe KSA likely participated. I believe there was financial gain from the wars both through bush/saud connections and haliburton. I do not believe there were controlled demolitions or holographic planes or any of that.</p>

<ul>
<li>I believe the CIA is responsible for the crack epidemic and likely runs drugs to this day.</li>
</ul>

<p>-I want to believe UFOs are being covered up and aliens have indeed visited earth.</p>

<p>-I believe there is some degree of collusion between the Trump admin + GOP and the Russian state/ oligarchy.</p>

<ul>
<li>I believe secret societies like skull and bones exercise undue influence that the public is unaware of.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am highly, highly skeptical of other conspiracies such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sandy Hook false flag
-Clinton body count
-Pizzagate
-A central cabal that controls most government/finance/culture
-flat earth
-reptilians, ((globalists)), or whatever overlords.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this, I am frequently labeled a shill. Its unfortunate, there are too many people here who insist on an &quot;all or nothing&quot; approach to conspiracy.</p>

<p>And come on.

One of the reasons people thought the Podestas were suspicious in the first place was them <em>knowingly</em> being friends with a <em>Republican</em> pedophile.</p>

<p>But they&#39;re not investigating them. Taking a bunch of emails and substituting phrases like &quot;little boy&quot; for terms like &quot;pasta&quot; or cheese&quot; and then claiming this is evidence of a paedophile conspiracy is not investigating anything. It&#39;s just making stuff up. As is claiming the word &quot;kids&quot; spraypainted on a wall is evidence that someone owning property in the neighbourhood is a paedophile. Or claiming that because some dentists have a triangular G in their company logo and a shipping container outside they are paedophiles. Or claiming that the lack of physical evidence is just because evidence has been cleaned up.</p>

He had several diagnosed mental disorders, an obsessive fascination with school shootings and his father said in interviews he believes his son had undiagnosed schizophrenia. Beyond that there are dozens of eye witnesses who are alive and well and can give first hand accounts of what happened. In addition there are hundreds of direct witnesses to the aftermath that can likewise testify.</p>

<p>weak and frail autistic kid with no shooting experience and no motive whose DNA was not on the murder weapon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was thin, but he doesn&#39;t look &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;frail&quot; to me in photographs. And why does the fact he may have had Asperger&#39;s mean he couldn&#39;t shoot anyone? How do you know he had no shooting experience? His brother reportedly told the FBI that he enjoyed target shooting and that he was qualified to use a local range after taking an NRA safety certification course. As for the DNA, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-YeEgq5sO7NQWRJOXBsWVhNVFk/edit">this report</a> says at page 4, paragraph 4, that Adam Lanza &quot;is included as a contributor to the DNA profile from item #2-1S1&quot;. Item #2-1S1 was the forearm of the rifle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>anyone asserting in favor of the government narratives in cases as obvious as this is not really interested in conspiracy theories and so has really no business speaking here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But as an examination of your claims shows, Sandy Hook is not such an obvious case after all. It seems to me that more than a few conspiracy theorists are not interested in the truth and just want an uncritical audience for their views.</p>

The point I&#39;m making here, which you can answer, is what conspiracy theories might one subscribe to if they truly think Sandy Hook was a legitimate school shooting and happened just as the cable news networks said? That&#39;s what I am asking. What &quot;lesser&quot; conspiracy theories are there than Sandy Hook which would interest someone in entering discussion here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy! That&#39;s me! I&#39;m just interested in alternative narratives for the world we live in. While I don&#39;t necessarily buy most of the theories put forth here, I do feel there are things happening in the background that we don&#39;t know about and it&#39;s important to have some insight into what <em>might</em> be going on. So when I see a post saying that &quot;obviously the actions of this Walmart means that we can expect a serious false flag operation in this area in October&quot; I wait for October and try to see what happened. Most of the time.... nothing happens. As for why people may have a problem with some of the stuff we&#39;re talking about here, that guy who went into a pizza shop and fired off a couple of rounds at the floor might be a good example. That&#39;s not good PR for conspiracy theorists. Also, to be clear, I totally think there are a bunch of pedophiles in the government doing shit, but I don&#39;t think they do it with &quot;secret&quot;(NOT SECRET) symbols in pizza shops. There&#39;s a reason humanity invented basements. To store food and rape children.</p>

<p>I was in a the Ram Trucks sub and there was someone saying &quot;I&#39;m a Chevy guy, , , But&quot; </p>

<p>I think the age of the user base has gone way down. And the circle jerking is getting boring for most people. So they actively hand out in subs they completely disagree with for the lulz. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good observation. Just frustrating when it happens here because &quot;normies&quot; and &quot;conspiratards&quot; have different standards of what counts as evidence. If they see it on the news, it happened. If it&#39;s printed in a scientific paper, it&#39;s true. If they can produce a pseudo-justification from a gatekeeping website that rebuts something we&#39;re trying to say, they need not even understand it to throw the entire weight of their argument behind it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m here because I enjoy exercising my critical thinking skills. This is bullshit because X Y and Z.  You don&#39;t have to believe the majority of conspiracy theories to be interested in them. In fact, if most conspiracy theorists were actually true to their principles, they wouldn&#39;t believe most of them. People should be excited when counter evidence comes in, not angry.

<p>The state of r/conspiracy can only be explained by a rush of Republican partisans or at least Donald Trump supports rushing in to fill it.

<p>It was in this sub. The question is why? I mean, it is a conspiracy, it involves wealth and politics and backroom deals, etc. It has conspiracy written all over it and is happening now. </p>

<p>Now, as far as your OP: I look at it like this. If I am sitting in a lunchroom talking with people and one guy starts spouting off that the earth is flat I am going to speak up. Especially if that guy is sitting at my table and is part of the group. It&#39;s just silly nonsense.</p>

<p>If I am watching a movie and a person is being pursued by Jason or Michael Myers I might just yell at the screen when the person does something stupid. When someone does something awesome I might clap or cheer them on.</p>

<p>By speak up do you mean to present evidence that would demonstrate how the flat-earther can&#39;t be correct or do you just try to make them look like an idiot to everyone else at the table?  Because the latter is what I am referring to happening here.</p>

<p>Holy hell, the mental gymnastics is astonishing. How are news sources like Breitburt, InfoWars, and all the usual websites posted here not trying to push a narrative but organizations that have been a staple in American and International news for a century are?

<p>The difference is you think Trump doing a normal president thing by sharing information with a foreign country is some conspiracy.  I don&#39;t think it is a conspiracy.

<p>Don&#39;t rely on symbols to give you information, look at the owners, search the journalists and see what stories they write; there will be patterns if you look. Their credibility changes when you see that much goes on under a symbol, which influences their goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think that &quot;Pizzagate Investigator&quot; was a legitimate citizen, then you my friend, are living testament to the continued efficacy of MSM perception management. </p>

<p>A lone deranged individual pops up yet again, providing the justification needed to debunk the entire show.. </p>

<p>He&#39;s plastered and name dropped everywhere to show how crazy anyone who believes in organised elite pedophila is. Pizzagate has glaring holes in its theory yes, but anyone whose spent anytime researching it not only will have recognised some very suspicious elements permeating through the entire thing, but they&#39;d have likely kept conducting ancillary research to discover &quot;The Frankin Boys scandal&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Saville&quot;, &quot;Epstein&quot;, &quot;Roy Kohn&quot;, &quot;Royal Family and the missing indigenous children&quot;.</p>

<p>But if the all knowing media paint anyone looking into these things as a nutjob, then for fear of ostracisation, most will be cowed into silence. That effect is doubled when the propaganda they churn out creates armies of *self appointed guardians of the status quo&quot; to perpetuate the judgment for them : as you&#39;ve so readily demonstrated.</p>

<p>Anyways, the topic here is why is this sub so important to outsiders if they all think r/conspiracy is full of delusional idiots.</p>

<p>Now, when you go off topic and start talking about why everyone on this sub thinks everyone who dares disagrees with an opinion is a shill, well you see you have gone off topic. Also one, you never proved and useful information relevant to the topic, still.  Sorry to tell you but, but you are wasting your time here if all you want to do is talk about shills.

<p>No, I was responding directly to your comment. My comment was relevant. You just didn&#39;t want to hear it. </p>

<p>My useful information is to not spend too much time jerking yourself off, because you end up looking like a hypocrite. </p>

<p>At least as long as the mods are slow on policing the sub, lost count on how many times I&#39;ve hit that report link. Occasionally threads get a clean before I get to them, but that is when more accounts come in to add some extra zingers for me to add to the mod queue.</p>

<p>Only so much I can do on my end; and no I&#39;m not interested in being a Mod as I&#39;ve done similar work elsewhere and prefer sitting on the user side of the fence at my own pace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, most people have no idea that the civil war was used as a means to supplant a Barrister coup d&#39;etat a smash and grab. Now Americans are ruled by foreigners. Proof of which is easy to see. We deal with notary public&#39;s for all sorts titles. They have the power of the state department and the secretary of state. The state department only deals with foreign people. If you understand these things, the three stars on the flag of Wash DC is easily translatable to other sovereign city states, because there are only three in the empire. America is a modern day Sparta, but it believes its Egypt, and not actually slaves. That was by design however, it makes us work harder, believing we are actually free. The definition of &quot;Emancipation&quot; is a transfer of ownership. It does not mean &quot;to free&quot;. All you have to do is look at the Dred Scott case if your websters dictionary is broken and full of obfuscation. Webster is a chump. Its in the definitions of these words they use to confuse us. The word attorney, comes from the word attorn which means to prepare a tenant for his new oppressive landlord. Yeah. Let that sink in.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on this sub for a while (this account is an alt) and I must say, it feels like there have definitely been a lot more political posts coming in trying to spread misinformation. I do think the recent influx of Seth Rich posts is fishy, given that it coincides with the donald begging users to spread the story. It is fair for the users of the sub to question the validity of posts or the honesty of users, although it is obvious that there are many new users here that don&#39;t know the difference between questioning and being derogatory. You are correct, there are many comments trying to get people to fall in line with a narrative, but I bet there is a lot of debate over which political side it&#39;s coming from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How long have you been here? Many people here have seen how that story was created, seeing people&#39;s facebooks and their families&#39; mourning the &#39;suicides&#39; of people that were involved in leaks, just minutes or hours after it happened. It&#39;s easy to come in here and accuse people of making crap up when you didn&#39;t see things as they transpired that the media didn&#39;t touch.</p>

<p>From the way you&#39;re speaking, it&#39;s &#39;painfully obvious&#39; that you rely on msm for your information. Your talking points are news headlines, that is intellectually lazy. I bet you&#39;re here because you&#39;re curious though, and you&#39;ll stay because you know there&#39;s truth, that the story you&#39;re being told isn&#39;t accurate. The ego will say, &quot;Oh they&#39;re crazy, it&#39;s just entertainment.&quot; but your subconscious knows otherwise which is why you&#39;re here. It&#39;s ok if you don&#39;t believe me, but a year or so from now you&#39;ll still be here, and your mind will have been opened. That&#39;s all the psychology I&#39;ll do for today, but if anyone thought anything was genuinely crazy they stay away from it because of potential danger, it&#39;s a survival thing. But when someone prods into something further regardless of the approach, it&#39;s because the mind is trying to affirm or deny suspicions it already holds. </p>

Questioning CNN has become akin to questioning their very identity. And hence they end up here lashing out at those who are critical of msm and the official narrative.</p>

<p>Huge uptick in shilling recently though. 4chan had seen the same. Something is up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the key point you should understand: they don&#39;t give a shit what you think. They see places like this as convenient places for planting misinformation because the people here don&#39;t require anything resembling evidence - much less <em>proof</em> - when what they&#39;re presented with confirms their biases. That is an easy mindset to work with if you&#39;re a sketchy motherfucker with propaganda they would like to have others spread for them.</p>

<p>What you actually think is entirely meaningless, it&#39;s what their algorithms cook up for them to tell you that they care about. It shouldn&#39;t be too surprising that there are plenty of users who see dozens of well-timed propaganda posts, obviously meant to distract from this or that story, and think, &quot;Why the fuck are people regurgitating this shit in r/conspiracy without even the slightest bit of skepticism?&quot;.</p>

<p>I find conspiracies to be like modern day campfire yarns.

<p>There&#39;s truth here, there&#39;s lies here, there&#39;s wisdom surrounded by bullshit, there&#39;s people chasing the wrong rabbit-hole, and people who fell too far down the right one.</p>

<p>I always try to remain polite, but I am cautious of just buying something because someone said it here. Let&#39;s put it this way: Politics is the Entertainment branch of the Military-Industrial complex, and we&#39;re all armchair quarterbacks speculating about the upcoming playoffs.</p>

<p>So why are you trying to paint people who are exercising independent thought and are not convinced by the evidence presented for a theory as some &quot;outside force&quot;? Surely if people believe the theories they&#39;re putting forward, they should be able to discuss the topic reasonably with people who disagree? But that&#39;s not what I see in this sub. People who disagree get downvoted, accused of being shills, or ignorant. That&#39;s hardly promoting independent thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who even knows. People everywhere are freaking crazy. Like i&#39;ve tried to politely disagree/debate people in askreddit comments before and they get really defensive there too. I mean like i&#39;ll see someone stating something with hundreds+ upvotes and then i&#39;ll point out how they are not all completely correct and i&#39;m surprised when they reply to me but even more surprised when they get really defensive even though they already had tons of upvotes/people agreeing with them. </p>

<p>I think this sub can get ridiculous/silly and joke about itself but that&#39;s what I like about it-to a point at least.</p>

<p>And I like that there can be &quot;crazy&quot; ideas from all points of view here and just healthy debate. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this sub is threatening because it&#39;s still not that large and there&#39;s people with all different viewpoints here. Like I&#39;ve seen it compared to theredpill and shit and yeah there&#39;s prob some redpillers here but there&#39;s tons of tolerant liberals here too (such as myself.) </p>

<p>I do think there seem to be more trolls here lately (been checking on this place a couple times a month for years but didn&#39;t always have a reddit account) but at the same time it seems like more reasonable people changed or left and also after like 2012 died down (date of mayan apocalypse) and after the system/dollar never collapsed even though a ton of people thought it was going to, I think people just got bored of conspiracy theories. Even the price of oil has remained low for a good long while. Which annoys me because I thought peak oil was a thing and I needed a new car and got a hybrid. </p>

<p>anyways i guess i&#39;m rambling. </p>

<p>thanks for listening.</p>

You say that the msm is full of bullshit and shouldn&#39;t be trusted to investigate the Trump-russia connection while also maintaining that the conspiracy created by the msm should be taken very seriously and investigated?

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  As such, &quot;free speech&quot; is not allowed, and debaters not on board the Trump train are redirected to more appropriate venues.</p>

<p>Now with that said, respectful debate and open minded questions are regularly engaged and not banned.  There are plenty of people who are openly opposed to Trump who post on T_D and are allowed to stay and talk.</p>

<p>But you have to be respectful.  Don&#39;t be a dick.  If you are a dick, you get banned.  If you aren&#39;t a dick, you are of course welcome even if you disagree.</p>
