       Where are the Bernie Bros? Why is everyone so afraid of Russia? I talk to people here, and they laugh at the hysterics of our country and how clearly corrupt it is.

        I made a video on how dumb it is to suggest Podesta was hacked

       by Russian secret hackers. Where did all you morons who believe that come from? Between DNCLeaks and Podesta, we have our answers. Podesta should not be allowed near National Security information and Seth Rich was pissed about the DNC.

       You ever wonder why people from over the world say "Americans are stupid"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it is because they think we can't count?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you think it is because, when on the outside looking in, it is very obvious that we are a conquered people living under a brute force regime that takes what it wants, when it wants it, and leaves the people blinded by propaganda?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a lot easier to make an assessment of a fish bowl when you are on the outside looking in, rather than being on the inside looking out

       Japan and Taiwan. Once Japan had to be a little bitch and take being shit on. Can you say fukushima? Now they have their own military. Ask the Japanese prime minister how much he loves their new army. Hell, he's already said it. He loves it. We're selling weapons(now) to anyone who wants their freedom. And Taiwan? You think they like their new military? Big fucking difference. A nation is nothing without a military. There, got you 2, and the list is growing.

       The prosecution of a currently unemployed politician isn't at the top of my priority list right now. I agree that the DNC rigged the primaries and it was clear as day to me as it happened, but the past is the past and we have bigger fish to fry right now.

       Sure they can..
       <em>
        with evidence
       </em>
       . We've known Hillary is corrupt since the 70's. The recent red scare was so random and so heavily pushed by MSM that you have to question the validity of it if you have any sort of independent thought running through your own brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's zero evidence that Russia hacked the DNC, unless you believe word salad that falls out of Hillary Clinton's mouth. There's zero evidence that Trump is some Russian plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's maybe circumstantial evidence, if you believe in conspiracies- that Trump, Tillerson, and Exxon could be working with Russia to get the U.S. in on the Syrian pipeline deal.. but that's about it. I wouldn't put it past them to do that, but I also wouldn't care if it were true. The idea that Russia is our enemy is absolutely preposterous.

       I'm not here to defend Donald Trump, but I do feel the need to explain to people that the Russia story is 100% fabricated bullshit. Trump is complicit in the Russia story. He
       <em>
        wants
       </em>
       to look guilty to distract everyone from the fact that he's sailing us right into the biggest war in history. No one seems to realize this cause they're all tuned to Mother Russia, but our military movements lately seem to suggest that we're about to fuck the whole goddamn world up, fast.

       He's a republican and politics is shadow play. Might also want to look into Syria being a false flag of a false flag. With that meaningless missile launch he woke up millions of centipedes to the neocon agenda. Also stated they'll take out Assad AFTER they take out ISIS. That's called kicking the neocon rock down the road.

       I can agree. I was out in my yard pulling weeds, and I saw 2 F16s flying lower than I ever seen, performing practice drills around my neighborhood. They were only several hundred feet up, and were circling around the area for a good 20 minutes or so.

       There's definitely something suspicious going on.

       That Storm Clouds Gathering video is an embarrassment. I usually like the guy. But he repeated about 6 DNC propaganda talking-points that have been definitively debunked, and he served them up uncritically for his viewers. It really made me lose respect for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cringed when he repeated the DNC "Katie Johnson" narrative that the Clinton camp manufactured to create a smokescreen to hide Bill Clinton's decades-long rape accusations. It was the most definitively-debunked story I've ever seen and Storm Clouds Gathering included it in his list of "Trump accusations" hoping his audience wouldn't fact-check it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That video of his scores an F.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I always thought he was better than promoting John Podesta propaganda.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, maybe they got to him. Offered him money to promote that garbage to the Alternative Media crowd.

       Donald at his next rally, as he points his finger, boldly says "her socials are so bad."  He then picks up a piece of paper and pretends to read from it, as he says, "less than one-half-of-one percent.  Can you believe that?"  He then shakes his head in disgust, as he says, "it's terrible, just terrible."
He then goes on, angrily... "the handful of people there were paid for using a State Department slush fund.  What's that about?"

       It isn't Hillary they're protecting, it themselves.  The Clintons have amassed a huge fortune and wield an ungodly amount of power and influence - entire countries have been laid to waste and the coffers looted because they made it so.  They've been untouchable for decades, or at least appeared to be, so everyone got in on the action.  If the Clintons go down the a large portion of the US government could very well go down with them.  No one on the Clinton money-train wants it to end, or have their careers ruined by their involvement in it or (God forbid) actually answer for their crimes.

       Yeah man every episode. Ditched NA for y'all about a year ago when I discovered it. The hook for me was the AJ Clips of the Week (welcome to Austin btw. Another side note I too moved to ATX from ATL where I went to college, been a while tho but I like/get the comments on local stuff from both locations) but then gradually realized I was smiling through the entire shows on my commute, guess it just matches my sense of humor &amp; politics to a T, or something. Y'all turned me on to Anthony Brian Logan and Roaming Millennial too. Should get more guests! But I know you're trying with DP and that wacko Bigfoot guy, Caine?. Keep trying. Anyway man I hope you, The Clowny One and The Young Jizzer keep it up, keep expanding like with the Saturday show. But whatever you do, if you do end up quitting your day jobs and living off donations, please please don't start guilting people if money is slow one week like John on NA. So fucking distasteful. Man I cite that as a main reason for curtailing my listenership to them. SO tacky. Like, how about a Thanks for making shittons for doing something you enjoy? Very few people can say they do that in this life.

       The funniest thing I noticed was the insistence on bringing Russia into the Seth Rich issue, either by claiming "it's a distraction" or, "Russians killed Rich." I wondered why and remarked that two conspiracy theories can exist side-by-side.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in this case, they can't. The entire Russia theory hinges on Seth Rich
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being the Wikileaker... because then, the "Russia hacked the election" falls apart. Not to mention, you open the can of worms because now there's a murder investigation (or at least, there should be).
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment has to stifle the Rich thing with the exact intensity as they're promoting the Russia line, because the storylines are dependent on the other in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually don't know why I didn't piece this together earlier. I feel kinda stupid for ever doubting Rich was killed by anyone other than camp DNC/Clinton.

       The Bernie bros are split between woke and unwoke. I'm a berner, but I can understand how many would confuse me as A Trump supporter. It's clear to me the deep state is the greater evil.
