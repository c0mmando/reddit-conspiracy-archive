<p>I&#39;m sick and tired of being ruled by psychopaths who pretend they care about our well being when all they truly care about is power. I&#39;m tired of them pretending they&#39;re on different teams when &quot;Left vs Right&quot; is just theatrics to keep the peasants busy fighting with each other.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of being advertised to everywhere I look. I&#39;m tired of being looked at as just another number instead of a person with feelings. I&#39;m tired of the corrupt corporate media. I&#39;m tired of celebrity worship. I&#39;m tired of being spied on. I&#39;m tired of not being able to watch a tv show without having an obvious political agenda shoved down my throat.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of presidents, I&#39;m tired of government, I&#39;m tired of the constant arguing and negative energy. </p>

<p>I wish this whole fucking system would burn to the ground.</p>

<p>Sorry that&#39;s not gonna happen until...well, you better not ask.</p>

<p>Humanity has been imprisoned on a grand scale since 5777 years, with only few years of freedom in between and that still didn&#39;t apply for all of you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to get much worse for most people until it gets better, still no guarantee that you will survive whats coming soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can probably expect it to last a month or two at most, before post-system happens. Most people don&#39;t have significant food or water stores, and only the people smart enough to do so, or the people ruthless enough to take, will survive. You can last 2-3 days without water, depending on climate. Maybe 4-5 days longer depending on water sources near you, provided you don&#39;t die of cholera from sewage water, or lack of filtration methods. My stores are sufficient to last such a time, I have connections for resources I can&#39;t gain myself after that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If/when SHTF in the USA it will be worse than the bloodiest, ugliest thing you can ever imagine. There are so many privately-owned guns in circulation in this country, and when the supply chain breaks down they&#39;re all coming out.(I&#39;m not anti-gun, I&#39;m just stating facts) Add in the fact that over 95% of people are completely unprepared to live even one week without a trip to the grocery store and you have a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all seen those black Friday videos of people trampling each other and fighting over hot deals on flatscreen TVs and other meaningless junk. How do you think they&#39;re going to act when themselves and their families are starving to death? Be careful what you wish for. </p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like I want the crash to happen, then I use my brain and actually think about it. It&#39;s gonna suck. No more sitting on my couch ripping bongs and chugging beers watching pirated movies. Even if you somehow manage to live you will be forever changed and have severe PTSD from having to kill people.</p>

<p>Real funny joke commenter, you think that will work? look at all the people that used love, and/or neutrality and protested, what happened? very little to none, Tiananmen Protests were a great example, if your a imbecile that never heard of it, let&#39;s give you a starter: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989</a></p>

<p>The only way this war can be won, is if people wake the fuck up, realise everything is a shame, and still have the gall they very well need to defeat and destroy this enemy of ours.</p>

<p>In case of TL:DR: Protesting is useless against the NWO/Elitist Cabal, an actual revolution is needed, not some hippy &quot;we think it will, but it will do exactly jack shit&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think PTSD effects everyone. I had the pleasure to meet some tribals in South Africa and one of them was this top warrior in his tribe who was reported to have killed 11 men in 3 separate tribal skirmishes. He was one of the kindest, friendliest, warmest and genuinely decent human beings I ever met. I asked him if the killings ever haunted him. </p>

<p>He told me: &quot;you might not believe this, but what I did was an act of love for my tribe, those men could have killed my kinsmen, hurt our women, captured our children. If I didn&#39;t do what I did, they would have done their damage and I wouldn&#39;t have been able to live with that.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;d think a similar thing would be the case with people here. If we killed someone who are as going to kill us or our family I think it&#39;d cause less harm to us psychologically than say, killing someone in cold blood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I believe PTSD stems from killing of the unjust, or under unjust circumstance. Say for instance you had to execute an enemy POW in warfare. It had to be done. You&#39;re under orders and you <strong>DO NOT</strong> question orders. There would be a difference between shooting him in the back of the head while he&#39;s digging his own grave as opposed to giving him a last cigarette and let him get his last words in. Know what I mean? Both are terrible situations no doubt. But giving the enemy combatant some dignity in his final moments might not haunt you as bad as the former.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Verizon.  Two lines.  One smart phone one flip phone.  One data plan.  5gb for $50 I believe it was.  Then $20 each access line.  I have international calling $10.  $100 plus tax.  But, each time you go over the data limit it was $10 per 500mb.  But, they round up the usage too.  So my bill was typically $140-160.  I travel a lot and get a 10% discount from work, so this was the best plan for me in a super rural area.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well two phones certainly make things more expensive. Though i could get 5gb for 10 euros instead. And who the fuck pays for access line.....</p>

<p>International calling is more expensive of course, at least here in europe EU forced same prices within EU.</p>

<p>You dont need internet for GPS navigation. GPS works without data. You just have to pre-download maps before leaving. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Verizon will not allow me to use a smart phone, so touch screen, without having a data plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is literally illegal. They have NO say what phone you are using to connect to their service.</p>

<p>I choose to live very minimally with few possessions and no credit/bank based accounts. I keep ducks, chickens, and rabbits for food and eat a pre1950s diet (less carbs means you can grow more of your food.) I use rainwater catchment and gray water systems to improve the fertility of my small yard. I removed the bed, chairs, and pillows from my home in order to improve my body&#39;s alignment through squatting, floor sleeping and just not sitting. I am afraid my state would consider my &quot;extreme lifestyle&quot; incompatible with having kids and it honestly has caused my husband and I to hit pause on that front, which is really sad to us. When I brought this up to a gaurdian ad litem friend she didn&#39;t hesitate to say they could easily make an argument to take my kids away. SO you can choose, but they will make it hurt, and increasingly so it seems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem I have is that in an extremely fluid situation, like a revolution let&#39;s say, psychopaths have the greatest skill set for taking advantage of the situation. They are not burdened by concern for for others, ethics, or morals. And their natural inclination in all things is to improve their situation at the expense of others.</p>

<p>We should always keep this in mind when considering changes. &#39;The System&quot; is a huge pain in the ass, but it is literally the only thing between us and them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true.  Psychopaths are impulsive, intolerant of difficulties, and have difficulty planning for the future.  They go off the rails in deteriorating situations.  By contrast, non-psychopaths are adaptive, resilient, and cooperative with each other.  They also tend to have more real skills.  To survive in fluid situations, psychopaths require polemic skills suitable to infiltration of non-psychopathic leadership.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the suicidal mindset that is killing Western civilization. Most liberals are infected with it. Religion is an antidote, but in the West Christianity has been disgarded and scorned. This is why, in the not to distant future, Islam will take over. The people need religion in order for their society to function properly, and they are being denied it. Having cast away the superior religion of Christianity, they are going to get saddled with the inferior religion of Islam, and they won&#39;t have any say about adopting it. They will be forced to parrot its dogma, just as they are in the Middle Eastern Islamic nations.</p>

<p>Suicide is not the answer. Atheism is not the answer. Islam is not the answer, either, but that&#39;s the answer we are going to get, because we cast aside Christianity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with your sentiments here, however if the system is burned to the ground it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to live a normal life like a normal human being. Given America&#39;s violent history, it seems incredibly unlikely that those in power would walk away peacefully. A violent military coup or a citizen-style upheaval or a combo of both seems much more plausible. And the kind of government that our &quot;democracy&quot; is replaced with could be even worse than what we have now. </p>

<p>This belief may seem counterproductive here, but stay with me for a minute. Currently our &quot;elected&quot; officials and the media are desperately trying to convince us that we still live in a democracy; they are doing everything they can to keep this illusion in tact despite the obvious. But IMO if they are peddling this message it means that they, at some level, believe they should be held accountable to the people. I&#39;ll be more concerned for my freedom (and life) when our government and the media stops pretending we live in a democracy, that&#39;s when things get really fucked up, when they outright tell us we have no say and there is nothing we can do about it. That, I imagine is what will happen when this whole system burns to the ground, a full-blown totalitarian regime will take its place. I&#39;d like to believe that isn&#39;t true, that some utopian efficient, accountable, libertarian, direct-democracy will take its place, it just doesn&#39;t seem realistic whatsoever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democracy seems like non existent if people are not deeply involved in it. The system it self is not bad, the people who are now in charge tho are actually crazy and dont forget the laws for them are not laws at all.They are changing and distorting constitution, changing acts all the time, with more and more time you give them power, the more it becomes abused and corrupted when the moment comes of no return, righteouss people going to jail, truth is banned the law punishes good. People become worried and protest in streets, but while this is happening those who abuse are still in power they just think of more tactics to implement,probably moving their wealth somewhere and if peaceful march doesnt solve anything you see whats going next, total self destruction and massive psychological problems, abuse of substances as we see today wich bottles up bringing even more violence later total unorganised chaos and then of course it will be about who got the goods for survival those have the army, but if all people get involved there is no match for that, in this time and age the ignorance is biggest crime, you should know those who are in power right now are not special in any kind, quite different they are stupid as fuck and they are afraid as hell just know it till the end </p>

If you think the crash or after the crash will be different or better then you&#39;re in for a harsh realization.  You&#39;ll have to deal with the same sort of politics with less resources and time to discern who&#39;s deceiving you.  Not to mention if there was a crash, most of the people you love will probably die for lack of access to healthcare, food, clean water, etc.  It&#39;s fun to romanticize the end of the world, but that&#39;s a luxury for those who have yet to see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same. I find myself fantasizing about how life would be in prehistoric times. Sure, life would be hard as shit and we would mostly die young, but we would have nothing to compare it to and for me the benefits of that sort of life far outweigh the cons. We would be surrounded by untainted nature, immersed in its mystery and the unknown. Instead of having to punch a clock, we would do what we want in order to survive and improve our lives as we saw fit. It just seems like a much better way of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, if the system collapses now and we go back to the Stone Age, things are going to be very, very bad for a while. Most of us would probably die of famine or in other horrific ways and I can&#39;t say that I want the system to collapse for that reason. I do wish we could skip past all that and get back to a sort of prehistoric, natural way of living. But at this point its just not realistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of instances when the country wasn&#39;t divided; in times of great change, change that influenced every American regardless of party affiliation. There&#39;s 330+ million guns in the US, and as many citizens. Compare that to the several million in the US military, and you have a severe disadvantage on the government&#39;s side. </p>

<p>They&#39;re not going to use nuclear weapons. They won&#39;t destroy significant infrastructure, and they won&#39;t mass murder people. If you&#39;re building a regime, you can&#39;t destroy the foundation that it&#39;s being built on. People will be afraid to work if they know they&#39;ll die. </p>

<p>You need the infrastructure for your own purposes, transporting weapons and supplies, so destroying that is no good. And you definitely can&#39;t use nuclear weapons, as that would create a power vacuum between Russia, China, and any other country that wants to invade the US and &quot;save&quot; the citizens there, and would likely trigger most nuclear attacks. </p>

<p>And besides, what good do tanks, drones, and other large scale weapons do in that environment? They fail. Just look at the Middle East. Religious fanatics running amok with $50 Soviet cache AKs, and they&#39;ve been around for decades with little to no effect on their causes. </p>

<p>And the US is multitudes larger than that, with an immensely large amount of weapons. If it goes to revolution, it&#39;s going to be 100 years of guerilla warfare, terrorism campaigns, and bodies thrown at each other, possibly more. The government can&#39;t handle the size of the US with the military, or possibly even other militaries in addition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>China has shown why one-child policy doesnt work - they have singlehandedly turned male population into majority from being minority in entire human history. People were literally killing their children if they werent the &quot;Right gender&quot; or hiding them from government resulting in them never being able to get education and thus end up woking in sweat shops.</p>

<p>Trust me, i really wish one child policy would be a solution, but its not.</p>

<p>Japan has a negative birth rate because of its social situation. according to latest stats less than 30% of japanese before the age of 30 even had sex. they are literally secluding themselves from others.</p>

<p>And what if nations form in those 5 years? I can think of several organizations with the skills and resources to develop and build a self-sustaining nation in that amount of time, including a military. I doubt that they have that many weapons stocked underground. Planes and tanks need bodies to drive, and those bodies would consume resources that they&#39;ll want for themselves. </p>

<p>Chances are they&#39;ll lock themselves in their bunkers, and starve. Or they exit 5-6 years later, sick, malnutritioned, with rickets and all sorts of fun diseases from lack of sunlight or proper nutrition, without anyone to defend them. </p>

Can you imagine the government that exists today existing 100 years ago? Back when people didn&#39;t have the distractions that exist today?

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t understand, when they&#39;re talking about how unfair the system is; if you&#39;re winning it means you&#39;re playing and if you&#39;re playing, you&#39;re losing by default.</p>

<p>Happiness is transitory and fleeting. It wants any excuse to go away; cat died? Now you&#39;re in grief. Girlfriend left you? No more happiness. Have a bad day? Maybe your week is shit now - but that isn&#39;t an aspect of modern life, that&#39;s life.</p>

<p>Sometimes you get to be a happy, well-balanced human who glides joyfully through life. Think about your life, though, is there some aspect of it that suggests to you that you&#39;d be like that all the fucking time if the <em>system</em> were different? The system used to be profoundly different and it was, in fact, even shittier - not always the system&#39;s fault, but pretty true. It was boring, tiring, scary, full of child mortality, hungry, depressing, and dirty. Yet people were still happy some of the time, as is human nature. No one is happy all of the time, though, because even king&#39;s have it pretty shitty, in the end.</p>

<p>You want the <em>whole fucking system</em> to burn down because you&#39;re <em>tired</em> of advertisements? Get in fucking line. I&#39;d like to see it go because my tooth hurts, but it&#39;s so damned hard to see a dentist on Saturday. Thankfully there are fucking dentists, though.</p>
