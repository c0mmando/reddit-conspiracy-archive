    <div class="md"><p>the_donald, as much as it seems to allow for differing opinions, really is just another flavor of the tight casting we have everywhere else.

<p>Any time someone is trying to convince you to be negative of places like this, just ask yourself what goals a person that says that might have. Who would expend effort trying to tell others not to expend effort?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are brigaded because people from the donald don&#39;t like to see negative posts about him here. Look at controversial posts versus hot - they pour in here to deflect from their master and attack hillary/obama/podesta/etc with things they made up on 4chan.</p>

<p>They fear the truth. That isn&#39;t what a conspiracy person does, they seek it out and go where the evidence leads them and they have be careful of bs being strewn all over their path.</p>

<p>These people have one goal and one only, to downgrade posts about one man because they cannot face thinking he isn&#39;t the god emperor they thought he would be (plus, he owes russia a lot of money so they send shills to keep the news positive, they need him in power).</p>
