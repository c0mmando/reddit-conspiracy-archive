       Honestly this sub isn't T_D 2.0, as you don't get banned for going against Trump narrative. You do see Trump supporters trying to censor that side of things with "ban the shills" (e.g., people critical of Trump) posts every day though.

       claim that the mods here have banned them for going against the Trump narrative, which is absolute horseshit.  I've never seen one of those claims backed up when I question someone on it but it seems to be a popular thought, despite lack of evidence.

       Ask the Mods why they deleted/censored the two most popular threads in the subs history. They just happened to be anti Trump and they just happened to turn out true. You can't, because the mods added in the stipulation that you can't question mods immediately after the censorship.

       the_donald, as much as it seems to allow for differing opinions, really is just another flavor of the tight casting we have everywhere else. This place and 4chan is like the last bastion of free speech, and the negative agendas spare no effort in polluting them, or trying to convince us otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any time someone is trying to convince you to be negative of places like this, just ask yourself what goals a person that says that might have. Who would expend effort trying to tell others not to expend effort?

       Absolutely. And I think during the election it was hilarious, and a couple stories broke there that the rest of reddit wouldn't allow. I don't know what it is now, but it is as manipulated as politics and worldnews. But it never pretended to be something it wasn't, like you say.

       We are brigaded because people from the donald don't like to see negative posts about him here. Look at controversial posts versus hot - they pour in here to deflect from their master and attack hillary/obama/podesta/etc with things they made up on 4chan.

       They fear the truth. That isn't what a conspiracy person does, they seek it out and go where the evidence leads them and they have be careful of bs being strewn all over their path.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people have one goal and one only, to downgrade posts about one man because they cannot face thinking he isn't the god emperor they thought he would be (plus, he owes russia a lot of money so they send shills to keep the news positive, they need him in power).
