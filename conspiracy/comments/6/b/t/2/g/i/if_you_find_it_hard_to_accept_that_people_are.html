       And these are only the four who are most well known and who were murdered in public.  The list is a very long one.  Murder is very common.  To this list I will add Huey Long, Presidents Lincoln, McKinley and Garfield.  If we were to also list those who survived murder attempts we would add Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.  Then others such as Yitzhak Rabin, George Wallace, and many more.  It has been said that Murder is as American as Apple Pie and there is enough truth in this that no one should suspend their ability to accept the commonality of it.

       Thanks for this post  Ive noticed alot if the userbase is younger, and woefully unfamiliar with history, and it seems the more radical they are, the less they actually know about the history of the cause they espouse.

       I'm almost the same age and fully agree. It's also worth mentioning that in and around most those infamous assassinations were any number of other highly suspicious and unusual deaths of certain key individuals who were close enough to those events shed far more light on them than what any of the official statements had to say about them but who never lived to tell the tale. There are any number of glaring discrepancies and more than just a whiff of a conspiracy and cover-up surrounding virtually all of them, not to mention subsequent developments that each of them could be seen as standing in the way of that proved to be highly profitable for certain people once they were out of the way. All, of course, simply attributed to nothing more than pure coincidence.

       It is as if there is a conspiracy by organisations like fox, breitbart, infowars and zero hedge to deliberately spread false information and fake conspiracies so that we don't look too closely at the real conspiracies that are happening.

       And that is why I joined this sub. As Watergate proved, as the 'war on drugs' proved, our government doesn't tell us crap and gets away with far more than it should. And yet instead of forcing the government to spill its secrets and removing anyone who commits such scandals from office, we keep electing the same corrupt liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead of proving a pure truth, people are instead politicizing the sub to prove their personal truth. They discredit one side of the government to make the other look better, instead of showing exactly how wrong both parties are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel this competitiveness stems from the two-party system. Instead of giving us multiple choices, it instead polarized politics, to the point that many people see it less as the drive for a better country and more the drive to see your side win a competition.

       I am with you in the spirit of the search, and
       <em>
        (sigh)
       </em>
       , I am not far behind you in terms of years of searching - and the quest goes on...
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, the most frustrating part has not been the lack of discoveries, rather, it is that the VALUE of such discoveries is indiscernible to those who lack the understanding of the historical and political contexts in which such gems are set.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like trying to explain the significance of a microchip to a bunch of illiterate medieval peasants. They may be sincere in their interests, but having no grasp of relevant context, most just aren't going to "get it".
      </p>
      <p>
       That's okay, I suppose. The fascination is in the search itself, and the "reward" comes when, on rare occasion, we enlighten others as well.

       Just a thought, if you summon two of the British mods at 4am only the one who has insomnia will answer you.

       I recommend asking in modmail, I agree it is worthy though.

       Whoa easy with all this "they" nonsense! Aren't we not supposed to group people together?? I'm a millennial who relearned all of my history after my first conspiracy breakthrough that made me stop and ask myself, "Well what the fuck else are they lying to us about?!" and realized many things they taught us in school are bull shit.

       I'm a millenial myself and did the same. But you have to be honest that things would be going differently if the majority of the population wasn't lazy and completely dumbed down. Users on this sub are a tiny little minority in relation to the overall population, they aren't representative of the majority.

       The problem doesn't stem from a lack of desire.  The biggest issue is relative to the awareness of the information and it's daunting depths.  One thing that this generation has the most exposure to is information and this over exposure has consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       One consequence is over inflating information.  Another consequence is the exaggerated expectation of infallibility when speaking in regards to any event or subject.  Online or in person you are expected to be an expert in your field if you have any a semblance of knowledge regarding the topic.  Because it's impossible for everyone to be an expert in everything, but wholly acceptable for someone to be completely ignorant on a subject, this encourages people to reject learning.
      </p>
      <p>
       This avoidance of self education as a defensive mechanism not only fuels ignorance but also breeds misinformation.  Misinformation comes from echo chambers filled with individuals uninterested in meaningful research and only concerned with absorbing information quickly from a trusted source that is assumed to have processed the information.  The processing of this information distills the data and research into a true or false answer to the question - "Should I like this?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Learning for the average person is difficult.  I say this because if it were easy the worlds populations would be much more educated than they are.  Cultures can surely sway that difficulty but it's a universal constant for life to find the easiest path to follow.  I suppose this pathing, which is always compared to a river's flow, could go a step further.  Our current environment with education and information has become so immense humanity is still struggling to keep up.  Instead of the rivers of human understanding living in a flood plain they exist in a canyon.

       Not entirely sure, but almost 0 chance he died in Germany. He was a Rothschild plant, and Argentina is a very likely place. There were reports that he was there.

       We never even learnt about history after the 19th century. It was all left out, they didn't even try to wash our brains with propaganda. I had to learn it all by myself.

       I strongly recommend anyone in here spend a lot of time on history. Most of the narrative behind the facts we learn is BS, and it clouds our view of the present.

       Oh come the fuck on, you think it was easy to wake up in the 50's or the 80's? McCarthyism or the Cold War was a great time to question things? Who are you going to talk to about the JFK assassination in 1971? Where are you going to post about it or discuss it or read about it? Maybe you get lucky and come across a book by like a Gary Allen or similar, but what are the chances?

       I think one of the biggest unaddressed conspiracies of reddit.com is that the reddit administration continues to push the idea of a majority userbase in their 20's. I remember a survey done back in 2010 or 2011 and they couldn't wait to publish the results and show everyone how "cool and hip" the userbase was. They published all sorts of data, including professions, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       It is my humble opinion that reddits current userbase (for at least the last 2 years) is predominantly high school kids and the second largest demographic is middle school kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       See
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/">
        "How Reddit was Destroyed"
       </a>
       to witness a very deliberate and systematic approach to turning this website into the bought and paid for garbage propaganda machine that we currently have.
      </p>
      <p>
       This process created an online environment that aggressively pushed away the very demographics that allowed reddit to become the 4th biggest website on the planet. So what we have, just like Facebook, just like Youtube, and every other popular social website is history is an exodus of the founding group (ages 17-35) and the entrance of the next group (ages 9-25) and once this second group with an average age of 15 or 16 decides to leave, then we will see (again like every other social media platform) the entrance of the 35-70yr crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, reddit has an average age of 15 or 16 years old and the greater majority of them are from the US and Canada (probably over 75%).
      </p>
      <p>
       These are people who were literally in diapers or not even born during 9/11 and who are currently knee-deep in the (completely outdated) indoctrination system known as North American high school.
      </p>
      <p>
       They use social signaling as a way to identify themselves as part of the "cool group" and this is never anything but jumping into the latest circlejerk pool while screaming "cannonball" so that as many people as possible see the splash they make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all about being "in" and "in-the-know" by blindly repeating the latest meme news which has been manufactured by the globalist who control the mainstream media (and reddit and facebook are both now pillars of mainstream media), and then this human weakness is further manipulated by the appearance of a fake and manufactured "peer consensus" which is the product of NYC Craigslist ads and Washington DC "think tanks" combining to put tens of thousands of people into what used to be called a "call center" but is now refitted to be a online propaganda machine where the employees get minimum wage, type from scripts, have managers in the know coordinating attacks, and directors above the managers getting the daily orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe me I know, I used to work in one of these centers. Nobody even questions what they are doing because we get a paycheck and the promise of overtime (time and a half) hours. I once brought it up at lunch and my little group of work friends showed a cognitive dissonance so thick that I literally got frightened by the reactions and dropped the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it is not just "high school kids" allowing the information age to turn into lies, it is also the college age kids and above who turn a blind eye and who will do anything for a paycheck because of the times we are currently living in, a world where Wall Street greed and corrupt Western-led politics caused a global meltdown of the world's economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is another thing, none of this majority reddit userbase even has a fucking clue how different it was being a kid in the 70's, 80's, early 90's, etc... or how much different the US (and by default world) was before 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       They cannot even conceive of those times because they have no memories or experiences to compare. So while these people have no concept or clue how much shit we have all been smeared with, they are simultaneously being brainwashed by school, the internet, real peers, mainstream media, fake peer consensus, TV shows, movies, today's horribly wrong sponsored-prostitution of the word "science" and a million other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the while those very institutions whitewash pre-9/11 history right in front of our eyes. Something that no pre-internet generations could have ever seen so blatantly. But it doesn't matter, because we are now outnumbered on this website and the manufactured echo-chamber simply gets louder day by day. Becoming more and more effective by the minute. Daily online Two-Minutes Hates sessions brought to you by a masterful take-over of the digital world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And anyone who says anything other than the daily circlejerk gets their opinion shoved behind a collapsed icon or behind a [deleted] sign that you don't even see if you are signed in. And since I have had hundreds of comments shadow deleted like this in the last 2 years, I can only imagine how many people's opinions out there are being deleted daily on this website and they don't even know it because they never even considered checking.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the scary thing is that it is comments like this being deleted. Don't get it twisted and think I am talking about "da Jews" or being rude or insulting. It is literally comments like this one, and so I will check every hour or so to make sure that I can still see when I am signed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heed my warnings. I, like most of the old-school crowd on this subreddit and website, have been pushed to my limit and rarely even post anymore. So its a damn effective system they have running here. You have been warned. Nothing good can come of this. If you want one piece of advice from me: travel. Leave wherever you are from and see the world, see how much you have been lied to, see how much you have manipulated since birth by party politics, nationalism, and an intentional highjacking of your baser instincts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you leave the bubble, things suddenly start making a lot more sense. So do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace and love.

       Mine only employed a couple hundred but we were obviously part of a much larger system with many branches.

       First up,Wikipedia isn't the only place to find information on the vast Internet. You're either old or stupid if you believe that. So now, lemme see if I can get this right. You, random redditor, makes a ton of bold, wild and improbable accusations and you present them as facts. You utilize statistics etc, but yet when asked for verification you can't show a single thing to prove that you
       <em>

       How about this. "The world actually only has 4 billion people and the higher numbers are made up by globalist shills to ensure they keep control of the resources in their countries and keep them flowing". You read that and it sounds magnificent and dandy right? But you want to independently verify this yourself and you ask me for a source or sources. Then instead of backing up my claims I just handwave that away and complain about ignorant sheeple. See how that works? Provide sources so others can independently draw the same conclusion. People who refuse to do that then rant when their bs isn't well-received or believed are the nuts that give conspiracy theorists a bad rep

       Im sharing my personal experiences and observations, I am not that concerned with proving anything to people unwilling to entertain ideas that currently have no proof either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even reddit admins cant prove the age of the people on this site. They can only send surveys and hope the small amount who answer are not liars. And if reddit admins didnr like the results, I doubt they would publish them honestly. They have no agency monitoring them and they can say anything they want.

       The condescension from this thread blows my mind. If you've decided 17 year olds are too young and clueless to be worth your time to type out a reply you either write long winded replies or you're just a shithead. But I mean you did admit that you were a shithead at 17 and some things never change I guess

       Honest question: If he's saying something that you feel like you should respond to, why does it matter if the other person is 13 or 33? The only fact that should matter is that you realized it's a stupid comment and/or argument to begin with.

       Kids dont have the reference experience to understand things like war, politics or economics outside of entertainment media.  Its futile to try and explain.  Sure you can explain the concepts but those concepts take a different meaning when your children, your house, your livelihood are endangered.

       Main reason why your first comment catched my eye is the fact that there are old people that don't really understand things either, and internet is famously full of idiots. As such, I just personally don't ever think about the age of the commenter as when it comes to online conversations, it generally doesn't matter. Some 13 year old can act wiser than some 33 year old etc. Maybe the particular 13 year old kid just happens to be interested in history and knows how to research stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do have a point though; younger people tend to not know enough (or particularly tend to not have enough personal experience) when it comes to things like global politics/economics - in certain topics the commenter's age and experiences will affect a lot of things. It's just that you literally can't know the other guys age without creeping through the persons comment history and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I usually take comments at face value: if the comment sounds stupid, I don't care if it sounds stupid because of his age or if he just happens to be stupid. And on the other hand if it sounds wise, I still don't care if the commenter is 10 or 50 (unless it's relevant in the context, of course).

       I fully agree with you on this. IMO it is an equally stupid behavior of older people if they dismiss and don't even want to discuss with younger people for the sole reason that they are young and thus not capable of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think that you should always try to explain things and if you as an older adult refuse to talk to younger people then you have no right to judge them for not understanding things and you also have no right to blame them for being brainwashed by media etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone shows interest in something I'll try and explain it to them regardless of how old they are. If they want to argue or debate with me I'll do that as well.

       A lot of it is more: "do I really want to type all this out and have a long drawn out back and forth with this kid?" rather than people being dismissive. It gets exhausting trying to explain all of the backhistory, and being hollered at by kids about how much of a nazi you are in the process doesn't help.

       I can understand that and I agree with you. I do think though that every person deserves to be heard. Of course if someone behaves the way you described it then it is different. But if a kid / teen shows genuine interest then I feel older people should offer them answers or explanations.

       Overall, I agree with you. Ignorance can come in all different packages. However, it seems like sometimes you can spot the young age without snooping.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not even total ignorance, even if they've done the research it just reads like a rote wikipedia entry. There is this compression of the timeline that happens. The spread out nature of events, nuance and color is lost.

       That's ridiculous, I've met 13 year olds who have experienced more in life, have more appreciation for life and people than 50 year olds I've known. To write off an entire age group is like me writing off everyone over 55 because a lot of them are out of touch with technology, have lived sheltered lives without taking any risks and just insulated themselves with people and communities who all agree with their way of thinking.

       I remember thinking the same thing many years ago. I knew all the answers, could articulate them very well and interact with adults just fine and was often complimented on how 'smart' I was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had to grow older, much older unfortunately, before I understood the difference between being smart and being wise. People that stay curious about the world and continue to seek knowledge of all forms every day spend most of their time learning how much they don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now that I'm more than halfway through my journey in this life I start to get hints of the wisdom that people older than myself have access to. If you can imagine how you would treat a child and have a pretty solid understanding of its needs and motivations, that never stops happening and it is weird to see younger adults as children. When someone feels that moment of weirdness they'll usually say something like "When did I get so old?".

       For me, I definitely get more humbled the older I get. I realize how little I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also lose more respect for my elders consecutively. I remember looking up to people my current age when I was younger, thinking they knew it all. Turns out each time I reach a new stage in life I realize my peers are just as full of shit as they were at an earlier stage. Wisdom can come with age, but it usually doesn't.

       That aspect had crossed my mind as well but I didn't want to muddle my message. I think there a plateau many adults reach when they've been around long enough that they feel secure in what they know and what they don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       From that plateau it's striking to see how many people are just batshit crazy.

       I'm only 21 so I'm part of the younger group on here and I'm not trying to be like "excuse me I'm not like everyone else," but it really does baffle me how many people don't care to go and look their shit up before coming on here (or anywhere else) and arguing with people about things they hardly know about. I came to this sub to learn more along with doing my own research; not to hear about how the earth is flat "because I say so and this video quality sucks." I am here for comments/posts like this because it's some pretty important stuff and it really makes you think so you can go look further into it as well and understand.

       I can't sit here and say I know what happened in history before 9/11 changed the world considering how young I am, and that's all the reason to fucking do research rather than grab a story out of a high school history book and base my beliefs and knowledge on it. I have questioned my parents' political stances and others to understand both sides and to form my own beliefs and opinions.

       Part of that research is talking to older folks you meet. Next time you want to go out, find a local dive bar. Somewhere with people ~40+. Find someone who doesn't mind chatting it up, buy em a round, and ask.

       But I will also say I was 23 when 9/11 happened and new information has been trickling out over the years that has made me question everything. The stories we are told at the time don't always match with reality. Regardless of party and bias I think we should all be concerned with the amount of power the MSM has over thought and narrative- it is highly likely to damage the threads of our society in unimaginable ways.

       I wrote about it extensively using a previous account. I knew people would ask about it but I learned from the last times that its damn near infuriating to post about it. I will get flooded by accusations and people demanding more no matter how much I write.

       Believe me, these places exist. I got hired through a temp agency and I still have no idea how they got my resume. I was 25 at the time and living in the East Village, Nyc.

       I was just reading a review of a book at Goodreads and I couldn't believe how dumbed down the site has become. Review after review is littered with stupid gifs, memes and just "Luuurrrvvvv Edmond Dantes, he's soooo keewwllll, hihi, thousand heart emojis". That's when I realized that most of the reviews were written by teenagers and that I could just forget the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree so much with your comment, sadly, the quality of a site declines when it gets overtaken by dumb teenagers. It's not fair to call all of them dumb, there are surely many that could write well thought-out comments or just produce quality content without using thousand emojis and memes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm almost thirty and I got to know teenagers that are serious, hard working, well educated and who have a clear grasp on the world. Sadly, this doesn't seem to apply to many that comment here on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if there has ever been such a rapid decline of living quality within a few generations. Who knows, maybe this is why today's teenagers are so incredibly dumbed down. At least they know how to contour and put their photos on instagram.

       It is also painful for me as a parent to see how little opportunity there is for the younger generation and how much society has actively cultivated hate and disrespect for them.  That is the part I absolutely do not understand.   What kind of society denigrates and hates its own young?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there are going to be a few bad apples, but by and large they are no worse than any other generation and have less opportunity to improve their lot.  I am fortunate the my kids are managing well and most are in (or were in) a state that still has some opportunity for the younger generation.  But if they had been born a decade later, then I think it would have been even harder for them.  It is just getting worse and worse.

       Yes, this is awful as well. What's even more painful is if parents act as if the youth is just entitled and lazy, when they ignore that everything was handed to them on a silver platter and that times have changed. The society not only shuns the youth, but older job searchers are also humiliated. No one will take them because they cost too much or because they're too experienced.

       It was long portrayed as "progress" when all the manufacturing jobs were outsourced to the East. Now we're left with shitty service jobs like retail or waiting tables or completely superfluous jobs like "food stylist" or "personal shopper". There are few meaninful and satisfying jobs (like doctors, police men, nurses, teachers) left and they're mostly financed by the state, which is sadly shrinking. We're all caught in a vicious cycle and we're all going down the drain collectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's problematic to call a whole generation "bad" or "good", but we can't deny that a baby boomer will have a different experience of life than millenials who live among the scraps of what has been once a successful civilization.

       I think much of the hate is largely toward the group that are so often in the press, especially in the universities. Where it's just a liberal minded circle jerk and thought contradictory to it is just shut down asap.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I would disagree on having opportunities to improve "their lot". I'm 27 and have so many more resources for improving myself and my economic status now than when I initially came out of high school. It takes research and a willingness to relocate for job or school opportunities. If you contain yourself to a local sphere then yes, you're going to be limited. I left home at 19 with $200 and a duffle of clothes to start my life over and now make on average 55k a year. Opportunity is everywhere.

       You are the age of my sons.  Yes, for that age group, I think there was some opportunity, at least in some states.  In many states, such as NY  and particularly on Long Island, the chances are slim and the pay is really terrible relative to the cost of living.  For people that already have made it, it is fine, but for someone starting out it is really poor.  OK, on the other hand, has much more opportunity for the young.

       But it shouldn't be that way. That you have to throw your whole life away and bend over backwards just to get by in a decent way. Not everyone wants to leave their home and family behind. I moved away, but it shouldn't be forced upon those who don't want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people shouldn't be called lazy. It's a sign that something is seriously wrong in our society. We have a surplus of food, energy and everything that is important for human life. Yet we are brainwashed that we are "lazy" if we don't contort ourselves completely. It's the system that's broken. This brainwashing is just to divide the population, to make us hate each other so that we don't see who the real perpetrators are. The politicians and CEOs who make the system are those that we should hate, not the others who struggles just as much.

       I agree, the system is completely broken. That, however, doesn't mean that opportunity is going to be the same geographically. To think that opportunity should be or ever will be the same for everyone no matter where you live is just delusional. The job market and solid post-secondary education is always going to be completely different for say Dothan, AL and San Francisco, CA. You can't honestly make the comparison in either regard. Sometimes you DO have to go where the work or education is.

       That's fine and dandy, but can't you also say that because you're a conspiracy theorist, you also live in a bubble? I mean, this sub has already been taken over by the Donald so what merit do you have? Pizza gate is a huge one here too. And now Seth Rich. And before that, Sandy Hook. 
It's ridiculous. There's no evidence at all for any of the three I've mentioned. And you know why? Because it's all right wing propoganda and the most gullible ones ate it the fuck up. You don't have to investigate because there's no evidence. You're making this sub a joke. It has been for awhile since you let the Donald in here. This sub should be partisan free and you all screwed that a long time ago. 
So ban me. What do they say in the Donald? I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.

       Exactly.  Like the conspiracy to deflect all blame for the DNC's complete failure to beat the incompetent nitwit Trump, and blame it all on "the Russians".

       Everyone should question what they read.

       My stance is this: what's the agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would I ever believe what the WaPo, NYT, or CNN say? Why should I believe what the 'big 6' media outlets put out?

       TD has some things right, and some things wrong. That's why you, as a reader, should question and investigate yourself and decide for yourself what's true or not.

       Honestly, it isn't even necessary to travel to know that we're drowning in a sea of propaganda: Much of it is self-contradictory and/or completely absurd. Certainly Reddit, itself, is not responsible for its contribution to this, but bending to the will of powers that could shut it down completely in minutes if it became a "threat to national security."

       This same thing is happening to youtube. The community that brought the platform into the modern consciousness is being pushed away by the suits in favor of a new way to sell toys to kids. These toy companies were losing money due to the rapid development of streaming services, notably youtube that was free to use, so they just started dumping money onto anyone who sold the idea of toys on their channel, and made sure youtube would give them greater control over advertisement so as to prune the "undesirable" channels that provide controversial content that might hurt their image. It has gotten so out of hand, that some people rebrand their channels almost overnight from being vlogging/gaming/art/sketches to toy unboxing and reviews, all without any concern towards their former fans. Imagine you were watching your favorite show and then one day, all of a sudden, the show becomes some twisted form of itself with product placement all over, and crude jokes for children thrown around.

        And anyone who says anything other than the daily circlejerk gets their opinion shoved behind a collapsed icon or behind a [deleted] sign that you don't even see if you are signed in. And since I have had hundreds of comments shadow deleted like this in the last 2 years, I can only imagine how many people's opinions out there are being deleted daily on this website and they don't even know it because they never even considered checking.

       Seriously, this happens at a stupid rate. I am part of some subs where to say anything against the popular opinion is complete blasphemy, even stupid things. Here's an example: I'm part of a sub that talks about eating limited calories per day. Within this sub, there are people who go crazy about this particular brand of fake ice cream that has a few less calories so they justify eating a whole pint of it. I point out how ridiculous that is (when you can just have a normal portion of regular ice cream and not gorge) and I get downvoted and/or deleted to oblivion. And that's just on a silly meaningless type of thread.

       I know what you mean. I'm a member of two mom subreddits and my children are only partially vaccinated, the youngest completely unvaccinated. Those subs are rabidly pro-vaxx. Although abusive language and name calling is not allowed in general, when anyone who even dares question vaccinations posts, they are called names, insulted, and downvoted to oblivion. And, no one sees a problem with it - it's perfectly socially acceptable.

       Incredible comment that I heartily agree with.  The newer generation is properly fucked in many ways when it comes to having the tools necessary to process information like people who grew up primarily before 9/11 when things were entirely different.  Hard to recognize the country anymore.

       Lol I was born in 89. So I was a child of the 90s. It hasn't changed that much. Honestly the biggest difference I see is that there's just a lot more fear mongering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I think OP is referring to seth rich. Really I would care if t_d wasn't spamming stupid horseshit all the time. They turned themselves into a crazies echo chamber and then want people to listen. The sitting president or his close associates collude to interfere with the election and there is actually quite a lot of valid evidence and they're like SETH RICH PIZZA GATE. It's like fuck off.

       Great post. I'm also deeply frustrated, and older... but I'm less pessimistic. I think it's never been easier to research and discover our actual history. Things are going to change, but I agree that lately the dichotomy of corporate news vs. actual news is striking. The best thing we can do is talk to our elders, and our children, about the nature of the MSM.

       Your comments resonates very strongly with me. The number of these kinds of comments have been reduced to about 1/month here which I manage to bump into. Being from a European country (not so different from the US brainwash but still) and having traveled a bit in my short life so far I can say your words hold a lot of weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is something very scary happening with the people of the USA and I have not been able to put it into words. I was born in the 90's and have felt something strange missing in all of this. The world we have right now. The community is somehow missing, the sense of belonging. Historically it has been dangerous when young people don't have a place in the world. It makes me vary of the future. I just hope we make the right choices and go the right way.
      </p>

       Thank you for taking your time and writing your thoughts. It has made an impact.

       There is a search engine I can't find right now that shows you the frequency of certain words used on reddit. Anyway, a couple years ago the word "tho" exploded. It was a clear sign that the kiddies had moved in to Reddit.

       I major in literature and I've fallen in love with critical theory. It's incredibly relieving to be able to approach social understanding in a structured way.

       You're spot on with almost everything you said, especially the points about age manipulation. Young kids want to fit in and the internet lets them do that. If you can control that, you can get away with pretty much anything.

       I'm not quite old enough to call myself yet but I supposed I'd be in the higher demographic.

      <p>
       I just wanted to one thing you've not mentioned; that is the new entrepreneurship streaming allowed. Teens trying to explain the world and things to teens.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they're not on about the consumation of certain goods they'll give their opinions on 'ongoing things in the world' with a follow ship that state TV could - at times - only dream of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally the setup of these shows is all but thorough. Additionally it's admittedly also hard to not fall for some nutjobs' conspiracy stuff that solely pursuits his own agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the one I've learned - live your life in a fashion that you don't have to deal with regret when finally lying on your deathbed. The world has been spinning before us and it will do so after us. While the 'grander scheme of things' is in fact worrying, the small scheme of things is not. The latter also is within our power(s) to change for the better ;)

       So your argument is that in the 21st century, where we have modern forensics and massive advances in surveillance and identity technology, that it's less common now for an assassin to get caught than it used to be? I mean, all hose examples are extremely dated. Do you have a modern example of where an assassin was conclusively caught?

       think (as opposed to what I can prove) is that the 60s-era assassinations were exceedingly clumsy and obvious, and in the modern world an assassination is much more likely to be concealed as an accidental death, e.g. a plane crash.

       I'm not so young, and up until about 10 years ago, I was completely blind to the other side of history.  I watched a bunch of "boring " documentaries, read a few books, and I slowly began seeing the world differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm to the point now where I can't even turn the TV on anymore.

       I see what they're censoring.  They want you to believe political assassinations, false flags, distraction memes, etc. don't exist, and therefore aren't relevant to the current (bullshit) narrative.
      </p>

       I wish more people were seeing the things the same way.

       It's pretty safe for me to say about 75% of youth today are more intelligent than you are. You've fallen into the same trap the generation that came before you did; blaming everything on the generation that came after yours. They're all idiots, but your generation? Geniuses, every last one. Learn to think for yourself, stop being a fucking tool. Look at the real problems instead of opening your mouth and spouting idiotic shit.

       If you think that your obsession with fantasy boardgames and unique dice is an insult, maybe you need to rethink your life choices and hobbies.   Yeah I think you are pretty fuckin dumb to spend so much time with orks and elves and bullshit.  You can whine and cry all you like about the priwess of todays youth, but the fact remains you have NO life experience and frankly, you are a victim of a compromised educational system leading to your obtuse view that everyone but you is wrong.  Anyhow, go catch a pokeyman and name him Putin or something, I dont need to talk to children with a bit of diaper rash anymore.

       Get angrier, you old moron. It's really funny to read your insane rantings about the youth, and how the Jews did everything. All I can imagine when I think about how you look in reality, is some lonely old fuck, sitting at his ancient computer that he barely understands how to use, constantly crying and screaming about those "stupid youths and them damn jews!". Your ignorance is astounding and actually somewhat frightening, because you ACTUALLY believe this shit. You're an irrelevant, pathetic fool. It'd be best if you just shut the fuck up, rather than continue making yourself look like an idiot.

But hey, believe what you want. That's the beauty of the internet; you can be as stupid as you want, and no one can stop you. So go, old man, and be as stupid as we all know you are.

       I've said far more than "NU UH", though I'm not surprised that your senile mind forgot, if you were even able to comprehend what I said in the first place. Anyway, I have far more important things to do than arguing with a senile old fool on the internet, so I'm gonna stop replying after this. It's been a hilarious time though. I'll leave you with one last thing. I am going to outlive you. My generation will outlive yours. Nothing you've ever done in your life will matter, we'll just toss it in the trash and live lives free of your foolish ignorance, while you rot in the ground, completely forgotten. You are nothing, and have never been anything. Have a nice day!

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ronald Reagan was an actor, not at all a factor
Just an employee of the country's real masters
Just like the Bushes, Clinton and Obama
Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters
If you don't believe the theory, then argue with this logic
Why did Reagan and Obama both go after Qaddafi
We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil
Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Killer Mike's spelling it out in this last verse of his song Reagan. Clinton doesn't decide who lives or dies, she, trump and everyone else is just there to take the blame from the other side while the real masters make all the decisions.

       I could also argue it's anti war propaganda, considering how pissed off some people were that friendly fire is allowed to happen since you usually don't hear about it. I don't think there's a motive.

       What I read was that due to his status he was in a position to be big threat to the war propaganda machine due to his anti war sentiment. If I have a problem with war no one gives a shit about a grunt nobody, but if nfl star ranger American hero has a problem it could cause more issue. Interesting theory, just as likely true than not true.

       His whole death is extremely suspicious. Friendly fire on a clear day? He was very anti-war and was booked to do a talk with Chomsky (I think) when he got back. He died before he could get back.

       I remember reading that Pat Tillman was sending letters home about how bullshit the Iraq war was, and that all he was doing was guarding Opium fields. He wanted to be vocal about it when he returned back to the United States from his tour.

       As someone from Az it was closely covered here for years. The fact that the the government tried to cover up his death in the first place should be telling. Second he was becoming less supportive of the war and more vocal on what was actually happening there. They couldn't have such a popular person that sacrificed so much to join the military giving them a huge black eye by speaking out against the war.

       That's all that makes sense. The military wants to prevent people from being anti war so they kill him and it's painted as friendly fire? Also why even bother since him enlisting was extremely patriotic and inspired many Americans I'm sure.

       Accidentally? According to the people who were there (and taking fire along with Tillman), there was absolutely no way the shooters didn't know they were firing in friendlies. Not to mention the ever changing story to back the entire incident. First it was enemy combatants, then it was friendlies with ARs and finally, it came out that he was likely hit in the head and face 3 times from incredibly close range.

       I have to admit that I know next to nothing about the controversy surrounding his death.  I can find the official story, easily enough, with a quick google search, but would you mind linking something in-depth that takes a critical look at all of the information?
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember hearing about this a while back, but I never picked up anything past the initial report.  Hearing that this was a case of friendly is incredibly sad.  I couldn't imagine being a soldier who realized he was being attacked by his own guys.

       Hey, sorry it took me so long to get back to you, but thanks a lot for the information.  I remember hearing about there being something being... "off" about this story, but I was caught up in something else at the time.  From what I remember, he was a true believer, and if he was really killed by his own guys... that's unforgivable.

       Yes, Ruppert would be on my list. He is one of several "suicides" where his so-called partner was rolled out and used a prop to quell any suspicion that he might have been murdered. The same happened with Michael Hasting's wife, and Aaron Swartz's mysterious girlfriend.
      </p>

       Phillip Marshall was close with CIA pilots and was writing his second book on 9/11 presumed to go in depth on the no plane theory with eye witness accounts of the planes that were supposedly used in the attacks on 9/11 landing at a CIA airport in new mexico.

       The only conspiracy regarding Rich is the one invented by Fox news.

       The "private investigator" supposedly hired by the Rich family is none other than a bought and paid for analyst for Fox News by the name of

       The entire conspiracy subsits on innuendo and false information, and started in the halls of Fox News. It was obviously fake from the very start, yet because it made the DNC looked bad, the narrative was pushed by conservative media, a tactic they are well known for.

       Reporting that somebody "suffered from depression" is invariably posited by the media (and unquestioningly accepted by MSM consumers) as some sort of "proof" that somebody committed suicide, case closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality only 3-4% of depression sufferers end up taking their own lives. Someone like Aaron Swartz, who left no note and was found hanged (the professional assassin's favourite method of staging a suicide) may well have been depressed, but he also presented a threat to some very powerful people, if the stories about his intent to blow the whistle on a huge paedophile ring are correct.

       ... HST himself always said, throughout his life, that he planned on offing himself. At first he said he'd do it when he was 50 years old, but when he actually hit 50 and realized it wasn't so bad, he put his suicide off. The comment about it being "obviously a suicide" has nothing to do with medias interpretation of his mental health or lack thereof, it's from the man himself's very own, well-known words and plans.

       sry, I got excited when I saw that her name wasn't there. It was strange bc she disappeared and was later found dead. 
I think she was an intern or something. I think the character on house of cards that was pushed into the oncoming train was based on her (maybe).

       I would add Ernest Hemingway to that list. Although he probably actually offed himself, he was being tailed by the FBI for years and they were making his life a living hell. The FBI used to try to drive people to suicide, a famous example being the letter they sent to MLK shortly before his assassination.

       What would be the motive for them to want Hemingway dead?  I think I also left out obvious murders/assassinations like MLK, RFK, Malcolm X, and JFK.  But you are absolutely right about the vileness of that letter and tactics used against MLK Jr.  Peace.

       All the royalty was forced to live a life of exile in the majestic pristine mountains of Switzerland, after the fall of the Monarchical charades. At the time, every national Monarchy shared one common feature. Every one of their personal guards were Swiss, throughout all of Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is well recorded in the French Revolution, among others, where the Swiss Guard were the staunches defenders of the Royalty, legendary, really, even in battle prior to that, as the 'last line of defense', most well equipped, and most trained line of defense. Thus the Swiss choose to guard the Pope as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among the unique features of Switzerland, such as $97,000 median incomes ( vs $29,000 US), no political assassination, mandatory nuclear fallout shelters, nationalized agriculture, strict environmental laws, liberal human rights, cooped industrial education, union employment, and only nation worldwide under direct democratic rule with a council of 7 Presidents; Switzerland was also the first nation to relocate their Jewish populations and burn them alive in order to take over the Banking Industry, in 1349.

       Likewise, keep in mind unlike the 'national' borders of today, the rivers played a major part in trade and communication. Thus, lower France and the Rhine land are often influenced by the Swiss and can be seen as an economic unit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, it's important to keep in mind they were the first nation to electronically connect every home via telephone wire, in 1898, well before many other nations, and are the international postal headquarters as well. I forget the name of the Swiss press, but that had a form of nationalized press for a long, long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the US began it's CIA service, it was modeled, or upgraded, after Swiss style espionage, primarily lead by Allen Dulles who had spent some 20 years in Switzerland previously. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, he was fired by JFK prior to serving as a judge who shared the belief there was no grand conspiracy to assassinate him. The primary form of Swiss CIA was 'technological guerrilla warfare', where as prior-US CIA activities were 'service to nation'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rolex and the Red Cross are both Swiss Charities worth considering.
      </p>
      <p>
       I almost forgot to mention, forms of what we'd call 'satanism' (Human Sacrifice rituals, slave master relationships, and occult imagery) are quite popular with Swiss elite, and was the chosen national celebration for the grand opening of the world's largest tunnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, however, their political system is a wonder to behold. Their constitution ratified around 1850, was guided on the principal of 'social direct democracy', with strong limits over executive power. For example, their council of 7 executives are not even permitted to join the EU, join TPP, or enter into any 'superstate' alliance without a national vote. Their form of Democracy is truly a wonderful system, and absolutely unique in the world.

       There is so much there the Amish were founded in Switzerland I think, along with a very popular religion around 1940 that said white babies born stupid would become black, and black stupid babies would become monkeys. The theory of 'devolution', which stated that black skin color was a symptom of intellectual inferiority and was contagious.

       They seem to have education figured out. The US could have modeled their system, but chose to make up some new pile of crap, with committees of unqualified goons, sending us down the education toilet.
       <br/>
       The US could have modeled any decent national system, or modeled any decent upper class private system, but went for experimental whims, based around committees of morons, and lots of microsoft profit.
       <br/>
       Watch as American kids learn to have more feelings, and world citizenship programming, when we could have easily modeled a successful system.

       The subreddit is a conglomeration of personalities. Some believe there's a conspiracy by the rich to gain control over the masses and some believe the Earth is literally flat. Some believe that the path to Freedom is to seizing the means of production and others think Donald Trump is the god emperor.

       I think it started with
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_mercenaries">
        Swiss mercenaries
       </a>
       from way back. They were hired by everyone, excellent pikemen that could be bought by whoever.

      <p>
       I think Switzerland's status has been a result of lots of history. Maybe it is the kind of place you're talking about now, but I think that's due to how neutral they are as well. If anyone starts wars, Switzerland would be the place to be to watch it unfold. It's not because Switzerland caters to them as much as it's just the obvious safe place to be I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty interesting. It might literally be the result of 700 years of history.

        Although King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he was undecided as to whether he would vote for Adlai Stevenson or Dwight Eisenhower, but that "In the past I always voted the Democratic ticket."[260] In his autobiography, King says that in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy: "I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but I never made one." King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying "Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964."[261] In 1964, King urged his supporters "and all people of goodwill" to vote against Republican Senator Barry Goldwater for president, saying that his election "would be a tragedy, and certainly suicidal almost, for the nation and the world."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Goldwater nomination, along with Republican reaction to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was also pushed conservative Jackie Robinson into the arms of the Democratic party. Robinson considered Republican support for Goldwater and lack of support for the Act to be a betrayal, an insult, and ominous for the future.

       He'd be viewed exactly like Clinton today. Old money, obtained in often mysterious ways, connected to many political powers-that-be, and a very centrist platform.

       Im glad he ran all those years ago and is hailed as a great man, as opposed to a monster like Hillary.

       It's obviously not the old money people hate about the clintons since the get votes; but their constant lies and assassinations as well as stupid moves world-wide. They are puppets to fuck-heads like Soros and Podesta.

       You're letting identity politics define your political scale. Race has always been used as a tool for division. Once MLK and Malcolm X begin to realize that the battle was drawn along class lines, is when they were assassinated.

       The trick is to not fall for the race baiting bullshit and keep your eyes on the prize (Capital).

       I always got the impression that MLK would get discredited as a black apologist if he were alive today. Like Bill Cosby minus the raping. The Boondocks did a show about it and I could totally see it going down the way they tell it if MLK didn't die, but was instead put into a coma from the assassination and woke up today.

       Possibly but if John Lennon spoke out today, he might have more of an impact than a Roger Waters.  Hard to speculate I guess.  They were definitely lionized after death.

       you would have heard the same type of shit in the civil rights movement 50 yrs ago. people are angry and you look foolish trying to police the emotions of angry people and even more so by trying to extrapolate the actions of a few angry people to represent the views of millions.

       Bruh on the real though I live right outside of Ferguson and can attest that shit like that does make outsiders look indifferent upon that movement. 
I do agree there is racism but is burning down your neighborhoods and looting innocent store owners going to help. No. But that was just that groups set of extremists no different than westborugh Baptist church or Islamic extremist. Its the good and the bad.
Personally ive always felt that BLM needs a  leader and a set goal. To be able to reasonably achieve goals without resorting to means like they used in Ferguson or Baltimore.

       truth, but BLM is just an umbrella idea that people are organizing under. like the civil rights movement, its not really an organization itself, but a cause that people are working towards. everybody has a different idea on how to get there and you're not going to agree with all of them but it doesn't discredit the overall goal. keep in mind, the civil rights movement had already been going on for 10 years before MLK showed up.

       I imagine MLK would still be taking about social justice saying something like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a "more convenient season."

       So, you're using the conspiracy theory versions of those deaths to try to convince people skeptical of conspiracy theories? I don't see how that works. I could equally say that those who find it hard to accept the idea of JFK being killed by a lone assassin should remember that MLK and RFK were also killed by lone assassins.

       Anyone who counted the number of bullets fired at JFK and RFK ought to be able to figure out quite easily that those were not 'lone assassin' murders.  If you look a bit deeper into the evidence you will find that there are just too many bullets from too many directions to support the lone gunman theory of those assassinations.

       Isn't it kind of strange- Trump hasn't said anything about the Seth Rich story. Sean Spicer refused to even comment on it. If the Seth Rich conspiracy is evident as you say why isn't Trump doing anything about it? Especially considering that uncovering such a conspiracy would help counteract his recent negative coverage in the media.

       As OP has not responded to any remarks except one which does not pertain to either the Clintons or Trump, I think it might be safe to say he is not remarking on them. His link discusses presidents only and of the recent ones listed the democrats have more attempts than the republicans. If I were to guess, I would say OP disagrees with the Trump theorists on this sub. But that is just a guess.

       This has everything to do with Trump. The whole point of pushing this conspiracy is a) promoting that the DNC info was leaked not hacked b) discrediting the allegations of interference against Russia and c) painting Hillary and the DNC as monsters. I think you'd be very hard pressed to find someone who doesn't support Trump promoting this theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats not the point I was making however. Regardless of how you feel about Trump- you can't deny that he would have something to gain if there were any credible leads pertaining to this story. His lack of interest in it implies that there are none.

       In your eyes because you're stuck on red vs blue. To anyone that is not partisan its just one more thing that politicians as a whole take part in. I bet you'd say pizzagate is also pro Trump.... While some people who look into these things are red or blue, to anyone who isn't on a team its just one more tally mark on a list of shit that both parties do. Seth Rich was probably murdered his involvement in the DNC just like the other 3 conveniently dead DNC peeps that more cant testify or take part in the cases involving the DNC. The DNC rigged primaries against Bernie in many if the same ways republicans fucked with Ron Paul.... Just because youre too stuck in the game to see thr bigger doesmt mean everyone else is playing the fame... Fuck trump and fuck clinton.

       Wikileaks explicitly stated: "This should not be taken to imply that Seth Rich was a source to WikiLeaks or that his murder is connected to our publications." Wikileaks knows that there is no evidence, but they benefit from the promotion of this story because it allows them to maintain their integrity as an avenue for whistleblowers and leaders, instead of a laundering service for hacked info.

       Don't feed me any mumbo jumbo about protecting his family or something like that. If it had been Rich, Assange would know and be able to reveal it. But it wasn't, and Assange knows this and is playing up the angle that you're so desperate to believe.

       I think the White House hasn't said anything, because they don't know anything and couldn't prove it if they did.

      <p>
       It was odd how the PI did a 180 on the subject of the laptop, but in Fox's (Fox News published their own piece, which is different from the fox5 story) defense, they wrote that their reporter confirmed with an FBI contact that Rich had communicated with Wikileaks and that some FBI agents assisted the D.C. Police.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's impossible to say as to whether this is true or not.  We'll probably never know.

       Or, perhaps exposing that kind of dirt is like turning on the lights and watching the roaches scatter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a strong suspicion the White House isn't commenting on Seth Rich because it will also come back and hurt big Republicans like McCain. We all know the R's and D's are just as shitty, but exposing assassinations of a leaker to Wikileaks could implicate so many big power structures it could do more harm than good.

       Also, it can be used as a bargaining chip.

       Wow that's not my take on it Mr. DNC Bot. Wikileaks put out a massive reward for info on the murderer. Seems to me you could ask them behind closed doors to confirm. Seems to me there is a held up investigation. Seems to me Trunp can just sit back and wait on this one, as such an accusation requires bullet proof evidence. So please get your shareblue garbage out of here. We won't let this murder list keep growing.

       . The things you pointed out definitely support the conclusion that Seth may have leaked information to wikileaks.

       that you are wrong is awkwardly out of place for this sub. Honestly, when I see people expend so much effort arguing against a narrative on a conspiracy sub, it only strengthens my belief that Seth was connected to WikiLeaks.

       I just think it's awfully convenient for Wikileaks. My point of view is that Seth is the perfect scapegoat to paint the DNC/Clinton as even more evil. Which sure they might be bad, but I can't call them murderers without proper conviction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks obviously hates Clinton, Assange obviously likes Russia(having a show on RT), so why wouldn't they take the opportunity to paint the Seth Rich murder as a DNC/Clinton murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I know everyone says Wikileaks has to protect its sources. But if it's that big of a deal, and obviously Wikileaks would have evidence that Seth was the leaker, then why not give it up?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it's impossible Clinton called a hit on Seth, but I think it's 100% fair to flip the situation and look at it like Wikileaks is lying to further it's own agenda.

       Also the persistent stance that it was a "robbery" (even though nothing was stolen) is annoying at best, suspicious at worst.  So all the gang violence in Chicago every weekend is just "robberies gone wrong."  JFK was just a "robbery gone wrong."

       That's actually an interesting question, since we know Trump adores unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that make his opponents look bad. He was the figure head of the "birther" fiasco after all. So why isn't he all over this story?

       I think it probably has more to do with the fact that he's already in office. Unsubstantiated allegations are useful when campaigning, but now that hes in office they are less beneficial, and everything he says carries greater risk.

       Did you even read that? This isn't even about Obama's birth! To quote your obviously biased source:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Mr. Penn never suggested bringing up Mr. Obama’s birth certificate
       </p>

      <p>
       And take note that they don't even say Clinton started it but the "Clinton-machine" did, because they don't dare to spout blatant lies like you or your god-emperor.

       The difference is that A) it wasn't Clinton. B) "the Clinton Machine" (read: Penn) didn't start the birther movement, he said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        All of these articles about his boyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse, multicultural and putting it in a new light [...]his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American
        <em>
         in his thinking and his values
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It has nothing to do with Obama's birth. It's a campaign strategy that targets Obama's upbringing. While this strategy is somewhat despicable it doesn't use false claims about Obama's birth. I'm quoting all of this from the link you provided.

       That's the opposite argument. They're not saying that no one has ever been killed for political reasons; they're saying that not everyone political who dies was killed for political reasons, which is the basic assumption of this Seth Rich nonsense.

       Wait no. That's not the logic.

       Basically for this to work, deleted posts would need to include a large number of posts deleted for a correct reason. He's arguing that the people  who weren't murdered are the correctly deleted posts and that very, very few deleted posts are do so due to a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't use posts not deleted because this implies all posts are equivalent to the population of people who apparently piss off politicians. When in actuality you need to sort you posts somehow where the metaphor for the dead and the living "thorn in side" people are separate from the larger population for a comparison. Otherwise you're comparing the amount of people alive on the planet to the number of people who are considered "thorn in side" by using what you imply are posts deleted by reddit in a conspiratorial manner.

       I started out on reddit 9 years ago as
       <em>

       , then got shadowbanned.  The next name I used was
       <em>

       .  Somebody discovered my identity so then I started posting as Dhylan.  I've been at this a good long time.  I enjoy this particular sub and have made a lot of friends here.

       I find it hard to accept that a political assassination would be done by shooting someone in the back without them even dying until they get to hospital. If that's an assassination, it's a fucking sloppy one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude was drunk and walking through a dodgy neighbourhood. He somehow took 2 hours to get from bar1 (after leaving drunk) to bar2, despite being a short walk. He was was torn, but not removed. I'd say it was a mugging gone wrong, a struggle, a gunshot and then the mugger ran off before searching the bloody victim for money (if I just shot someone I wouldn't stick around to go through their back pocket)

       If you're gonna assassinate someone, at least
       <em>
        kill
       </em>
       them rather than leaving the scene of the crime while they're still alive.

       And if the ploy was to make it look like a mugging them why not take his wallet etc? The wallet/watch behind is "evidence" of why this was supposedly not a mugging

       I just think it's awfully convenient for Wikileaks. My point of view is that Seth is the perfect scapegoat to paint the DNC/Clinton as even more evil. Which sure they might be bad, but I can't call them murderers without proper conviction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks obviously hates Clinton, Assange obviously likes Russia(having a show on RT), so why wouldn't they take the opportunity to paint the Seth Rich murder as a DNC/Clinton murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I know everyone says Wikileaks has to protect its sources. But if it's that big of a deal, and obviously Wikileaks would have evidence that Seth was the leaker, then why not give it up?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it's impossible Clinton called a hit on Seth, but I think it's 100% fair to flip the situation and look at it like Wikileaks is lying to further it's own agenda.

       Ok. Given that they are fucking us over big time, and have been doing so for a long long time, we now know and understand this fact to a certain extent. The extent to which we understand these facts vary by individual, but everyone on this sub is to some extent awake. But, what do we do about our situation? What CAN we do? We know we are getting screwed, so do we call for more and better lube? Lower taxes, perhaps? A better healthcare system? If you do not pay your taxes in protest, they will lock you up and you will lose everything eventually. You can try to drop out of society, but the underclass holds no attractions for me. Being homeless is a young man's game.

       JFK was killed by a lone nut. MLK was killed by a racist piece of shit. Malcolm X was killed by a rival black nationalist group. RFK was killed by someone trying to bring attention to the plight of Palestinians. These guys weren't killed by shadowy evil organizations with complex nefarious plans. Jesus Christ, people.

       I guess you never heard of James Files.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll focus on some facts known about RFK's murder for you.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Powder burns on Kennedy's clothing reveal that all three of his wounds were from a gun fired from 0 to 1-1/2 inches away. And yet, all witnesses claim that Sirhan, who was in front of Kennedy, never got closer than three feet away.
       </li>
       <li>
        Sirhan's gun could hold only eight bullets. Seven bullets were removed from victims, an eighth bullet was traced through two ceilings into airspace, and two more bullets were identified as lodged in the door frame of the pantry by both LAPD and FBI personnel.
       </li>
       <li>
        Three bullets were found in Robert Kennedy, and a fourth grazed his suit jacket. The upward angle of each trajectory was close to 80 degrees. And yet, all witnesses claim Sirhan's gun was completely horizontal for his first two shots, after which his gun hand was repeatedly slammed against the top of a steam table.
       </li>
       <li>
        All four shots; the fatal penetration to the brain, the shot that passed through the right shoulder pad of the Senator's coat, and two additional bullets that entered Kennedy's body were all fired from the back and all produced powder residue patterns which indicated that they were all fired from a distance of only a few inches. Since RFK was walking towards Sirhan, and his body was always facing Sirhan during the shots even as he fell backwards it is impossible these shots originated from Sirhan's weapon.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I hope you're not someone who is confused by facts.

       Files claimed he was behind the fence and left a .222 bullet casing there on the fence.  The bullet casing which he said he bit and left on the fence?  It fell on the ground and was found precisely there under about 2 inches of soil in 1987 by John Rademacher, a lawn services specialist.

       I hope you're not too. Unsourced claims are not facts. Seeing as you just seem to have cut and pasted this from information verbatim one of the numerous sites that carry it but provide no citations, can you provide sources for these claims?

       I assume this is about Seth Rich.  All these people represented a political movement and were killed in part to stop that movement.  I can't imagine what the motive is in this case, even if the wikileaks thing is true, it was done, his murder prevented nothing as far as we know.

       The connections people have made about Rich have to do with content from the Clinton campaign, particularly campaign chairman John Podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       In one of his leaked emails he comments on "making an example of leakers."  In the new book "shattered" it was revealed that he and campaign manager Robby Mook devised the Russia narrative the day after the election.  If it is revealed that Seth Rich was a whistleblower who leaked the DNC emails, then that blows up the Russia narrative that the DNC has been coasting on.  Add to this the fact that Assange has not only alluded to Rich being the leaker, but that he also offered a reward for any info that could lead to Rich's killer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this theory is real, but Assange's involvement makes it seem like Rich was likely to have been the leaker.  Whether or not he was killed for this is another story.

       I want the mess of an administration in the white house sorted out first. As it actually poses a threat to our country. Especially after yesterday's embarrassing display by Erdogens men.

       Priorities. Trump isn't fit for the job, regardless of the adversity he faced on his trip to the White House, he may be guilty of a few things as well and he should be held accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I almost feel like this is astroturfing
 "I'm old so listen to me kiddos". Do you mean to say we should turn our heads to the trump administration?

       I mean that makes more sense for a motive but that would involve collusion from all of our allies, independent intelligence analysts, and our own intelligence agencies so the scale would be much bigger than the dnc.  But it's r/conspiracy so that's fine.  At least it makes sense as a motive.

       I'd say Malcolm was killed for religious/influence reasons because the Nation of Islam were sick of his shit. And George Wallace? Fuck George Wallace. He was killed by a disgruntled fellow neo-Nazi, that's justice if I've ever heard it.
      </p>

       That said, everyone you just named was a
       <em>
        major
       </em>
       figure in American politics at the time of their deaths, not completely unknown staffers who may or may not have emailed a website. They stirred a whole lot of shit at the center of the American eye before they were snuffed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also don't conflate the DNC with the US government which includes the massive end-all be-all powers of the CIA, NSA, FBI, etc. Which I'm guessing this post is about Seth Rich, and I just don't buy that fucking Nancy Pelosi and Clinton had this guy killed because of one completely unsubstantiated article by Fox News.

       Glad to see some sense of rational thinking on this sub still. This is clearly a Seth Rich dog whistle post and completely misses the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Seth Rich story is clearly a disinformation campaign to distract from the latest scandals for Trump and the GOP.  Fox news got wrapped up in it because they are as stupid as their viewerbase. The guy that first spread the story is now back peddling so fast and the family has told Fox and anyone else spreading the story to fuck off. Anyone still spreading that story is either so detached from reality or lacks a soul as they are willing to torture a family that has already suffered so much just for political points.

       Except none of those people were murdered by some covert, far-reaching conspiracy.  Their murders were not covered up or made to look like anything other than political assassinations.  Weak sauce partisan BS.

       I get people being annoyed by partisanship, but I'm always suspicious of these people saying "you need to stop seeing things as left v. right". Usually it's directed at people questioning something like Pizzagate or the Seth Rich conspiracy, but the person saying it rejects the Russia conspiracy out of hand.

       Me and my friends used to frequent this sub and talk about submissions off of reddit. Not so much any more. It's been compromised by t/d users. It's the mods fault. They started deleting submissions that didn't follow their narratives, etc until the only thing being posted was pizzagate and hillary's emails.

       The conspiracy theories surrounding trump are a gold mine along with pizza gate etc but they aren't welcome here because they don't follow the narrative.

       I would say that's incomparable. Police didn't give two shits about MLK or Malcom X and caught Oswald... the goal now (when an entity would be killing and not a random person out of passion) is not to be caught which is basically impossible

       I have absolutely no doubt that folks get murdered over information and political movements.

       I was pretty convinced that Seth Rich was murdered over politics. Still am.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that the focus on him almost a year later is nothing but calculated deflection.
      </p>
      <p>
       The claimed number of reported emails and attachments on his laptop are not proof. Those numbers have been public forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have new info on the investigation breaking multiple times a day. Real convenient that NOW people want to focus on a year old story.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also convenient that it pins the leak as internal, supposedly destroying the Russia narrative, as if it clears all the other sketchy Russia shit. Great totally natural timing, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the truth is, but it is really fucking clear that powers that be are desperately trying to drown the other's narrative out. If you aren't skeptical of both sides, you're naive.

       What makes you think he was murdered over politics? All the info that got out now has been proven false (connections to wikileaks, mysterious laptop in the FBI, etc), the police said they have evidence it was a botched robbery, but they still haven't catched the culprit, hence why the case isn't closed yet. Rich told no one he felt threatened or took any measures to protect himself. A presidential candidate (or even worse, one of the two biggest political parties in the US) having someone murdered and for no good reason (and that's assuming he was the one who leaked the DNC emails) is very unlikely to say the least, so we'd need real, crystal clear proof for this be credible but literally the only connection to Hillary/DNC we have is that he worked there. This is a genuine question btw.

       Something about a DNC staff getting shot in the back during a robbery where nothing was stolen at the same time as DNC leaks going on just makes me a bit suspicious, I guess.

       It's been a year though... We're not getting closure. I don't see a point in focusing on it. I definitely don't see a point in the witch hunt 4chan is doing.

       Well it certainly wouldn't be the first time a botched robbery ended with the attacker fleeing the scene without stealing anything for various reasons (gun being discharged by mistake/misuse, being scared of being recognized because of the noise and/or possible witnesses, not finding anything to steal immediately, being high on drugs, etc). It's also worth noting the neighborhood where he was shot had been plagued by numerous robberies at the time according to the police and they estimate he was shot at roughly 4 am, plus his watch strap was torn which indicates the attacker did try to steal his watch but gave up. Also according to his girlfriend there was a struggle before or shortly after he was shot and he was still alive when the police found him, so if that was an assassination attempt, it was executed very poorly to say the least.

       My 8-year-old grand nephew called me a few days ago to ask me to explain to him what a coincidence is.  I asked him if he had asked his grandfather (my brother) to explain it and he said that my brother tried to but couldn't.  Can you...   Nah, never mind.

       Anyone who disputes that Russia hasn't assassinated various political dissenters would be an idiot who hasn't looked at obvious patterns.

      <p>
       The same patterns of  mysterious and convenient deaths of people staged to bring the Clintons to justice are totally obvious if not flagrant.  Their political might and the stranglehold of their corrupt influence and blackmail has prevented any earnest attempt at prosecution.

       I don't think you failed to start a discussion I just think that it's a little tone deaf to assume that the famous examples you state are good ways to remind people that entrenched power holders murder people, because none of those have been proven to be that case. Obviously there is reasons to suspect that to some extent though.

       A better example would be someone like Litvinenko.

       I should have researched the topic thoroughly, I confess.  Hell, I didn't even think carefully enough about the appropriateness of the topic itself.  I was very young and very impressionable in those days.  I was naive, too.  There was something about seeing so many people being murdered just for talking about Peace and Equality.  I didn't think people should be getting killed for something as obvious as that.

       That's a very interesting turn of phrase.  You are either an English language poet or a very literate speaker of a foreign language.

       "...
       <em>
        no one should suspend their ability to accept the commonality
       </em>
       ..."  This is a highly clever logical structure.  So clever, in fact, so original, that I suspect it is an approximate transliteration of an idiomatic phrase from some other language.  Probably Russian.  Maybe even from Dostoevsky.

       If I were cynical, I would say this post was a blatant attempt to whitewash political murders committed on behalf of dictatorial regimes (like Russia) with a substance derived from a long history of political violence in a truly free Republic.

       I was born in upstate NY and have traveled the world.  I live in Oregon these days.  I appreciate your comments.  I don't read as many do but I have always made the effort to express myself to others in a way that I regard as enjoyable.  There is certainly no agenda as you have posited, but I admit readily to my deep appreciation for the value of being reflective upon and, when necessary, critical of ones own behavior and thoughts.

       What's your point? "People have been murdered for political reasons in the past, therefore

       murder must have been for political reasons"?

       Acting like only one side does it is not democratic. Chances are if the DNC did murder that guy (and that is a big IF), then the Republican party 100% murdered a bunch people themselves. At which point it just becomes politics. If it is so common that everyone does it, it no longer is a special case and no death is abnormal.

       If you find it hard to accept that people are actually murdered because crazy people kill other people all the time in your gun riddled country (without any form of conspiracy or government collusion other than an ongoing failure to properly regulate weapon ownership) I'd like to remind you that it happens so often it's barely even news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess if you're hanging out on here you take it as read the assassinations you list were all the result of well organized conspiracies among your ruling classes but most people find the line that they were the work of lone-wolf crazies perfectly plausible as, you know, your country is full of heavily armed nut jobs. Conspiracies make much more interesting stories but Occam's razor says the majority of "political" murders are the work of unstable individuals.

       I'm sure you are aware that the true meaning of Occam's Razor only refers to the simplest explanation
       <em>
        within the evidence.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you ignore witness testimony and physical evidence indicating more than one gunman in all of these instances, you're still left with an overwhelming degree of circumstantial evidence suggestive of a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my view, always deferring to the
       <em>
        "simplest explanation"
       </em>
       is a surefire way to lose the plot.

       Are you honestly saying all those people were killed as the result of a conspiracy by power brokers? This is why conspiracy theorists lose credibility. Huey Long was more likely accidentally killed by his own body guards.

       Even though all of this info is out there, it's really hard to get to the actual truth of any matter regards this topic. People who are killing others who have the ability to cover it up are not announcing their activities. No one is ever caught or convicted and if they are they are fall guys, paid to take the fall and direct all the heat away from themselves.
      </p>

       It's important not to confuse the nutcases with those motivated by politics/power/money but there is a clear pattern that points to a group of elite who don't want the party to stop and who use our own behaviour against us, controlling large swathes of the earth and it occupants for their own gain. It's in their interests to divide and rule, keep the fear going, pitting fellow man against fellow man. Whilst we are all distracted by a non stop tide of headlines and bad news, they pilfer what is rightly ours and use us as an endless supply of labour to carry out their dirty work. From basic labouring to fighting their wars. Then they bet on the outcome and double insure for safety meaning they can never lose. They created the game, they control the game, if you take them on you'll be another in a long line of dead people.

       If there's one moment that seals it for me it is Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (in the Bill Clinton administration)  declaring on National TV that she finds it completely acceptable that Bill Clinton's sanctions on Iraq during the 1990's caused the deaths of half a million Iraqi children.  These are the kind of people who run the Government of the USA.  This is why there's no peace in the world.

       For me, personally, the 60's were a tough time because I was also losing friends and classmates in Vietnam, and there were several more who died in car crashes at 2AM.  By the time I was 20 I had already learned how unfair it all was.  and now that it's 50 years after that I treasure my own longevity and health with a great deal of appreciation.

       I take solace in the fact that these days there is far less ability to cover up these attempts.  I am not naive to believe that we can completely stop it, but with as many eyes and cameras out there it sure is tougher.

       The strangest thing about Malcolm X is that he was fine when he thought white people were evil. Once he came back from Mecca and started preaching togetherness, he was dealt with swiftly.

       Nobody knows the answer to that.  RFK had just won the Democratic Primary votes from California and was likely to be the Democratic candidate running against Richard Nixon, the Republican candidate.  Nobody thinks Nixon was involved.

       I once knew a guy who killed for money.  He had ice water where he should have had blood.  He told that sometimes he had to shoot people in the back if they thought they could stay alive by running away.  He didn't like having to do that, he said.  His brother was the chief of police in Portsmouth, Virginia.  I'm 68 and I could keep everyone up all night for 6 months with stories about the things I've seen.

       It's not that it's hard to believe . I'm just not going to believe it when there is no actual facts that point to it . When the "facts" that people do present to make the case are always between blatantly false, easily disproven , or obviously made up to fit the agenda , thats when I call bullshit.  You should never have to make up false information to be able to support anything . If so , then something is really wrong .

       The other side of that coin is: some people find it hard to accept that sometimes bad things happen because of an individual's shitty decision, and that every death isn't the result of a vast conspiratorial web of puppet masters tugging on delicate threads to kill someone. I have no doubt that politically-motivated assassinations happen. But I think some people have trouble accepting that life is so random. It's scary. Much easier to tell yourself that 'guns don't kill people; the Clintons do.'

       Now with that out of the way, I'll just say this: I despise the U.S government. While I'm positive much of this is true I don't like talking about stuff like this because it depresses me and makes me want to end my life (go figure). So, you guys do you, I'll do me, and I might be able to survive at least a few more years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I have this sort of "fuck it" mentality. I believe myself to be incapable of doing much to change anything so instead I just do what keeps me happy and going.

       No. Even if you accept the extremely dubious notion that they were killed by the
       <em>
        "lone nuts"
       </em>
       identified by the state, the sheer degree of circumstantial evidence indicating a conspiracy is overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was Oswald seen by
       <em>
        multiple witnesses
       </em>
       in New Orleans and Clinton, Louisiana with CIA assets David Ferrie and Clay Shaw, who both denied (the latter under oath) they ever met him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why, on December 8, 1999, did a civil jury in Memphis conclude, based on the testimony of
       <em>
        multiple
       </em>
       witnesses and the taped confession of one of the conspirators, that there had been a conspiracy to kill Dr. King?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was police security systematically removed from the event where Malcom X spoke despite warnings of a planned attack on him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did the medical examiner conclude that RFK had been killed by a point-blank shot from behind when Sirhan was several feet in front of him? Why were there fourteen bullets found in the pantry when Sirhan only fired 8 shots? Why was he seen shortly before the shooting in the company of a woman who was later seen giddily shouting
       <em>
        "We did it! We shot him!"
       </em>
       and why did the LAPD attempt to coerce the witness who attested to this into changing her story?

       Not even the people who disagree with me would deny those facts. They'd simply try to discredit them by attacking the credibility of the witnesses, the civil judgment or making tortured rationalizations for the litany of holes in the official narrative of what transpired at the Ambassador Hotel.

       You're the first (and only) person to deny (without evidence) that these undisputed facts are true. Is it frustrating?

       The following is a description of the civil trial verdict, published in the New York Times on 12-10-1999:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The jury in Memphis declared Mr. Jowers liable in Dr. King's death for having purportedly hired a now-dead Memphis police officer, as part of a vast conspiracy, to kill Dr. King. It also found that unnamed others, including government agencies, had been involved, in effect accepting the plaintiffs' contention that James Earl Ray was innocent, despite his guilty plea.

       This is what I don't get about the deep state talk.  Big /s here but
      </p>
      <p>
       JFK was a democratic president assassinated and replaced by a conservative DINO.
      </p>
      <p>
       His brother ran for president and was assassinated before he would've inevitably been the popular candidate for the left and possibly unified the country in a troubled time.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 secured George W. Bush perhaps the largest amount of political capital in American history.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a deep state it's either playing both sides extremely dirty or just not on the side you guys think it is.

       These names are just the tip of the iceberg.  Most people who are killed are not publicly well known -- or long forgotten.  Most recently, I am still haunted by the murder of Philip Marshall AND his kids.  Or how about the guy who accused Ted Cruz
       <code>
        s father of being in the CIA with Oswald.  Really, this crap is ubiquitous.  They get away with it, and are emoldened further.  People need to take these mysterious deaths more seriously.  The key is to start taking accusations of assassination seriously and not dismissing them as

       conspiracy`theories.  When circumstances are mysterious and puzzling, I would bet that 9 out of 10 incidents are deliberate assassinations. It goes on all the time.

       Socialists, whistleblowers, people resisting corruption and getting in the way of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just how people get and hold power. They need to gather support, recruit followers, convert opponents, and remove obstacles they can't convince to move. If you can't get around them, they need to be ignored by the masses, silenced, or removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to convince oneself that we are somehow above that is absurd. No matter who is in charge, there will be obstacles, and some of those won't be solved without dismantling them. Occasionally a human obstacle will be too stubborn to coerce.

       Some guy walked into my neighborhood convenience store on Mother's Day with his mother's decapitated head.  Yeah, murder is not such a rare thing.  Chicago averages about 2 1/2 murders every day, ferchrissakes.

       does any sane adult really think that people have not been murdered for political or financial reasons? America or pie has nothing to do with either, it's universal through history, civilizations and diets.

       I am in no position to revoke said license. I just think that from choice of big countries Russia has so many examples that over there it almost seems accepted common knowledge that people kill and get killed for top positions.

       I didn't realize Bobby announced the assassination of MLK at an event until I just watched a documentary. Can you imagine, after his brother and then MLK, the fear he must have carried? My aunt spoke to Bobby and Sirhan the night of his death, and my mom was home watching it LIVE. I can't imagine.

      <p>
       I mean, I sometimes think about bombs in public and at political rallies, it kinda pops up a little (more mistrust of police or a riot, than of a lonegun man), but I can't imagine all the assassinations, Kent State and even the Buddhist monks, what that was like on TV back then. No movie or show was as violent as reality.

       I can easily see that take on it by someone who frames US history and, especially, politics in a left/right liberal/fundamentalist framework.  To the extent that this makes any sense at all, so too does that person's viewpoint.

       Won't deny he got things done, albeit half-assed (in their quality and origin of payment , but it was better than what existed) but the did them in ways that would provoke actions.

      </p>
      <p>
       He grew up poor in relative to his time period and environment, kind of had a "off and on again" relationship in the private sector but campaigned in politics for the little guy against the State Establishment, albeit using less than reputable means like they all do,(I myself would have rather enjoyed his verbal and non-verbal attacks on his opponents).
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a politician; one that was so good that LBJ looked up at him.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes me question his morality is his attacks against the occupations of non-political members when trying to gain the upper hand over others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or his interactions with the University and the people within the University of which he held a fondness for.

       Well, JFK, anti communist,  was killed by a communist.  MLK was killed by a racist.  MX was killed by political rivals, allegedly, and RFK, who supported Israel, was killed by an Arab terrorist.

       No, when I was a kid, in the 50's &amp; 60's, we only knew what the TV, magazines and newspapers told us.  Our parents and grandparents basically trusted the government, but they also were aware of the way that the government protected corporations from the unions.  The 'great awakening' actually started with the folk musicians and rock musicians.

       Yes, Ruppert would be on my list. He is one of several "suicides" where his so-called partner was rolled out and used a prop to quell any suspicion that he might have been murdered. The same happened with Michael Hasting's wife, and Aaron Swartz's mysterious girlfriend.
      </p>

       A few other "mysterious but convenient deaths" which were recorded as suicide or natural causes would be:

        Phillip Marshall - 9/11 whistleblower (suicided himself, his kids and his dog).

       If there's one moment that seals it for me it is Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (in the Bill Clinton administration)  declaring on National TV that she finds it completely acceptable that Bill Clinton's sanctions on Iraq during the 1990's caused the deaths of half a million Iraqi children.  These are the kind of people who run the Government of the USA.  This is why there's no peace in the world.

I'll try to find some time to dig into it for you.  If you don't want to wait for me you might be able to find out the answer for yourself.

       I always got the impression that MLK would get discredited as a black apologist if he were alive today. Like Bill Cosby minus the raping. The Boondocks did a show about it and I could totally see it going down the way they tell it if MLK didn't die, but was instead put into a coma from the assassination and woke up today.

       They seem to have education figured out. The US could have modeled their system, but chose to make up some new pile of crap, with committees of unqualified goons, sending us down the education toilet.
       <br/>
       The US could have modeled any decent national system, or modeled any decent upper class private system, but went for experimental whims, based around committees of morons, and lots of microsoft profit.
       <br/>
       Watch as American kids learn to have more feelings, and world citizenship programming, when we could have easily modeled a successful system.

       I've got over 30,000 views , 700 comments and 200 people who want a comment from me.  Plus, I've got to get the lawns mowed, help the wife shop and get ready for my grandchildren to arrive.  I may not have time to get into that right away.

       <em>
        strongly suggests

       otherwise.
