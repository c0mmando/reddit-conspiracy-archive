       I've wondered if the seemingly upward trend in human gender confusion is somehow linked to this as well.  I've heard that they can't filter birth control and other pharmaceuticals out of water.  And then there's the hormone filled milk and meat, and chemical laden vegetables.  Seems like everything is rotting from the inside out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans "physical sex" and "brain gender" are set at different times.  Sex is obviously a genetic thing, but brain gender comes about partially from a flood of hormones from the mother's body.

       It 100% is. This post talks about just two of literally hundreds of endocrine disruptors that were bathed in daily. These chemicals are literally chemically castrating people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Testosterone is dropping across the board every generation as the number and prevalence of these chemicals increases. Hormones are what literally make you who you are. If you stop producing testosterone you're going to gain weight, shed muscle, and become miserable. This then creates a massive imbalance where your estrogen is too high, now you become feminine, and emotional.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is elementary biology. And I'm willing to bet in the vast majority of cases where a man suddenly feels like a woman, lack of testosterone is the culprit and everytime I say it I'm down voted into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example there was a perfectly normal 30 year old man who for some reason stopped producing testosterone entirely. All the changes I listed occurred, but also, suddenly he started feeling like a woman trapped in a man's body for the first time in 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now people, what's the 2+2 common sense solution here? How about replacing the testosterone!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       No, it's 2017 and we're fucking retarded. They started giving him massive doses of estrogen to encourage a transition. Like what. The. Fuck??? How does anyone see that as the logical solution??

       If you're deficient or in these extreme cases I mentioned where you're not producing virtually any - you get hormone replacement therapy. It's not 'juicing'.

       I know exactly what you meant. Any hormone a person takes is a "steroid", birth control is a steroid. If you're young and healthy, there are ways to pretty significantly increase hormones endogenously, such as diet, supplements, training, or even things like sauna use.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're old, or have some issue causing your body to be unable to produce a hormone the only option is hormone replacement therapy. Where a doctor prescribes and administers doses of that hormone to return you to healthy levels. There are myriad of health problems that come with low hormone levels, even in men estrogen is critical but only in smaller well balanced amounts. And the opposite is true for women, women need low levels of testosterone for health and well being.
