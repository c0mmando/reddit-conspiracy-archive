       Exactly. He went to an American booking agency. Booked a speech in Russia. Got paid and went to work for the federal government. The practice is corrupt as fuck, but prevalent throughout Washington.

       Yes he shouldn't have lied. I honestly just assume every politician takes money or else they wouldn't have been allowed to get that far. But a lot of odd things with this case. I'm starting to think trump is being set up. And I didn't vote for him.

       Flynn was running the Flynn intel group, a company that trades in intelligence and security consulting. He had foreign clients at the time, including Turkey, and a conflict of interest. He shouldn't have Even there to begin with. Is this impeachable? Heck, Obama didn't get impeached and neither did bush, so no way, but it is shady as heck that Flynn made it that far.

       Podesta even said in his emails that the DNC needed to come up with a story about Putin and trump to try to delegitimize the election. If you believe the Russian narrative, or that SETH RICH wasn't murdered by the DNC, that they aren't pedophiles, that The Deep State isn't real, and Soros isn't manipulating the left daily, then YOU ARENT PAYING ATTENTION.

       And you know what, shitbag? You are losing. The people that you are following are losing. People want culture, not globalization, you are losing and us patriots are winning. So no matter what half ass, retarded comeback you throw at me, the fact remains that YOU ARE LOSING AND THE DNC IS FALLING APART. The blind (you) will be lead by the awake (me). You are just a sheep, a rat, and a traitor. Nothing you could ever say to me is lower than what you are. Fucking rat.

       I'm sure that patriots won't let this country be over taken by communists without a fight. I'm sure that Clinton is a criminal. I'm sure that the left are nothing more than useful idiots. I'm not Trump, I can't say what he will or won't do, but I know what I would do in his shoes, and that's all I got. I certainly wouldn't let myself be completely brainwashed like the left has become with their relentless backing of main stream media and the DNC as a whole without asking themselves what they themselves think.

       As per usual, it's the usual fallacious reasoning in assuming the government has such an absolutely mind boggling conspiracy running afoot yet somehow manages to do so without any leaks while the President himself just blabs classified information to the Russians.

       But I will reach out! You can end this cognitive dissonance once and for all and just admit Trump is a fuck up! It's so easy! All your pain and fears and dread will be gone the instant you come to terms with reality and drop Trump! Give in!
