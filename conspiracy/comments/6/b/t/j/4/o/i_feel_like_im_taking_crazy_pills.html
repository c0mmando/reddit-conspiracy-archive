    <div class="md"><p>The vaccine issue is about ensuring a safe and quality product from a corrupt industry virtually immune from the consequences of its actions. It&#39;s not that most of them don&#39;t want any vaccines, they are concerned about their safety and want better oversight for big pharmaceutical companies. </p>

<p>As far as the flat earth thing. It&#39;s a troll theory meant to feed other trolls so it should be banned from the sub and never discussed again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the vaccine thing goes, people should have ultimate authority over what goes into their bodies. It&#39;s a sticky situation because I realize how dangerous it can be with certain diseases and the need for preventing them from spreading to others, but the Science argument only gets you passed the Jenny McCarthy housewive anti-vax fad. You might consider that:</p>

<p>A) although something may <em>appear</em> to be medically safe, the tests are not definitive or 100% guaranteed safe and the long-term effects are difficult or impossible to predict. If someone is more afraid of autism than a potentially life-threatening disease, they should reserve the right to choose for themselves.<br/>
B) At some level we are trusting that the contents of whatever vax we&#39;re given is what they say it is. Corporate Cost-cutting, marketing of unnecessary or ineffective medicines, under reporting of adverse side effects, even simple human error. It&#39;s reasonable to believe these situations are quite rare, but they should be acceptable factors in someone&#39;s personal risk equation. 
C) MNC&#39;s (less) and governments (more) cannot be expected to restrain themselves from using vaccines to achieve some desired result unknown to the recipient--past, present, or future. It doesn&#39;t always have to be an elaborate mind-control plot, the objectives could be much simpler but equally as dangerous on the larger scale. If we even start to lean toward mandating a certain vaccine schedule, which is already growing continuously, it&#39;s plausible that a gov or corp might introduce something that serves their own purposes. Just because the measles vaccine is legit, doesn&#39;t mean every other vaccine is automatically safe. You shouldn&#39;t have to coerce someone to vaccinate if it&#39;s genuinely in their own best interest, you should have to <em>convince</em> them. </p>

<p>To me, this anti-vax label is the same song and dance they&#39;ve done with climate change, the holocaust, and conspiracy theorists in general. Anyone who slightly disagrees or critically questions the official accepted narrative is bunched in with the extremists and ridiculed for this wrongly assumed association. </p>

<p>For example-- if you agree that the climate is changing, agree that human activity is a significant contributing factor, agree that pollution is bad and that a cleaner energy system is more desirable than the status quo, BUT you disagree that humans are the singular or predominant driving force, or disagree that these trends can be reversed through policy reform and increasing regulation, or disagree that &quot;climate-friendly&quot; industry is preferred at any cost. Congratulations, you are a Climate Change DENIER. </p>

<p>If you agree that the jews were systematically persecuted in WW2 and were subjected to unspeakable atrocities, but you disagree and think the number of those killed was ANY number less than 6 million-- Yep, you are now a Holocaust DENIER. </p>

<p>It&#39;s intentional, it&#39;s fucked up, and it absolutely works. Same way Flat-Earthers are used to shape public image of all conspiracy theorists, someone who is cautious of any foreign agents entering their body are represented by the Jenny McCarthy Club for Choosing Measles Over an Autistic Son. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mastered in biochem with a minor in physics at MSU.. I studied for 5 years postgrad. Yes, I can link peer reviewed studies relating to Flouride and Vaccines when I get home in a few hours tho for some reason I doubt anything I send you would convince you. I work in a genealogy lab right now so yes, you could call me a scientist. What are your credentials?</p>

<p>Still, any information that is trying to be killed off and silenced should make us suspicious. Seth Rich stuff is relevant. Regardless of any opinion of /pol you might have, it was shutdown last night for 6-8 hours after they were investigating. The owner of the bar Seth Rich was last seen alive, visited the Oval Office for 12 hrs, 4 days before Seth was killed. </p>

<p>But once he brought up flouride, it was obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vaccine conspiracy is real. The question is not whether the principles of immunization or vaccination work or not. They do work. The questions are rather, are the vaccines safe? They&#39;re not. Whose making all the taxpayer money with them? Giant pharma corporations. What else are they putting in these vaccines? Possibly dormant viruses to be triggered by certain catalysts.</p>

<p>Flat earth is one of many psychological operations (probably pushed by intelligence agencies) that attempt to discredit places like this that offer real discussion and dissent. After all, who would believe information from a place where users believe the earth is flat?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Anti-vaxx&quot; is a concept the media loves to misrepresent. 99% of &quot;anti-vaccers&quot; aren&#39;t against vaccines. Some oppose <em>some</em> vaccines, such as ineffective flu shots, but the main concern are vaccine additives that are known toxins and neurotoxins.</p></li>
<li><p>Sodium fluoride has a very interesting history, which you can look into for yourself if you&#39;re curious. But it doesn&#39;t take a shill to believe that calcification of our pineal gland is undesirable - something that we know fluoride does.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>As I see it, there are different layers of conspiracies. The ground level ones have more concrete evidence, like 911 or JFK.</p>

<p>But the farther &quot;out&quot; you go, the harder it is to prove and one has to rely more on anecdotes and even straight-up gut instinct: this includes conspiracies like aliens, astral projection, etc. </p>

<p>People posting here come from all levels of the spectrum. Some believe just the lower-level &quot;provable&quot; stuff while others believe that aliens are battling for human liberation. </p>

<p>I frankly don&#39;t care what people choose to believe. I care about maintaining honesty, integrity, and civility in discussions. Especially because the conspiracy you adamantly believe is wrong today may actually turn out true a year from now. So, keep an open mind and let&#39;s be good to one another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was the same as you a couple years ago. And I am still mostly with a couple considerations. </p>

<p>I think there are some extremely unsafe vaccines, enough that I will at least discuss acquiring the most safe formulations with my doctor should the need arise. But the whole antivaxxer movement is a little over the top.</p>

<p>I was an environmental chemist for 20 years, primarily in drinking and waste water. So, I don&#39;t think fluoride is bad per se. However, I find it highly suspicious that the big push for fluoridation came around the same time some industry had a huge fluoride waste disposal problem. I forget the specifics. If you&#39;re really curious google it up.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m 100% with you on flat earth. I am also a moon landing heretic, I think we actually went there. Please don&#39;t let my mom find out.</p>

<p>But seriously, disregarding 90% of the shit around here as a paranoid fantasy, the 10% you are left with is still totally unconscionable. I&#39;m up to about 30% that I believe, and another 50% I wouldn&#39;t put past the fuckers. Bad people do bad things, and they make a ton of money doing it. Our world is run by gifted psychopaths.</p>
