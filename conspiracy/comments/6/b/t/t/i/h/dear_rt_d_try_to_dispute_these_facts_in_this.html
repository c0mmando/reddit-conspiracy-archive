    <div class="md"><p>Sure there are also common enemies but often US/Russia pick different horses in other conflicts to wage proxy battles.  I wouldn&#39;t call current relations &quot;good&quot; Putin himself said relations right now are about as bad as they were during the cold war. Now whether that is a telegraphed comment to cover collusion or something he truthfully means remains to be seen but it either means US-Russia relations are not good or the US government is under Russian influence, both are not great for the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there was the cold war. But yeah, both side were ready to end the other during that time. Who does Russia want to be friends with? Is it just the U.S.? What about our European allies? The Europeans seem to be very concerned about NATO and Russia. By the way, I do agree with Trump that the Europeans should be paying their fair share and not relying on the U.S. tax payer all the time.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Russia is a threat to us currently but Russia does want to be the world super power they were as the Soviet Union. Why would they want to be good friends with the other super power? Wouldn&#39;t they rather see that power be diminished by any means?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this really detailed timeline. I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Still don&#39;t buy it. </p>

<p>At the end of the day it boils down to the political establishment wanting to pick off anybody they feel will not be amenable to their/the deep state&#39;s agenda. Flynn was an obvious threat, and I said as much long before he was expelled from team Trump. Lying--under-oath-POS-Clapper, for example, hated the guy. </p>

<p>I also find it funny that the worst Flynn&#39;s done is accept money from a TV network (blanket-branded as &quot;Russia&quot;) and was a paid lobbyist for Turkey. </p>

<p>Tell me... if Podesta was appointed as Sec of State, as was likely intended... how much money do you think he&#39;d have accepted from foreign governments? </p>

<p>Actually, I can tell you--he scrounged up money from the Libyan Asset fund (ie, money looted from Libya post-conflict), from Albania and head of the KLA (known trafficker, btw), from Saudi Arabia...How about the fact that <em>he</em> didn&#39;t disclose the fact he didn&#39;t offload Joule funds as assured, but sent it to his daughter instead?  </p>

<p>But I&#39;m supposed to think Flynn&#39;s a bad guy. </p>

<p>Yeah, no. And this is just one of the many rogues in DC. They&#39;re all the same, on both sides of the aisle. But you&#39;re not going to whip me into a frenzy over how terrible Michael Flynn is based on everything you just outlined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so let&#39;s look at what we have on Trump: </p>

<p>1) He shitcanned Flynn.</p>

<p>2) Now, a memo <em>from Comey</em> comes out alleging Trump asked for the FBI to &quot;go easy&quot; on him. Or something. A) who trusts Comey&#39;s judgment at this point? B) Where&#39;s the evidence? We need more than this &quot;he said she said.&quot;</p>

<p>And also, there is no generic &quot;Fuck Podesta&quot; when he represent the interests of the shadow creatures running Washington (and our media). I hate BOTH sides of the R&#39;s and the D&#39;s, to be clear. But I think one is mildly hypocritical if they&#39;re clutching pearls at what Trump is doing if there&#39;s no greater introspection into the cesspool of DC, who&#39;s running it, and their overall motive of giving Trump the boot. </p>

And when I line up Flynn&#39;s alleged sins, they pale in comparison to what&#39;s a normal day in DC. Were Flynn&#39;s actions wrong? Sure, maybe.

<p>Maybe, but I believe that they are more afraid of losing the people that are Trump core supporters as we saw during the election.

<p>I agree with this. Honestly there could be photos of Trump giving Putin a handjob and most of T_D would still stand by him, and these are the people that Republicans hope to vote for them in the coming midterm elections. You&#39;re also right there is a certain turning point that some in the house/senate will not be able to ignore. Those in &quot;safe&quot; districts will always play it safe I think.</p>
