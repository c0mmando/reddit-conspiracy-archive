        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump has super disappointed me.  It seems like the accusations of him not being very well-read or intellectual, not being up to the task, not keeping his word, being a Zionist and warmonger - that&#39;s all true.</p>

<p>But he&#39;s no Hillary!</p>

<p>And this Seth Rich stuff is breaking open.  It will prove the DNC not only fixed elections, cheated and lied, but that they kill in order to fix elections, cheat and lie.  </p>

<p>It will prove that the Russian story, if not fake, has major major components that ARE fake, and that the media will be outed as the rumor-mongering fake news opposition party that they are.</p>

<p>It will prove that the DC FUCKING POLICE AND FBI have moles and agents willing to cover up MURDER for the Clinton/Obama team.</p>

<p>It will prove that Obama inserted traitors into the bureaucracy who aren&#39;t loyal to the American constitution, but to their political masters.</p>

<p>Many people will go to jail over just this.</p>

<p>But then the voter fraud stuff happens.  Then the Hillary server case reopens.  Then the Benghazi/Syria/Arab Spring narrative is reevaluated.</p>

<p>Shit is unraveling.</p>

<p>So the bad guys are rolling out their Hail Mary this week: impeach, 27th amendment, and so forth.</p>

<p>Trump may yet get assassinated by these fucker.  Choke on a pretzel or something.  God help him.</p>

<p>I do believe many of the insulting things we hear about Trump are just fake news media hype.  I believe that although he&#39;s not <em>that</em> smart, he&#39;s smarter than the media says.  I believe he&#39;s totally embattled, and would likely keep more of his campaign promises otherwise.  And I believe he&#39;s probably pretty strong willed.</p>

<p>We have hope just maybe.  But even is Trump is a dickwad we have to rally now.  He&#39;s the flag, the football, maybe not the captain.  Assange, Kim.com, this is the tug of war rope we gotta hold on to.</p>

<p>Aw man what a ride.</p>

<p>CIA shuts down the economy by not selling drugs, Soros pays his minions to burn the cities, and everything goes to hell. Trump needs to figure out ways to unite the whole country around real, systemic reform, and he&#39;s surrounded by idiots and traitors.</p>

<p>Now, FDR&#39;s decisions were not all good. But he did a lot of good things, like the TVA. And he was trying to dismantle the British Empire when he died, possibly assassinated.</p>

<p>&quot;Antonio Maria Costa, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, said he has seen evidence that the proceeds of organised crime were &quot;the only liquid investment capital&quot; available to some banks on the brink of collapse last year. He said that a majority of the $352bn (£216bn) of drugs profits was absorbed into the economic system as a result.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I look at it is there are a handful of &#39;huge domestic scandals&#39; going on right now, a couple for each side of the aisle to be occupied with. The endless Russia stuff on the left, now the &quot;Comey Leaks&quot; will keep people baited for months. On the right you have Seth Rich and the never ending (or never started) Weiner laptop / FBI handing out Immunity like candy and allowing laptops/phones to be destroyed, DNC etc. Nothing has really moved forward in months, just a shitload of big headlines. People were calling for his impeachment before he was even sworn in. All they have to do is catch him in a lie like the last impeached President (Bill Clinton) so it is a possibility. </p>

<p>Meanwhile no one is paying attention to shit going on overseas. 100Billion arms deal signed with Saudi. That guarantees a continued war in Yemen (and Syria) more bombing, US/Saud imposed naval blockade on the country, Sanctions, 20mil people are slowly being starved out, Cholera outbreak in the last week or two. Not a peep from any MSM / UN. Almost like they are ignoring what used to be called Illegal wars of Aggression / genocide of the Houthis. </p>

<p>US and UK Special forces led a few hundred armored vehicles  and a couple thousand militants up near Der ez-Zor in the last couple days sneaking across the Jordanian border. Haven&#39;t seen that headline anywhere on the MSM.  We have special forces getting killed in Somalia (fighting the bogeyman ISIS lols) Shit going down in Southern Sudan no one is talking about, again ISIS blamed - funny they are always wherever the US wants regime change...</p>

<p>UK Parliament is in recess for another 3 weeks or so... if something really big happens in the Mid East there will be no debate in Parliament for getting involved (and congress hasn&#39;t declared war since the 1940s so the US will be on board) A coalition gets put together and no one notices because of the shitty cocktail of domestic partisan politics is occupying their shortsightedness. 
Also in the talks right now with Trumples in the Mid East trying to set up a &#39;Middle East NATO&#39;. Seems to me more people should be paying attention to that than the constant russia/impeachment narrative. If it happens then so be it. Why not focus on something that matters for a change- like your tax dollars murdering people in the middle east that no one on this forums board seems to give a fuck about anymore since realityshow President took office.</p>

I believe that although he&#39;s not that smart, he&#39;s smarter than the media says. I believe he&#39;s totally embattled, and would likely keep more of his campaign promises otherwise. And I believe he&#39;s probably pretty strong willed.&quot; Exactly what I have been thinking...He is surrounded by Clinton/Obama lackeys. Once he can break free of all this BS maybe we can see some real change. Wouldn&#39;t hurt if high lvl people went to jail for their crimes against this Nation.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got to take into account the fact that Trump is a big businessman before anything. He was raised by a big businessman. He grew up a big business man. While he might not know exactly how to run a country (who does?) he does know how to run a business and that there is a mission all of its own. He&#39;s by no means a dumb man. He might be brash and a bunch of other adjectives one might use in an insulting mannor. But stupid is something he&#39;s not. You don&#39;t get where he is today by being stupid. You don&#39;t get where he is by being lucky. While some might retort by saying he was born into, which is true his family circumstances would be a major factor where he is today, I think people disregard the fact even the race for Presidentcy is a brutal shit fight through the conniving ranks of power hungry people, who lie, cheat and backstab as part of daily life. You don&#39;t come out on top of that fuckery by being stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, I think he is far less intelligent than even the media leads on and his success is thanks to being born into a rich family with connections to the right people that guided him through purchasing and managing investment properties starting decades ago during the post war economic boom. That, in combination with his celebrity status due to his brash personality and need to be in the public eye made a very valuable brand which escalated his business prospects even further. But, he has lived a very sheltered life surrounded by yes-men and wealth and hasnt ever needed to learn things for himself. The idea that the media is trying to paint him as a russian double agent or something is hilarious to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt his family and upbringing helped with where he is today, but that&#39;d be a somewhat selling him short. Sycophantic yes men, everyone knows are bad for business. I know it (and what do I know?), all CEO&#39;s know it and all good leaders know it. You need to know bad news so you can plan and act accordingly. Churchill even went as far to hire &quot;no men&quot;, men who told him nothing but bad news. He&#39;d also have to learn things for himself everyone does, you think he&#39;d have his father hold his hand through all his wheelings and dealings throughout his life?</p>

Notice his bankruptcies, his difficulties getting financed in the US, the mystery surrounding his actual net worth. Nothing suggests he could have built his empire from scratch, so why pretend?

<p>The fact that he is popular says nothing about his intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really care about Trump. Or who the US president is. </p>

<p>The problem that I guess I have is how this has gone down. 
Before a week had passed by the DNC&#39;s finest pundits came together and wanted Trump impeached.  Maher stated it. Michael Moore stated it. 
They didn&#39;t really care about the <em>how or the why</em>.</p>

<p>They pressed for an independent investigator, which to anyone familiar with politics is a death sentence.  Regardless of impeachment the process is so terrifyingly slow. </p>

<p>Independent Investigations basically mean that they will find something on you.  They do not stop until they find anything. And since no one is perfect , they will find something to nail you with. </p>

<p>Impeachment hearings can take 20-30 months of office away from any real work being done.  </p>

<p>I feel for the American people to some regard.  The media got them to fear Russia without saying a single word as to what the Russians want. All of this comes at the DNC trying to earn senate and congress seats and hopefully the presidency in 2020. </p>

<p>Even worse the United States has a president who I would classify as &quot;independent&quot; and with that we see how the media will go into nuclear mode of lying to no end to make sure that a non-establishment leader will not be in office for very long. Even if that person is a asshole who doesn&#39;t know what they are talking about.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sick of hearing about these supposed pedo rings when the vast majority of children abused is by people they know. If vast numbers of missing children existed, maybe there&#39;d be a point, but there is no evidence.</p>

<p>I hate pedophiles because I was a victim, and it was by people I knew and trusted. It&#39;s sickening that you use child victims as a pawn to push your anti-Hillary agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to hear that, I&#39;ve been there too and the mother of my child has been as well. Thanks for calling out someone who although is probably well meaning, is being blinded by sensationalism and bias. It discredits the movement and just helps these criminals get away with their crimes. Assuming it all revolves around pedophilia. I believe a large chunk of the dirt is more about organ harvesting and the lucrative market it is. I mean when your dying you will pay <strong>anything</strong> to stay alive longer. As well as general human trafficking being very lucrative on it&#39;s own not even talking about children in the mix. Aka Dyncorp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look supporting Pizzagate and all that it stands for is great. But not having your facts straight and pulling out weak evidence like Obama having a boner on camera is just embarassing us. And I usually hate to hear that type of argument used against any supporter. But if we want these people to come to justice we have to operate with cold hard facts that can be used in a court of law. Not just speculation on the weaker parts of evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think you meant 25th amendment and Trump being declared &quot;unfit&quot; to carry out his duties.  It was meant to be in the case of a President being legitimately incapacitated for real , not just because he is so hated by the rotting corpse of the corrupt system that literally refuses to accept reform in the name of the good of the republic. </p>

<p>Im sorry people, but you need to see the sad truth.  The US government is no longer for, by, and of the people. It probably hasnt been for a very long time, decades any way.  The Federal government is a festering cesspool that literally hates the average american and, like an entity unto itself, lives to prey on the public, enacts self-preservation and status quo security measures, and has no reservations about this whatsoever.</p>

<p>It really <strong>IS</strong> a swamp. And it consists of nearly the entire federal system, many tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of member employees.  They do not want to see their way of life altered ONE IOTA. they want MORE power, HIGHER taxes, TOTAL control.  They will stop at nothing. And ONE MAN, even a DJT, cannot come close to even making their path shift an inch.  I fear literally for his safety. Either that or a false flag to provoke a war. I find both possibilities to be very plausible, because the media &amp; propaganda war is a joke, they have lost that front, fewer and fewer people believe the VERY FAKE news every day.  Their options are shrinking, and people are awakening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the impeachment push is coming <em>because a sitting US president has committed crimes against the state.</em> You don&#39;t know about it because of a massive propaganda push to use the ridiculous Seth Rich conspiracy theory to distract from it. Seriously, yesterday, when by all accounts the Trump situation is approaching Watergate proportions, this sureddit was suddenly <em>filled</em> with Seth Rich articles, all saying the same thing, all with zero hard evidence to prove it.</p>

<p>The kicker? The supposed &quot;smoking gun&quot; (someone told someone else something about it, but guess what no proof! shocker!) came out about an hour after the latest Trump news broke. What does that tell you? </p>

<p>Not just this one, but <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> and <a href="/r/Libertarian">/r/Libertarian</a> and various other conservative-leaning subreddits. Whoever is spamming the Seth Rich articles didn&#39;t even bother with subreddits that weren&#39;t likely to run with the story. So it isn&#39;t about &#39;getting the information out there&#39; it&#39;s about trying to reassure Trump&#39;s base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the only way you can be impeached is if you have commited high crimes and misdemeanors while in office. a sitting president cannot be convicted of crimes committed before he took office. those crimes can only be adjudicated after he leaves office assuming the statute of limitations has not run out.</p>

<p>the russia thing, true or false, occurred before jan 20th, ergo not impeachable. the firing of james comey was not illegal unless it can be proved it was an attempt to obustruct justice. what took down nixon was not his actions but the tapes where he confesses his intent to obstruct justice. </p>

<p>i haven&#39;t followed this closely since january, because i&#39;ve had enough with this dog and pony show and want to live my life in peace, but i thought i heard that the request to stop investigating was asked back in dec and was about flynn. if so, it&#39;s before trump was sworn into oiffice and is unimpeacheachable. </p>

<p>even if it was after jan 20, the delay in between the request and the termination, and the stated cause being comey&#39;s handling of the clinton investigation that was already called a terminable cause by those calling for trump&#39;s impeachment now, is probative evidence the termination was reasonable and justified.</p>

<p>comey&#39;s internal memos documenting the request are not admissable, unless comey has letters directly from trump threatening him with termination unless he stops the investigation or has tapes where trump says this. the memos are out of court statements asserting the truth of thereof--i.e. hearsay. the confessisions by trump, if they exist, get in due to the hearsay exception of confession.</p>

<p>comey knows this that is why he wants to grandstand before congress. its character impeachment, which is ridiculous at this time because everyone is pretty much in agreement that trump is a crude, ill-mannered, tactless asshole, who shoots his mouth off without thinking...but that&#39;s not a high crime or misdemeanor, it&#39;s just embarrassing.</p>

She&#39;s been running the show the whole time and it using it to grind the conservatives to dust.  You just watch how it all plays out, and you&#39;ll find all this lame back and forth while the big T goes and commits <em>capital</em> T and the whole house of cards come crashing down and Hillary rises to the top.
