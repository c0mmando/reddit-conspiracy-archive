       Think of everything you know about the CIA drug trade. Substitute "drugs" with "humans" and you can learn exactly how they do it, and why they do it, and the sheer scope of it. Their playbooks are nearly identical.

       No. The CIA's drug dealing effects

       Yes, that is the beating heart of the evil. Remember,

       They often print cash and vacuum it back off the street by selling drugs. Same as the British with their opium smuggling.

       I have been trying to get info out for several years and nothing has happened yet. The problem is no one has any reason to believe me. If I was higher level I might be killed or who knows what.

       This is all pretty much info that is already out there but no one has put the pieces of the puzzle together just right. It is speculative on my part but i feel I have really hit on some things here. I knew all the pizzagate stuff was real several years ago based on related discoveries.

       “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

       People are missing the fact that trump is apart of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the financial board he set up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steven feinburg is his top economic advisor. The owner of Dyncorp. The famous international Brownstone operations group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at trumps dealings. He was best friends with his helicopter pilot, back in the day. The guy ended up running the US' largest cocaine dealing operation to date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at trumps modeling agency. He is known to run the girls illegally. His wife was one of his illegal girls. A girl here illegally is the first step to pimping that same girl out. Remember there is no record of her and she is completely reliant on the agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has ties to the Clintons and Epstein.

       Kind of. He's been in with these people for years, but I haven't seen any evidence he's fucking kids. He at least has a lot of leeway to operate on that front.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize how few options he even had for his cabinet? He tried to pick Flynn as his VP and they wouldn't let him, they've pushed the anti-war Bannon out, and the majority of people he thought he could trust are openly stabbing him in the back?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's in over his head, and he needs to get Mike Flynn back in there, flush Kushner out, and give us a call before it's too late.
