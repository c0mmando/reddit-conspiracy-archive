        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Draining the Swamp is not a simple matter. There are <a href="https://thecenterofthedecentralized.wordpress.com/2017/02/17/former-cia-operative-robert-david-steele-trump-is-battling-pedophile-network">pedophile rings</a> that control most of Washington. The deep state assassinates people, from journalists to JFK.</p>

<p>The media is under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">CIA control</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Voice">deep state</a> pays shills to lie to people on the internet. And the last president was a <a href="http://conspiracyarchive.com/Articles/Obama_CIA.htm">CIA agent</a>. </p>

<p>But it gets worse. The economy is dependent on <a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/11/nathan-kleffman/cia-drug-dealing/">CIA drug-dealing</a>. If Trump tries to take the whole thing down, they can crash the economy. Or they&#39;ll send <a href="http://gulagbound.com/12652/top-5-revolutions-backed-by-george-soros/">Soros</a> to start a revolution.</p>

<p>We need to get the economy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bhu7n/economic_growth_clean_energy_and_a_balanced/">jump-started</a> again with some real <a href="https://newfederalistpapers.joomla.com/11-orbitalring">innovative thinking</a>, to have enough money to be able to jettison the pervert elites. And we need to unite with the reasonable Americans so that Soros can&#39;t run a coup.</p>

<p>The battle can be won. But it has only begun.</p>

<p>No. The CIA&#39;s drug dealing effects <em>their</em> economy and that of the drug customer&#39;s. You have neglected to mention the role of the central Bank&#39;s. This would include, but is not limited to, The &quot;Federal&quot; Reserve Bank(s), The Bank of England, The Bank of Canada...etc. Their collective evil practices have ruined the economy far worse than the CIA ever could...and that is no mean feat. </p>

<p>Yes, that is the beating heart of the evil. Remember, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple">Jesus only resorted to violence one time</a>.</p>

<p>They often print cash and vacuum it back off the street by selling drugs. Same as the British with their opium smuggling.</p>

<p>Look at the financial board he set up.</p>

<p>Steven feinburg is his top economic advisor. The owner of Dyncorp. The famous international Brownstone operations group. </p>

<p>Look at trumps dealings. He was best friends with his helicopter pilot, back in the day. The guy ended up running the US&#39; largest cocaine dealing operation to date. </p>

<p>Look at trumps modeling agency. He is known to run the girls illegally. His wife was one of his illegal girls. A girl here illegally is the first step to pimping that same girl out. Remember there is no record of her and she is completely reliant on the agency.</p>

<p>Kind of. He&#39;s been in with these people for years, but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence he&#39;s fucking kids. He at least has a lot of leeway to operate on that front.</p>

<p>Do you realize how few options he even had for his cabinet? He tried to pick Flynn as his VP and they wouldn&#39;t let him, they&#39;ve pushed the anti-war Bannon out, and the majority of people he thought he could trust are openly stabbing him in the back?</p>

<p>He&#39;s in over his head, and he needs to get Mike Flynn back in there, flush Kushner out, and give us a call before it&#39;s too late.</p>
