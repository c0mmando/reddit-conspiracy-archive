       Sorry if this doesn't belong here but I have a 20 page paper on JFK's assassination arguing that it's a conspiracy due in about a month, and I wanted to know if there were some facts and information that I should definitely include, and which points should I make? 
Again, sorry if this isn't the place to ask for this.

       do you know anything about shooting? if so, then you'd know the shot made, was nearly fucking impossible from that angle. approach it from there and you can easily bullshit 20 pages.

       Yea, I've read a lot of conflicting information about how Oswald (whether he was the shooter or not) was either a good shot or a bad shot. The two JFK films I watched argued both sides. One showed how we was certified to be able to shoot within like 500 meters with accuracy, and the other film showed how he was garbage at shooting.

       american marsksmen tend to be really good at one type of shot; the shot made from where it is alleged to of had been made is a fucking hail mary. in my prime I could not of had made it, if planning a proper assassination I would've gone else where, so you can pull up a map and look at buildings further down route, shit you give me a straight line and I can cap someone from 1km no issues, but moving from the side? no marksman of ANY ability would risk that shot.

       Thanks, I'll be sure to focus on how risky and nearly impossible the shot was. Do you have any sources or could you direct me to any websites that might be able to elaborate on the shot and things like that? It's okay if you don't.

       Well I am just speaking as a shooter; i dont know about sources, but I can tell you from my knowledge and experience shooting a sideways moving target, on a target as critical as a president requires extraordinary skill, and the fact he didnt get away, doesnt add up. if you can make that shot, you can GTFO quick enough.

       So I should talk about the angle of the shot and the type of rifle that was used? Then I could also bring up the average shot of marksmen and compare it to Oswald or something like that?

       yup, those are great ways to waste space. my personal opinion JFK was killed by someone from the intelligence community, it was pinned on oswald as he was a great patzy, he made it an easy trial; guilt isnt about being guilty, just about looking guilty.

       You neglected to add the the alleged weapon was the worst, poorest weapon ever built. It was a Mannlicher. This was a single bolt action rifle. This means he would have had to Aim, shot, unload, reload, aim, shot, unload, reload, aim and shoot a third time through tress that obscured his sight line. Even teams of expert marksmen, using top quality weapons, couldn't have completed that task. Meaning that Oswald could not possibly have shot Kennedy - even if he wanted to.

       there's a tonne of factors, but yes the shitty gun is one of them, i figured just mentioning that it was Hail Mary was sufficient to say "yo the odds are VERY stacked against it succeeding". But you're right for the OP I definitely should've mentioned it was an awful rifle

       Whether he was a good or bad shot means nothing. The circumstances under which he found himself prevented
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       , let alone him, to have made those shots. Obscured sight line, single bolt action rifle, poorest quality rifle ever made, very inaccurate and as a result of this no time. Oswald was innocent on just these facts alone.

       If you could find a photo of the Book Depository on that day of the year (November 22 (in any year just to show the condition of the trees in that location) that would lend weight to the evidence you present. In addition your research should, if possible, include some references to the zapruder film. This clearly shows that Kennedy's head went backwards on the fatal shot. The only way that could happen is if the shot came from in front of Kennedy. This would have had to come from the "grassy knoll". And since the fatal shot came front in front of Kennedy, that adds addition proof the Oswald was innocent.

       Yeah, I've used the Zapruder film as the base for the 4 pages I already have. Unfortunately, I've used testimonies from doctors and ballistics experts of that time, and the testimonies say that it's impossible to determine the origin of the bullet through Kennedy's movements. I personally believe you can, but hey, whatever fills the page. I can still continue with this testimonies for a few more pages before bringing up Oswalds impossible shot, and the circumstances

       In high school a few months ago I did a paper on it for history. I included that JFK was wanting to end the Federal Reserve (which is controlled by the world's richest families) and how he was going to cut US aid to Israel (money) if their nuclear plant was disabled to not be able to produce nuclear weapons

       Buy the book "On the Trail of the Assassins" by Jim Garrison. It's the best group of evidence to show that the CIA was complicit and that the government stonewalled any investigations.

       Yea, I watched the JFK film in which he tried to prove it was a conspiracy. My teacher actually recommended the film so I guess me using another source from Jim Garrison will get me some bonus points lol (especially since it's an actual book and not a website)

       The key to the JFK killing is Oswald. People can debate the forensics and whatnot all day long.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a guy who is in a spy based program in high school, joins the Marines, learns fluent Russian, defects to Russia immediately after discharge, comes back with a CIA friendly handler (who allegedly killed himself on the day Congress subpoenaed him), is on the streets of New Orleans pushing both pro-Castro and anti-Castro positions...
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean there's no way he wasn't a spy. That's the only explanation. Once you show that, the entire "lone gunman" theory falls like a house of cards.

       Discovery Channel did a recreation of the magic bullet trajectory. They said it proved the magic bullet was possible. The reality is that it proves that the magic bullet is impossible.

       Notice that the bullet hits Kennedy in the back where it should, and it hits Connelly where it should. Then look at where the bullet exits Kennedy's body. The official theory said it exited Kennedy's neck as all the photos show. In the recreation their bullet exits Kennedy at the sternum. This is where the bullet would exit Kennedy from a shot from the book depository. Their recreation inadvertently proves that the official theory is impossible. And of course they declined to comment on this proof.

       The immediate response of the U.S. government to its sudden realization that the political and military situation in South Vietnam was not good was to expand the U.S.'s role in the Vietnam War. NSAM 273 had defined the "central object" of the U.S. "to assist the people and Government [of South Vietnam] to win their contest against the externally directed and supported Communist conspiracy." Escalating the U.S objectives, on 22 January 1964 the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent McNamara a memo declaring "victory" to be the U.S. objective and recommending that the U.S.

       Operration Northwoods 1962 (Kennedy nixed it and fired some involved, another strike against Kennedy)
It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner en route from the United States to Jamaica, Guatemala, Panama, or Venezuela. The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest to support chartering a non-scheduled flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       a. An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone.
      </p>
      <p>
       b. Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will begin transmitting on the international distress frequency a "MAY DAY" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal. This will allow ICAO radio[14] stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the United States what has happened to the aircraft instead of the United States trying to "sell" the incident.
Operation Northwoods, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, D.C., Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phony evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and international backing, they needed to launch their war.[16]
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, this was back in 1962. If they could have done it then to create war, it sure as hell would be a lot easier now.

       Here is frame 216 of the Dave Wiegman film of the Kennedy coup. The smaller circle is Kennedy's limo, the larger circle is the puff of smoke coming from the grassy knoll as reported by many witnesses.

       Mr. Lane was asking us to do something very difficult. He was asking us to believe John Kennedy had been killed by our own government. Yet when we examined the evidence closely, we were compelled to conclude that the CIA had indeed killed President Kennedy.

        This is why the Kennedy coup is still relevant after 50 years.

       So I should talk about the angle of the shot and the type of rifle that was used? Then I could also bring up the average shot of marksmen and compare it to Oswald or something like that?

       remember though unfortunately a conspiracy if done right has no evidence it was done. there's a lot of info to throw in, you can go full WaPo and cite me as an anonymous source :P

       You neglected to add the the alleged weapon was the worst, poorest weapon ever built. It was a Mannlicher. This was a single bolt action rifle. This means he would have had to Aim, shot, unload, reload, aim, shot, unload, reload, aim and shoot a third time through tress that obscured his sight line. Even teams of expert marksmen, using top quality weapons, couldn't have completed that task. Meaning that Oswald could not possibly have shot Kennedy - even if he wanted to.
