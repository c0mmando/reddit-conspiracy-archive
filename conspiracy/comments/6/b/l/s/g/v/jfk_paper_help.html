    <div class="md"><p>yup, those are great ways to waste space. my personal opinion JFK was killed by someone from the intelligence community, it was pinned on oswald as he was a great patzy, he made it an easy trial; guilt isnt about being guilty, just about looking guilty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You neglected to add the the alleged weapon was the worst, poorest weapon ever built. It was a Mannlicher. This was a single bolt action rifle. This means he would have had to Aim, shot, unload, reload, aim, shot, unload, reload, aim and shoot a third time through tress that obscured his sight line. Even teams of expert marksmen, using top quality weapons, couldn&#39;t have completed that task. Meaning that Oswald could not possibly have shot Kennedy - even if he wanted to.</p>

<p>Whether he was a good or bad shot means nothing. The circumstances under which he found himself prevented <em>anyone</em>, let alone him, to have made those shots. Obscured sight line, single bolt action rifle, poorest quality rifle ever made, very inaccurate and as a result of this no time. Oswald was innocent on just these facts alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you could find a photo of the Book Depository on that day of the year (November 22 (in any year just to show the condition of the trees in that location) that would lend weight to the evidence you present. In addition your research should, if possible, include some references to the zapruder film. This clearly shows that Kennedy&#39;s head went backwards on the fatal shot. The only way that could happen is if the shot came from in front of Kennedy. This would have had to come from the &quot;grassy knoll&quot;. And since the fatal shot came front in front of Kennedy, that adds addition proof the Oswald was innocent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve used the Zapruder film as the base for the 4 pages I already have. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve used testimonies from doctors and ballistics experts of that time, and the testimonies say that it&#39;s impossible to determine the origin of the bullet through Kennedy&#39;s movements. I personally believe you can, but hey, whatever fills the page. I can still continue with this testimonies for a few more pages before bringing up Oswalds impossible shot, and the circumstances</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The key to the JFK killing is Oswald. People can debate the forensics and whatnot all day long.</p>

<p>But a guy who is in a spy based program in high school, joins the Marines, learns fluent Russian, defects to Russia immediately after discharge, comes back with a CIA friendly handler (who allegedly killed himself on the day Congress subpoenaed him), is on the streets of New Orleans pushing both pro-Castro and anti-Castro positions...</p>

<p>I mean there&#39;s no way he wasn&#39;t a spy. That&#39;s the only explanation. Once you show that, the entire &quot;lone gunman&quot; theory falls like a house of cards.</p>

<a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/JFK/ford.html">http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/JFK/ford.html</a></p>

<p>Discovery Channel did a recreation of the magic bullet trajectory. They said it proved the magic bullet was possible. The reality is that it proves that the magic bullet is impossible.</p>

<p>Please look at this still frame from that show:</p>

<p><a href="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/Hgec6oCdIvE/hqdefault.jpg">http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/Hgec6oCdIvE/hqdefault.jpg</a></p>

<p>Notice that the bullet hits Kennedy in the back where it should, and it hits Connelly where it should. Then look at where the bullet exits Kennedy&#39;s body. The official theory said it exited Kennedy&#39;s neck as all the photos show. In the recreation their bullet exits Kennedy at the sternum. This is where the bullet would exit Kennedy from a shot from the book depository. Their recreation inadvertently proves that the official theory is impossible. And of course they declined to comment on this proof.
Here are the people that saw Kennedy at Parkland hospital:</p>

<p><strong><em>11 October 1963</em></strong> - 5 weeks before the coup.</p>

<p>McNamara and Taylor&#39;s recommendations included an appraisal that &quot;great progress&quot; was being made in the Vietnam War against Viet Cong insurgents, that 1,000 military personnel could be withdrawn from South Vietnam by the end of 1963, and that a <strong><em>major part of the U.S. military task can be completed by the end of 1965.</em></strong> The U.S.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Action_Memorandum_273">National Security Action Memorandum 273</a></p>

<p><strong><em>26 November 1963</em></strong> -  one day after former President John F. Kennedy&#39;s funeral.</p>

<p>The immediate response of the U.S. government to its sudden realization that the political and military situation in South Vietnam was not good was to expand the U.S.&#39;s role in the Vietnam War. NSAM 273 had defined the &quot;central object&quot; of the U.S. &quot;to assist the people and Government [of South Vietnam] to win their contest against the externally directed and supported Communist conspiracy.&quot; Escalating the U.S objectives, on 22 January 1964 the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent McNamara a memo declaring &quot;victory&quot; to be the U.S. objective and recommending that the U.S. <strong><em>put aside many of the self-imposed restrictions which now limit our efforts and undertake bolder actions which may embody greater risks.</em></strong> </p>

<p>Interesting connection between people that said the JFK coup was called the &quot;big event&quot;.</p>

<p>In the 2007 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98OSYceGvWA">death bed confession of E Howard Hunt</a>. At 2:30 his son says Hunt called the coup &quot;the big event&quot; and his father says it at 5:40 and 6:15:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_nEDt_Ha04">The Men Who Killed Kennedy - Judyth Baker - 2003</a></p>

<p>Very interesting thing about Judyth Baker is that at 37:25 she says that Oswald called the JFK coup the &quot;big event&quot;. This was years before E Howard Hunt revealed that the code term for the coup was &quot;the big event&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKhemming.htm">Gerry P. Hemming - 1994</a> called it the big event in 1994: <strong><em>&quot;The FBI came by my place after the assassination and asked nine questions in a hurry, and got the #### out of there. They asked: &#39;What did you have for breakfast? What did you have for lunch?&#39; They didn&#39;t ask where I was when the &#39;BIG EVENT&#39; happened.&quot;</em></strong> &lt;source  A. J.

<p><a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKlorenzM.htm">Marita Lorenz</a> 2002: <strong><em>&quot;Lorenz tells a story of a carload of CIA agents, including Frank Sturgis and Lee Harvey Oswald, carrying high powered rifles and sub-machine guns coming to Dallas just before Kennedy&#39;s visit.

<p>Operration Northwoods 1962 (Kennedy nixed it and fired some involved, another strike against Kennedy)
It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner en route from the United States to Jamaica, Guatemala, Panama, or Venezuela. The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest to support chartering a non-scheduled flight.</p>

<p>a. An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone.</p>

<p>b. Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will begin transmitting on the international distress frequency a &quot;MAY DAY&quot; message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal. This will allow ICAO radio[14] stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the United States what has happened to the aircraft instead of the United States trying to &quot;sell&quot; the incident.
Operation Northwoods, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, D.C., Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phony evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and international backing, they needed to launch their war.[16]</p>

<p>Remember, this was back in 1962. If they could have done it then to create war, it sure as hell would be a lot easier now.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane was asking us to do something very difficult. He was asking us to believe John Kennedy had been killed by our own government. Yet when we examined the evidence closely, we were compelled to conclude that the CIA had indeed killed President Kennedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You neglected to add the the alleged weapon was the worst, poorest weapon ever built. It was a Mannlicher. This was a single bolt action rifle. This means he would have had to Aim, shot, unload, reload, aim, shot, unload, reload, aim and shoot a third time through tress that obscured his sight line. Even teams of expert marksmen, using top quality weapons, couldn&#39;t have completed that task. Meaning that Oswald could not possibly have shot Kennedy - even if he wanted to.</p>
