        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Disclaimer. If you look at my history I&#39;ve posted in T_D a while ago. I am slowly losing faith in his political agenda  and sick of having everything be about politics around here and reddit. Don&#39;t even know what to believe at this point. So I&#39;m done talking about it until concrete evidence comes out. </p>

<p>So I ask others who are into conspiracy that&#39;s non political what are some good topics to dive into? I was reading alternative history&#39;s recently which is pretty cool. </p>

<p>I&#39;m into reading about anything even what people would like call crazy around here lately. I want to find something I can look at from different angles. I miss objectively questioning and drawing conclusions. </p>

<p>Idgaf about Internet points so up vote or down vote I just hope I find something cool to read about that has nothing to do with Russians, Trump, Clinton&#39;s, Seth Rich, etc...</p>

<p>Edit : thanks for the links and ideas everyone! I am going to bed as I have work in the am but I will research more tomorrow night. I appreciate you all! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many ancient statues are actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_fossil">soft body fossils</a>. Namely the olmec heads and the sphinx head. Much of what we see in Peru is either the petrified remains of inorganic metals and plastics or trace fossils of such devices.</p>

<p>To elaborate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamiyan">Buddhas of Bamiyan</a> were constructed in much the same way as the statue of liberty. The metal has since petrified this process is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomorph#Substitution_pseudomorph"> infiltration pseudomorph.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, also 71% of prisoners in Israel are not Jews, the majority is the Palestinians. Yet for some reason the media is quiet about it. </p>

<p>In medieval Europe Jews were killed because they had a different religion, they killed Jesus - who by the way was jewish, and most importantly of all - the Jews were the only ones allowed to engage in money lending and hence it was an easy way to get rid of your debts. </p>

<p>James Tabor is a theologian. Those come in few flavours. Almost all of them became theologians because they believed in the first place. Tabor is a believer. Theologians who do not believe rip his book to shreds. Again, Tabor is not a scientist, archaeologist or a historian. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen! Preach it brother. I&#39;m all there with you. </p>

<p>Still if someone has a belief then they can act on it. It was the same in medieval Europe as it is now. We can find religious fanatics everywhere. In my opinion the reason Jews are hated so much is because they appear to be quite insular and then there&#39;s of course the religious motive. As much as you or I may not like it, while Jesus or any other kind of deity is not real, the effects of people believing they exist are real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gobeckli Tepe - lots of interesting stuff about that.  Joe Rogan&#39;s podcasts with Randall Carlson will shine some light on the matter.</p>

<p>The JFK to 911 movie by Francis Connolly.  Very interesting.  Lots of claims to follow up on.</p>

<p>Corey Goode - watch his videos, read his website and related links, keep an open mind.  Lots of it is pretty out there (aliens, us space programs, etc).</p>

<p>That&#39;s enough to keep you busy for a couple years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Jesus was THE &quot;King&quot; of the jews. Literally. Highest jewish royal aristocracy. Read the very first page of the bible. 
He had direct royal ancestry on both of the fathers and mothers lineage from David and Solomon. This didn&#39;t happen in centuries. Why do you think they called him the king of the jews?
The fathers Davidic lineage goes directly up to David.
From his mothers side, the Hashmoneans Levitic priests through the obscure Nathan (Batsheba), but they were the richest tribe and the last jewish kings. (Well, the real father is another story, but at least the official father was a royal.)</p>

<p>First he tried a Ghandi-like revolution as fighting Herodes doesn&#39;t makes much sense. The Romans wiped the biggest cities for the jewish revolutions. His life-style was a bit strange for a royal, but he wanted to make a difference. But then as it didn&#39;t help he came with soldiers and weapons to take Jerusalem. (The last years in South-Lebanon is left off in the bible books). So they killed him. Very simple historical facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Jesus was an Isralite and followed hebrewisim and not &#39;The traditions of the elders/Judaisim&#39;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, of course. He was Davidian and Levite from his mothers side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Caesar called him &#39;King of the jews&#39; he was being ironic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both, ironic and true. There was no king of the jews, because Israel was occupied territory, 
and the jews were not allowed to elect a king.
But Caesar admitted his lineage as the verbatim King of the jews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Jewish media conspiracy&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonsense. The bigger problem is the catholic church, which suppresses scientific knowledge about those historic times. But it got published as book of course, and some Hollywood and TV documentary filmmakers even took it up. The James Cameron movie &quot;The Lost Tomb of Jesus&quot; was not distributed, maybe because of jewish influence, most likely it was not good enough for the theatres. But it is shown on TV from time to time.</p>

<p>Claiming that Jesus was not a Jew because Arabs now claim that all Jews are actually Russians who converted to Judaism and then &quot;invaded&quot; Israel is ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they&#39;re not wrong..The original Manuscripts never mention the word jew,-not once. During His lifetime, no persons were described as &quot;Jews&quot; anywhere. That fact is supported by theology, history and science.  In neither of the manuscripts of the original Old or New Testament was Jesus described or referred to as a &quot;Jew&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s correct. It was a name by the romans for the 12 jewish tribes living in Judea (and Galilee and Perea), but different from the Samaritans and Idumeans. 
Caesar and Herod (the roman official King of the Jews) mentioned the name Jews all over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s still  incorrect to say he  is a Jew, because the Jew&#39;s are Pharasies and edomites. (There own texts admit this). He was a judahite isralatie and not a jew/Babylon  heretic.</p>
