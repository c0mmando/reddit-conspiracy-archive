    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not.  My point, as I said from the beginning, is that yes, politicians are the same - they are self serving, and that is what they care about - keeping their jobs.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. First, before you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, that is totally wrong. The ACA had no effect on anyone, and would have been passed no matter who was in office?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if we switch to single payer that won&#39;t have a long term effect? What about building a wall and all the disruptions to local wildlife? That&#39;s &quot;short term&quot;? What if we never invaded Iraq? All these things have HUGE long term consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said that Obamacare didn&#39;t effect anyone, I agreed with you that the laws passed do effect everybody. I also did not mean that there were not long term effects. </p>

<p>Yes, when you think about them as R v D, the parties are different in what passes. Look at it as if they are one entity, and that is what I&#39;m trying to get at. Ultimately, both parties are for big business, the military, oil, money. Not for you or I. They are literally on the same side. One side makes &quot;progress&quot; and the other twists that progress into being worse than what we had to start with.</p>

<p>he horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one&#39;s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic.</p>
