    <div class="md"><p>That would definitely be a sound argument if we were blaming the fire department for the house burning down.   Instead, we&#39;re talking about how suspicious the actions of the DNC are.  </p>

<p>The fact that it took a while is in line with an organization that couldn&#39;t give up operations-critical hardware.  The fact that they <em>did</em> give it willingly instead of requiring a subpoena or warrant is in line with the idea that they weren&#39;t hiding anything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s defensible to call it suspicious, but you&#39;re not just calling it suspicious, you&#39;re spreading something that isn&#39;t true and then defending it even though you&#39;re aware that it&#39;s a lie.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see confirmation here that they ever received direct access to the servers in that article. It could easily mean they were rebuffed until later being given 3rd party information and nothing more. In fact that&#39;s exactly how it reads to me, especially when you get to this part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI instead relied on the assessment from a third-party security company called CrowdStrike.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Either way you&#39;re stating something as fact that this article in no way confirms. Talk about feeding a narrative.</p>

<p>As an aside, I still see cause for major concern even if the FBI was simply delayed in being given access to the server, especially considering the fact that this article shows the DNC flat out lying about access being requested at all:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The DNC had several meetings with representatives of the FBI&#39;s Cyber Division and its Washington Field Office, the Department of Justice&#39;s National Security Division, and US Attorney&#39;s Offices, and it responded to a variety of requests for cooperation, but the FBI never requested access to the DNC&#39;s computer servers,&quot; Eric Walker, the DNC&#39;s deputy communications director, told BuzzFeed News.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re interpreting this to mean something it doesn&#39;t, but as written it means that at some point they were no longer rebuffed.</p>

<p>They <em>did</em> rely on crowdstrike for their assessment, and the critical piece of <em>proof</em> is actually in a phishing email rather than the servers themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>...at which point they were provided with the Crowdstrike findings, not the server. A different article lays it out more clearly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bureau made &quot;multiple requests at different levels,&quot; according to Comey, but ultimately struck an agreement with the DNC that <strong>a &quot;highly respected private company&quot; would get access and share what it found with investigators.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nowhere does it say that the FBI ever got access. You&#39;re choosing to interpret it that way but when you look at everything that interpretation doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Also emails are kept on servers FYI so what you&#39;re saying regarding the proof being in an email and not on a server is completely nonsensical.</p>

They were given complete, unfettered mutual access to all sensitive raw intelligence data, and importantly, complete independence to reach their findings. They found that the Russian government pursued a multifaceted influence campaign in the run-up to the election, including aggressive use of cyber capabilities.</p>

<p>The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets. Russia also collected on certain Republican Party- affiliated targets, but did not release any Republican-related data. The Intelligence Community Assessment concluded first that President Putin directed and influenced campaign to erode the faith and confidence of the American people in our presidential election process. Second, that he did so to demean Secretary Clinton, and third, that he sought to advantage Mr. Trump. These conclusions were reached based on the richness of the information gathered and analyzed and were thoroughly vetted and then approved by the directors of the three agencies and me.</p>

<p>These Russian activities and the result and (ph) assessment were briefed first to President Obama on the 5th of January, then to President-elect Trump at Trump Tower on the 6th and to the Congress via a series of five briefings from the 6th through the 13th of January. The classified version was profusely annotated, with footnotes drawn from thousands of pages of supporting material.&quot;</p>

If he was, how would Russia know about it but no one in the DNC or US government would? Rich somehow found out that Russia hacked into the DNC but he didn&#39;t alert anyone to that info, yet Russia figured out he knew this? And if he had evidence Russia was the hacker, where is that evidence? The FBI has his computer. It makes no sense.</p>

<p>As a Progressive, I hate Trump as much as anyone but you have to be blind not to notice the inorganic vote botting being used on these subs. It happens on T_D too, but they have 16k people online at all times and their posts still barely break 50% upvoted. </p>

<p>All of the Trump and Anti-Trump related subs exist as a means to push propaganda anyways, that&#39;s why I filter them.  </p>

<p>Yeah, and so are the people nonstop accusing other redditors of beings Russian.  Reddit is basically promoting astroturfing nowadays because it increases their ad revenue and site views.  </p>

<p>It somewhat parallels to the Medias nonstop coverage of Trump for the past 2 years while ignoring, smearing or not even mentioning Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>May very well be and it should be investigated by non-partisans.</p>

<p>I just find it disturbing that both major candidates had even closer ties to Saudi Arabia yet that isn&#39;t even being discussed. They donated 25 million to the Clinton Foundation and bought 40+ million in property from Trump.  </p>

<p>That country is one of the most repressive in the world.  They execute gay people and Women have almost no rights at all(Including DRIVING).</p>

<p>Disinformation is intentionally false or misleading information that is spread in a calculated way to deceive target audiences.[1][2][3] The English word, which did not appear in dictionaries until the late-1980s, is a translation of the Russian дезинформация, transliterated as dezinformatsiya.[1][2][3] Disinformation is different from misinformation, which is information that is unintentionally false.[4] Misinformation can be used to define disinformation—where disinformation is misinformation that is purposefully and intentionally disseminated in order to deceive.[5]</p>

<p>It literally wasn&#39;t there in the dictionary till the 80s.</p>

<p>Then you have people like Clint Watts <em>testifying</em> that there have been active measures amplified by places like TD/4chan, etc. Remember the whole furore in 48 hrs over #MacronLeaks and how Macron honeypotted the whole operation. Do you remember how it was on conspiracy and TD? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the need for money, but you can give your kid a lot by being a good person and investing into them with things other than money. It&#39;s not about giving them shit or sending them places. All of my buddies who came from wealth didn&#39;t respect it because it came at the expense of relationships with their parents. They got &#39;everything they wanted&#39; except the most important thing.</p>

<p>Teaching your kids to acknowledge and accept the fucked up world for what it is is infinitely more valuable than selling your soul for a salary. Teach your children principles to live by, not double standards for which to sell out by.</p>

<p>What our kids want is our attention. As a father, teach them to succeed. Don&#39;t rely on their school or the extracurriculars you can or can&#39;t afford. Life is the same for most of us. Teach them how to do life, and they&#39;ll take it from there. You are the best thing they will ever have if you just live up to your role. All the best to you and your family :)</p>

And the charge that Sally Yates saw something dangerous in his behavior itself, not just hiding the meeting? What about the grand jury subpoena on Flynn? And the Senate subpoena on Carter Page?

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really not that complicated. If the conspiracy is true, the DNC emails are from Rich. But the Podesta emails are probably not (a normal staffer wouldn&#39;t have access to those). For those, there&#39;s a phishing email from a domain registered by a Russian citizen, and a reply from a staffer saying &quot;This is a legitimate email&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, whether a simple phishing scam is really a hack, and why a presidential campaign advisor is that naive about security, is an entirely different matter.</p>

That&#39;s why Dick Cheney calls it an act of war if it happened. Let&#39;s find out the truth.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not a foreign government- you&#39;re just being an American so you&#39;re not interfering. It&#39;s not vague- if a foreign government is trying to influence our elections to get the results they want - for whatever reason- that should bother Americans. This sub can be fun to try and sort fact from fiction and I&#39;m pretty certain they were up to some hijinks but just how much effect they had who knows. Hillary and the DNC fucked up so much themselves Trump might not have needed too much help.
But here&#39;s a few things that interest me. I don&#39;t like the thought of Russia trying to influence America&#39;s sheep.</p>

<p>Nobody comes here to be a tinfoil anything. People come here to discuss, research, and share ideas about conspiracies. If you come here to use the term &quot;tinfoil&quot; unironically then you&#39;re not here to improve the quality of this sub. </p>

<p>I described him as someone using a term that no conspiracy user would say. I didn&#39;t describe anything about his character or his life, just that his comment is absurdly suspicious.

<p>I have been on the Internet and I have seen plenty of hateful comments. This one is being upvoted liek crazy, and more specifically upvoted by a community that knows tinfoil is a CIA term just like &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; was invented after the JFK assassination. Nobody here should respect someone using the term tinfoil to describe serious felony-level conspiracies. Yet there it sits, +25 points and counting. </p>

<p>Someone who is seriously interested in conspiracies knows how much stigma comes with even <em>maybe</em> being curious to research. Nevermind seriously putting in years of research to learn about this stuff. The level that &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; get made fun of, mocked, and basically called crazy/nutcase/whackadoo/fringe/tinfoil etc is extreme.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;elitist&quot; to think that someone mocking all conspiracy believers probably has malevolent intentions. To use your terminology, a &quot;real&quot; conspiracy user would not say &quot;all these tinfoil hatters&quot; seriously. Maybe tongue in cheek, but that is clearly not the case with the above comment. </p>

<p>And BTW on this point: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>he insulted himself!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure doesn&#39;t seem it. He&#39;s not denying anything, he&#39;s saying tinfoil hatters deny deny deny. He&#39;s agreeing with everything, meaning he&#39;s NOT one of the deniers. He&#39;s not one of the tinfoil hatters. He&#39;s a totally sane member of society and anyone who denies this theory is a tinfoil nutjob who belongs in the nuthouse restrained away from society to keep everyone safe from those dangerous conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>He did not insult himself, and he is not including himself in that comment. No idea why anyone would use collegiate-level mental gymnastics to try defending someone mocking a huge group of people on this sub but whatever dude</p>

<p>One of the biggest was hacking over 20 State voter rolls. Campaigns try to build voter rolls by getting email lists and it&#39;s considered one of the most valuable forms of campaign information possible</p>

<p>Russia directly hack the government butter rolls and got the real information on who votes where it&#39;s fantastically valuable information</p>

<p>The hacked voter rolls for fed to the Trump campaign through the secret Alfa computer after being scrub through a DeVos connected data laundering server</p>

<p>These hacked voter rolls were used by Cambridge analytica the Trump campaign and other GOP organizations</p>

<p>All the bases before we begin to discuss the amount of money that Russia laundered into the GOP, something which many of our allies and our own government claims to have several intelligence intercepts of Republicans admitting to the scheme</p>

<p>You sweet naive child. I wonder what <em>War Games</em> vision of l33t hax0rs you&#39;re imagining.</p>

<p>You do understand that government intelligence agencies are the main source of state sponsored information warfare and can be physically and digitally surveilled?</p>

<p>You sweet naive child. You realize that governments operate hacking operations out of physical locations, right?</p>

<p>And sure, IP tracking means shit to private citizens who don&#39;t monitor and analyze the raw flow of all internet data in utterly massive data centers. </p>

<p>Lmao the American education system hard work here, -- WOW (p.s. &quot;rHetorical&quot;)</p>

<p>Sure, I&#39;ll spoon feed you.</p>

<h1>QUIZ</h1>

<p>Q1: Does the American Intelligence community have the ability to discover the source of a cyber attack attempt without using technical analysis?  </p>

<p>Q2: Does human intelligence have the ability to compromise humans performing cyberwarfare?</p>

<p>Q3: Can both clandestine and non-clandestine tactics be used to compromise humans engaged in state sponsored cyber attacks?</p>

<p>Maybe if you pass the quiz on HUMINT we can move onto SIGINT and or TECHINT</p>

<p>This is your bias, not ours. You dismiss anything you dislike or that damages your narrative as a distraction.Trump is a big asshole, but so far(well, at least until the Comey firing) nothing he&#39;s done has been secretive conspiracy level stuff, it&#39;s all &#39;Imma fuck over immigrants, Imma break the ACA, Imma ignore separation of powers, Imma tweet stuff undermining the office of POTUS,&#39;(all of which we were expecting). Guess what? He&#39;s going to deregulate the financial sector and give rich people a tax break too. That isn&#39;t conspiratorial, it was his goddamn platform.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are. I&#39;m not in support of russia. I just haven&#39;t seen anything to actually support the idea that they &quot;hacked our election&quot; and are colluding with trump to &quot;subvert our democracy&quot; (that doesn&#39;t even exist--the US is an oligarchy). If you disagree with that feel free to show me proof.</p>

<p>And as much as russian might try to spread disinformation I have seen first hand a much greater and more disturbing history of the same from the US government and media as a US citizen.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Worrying? No. Interesting? Yes. </p>

<p>What is there to be worried about? 2 months ago if you ask anyone if comey should be fired they would almost certainly say yes. We also don&#39;t know why he fired him and there are a vast number of potential reasons good or bad. I&#39;m not going to jump to conclusions, especially not conclusions that trump&#39;s &quot;opponents&quot; want us to jump to. </p>

<p>There is a lot that could be going on here. It could be more theater because trump is just putting on a show to appear to be an outsider when he isn&#39;t. It could be trump just being a doofus being mad that elements within the government are still trying to villify every single thing he does and he feels Comey is either going along with that or not stopping it enough and made a feeble attempt to shut it down (whether or not the russian stuff is true). It could be any number of things comey did in the past to show he is not impartial and is incompetent. It could be that trump knew comey was involved in something behind the scenes that he didn&#39;t like. It could be a great number of things.</p>

<p>&quot;The tone of the call was informal, and Clinton never urged Trump to run, the four people said. Rather, they said, Clinton sounded curious about Trump’s moves toward a presidential bid and told Trump that he was striking a chord with frustrated conservatives and was a rising force on the right.&quot;</p>

<p>So no, he didn&#39;t tell Trump to do that. </p>

<p>I stand by the fact that Bill Clinton called Trump shortly before Trump announced his candidacy. Coincidences like these don&#39;t happen in politics, regardless of what the evil, lying politicians try to say.</p>

<p>Plus, I find it interesting that you are shilling to try to discredit Trump, yet you insist that Trump in this circumstance is 100% honest. See this is evidence that you&#39;re following a script. You have to twist around to defend Trump, so as to protect Clinton. An honest person would just say that both are evil liars. Since you can&#39;t do this proves you&#39;re pushing an agenda. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with Trump, you know, the president and the one with all the Russian connections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again deflecting attention away from Clinton. Let&#39;s see you prove that you&#39;re not a shill by saying that Clinton and Trump are both evil liars.</p>

<p>See I have no problem saying this, Trump is evil. Now it&#39;s your turn, to prove you&#39;re not getting paid to manipulate people here.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know how that conversation would go. A Fox News reporter is asking Wheeler questions, and in doing so, tells Wheeler an absolute whopper/bombshell. Then Wheeler goes and reports it as fact to a different Fox News reporter?</p>

<p>The whole thing was clearly horseshit from the beginning. Somebody at Fox, where he&#39;s a regular contributor, wanted him to make up some clickbait bullshit to dominate the news over Trump giving Russia our ally&#39;s intelligence.</p>

<p>The initial story included a few lines about there being a federal agent that flipped and had seen the actual forensics report. So my guess is that is was something pretty leading like, &#39;one of my sources tells me that there was a forensics report that confirmed sent emails, do you care to comment?&#39;. Which of course, he&#39;d respond like, the police have been uncooperative, because I&#39;ve asked to the see the report and have not.</p>

<p>I&#39;m, of course, specifically referencing the events of the last 24 hours where Fox news &quot;broke&quot; a fake story about Seth Rich which this sub immediately &amp; continues to spam the front page with (currently 18 of the submissions). Fox news may be fake news; but that apparently wasn&#39;t terribly important to the Seth Rich narrative.</p>

<p>That word does not mean what you think it means.</p>

<p>Again, if you are claiming that CNN has deliberately fabricated Wheeler&#39;s quotes as part of a conspiracy to disprove the Seth Rich narrative, then go ahead and prove it. As I said, this should be a relatively easy to do, and a potentially explosive revelation if true. I would think that someone who hates &quot;fake news&quot; would be all over this.

<p>You specifically stated that the entire story is a fake. </p>

<p>Facts are that a DNC staff member was murdered days prior to wikileaks release. Nothing fake about that and it&#39;s certainly suspicious. </p>

<p>I can understand your suspicious regarding the number of threads on this issue, but your original statement was that the entire story is fake. That&#39;s my main issue here. The fact that you used CNN as a source was comedic gold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I see a lot more comments on the forum decrying the supposed T_D takeover than i see actual pro-Trump comments, and with more upvotes. </p>

<p>I&#39;m plenty skeptical of Trump, but I&#39;m more skeptical of the MSM making a concerted effort to push a narrative. It looks like a WMD level misinformation campaign, when the stories are based on anon &quot;current and former&quot; officials instead of named sources and/or documents. They can turn on the faucet and leak some mundane story with sensational editorializing and Trump/ Russia in the title, and all other news of the day gets buried. 100 million in weapon sales to Saudi Arabia, the net neutrality debate, and more conspiratorial stories like Seth Rich, all fly under the radar. Trump and any contact he has with Russia (which as President will continue to be regular and necessary) can be spun into a great distraction. He&#39;s someone&#39;s puppet, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re Russia, and I doubt he&#39;s complicit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I never said that. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me in the least, but I have no idea if they are fabricating any stories with these new developments/claims with the Seth Rich case. If they did purposely deviate from the truth and create another story, it certainly would be to refute wheeler&#39;s claims because evidence linking SR to the leaks, more accurately, wikileaks, would mean there was no russian involvement and this data came from within, rather than being stolen from an outside entity. </p>

<p>What I was saying was they, (CNN and other entities within the MSM) were making false claims and lying about the Russians involvement, likely as they were instructed to do. Even though, we heard the obvious motive for that but haven&#39;t been presented with any serious or compelling evidence to back these claims. </p>

<p>Since you mentioned him, back to wheeler for a second. Today I was reading that Seth&#39;s family is refuting these claims that their son/brother is a collaborator with wikileaks, so not really sure about that. You hire a guy to find out who killed your son because the local and fed authorities have been compromised or are otherwise enept, he personally makes a report and public statement, yet they are saying they don&#39;t believe it&#39;s true. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a fundamentally flawed statement. </p>

<p>To prove someones evil, you&#39;d need to prove evil is (objectively) a real thing. Something you can pin point scientifically and study. It isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>None of which is <em>inherently</em> evil. A bad man surrounded by good people would do this, but so would a good man surrounded by evil. As would a bad man surrounded by worse men. All we can say <strong>objectively</strong> is that Putin consolidates power and wealth.</p>

<p>The most likely explanation is: for nefarious purposes. But that&#39;s not an objective fact, just an educated guess. </p>

<p>IMO I suspect Putin does things for his own ideal &#39;greater good&#39;. Most of the worst attrocities in history were committed in the name of a greater good, unforuntately the true value tends to only be known in hindsight. </p>

<p>Putin has definitely done a lot of nasty shit, the question is whether it will be justified in the end. When you consider the nightmare Russia was living in prior to Putin, he doesn&#39;t seem so bad, but theres plenty of room for him to slide into &quot;Holy fuck he&#39;s completely insane&quot; territory. </p>

<p>All things a relative to their environment. Putin is better than the environment he took power from, but compared to the west he&#39;s got a long way to go.</p>

<p>This has always been apart of this sub; aliens, big foot, conspiracies, etc.  I think that&#39;s why this sub latched onto Trump so hard.  Trump is someone who lives by what he feels regardless of the facts.  He felt like he could end ISIS in 30 days. He felt like he would never go golfing because the job was so easy. He felt like we had the worst murder rate in history. He felt like all of our crimes were being committed by immigrants.  He felt like the unemployment rate was 30% or greater.  He felt like he could day 1 get rid of AHCA. He felt like he should be able to do what he wants and everyone would just fall in line.  He felt like he had the biggest electoral win in history. He felt like he had the biggest inaugural crowds in history.</p>

<p>I think what you are seeing is basically a &#39;boy who cried wolf&#39; situation. </p>

<p>Very few people I&#39;ve talked with will claim that the Kremlin doesn&#39;t have a vested interest in fucking with the US + allies. The notion that Russia would actively hack US institutions and political parties is also met with virtually no resistence. </p>

<p>But the idea that Putin, using his omnipotent KGB agents, planted and subverted the entire US government <em>specifically</em> to lift sanctions against Russia is utter insanity. </p>

<p>Now, there&#39;s a big leap between the first points and the latter, but the media has been extremely active in pushing the latter. The result is a backlash of flat denial. That&#39;s just what happens when people push such a heavily polarised argument. </p>

<p>The middle ground is: Russia does everything it can to further it&#39;s own interests, including hacking or attempted hacking of foreign agencies. </p>

<p>I doubt many people would seriously argue against that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hilary is garbage, but she&#39;s not running the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the Clintons have been under the thumb of the power brokers for a very long time. I don&#39;t believe that kind of authority dies out overnight. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>She&#39;s become a tool for distracting from the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possibly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But to use that as an excuse to close the door on investigating Russia is anti-american.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US should opperate under the assumption that foreign powers are always attempting to hack them. That&#39;s common sense. So investigating if Russia did so is pointless: of course they did. </p>

<p>So the investigation is instead focused at the US government. The notion that the Kremlin has managed to literally steal the US government. That&#39;s theoretically possible, but it&#39;s really, really close to flat out insanity. Especially when the alleged motivation is removing sanctions. </p>

<p>Investigation? sounds fine, I encourage it. But the completely insane media hysteria? that reeks to high heaven of conspiracy. The moment I see every a conglomeration of the most powerful and corrupt organisations doing something I tend to think the opposite of what they say is true. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which one feels right? Which do you more want to be true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instinctively I&#39;d say elements of both are true. The possibility of the Kremlin planting agents isn&#39;t just possible, it&#39;s been done before by other groups. However, the idea that Trump is an agent is pretty laughable. No intelligence agency is stupid enough to put an agent in charge of a nation, nor resourceful enough to fill an entire administration with agents. </p>

<p>With Hillary I don&#39;t give a damn about her candidacy, I give a damn about that family leaving their footprints in the criminal enterprises of nations all over the world. For decades they&#39;ve been implicated in conspiracies and global crime. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no such thing as rich saints. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>pro-orange people </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s how you convince people who disagree with you that they shouldn&#39;t bother with your points at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This thread was about the validity of any notion of Russian influence in the election or over the current administration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gap between influence in an election and influence over an administration is absolutely gigantic. It&#39;s like me saying that the Clintons either took some money they shouldn&#39;t have or trafficked children and ate them. It&#39;s such a wide target that you can&#39;t possibly miss. Lumping them together implies that they are linked. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well that is the narrative, the big bad evil Russia is comming for your country. The red scare has been building for quite some time if you haven&#39;t noticed. </p>

<p>I do get your point though, jumping to extremes is a method of making an argument seem worse than it is. I think an investigation is warranted, although I don&#39;t trust the agencies involved (then again, better the FBI than the CIA lmao). </p>

<p>It&#39;s not objectively when it&#39;s happening in real life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putin is objectively a threat to his opposition, but that does not make him evil by necessity. Evil is a moral judgement. Moral judgements are always subjective. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I lived under Saddam&#39;s regime for a long period of my life, I&#39;ve seen what he and his people done, and what Putin is doing is the same as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about Saddam&#39;s regime, aside from a few things like gasing civilians, torture, wars etc. I won&#39;t pretend to know the experience of living under his regime. </p>

<p>What I do know is that pre-Putin Russia was probably the most corrupt nation on the planet. It was just a place where Oligarchs lived the high life and murdered all competitors in the street. I&#39;ve heard some horror stories about what the lawlessness there was used to cover. Russia is better than it used to be, but I think Putin is nearing the point at which he becomes a liability instead of an asset. </p>

<p>How he manages that transition will determine how he goes down in history. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s all about natural gas lines coming from Qatar and Iran that will feed Europe and the rest of the world. If Russia/Assad took control of that area, it means Iran will have the hold of these pipes, and same as with the Syrian resistance, if the control that, then Europe and US will have a control over it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a major part of the conflict. I agree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that Russia is evil, it&#39;s that so many Russians that may have been involved with the US election and leaks have been murdered, presumably by Putin. Voronenkov, Churkin, Kadakin, Malanin, Erovinkin, Karlov, Polshikov, and of course Krivov, who fell off a roof in NYC on the day of the US elections. </p>

<p>With a death toll like that, what&#39;s one more leaker? A Democrat who might come clean about selling secrets to Russia? The logical conclusion is that Putin killed Seth Rich. </p>

<p>People say Hillary murdered various people, but come on, Weiner is still alive. That right there proves Hillary isn&#39;t a murderer. Putin, on the other hand, is a murderer. He was trained by the KGB, took over the oligarchs, cartels, and Gazprom, and people fall like flies around him. </p>

<p>So...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how it works for people who form their opinions based on fact and logic. Unfortunately, when it comes to Trump (and partially, clinton) supporters, they lie on the complete opposing side of fact and logic.</p>

<p>Just because they&#39;re prominent now doesn&#39;t mean they ever will be again.</p>

<p>During this election, we had people on the republican side who have never voted before just because they fell for trumps fluff pieces so well. 
When he flip flopped - it perfectly represented the uninformed that he got their vote. I&#39;m not going to even start talking about the republicans who purely voted for trump because he is the republican candidate, and still hate him...</p>

<p>But on the Democratic side we also had extreme left liberals, third wave feminists, and the &#39;PC&#39; culture, who voted for Hillary because she was a woman, and because she opposed the bigot.</p>

<p>So all of these sides collided with the informed and logic based voters. Sadly, we got the worse of two evils. I know people hate it when that&#39;s said, but I would prefer almost anyone to trump and clinton.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. The &#39;hackers&#39; used malware supposedly used by Russians (as if nobody else can do that) which is supposed to be proof of something. However, Seth Rich who is not a Russian hacker, leaking the emails means that Russians didn&#39;t do it.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/850692885062139904">Guccifer naming &quot;Seth&quot; as his whistle-blower in DMs</a> </p>

<p>Latest report by PI which hopefully he will follow-up with more evidence as he stated. I think Assange and Wikileaks RT&#39;ing the initial report by FOX 5 DC was telling and adds more credence.</p>

<p>As stated below, the WL bounty for info on his murder.</p>

<p>The way this whole Seth Rich murder investigation has been handled.</p>

<p>The other party involved. Monsters with a long list of suspicious deaths of people who have gotten in their way.</p>

<p>The Podesta email stating he&#39;s &quot;definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have a real basis for it&quot;.</p>

<p>The fact that there is literally no proof for this Russia narrative and the agenda has been painfully obvious to anyone in-the-know with what&#39;s really going on. </p>

<p>Is that enough to make your own inference? Is for me. In the meantime I&#39;m kicking the feet back with my popcorn to watch this unfold and the MSM panic some more. </p>

<p>Question- Is circumstantial evidence enough to convict?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes. Circumstantial evidence can be enough to convict someone. The question to the jury will be did the State prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt? It will come down to what is the actual evidence and can there be interpretations of the evidence other than that the accused committed a crime. The defense attorney will likely question the State&#39;s witnesses about other possible interpretations of the evidence. What those questions will be will depend on the exact nature of the evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re correct that Russia is not the only bad player around the world.
You seem to believe that the release of DNC emails is the only way in which the 2016 election was compromised.  It wasn&#39;t.  As in Brexit and the French elections there were and will continue to be psychometric targeted campaigns of misinformation to both suppress the vote on one side and get the electorate screaming mad on the other. 
Using Trump himself and possibly the RNC itself as a vessel for money laundering seems the most likely thing to bring this all into the public sphere.  Even with several shell companies one can usually find a paper trail.</p>

<p>Why exactly should I be worried about 1 in thousands of odds of me getting killed by a terrorist? Are you worried about getting shot? Because you have a 1 in 30k chance of getting shot and killed in America. That is more likely than dieing from a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>I&#39;m way more worried about the long term effects the muddling of facts with made up propaganda. I&#39;m way more worried about people not being able to differentiator factual news from fake news anymore.</p>

<p>Remember Russia is still invading sovereign land in Europe. Russia obliterated Georgia and planted a puppet government. </p>

<p>Russia directly benefits from a destabilized Europe. Anyone who says otherwise simply doesn&#39;t understand the geo political climate in that region.</p>

<p>I totally understand when Americans see Russia as some far off problem but for us it hits a bit closer to home.</p>

<p>There are refugees from the Ukraine in my country who have fled Russian artillery. Let that sink in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The democratic process that is already influenced by hundreds of millions of special interest and foreign dollars? You are trying to protect the integrity of that process? The system that has seen every president in the last 25 years threatens with impeachment? Suddenly the Russians are able threaten the stability of that system?</p>

<p>And so it&#39;s &quot;I am under no threat of terrorism myself but I am worried about those Ukrainians getting hurt&quot; meanwhile ISIS has displaced millions and murdered tens of thousands all funded by Middle East states that have millions living in indentured servitude. But Russia ... Jesus. </p>

<p>And let&#39;s not ask whether Seth was murdered for political reasons because, well, Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that the MSM backed the DNC on the election. </p>

<p>I know the same MSM has been running pro DNC Russia hacking narrative.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust them, because they&#39;re in cahoots. It&#39;s part of the problem of being a slimy group of shitheads who try to cheat the system. A lot of people won&#39;t trust you anymore. Meanwhile, the Seth Rich narrative adds up when you&#39;re considering a bunch of slimy fucks getting together and trying to figure out how to save their asses. </p>

<p>&quot;Kill Seth. Say it&#39;s the Russians on MSM since they already do what we want. Hands in the center, DNC on three.. 1,2,3, DNC!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I KNOW the DNC and MSM should be in trouble, and are in collusion. So of course they&#39;ll stick with the Russia narrative. That means the investigation dies, and the DNC is free and clear.</p>

<p>Even if I&#39;m wrong it means nothing, though. Here&#39;s the other narrative: a Russian agent sent a phishing email to John podesta. He fell for it. The results of his idiocy lead to Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 election, because when WikiLeaks released the valid information, it affected voters. </p>

<p>WHY DON&#39;T YOU GUYS HATE TRUMP MORE COME ON LOOK RUSSIA</p>

<p>I hate Trump just fine, thanks. I&#39;ll hate him more when I see more, but I&#39;ve seen enough to hate the DNC and MSM entirely. That&#39;s what the two sides boil down to. What do you hate more?</p>

<p>Grab the pussy, or lying and cheating in the primaries? Answer that and I&#39;ll know which narrative you believe. It just pisses me off that the DNC can get out of EVERYTHING they did this election and yet an unproven Trump Russia connection is enough for people to flip their shit. PROVEN TRUE DNC SCANDAL MEANS NOTHING, but don&#39;t worry, the media is on your side and thinks Trump should be impeached for a theory they refuse to show proof for. That&#39;s enough for you, because you&#39;re ultra biased against one side. It&#39;s nowhere near enough for me and most here, because we&#39;re ultra against BOTH SIDES for being fucking EVIL.</p>

<p>Go support your evil overlords elsewhere, r/politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying this couldn&#39;t potentially be a concern, but as long as we are investigating all foreign threats to america, we should be investigating the Saudis and Israelis at the top of this list as well. Which with the last two, that can get awkward because they are supposedly allies of ours. Lest we forget, allies that actively and repeatedly engage in human rights violations on a daily basis. But I digress, that&#39;s another thread for another time. </p>

<p>However, in my opinion, those people are misguided and focused on the wrong thing, and this is likely be design. The red scare, political propaganda and weaponizing fear are hardly new &quot;things&quot; and have been deployed for quite some time. Notwithstanding things that occur inside their country, because we are all guilty of something against our people, and apart from violating airspace of sovereign nations and this whole crimea/Ukraine revolution business, what have the russians really done to anyone in the last 2 decades? </p>

<p>The long and short of it is I believe the same people that are screaming about the Russians and how dangerous they are, are the same ones who are actively engaging in deflecting criminal responsibility on their political party and are otherwise unable to come to terms with what their leadership has done and is willing to do to remain in power (relevant).</p>

<p>But you still think the russians are the real threat to the short and long term future of the states? That&#39;s where I disagree with you, because I believe these are the results of propaganda --&gt; brainwashing. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also fairly obvious to me that the real threat faced by Americans today is sadly our own govt, and not some other group of people that live on the other side of the globe. </p>

<p>I will say again that I agree our two-party paradigm is quite outdated and archaic and needs to be completely overhauled. </p>

<p>But I&#39;d also like to ask you a question since you&#39;ve taken the time to respond. Even if the Russians have been actively working to undermine our &quot;democracy&quot; in hopes our country collapses from within, correct me if I&#39;m wrong but isn&#39;t that exactly what the agency has been doing literally for decades? If we can agree on that, is it a classic case of do as I say and not as I do??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia is not trying to collapse your country... Russia is trying to influence America so they will have a VERY powerful ally who will let them do whatever the fuck they want. Collapsing America is bad for them as well. This idea that they are trying to collapse America from within stems from Cold War propaganda. Which actually benefited them because they&#39;re doing the opposite but no one expects them to do that.</p>

<p>Americas two party system is undemocratic and one of the biggest threats you guys face I agree. But by spreading the unproven conspiracies as part of a political agenda supporting one side you just do what they want you to do.</p>

<p>This is all noise. Meant to distract. Meant to put you at odds with each other. You can be worried about the DNC and Russia. It doesn&#39;t have to be one or the other. But they managed to make it so. </p>

<p>Who benefits from this chaos? </p>

<p>Great point.</p>

<p>With the level of scrutiny being leveled at the US-Russian relationship by our media, I don&#39;t think you need to worry.  We should be more worried about those friendly relationships with foreign powers which fly under the radar, like our relationship with Israel.  If ever a country had an outsized influence on our politics...</p>

<p>I generally don&#39;t like the debate tactic where &quot;X is bad&quot; is deflected by &quot;X has always been bad and everyone already knows it&quot;, but in this case I think we need to focus on the actual details of possible Russian intervention, in the US, in 2016, possibly with Trump&#39;s complicity, and &quot;But the US does it too!&quot; is a distraction...

    <div class="md"><p>Assange proving Rich was the leaker would do more to legally incriminate Rich than it would the democrats/ clinton campaign.  That would be a tough decision to make.  To some, it would make rich a martyr, and to others, a traitor of the highest order.</p>

<p>So we don&#39;t know the truth for sure- but Assange maintains that he is consistent to his supposed journalistic code of ethics in his unwillingness to name sources.  </p>

<p>BUT... at the same time, he has certainly insinuated without too much evidence that Rich was a source.  It has also been heavily insinuated by former british pm and ambassador Craig Murray, that he was Seth Rich&#39;s contact within wikileaks.</p>

<p>If you already are a fervant DNC supporter, you aren&#39;t going to immediately jump to the conclusion that the DNC murdered rich- just because you find out that he was the leaker.  So I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of value of them speaking outside of coded language regarding the issue.</p>

<p>That is odd. That would be like if all new subscribers to Politics only talked about how dumb politics was to talk about. It&#39;s clearly some form of shillary, though perhaps it&#39;s Reddit search manipulation, like how they manipulate the front page.</p>

<p>Are you subscribed to TinyTrumps and TheNewRussianHolocaust ? Try Conspiracy! - Shit like that can appear &#39;shillary&#39; but is more manipulated search engine results, leading to a flood of &#39;anti&#39; thinkers brigading thoughtful discussion.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the clincher. The vast majority of people that are balls deep in conspiracy forums support no political candidate because they believe it&#39;s all the same shit, different face. </p>

<p>This sub is seeing hordes of people that denigrate conspiracy theories while citing MSM. It&#39;s bizzare. Recent hype with wikileaks has opened a few eyes, but there&#39;s way too many people bagging on well established conspiracy theories to be coincidental. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know one way or the other, but I doubt there was any <em>changing of the votes</em> which is what most folks think of when they hear <em>hacking</em>. </p>

<p>But anyone who has even a basic knowledge of hacking knows that the vast majority of hacking is <em>social engineering</em> so when we look at the news stories and the way the DNC leaks were twisted into narratives, <em>the populace was hacked</em> not the voting machines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you guys another point of view.</p>

<p>The latest news focuses on another attack on Trump, making fun of how he gave away classified information to <em>Russians</em> (again...). </p>

<p>Remember the HRC emails? How she had SAP level classified material on her laptop? Knowing the history of the Clintons, she was probably following her husband&#39;s footsteps and selling that information to foreign interests. The SAPs were mentioned in a few msm articles but downplayed by media in general.</p>

<p>Zooming out on this shit-show, a lot of top secret files are probably in non-American hands and probably, indirectly, all over the global private sector, but the media makes a HUGE deal out of some stupid ISIS Israeli spy?</p>

<p>Are you fucking kidding me? ISIS <strong>is</strong> MOSSAD! The msm narrative is SOOOO far from the truth it&#39;s mindblowing..</p>

<p>He &quot;resigned&quot; because of his contact with Russians. That&#39;s why Trump sacked him.</p>

<p>So even if this Seth rich hoax that&#39;s getting spammed is even credible 0.001% it still doesn&#39;t negate the fact that Flynn is out, Trump said Russia hacked the DNC Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russian investigation because of HIS inappropriate contact with Russians </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t Seth rich leaking the conclusion we came to when the Russian narrative first came out.</p>

<p>Then we were all shocked that it gained traction because it was an obvious ploy by the Democratic Party to take trump down quite a few notches.</p>

<p>Then it worked.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>I believe the truth is some where inbetween. Trump has ties to Russia. He has ties to the mob. And he is a position to allow a lot of bad stuff to happen including child trafficking, coke dealing, and whatever the fuck.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>At the same time, Seth rich leaked and was murdered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting way to discredit! </p>

<p>125813140 No one should be paying attention to or quoting anything Bauman has to say. They are Bauman&#39;s words and not the words of Seth Rich&#39;s family. The DNC made him the &quot;spokesman&quot; for the family but he doesn&#39;t speak for them. He is misrepresenting them in his own words. When he interacts with them he tells them what he wants them to say and then goes and says it by himself. He is not being honest, this guy is a pathological lying sociopath. There is an entire organized network of sociopaths/psychopaths at work here.
This Bauman guy already dismissed the emails by basically saying &quot;I haven&#39;t heard of any emails but if emails come out, they are not evidence. They are just words that anybody can type&quot;. This is something a psychopath does when they don&#39;t have the answers. They make stuff up and dig further holes for themselves and then make some more stuff up. This doesn&#39;t work forever if they operate on their own but they are a giant network and they control the MSM so they can lie and spin and ignore then go on to the next subject. It&#39;s worked for them for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for taking the time to put that together.  I&#39;m a Sanders liberal and I&#39;m very curious.</p>

<p>BUT, what I&#39;m looking for in evidence are real concrete sources.  All you have is that a private investigator said &quot;someone in the know&quot; has told him that there are files on the computer linking him to wikileaks.</p>

<p>Assange hasn&#39;t been much help either, because all he does is float ideas, wink and nod.  He&#39;s given you nothing concrete either.  I kind of resent that.  What&#39;s his game?  If he has evidence Rich was murdered, then share it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not brigading from some other site, and I quit the DNC last year and really dislike the party.  But your case is not persuasive.</p>

<p>If you want your case to be persuasive, we need real, concrete evidence.  Otherwise, this is all circumstantial theorizing on your part.  Interesting, but....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually pretty clear you blindly believe anything you&#39;re told if you think Wikileaks has a &quot;spotless record&quot;. Aside from very obvious collusion with the Russians to interfere in our election to support Trump what else do you need? I&#39;m glad you at least admit you&#39;re more likely to believe the word of a foreign adversary than your own countrymen but christ, at least do your homework before just buying into something blindly. Like you just said, there is no evidence to support the Seth Rich conspiracy and now Fox News is getting sued by his family over it. But you choose to believe this because it supports your narrative and just as easily dismiss anything that doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>You seem to think Wikileaks operates for the greater good. Are you not aware of their reputation? Are you seriously defending fucking Wikileaks? WOW</p>

<p>In all seriousness though, you know the difference between you and me? If this was Obama in Trump&#39;s shoes, and it looked like he was guilty of treason, I would have been calling for impeachment just like all the GOP would have. Some of us actually give a shit about country more than party. So yes, even though the CIA obviously has faults, at least I know they fight for America. Your side can&#39;t say the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Low information, and intellectually lazy.  </p>

<p>People should stop making knee-jerk false assertions if there isn&#39;t strong evidence to back it up.  It&#39;s great to question, and consider other angles.  But we shouldn&#39;t take a leap of faith based on imagination and conjecture to assert something as fact without considerable evidence and credible consensus.</p>

<p>There is no strong evidence supporting the &quot;Seth Rich was killed because he leaked the emails&quot; narrative.  I repeat, there is <em>no evidence to date</em> supporting this narrative.  It upsets me to no end that this story line is propagated across the internet as truth when there&#39;s nothing back it up.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s irresponsible, and lazy.</p>

<p>Seth Rich was a Russian agent planted within the DNC. He compromised systems and leaked information to his handlers. Whenever Russia wanted that information made public, they would have him send it to Wikileaks as a way of obfuscating any involvement by a foreign power. When he was no longer useful to them, they killed him to tie up any loose ends (as they do) and started spreading the narrative online (as they do) that Hillary did it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there probably was a russian hack. Several independent companies found traces of two russian toolsets on the clinton servers, but not on the DNC server.
But this doesn&#39;t mean that the russians leaked it publicly.
The DNC leak was very likely a leak, the Podesta gmail hack was probably done by amateurs/fishers. Maybe they even came from Russia/Ukraine, as most of those guys.</p>

<p>Of course the entire Russian narrative in the media is false. There is as with most CIA disinfo only a small core of half truth. Same as with the Russian Trump connection. There was a connection to the Russian mafia, but since 2016 they were heavily fighting, as the russians betrayed Trump with some of his projects. The whole Flynn narrative is a joke, as well as the Petraeus and Benghazi investigations. Petraeus and Benghazi was something completely different, much worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So because there was a leak, you are sure that Russia didn&#39;t have the DNC, didn&#39;t give money or communicate with the Trump campaign, didn&#39;t give money to the GOP...
The Russia thing isn&#39;t just that they leaked the DNC Wikileaks emails. In fact, I don&#39;t think the investigation ever said anything about those emails  in particular, just that they hacked certain politicians emails, including Democrats <em>and</em> Republicans. If Russia got emails they would likely use them for blackmail, not just make them public and be done with it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>American public politics is no longer a serious affair, an affair of transcendental import for the technologically-led destiny of the late capitalist, post-truth state. The public, as a result, has been far too infantilized by the reigning plutocrat-bureaucrat axis and consequently what passes for political discussion in the U.S. has correspondingly been equally infantilized; the controlling oligarchs, masters of politics as masters of the purchased (or purloined) state, fear no consequences and thus their nihilistic unconcern before the inconsequential effects (for their class) of their malfeasance or incompetence causes them to indolently play a game of perpetual pseudo-suspence with the minds of the politically residual middling classes and below.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American middle class has been both dumbed down as well as squeezed from top and bottom, to a point where it no longer exists in reality.</p>

<p>Large parts of the government have been outsourced to private corporations, think tanks, and lobby groups. There is no direct accountability between the public and their representatives who have become docile and unable to challenge the role of these quasi-governmental bodies.</p>

<p>The Military Industrial Complex has taken over the running of the government and the office of the president is ceremonial. Trump can&#39;t fart without permission. His missile attack on Syria last month was a gross violation of US law as well as international law. The fact that there has been no investigation of the so called chemical attack, and thus no evidence to support the missile strikes speaks volumes about the lack of public coherence as well as political coherence in America at the present time.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that ICBMs could be launched without the proper authority should be troubling for Americans. The fact that America has it&#39;s military active in Asia Europe and the middle east should also of concern.</p>

<p>America needs to ask itself who is running the shop. From Europe, from Asia and from the middle east, the answer is unclear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anybody anywhere has seen any evidence of Russian hacking this ought to have been presented publicly months ago. The fact that no evidence has been presented and no justification for the hacking presented can only lead to one conclusion. The hacking issue is based on American ignorance of what hacking involves, as well as an ignorance of any Russian advantage to be gained by Trump being in the White House.</p>

<p>Trump was never supposed to be president. That much is accepted  by both parties as well as the MSM.
How the Russians could possibly benefit by having Trump being elected is a bizarre question also not answered.</p>

<p>The fact that Trump has flim flammed on various issues as well as being thwarted in his approaches to national security, health care, suggest that he is unable to initiate his agendas without prior scrutiny by forces and faces unknown.</p>

<p>When evidence of motive, opportunity, as well as techniques are revealed this can be treated as a real news item. At present it is an American fiction based on suspicion and innuendo. No facts or evidence are being debated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now you&#39;re splitting hairs. It was classified in the sense that it would&#39;ve been classified had anyone other than the president shared it. The president has the power to declassify things, so you can say he shared declassified things, but it&#39;s disingenuous. Had anyone else done what he did, they&#39;d be facing criminal charges.</p>

<p>The issue is he shared info that was collected by a foreign intelligence agency. Traditionally, whichever agency collects the intel controls how it&#39;s disseminated. So, the country that shared the info with us shared it in confidence and it was up to them to decide whether or not to share it with Russia.</p>

<p>Since he betrayed that trust, it&#39;s less likely they will want to share intel with us in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello all, </p>

<p>Just a friendly heads up that various hate subreddits from around reddit (most dedicated to mocking those who question the mainstream narratives which are so prevalent these days) have started linking to the comments section of this post in order to influence the vote totals therein.</p>

<p>To that end, we encourage all users to take vote totals on comments in this thread with a grain of salt. We are working actively with the reddit admins to stem the flow of these vicious brigades, and we hope some of these horrific hate subreddits (that exist only to manipulate content on subreddits such as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, simply because this subreddit is resistant to having such narratives imposed from on high) will be addressed by the admins directly, as their behavior fundamentally undermines reddit as a platform in this regard.</p>

<p>To that end, if you see comments or submissions around reddit directed at this thread (or any other on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>), which directly encourage users to vote or participate in violation of reddit&#39;s site wide terms of service, please do let the mods know, as that is the only way we are able to work with the site admins to effectively stop the brigades.</p>

<p>Thanks for your consideration and please accept my apology on behalf of those vicious brigades who come to this comment section only to engage in ideological manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming you&#39;re correct and that brigades come from both sides, it would seem that one side is better at hiding their brigades better than the other. I feel pretty confident that if a mod became aware of such brigades forming in other subreddits, they would post a sticky disclaimer at the top, just as <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> did in this thread. If you can find evidence that this is happening and the mods are intentionally ignoring it, beyond &quot;if both sides brigade, they must brigade in equal amounts!&quot; then that deserves a post on this sub in itself. Otherwise, though, I cannot go along with your conclusion that this gives off a perception of bias.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t TheDonald.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods are choosing when to counter brigade tactics because that is their choice as mods.  <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> was notorious for this type of activity years ago and mods were heavily involved and placing sticky posts similar to this to stop it.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s because the anti-trump subreddits brigade in.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite disturbing to look at the anti-trump commenters here. If you look at their accounts, they are all less than 2 years old. They have a few token submissions of content about dumb stuff and then a lot of comment karma. Their comment karma is all from one or at the most two subreddits. They all appear to be sock puppets.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting that these are all the same person, but it appears that they are not using their main accounts to comment in here. There seems to be a coordinated effort by some group to come in here with sock puppets and make it appear that they are real, average redditors. </p>

<p>So just look at these accounts for yourself. They don&#39;t look &quot;normal&quot;. There is a group pushing an agenda here, but it&#39;s not a pro-trump one.</p>

<p>What you&#39;ll see with these accounts is that they only frequent a single subreddit, which is where all their karma comes from. A &quot;normal&quot; account will get their karma from several different places. </p>

<p>Like if I look at where you have submitted links, it&#39;s all over the place. Maybe you favor <a href="/r/aww">/r/aww</a> and other such meme subreddits, but at least you aren&#39;t stuck in one small obscure subreddit.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m only linking this so you&#39;ll stop dishonestly asking about a &quot;source&quot; when you obviously ignore the dearth of evidence that there is 10x more fact to Trump&#39;s impropriety than Seth Riches murder.

    <div class="md"><p>Lets say youre right about DNC leaked emails... there are countless other issues you are ignoring. Honestly, your snarky post and obvious ignorance to this makes you come off as a complete tool. Why not do a little digging for yourself and actually understand the issues before firing off this nonsense? Seriously, just spend 2 hours on google looking up multiple sources from different outlets and you will see what so many others see. I challenge you to honestly set aside your bias and challenge your cognitive dissonance while doing your research. The most dangerous threat to our democracy is a misinformes citizenry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would disagree with that. The media not only ignored the death of Seth Rich they completely ridiculed the idea that he could have been a leaker or that his death was in any way related an effort to make him an example to other potential leakers. They just went with the attempted robbery explanation with no proof he was robbed. In point of fact, there were no witnesses to disrupt a robbery and his body lay in the street for hours. So, any evidence pointing to an execution by the DNC is going to be shoved off into the corner. </p>

They were given complete, unfettered mutual access to all sensitive raw intelligence data, and importantly, complete independence to reach their findings. They found that the Russian government pursued a multifaceted influence campaign in the run-up to the election, including aggressive use of cyber capabilities.</p>

<p>The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets. Russia also collected on certain Republican Party- affiliated targets, but did not release any Republican-related data. The Intelligence Community Assessment concluded first that President Putin directed and influenced campaign to erode the faith and confidence of the American people in our presidential election process. Second, that he did so to demean Secretary Clinton, and third, that he sought to advantage Mr. Trump. These conclusions were reached based on the richness of the information gathered and analyzed and were thoroughly vetted and then approved by the directors of the three agencies and me.</p>

<p>These Russian activities and the result and (ph) assessment were briefed first to President Obama on the 5th of January, then to President-elect Trump at Trump Tower on the 6th and to the Congress via a series of five briefings from the 6th through the 13th of January. The classified version was profusely annotated, with footnotes drawn from thousands of pages of supporting material.&quot;</p>

<p>125813140 No one should be paying attention to or quoting anything Bauman has to say. They are Bauman&#39;s words and not the words of Seth Rich&#39;s family. The DNC made him the &quot;spokesman&quot; for the family but he doesn&#39;t speak for them. He is misrepresenting them in his own words. When he interacts with them he tells them what he wants them to say and then goes and says it by himself. He is not being honest, this guy is a pathological lying sociopath. There is an entire organized network of sociopaths/psychopaths at work here.
This Bauman guy already dismissed the emails by basically saying &quot;I haven&#39;t heard of any emails but if emails come out, they are not evidence. They are just words that anybody can type&quot;. This is something a psychopath does when they don&#39;t have the answers. They make stuff up and dig further holes for themselves and then make some more stuff up. This doesn&#39;t work forever if they operate on their own but they are a giant network and they control the MSM so they can lie and spin and ignore then go on to the next subject. It&#39;s worked for them for decades.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>according to NBC&#39;s Richard Engel (who is no fan of Trump), &quot;US intel official tells me trump told Russians about laptop airline threat. Told it wasn&#39;t anything they didn&#39;t already know.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I mentioned, the contents of the information is not necessarily an issue. What is an issue is the fact that Russia now knows Israel has that information and is sharing it with the US, as it gives Russia and Iran an insight into their intelligence apparatus; especially in terms of where Israel may have operatives. Furthermore, it decreases any international trust in Trump&#39;s ability to secure information correctly and follow due procedure in general.</p>

<p>What Engel is saying is that Russia didn&#39;t learn anything more than they already knew. Trump didn&#39;t say the intel came from Israel. It was the NYTimes that reported that, presumably because it&#39;s really not a big deal. Everyone is acting like Russia had no idea that Israel has a spy agency, and Israel itself said it hasn&#39;t decreased their trust in Trump at all. </p>

<p>So why did Trump ask him to resign and why did Flynn hide/lie about his talks with this one particular Russian?  Seems like Trump agrees that Flynn&#39;s connection with Russia was NOT just a normal part of his duties nor was appropriate, otherwise Flynn would still have a job.</p>

<p>Just because that other side over there <em>deserves</em> a sidewinder right up their exhaust, no need to jam the signal of the current missile homing in on <em>its</em> target here.</p>

<p>We have more missiles. Let each get their targets as unfettered as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pro-Dutch I would assume means a candidate who puts your country and culture first. That is what Trump does for America. Nationalist is just a term. Substitute patriotic if you like. No one is advocating for America to go conquer other countries.</p>

<p>The left here removed the American flag from their logo because it&#39;s offensive. They censor conservative viewpoints, control the media and academia, force social issues into law or use them to manipulate opinion, hire shills to manipulate social media, use the IRS to target conservative groups, prevent conservative speakers from speaking at colleges, call us racist, hateful, homophobic, misogynists, fascists, etc. all while trying to suppress free speech, inciting violence and promoting all forms of degeneracy in the name of diversity or inclusion. </p>

<p>If your media is telling you different, you can assume they&#39;re as dishonest as ours is.</p>
