       First off, it's just a "memo" he wrote... Not a audio recording like they had on Nixon... I can write a memo that david brock touched my kids private parts at a pizza party in DC... Does that make it true? No of course not, the burden of proof is beyond a shadow of doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the things we look at when proving a case is the reliability of the accuser. Are they morally bankrupt, skeletons in the closet, can they be blackmailed into giving false or misleading testimony...
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey is a bought and payed for clinton shill, he sat on the board of a bank along with numerous other shills including the clintons... The bank was being investigated for money laundering, currency manipulation...
      </p>
      <p>
       All charges and investigations dropped and stopped when the dems got elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rabbit hole is deep! Corruption, blackmail, pedophiles, satanism, ritualistic sacrifice to pagan gods...
      </p>
      <p>
       Question everything, and ask yourself what's the payoff or angle that the news is trying to get me to believe...

       Why would Comey write a memo about Trump telling him to stop the investigation the day after Flynn was fired?  At that time there was no telling how this was going to play out.

       ROFL. No, most people around here don't trust the three letter agencies,. But here's the thing ... they don't trust Donald Trump or Republicans or even Democrats either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you haven't noticed by Donald Trump's LIE record is actually worse than the agencies. Just about every three words he speaks has a lie or misrepresentation in it. The agencies tend to save their lies for one particular favorite -- provoking war.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       This post starts out right away with a Republican partisan agenda, and worse yet, with a blatant defense of the Establishment. That establishment would be Donald Trump and the Republican Party who have more power that EVER.

       The democratic party as a whole lied, cheated, killed and stole a nomination from Bernie sanders and trump is the bad guy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie tweets " if I endorse anyone but myself, know its a lie" or close to that... His wife was being investigated for something that happened at the college she's a professor at, anyways clintons goons rough him up and tell him endorse clinton and we make the investigation go away for your wife... But trumps the bad guy. How many people have the clintons killed? Up to close to 50 or so huh? Seems like you might wind up dead if your friends with them.... How many have died around trump?

       Are you in-charge of an investigation being held by an official agency looking into David Brock's possible crimes? Because if you are then you might have some credibility on the subject. Surely you can understand the difference between Joe Blow writing a random memo and the head of the FBI writing a memo on an investigation they're heading.

       The company got the largest fine possible and there's not really anything to suggest Comey was directly involved in the shady shit past just being a board member. Even then, that in no way invalidates his investigations and work with the FBI.
