I can write a memo that david brock touched my kids private parts at a pizza party in DC... Does that make it true? No of course not, the burden of proof is beyond a shadow of doubt. </p>

<p>One of the things we look at when proving a case is the reliability of the accuser. Are they morally bankrupt, skeletons in the closet, can they be blackmailed into giving false or misleading testimony... </p>

<p>Comey is a bought and payed for clinton shill, he sat on the board of a bank along with numerous other shills including the clintons... The bank was being investigated for money laundering, currency manipulation... </p>

<p>All charges and investigations dropped and stopped when the dems got elected. </p>

<p>The rabbit hole is deep! Corruption, blackmail, pedophiles, satanism, ritualistic sacrifice to pagan gods... </p>

<p>Question everything, and ask yourself what&#39;s the payoff or angle that the news is trying to get me to believe... </p>

<p>Maybe you haven&#39;t noticed by Donald Trump&#39;s LIE record is actually worse than the agencies. Just about every three words he speaks has a lie or misrepresentation in it. The agencies tend to save their lies for one particular favorite -- provoking war.</p>

<p>This post starts out right away with a Republican partisan agenda, and worse yet, with a blatant defense of the Establishment. That establishment would be Donald Trump and the Republican Party who have more power that EVER.</p>

<p>Are you in-charge of an investigation being held by an official agency looking into David Brock&#39;s possible crimes? Because if you are then you might have some credibility on the subject. Surely you can understand the difference between Joe Blow writing a random memo and the head of the FBI writing a memo on an investigation they&#39;re heading.</p>

<p>The company got the largest fine possible and there&#39;s not really anything to suggest Comey was directly involved in the shady shit past just being a board member. Even then, that in no way invalidates his investigations and work with the FBI. </p>
