    <div class="md"><p>Its worse than both sides are fucked.</p>

<p>Both sides are fucked ANDDDDD! both sides have faux grassroots 3rd parties established that claim to want to end the 2 party system when they really just want to end the opposition party.</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t believe how many supposed &quot;anarchist&quot; I&#39;ve talked to that suddenly reveal themselves as establishment democrats when they forget their act and start talking about policies they support. ANDDDD! You wouldn&#39;t believe how many supposed &quot;constitutional reformists&quot; I&#39;ve talked to that suddenly reveal themselves as establishment republicans when they forget their act and start talking about policies they support.</p>

<p>Everything is fake news, everything is for sale, everything is permanent and disposable at the same time.  </p>

<p>The best I&#39;ve been able to figure is that you&#39;re better off mastering the game, playing it for your own benefit and keeping an eye on the ebb and flow of social unrest so that you&#39;re ready to play the next game when the current game comes to an end.</p>

<p>Nobody is ever going to establish Utopia here on Earth. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve even wondered at times if spiritual forces make sure that there is always a suitable &quot;test&quot; environment here on Earth for the next generation to participate in.  Tough choices, no right answers and always without question designed to produce guilt, self loathing and hatred of others in a neat little package that puts your morality to the ultimate test.</p>

<p>Now scrap all that spiritual mumbo jumbo and consider that the difference in perspective alone between your average western Christian member of society and your average eastern Hindu/muslim/Taoist etc etc (assuming we are all wrong) and strangeness  of these alien groups of people is so abrasive that given the right circumstances (Oil embargo on imperial japan, etc etc) that its just too easy to become sworn enemies.  Once these rivalries are established, Short of nuking them into submission, they will carry on for generation after generation (Pakistan versus india) until people are just so indoctrinated with hate (White americans versus black americans) that the current reality no longer matters and the self sustaining rivalry will always find a new martyr to rally behind or a new injustice to rail against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the Seth Rich conspiracy negates the Trump-Russia conspiracy.  They are competing theories and diametrically opposed.  So the premise of this entire thread is dumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t necessarily see why they should be opposites and not connected. I for one believe that Seth Rich was given Russian money to leak the emails. Don&#39;t overestimate the Russians, I really don&#39;t think their hacking capabilities are that sophisticated. Seth subsequently approached Wikileaks, the obvious leak-platform to choose, and a platform with a clear anti-American agenda. Speculations about Russian influence over Wikileaks have been wide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>BC the whole Russia Red Scare has been a propaganda ploy the wholeee time. I saw in the primiares where they were painting Bernie to be a commie... Are they fucking dumb? BERNIE SANDERS A RUSSIAN COMMIE!? Who the fuck would make some dumb shit up like that? Oh thats right.. the DNC / dem establishment</p>

<p>Then it was Seth Rich. We allll knew it was Seth Rich, who was the leaker, yet Obama and Hilldawg kept feeding us the bullshit Russia line. Then TRUMP AND RUSSIA was pushed and has been pushed by the same fucks who are do whatever they can to SPIN. Spin from their dirty landry thats been aired out. </p>

<p>I&#39;m so sick of the bullshit. The dems have no taken one ounce of responsibility for destroying their own party. Watch these scum bag fucks paint SR to be Russian.</p>

<p>Seth Rich Destroys the fake Russian narrative. PERIOD.</p>

<p>They have stuck to their dumb fucking lies so let them eat their cake. They cant back out of this one.</p>

<p>How about we burn the whole mother fucker down instead of focusing on a puppet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. But you see posts like the one above where Seth Rich makes Trump shit not true. That is insanity to my old ass. Question everything, no matter which way you voted in the last election. These threads are nuts. Both are huge stories but I used to be able to read great discussions on thing like this and now it is all bullshit from both sides thinking their person is innocent when we should know that they are not, no matter Republican or Democrat.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. OP is full of shit. The MSM talks about Russia 24/7. Why do we need to rehash what the MSM and FBI and Congress and whomever else are covering ad nauseum?</p>

<p>There are other serious conspiracies that get no attention except for amongst this community. Maybe we should focus on those counter arguments specifically because they run counter to the mainstream narrative, and because they&#39;d disappear otherwise. Oh...I guess that&#39;s OP&#39;s point.</p>

<p>&quot;Either/or thinking&quot; is exactly how the elites manipulate the masses.</p>

<p>Russiagate &amp; Pizzagate are both mirror images.  Both are frame-ups with some truth and much falsehood.  Both are used to whip each other&#39;s political opponents into a frenzy and witch-hunt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the FBI gets a sudden new whitewash of &quot;integrity&quot; and the Anthrax evidence in their hands -- <strong>physical evidence</strong> unlike Russiagate or Pizzagate -- is declared &quot;old news&quot; by <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in their hysteria.</p>

<p>The &quot;Ames Strain&quot; Anthrax leads to the U.S. military&#39;s involvement in 9/11.</p>
