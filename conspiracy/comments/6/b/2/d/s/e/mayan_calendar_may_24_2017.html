       Is anyone familiar with the Mayan Calendar?
      </p>
      <p>
       "What makes May 24th, 2017 so special?
      </p>
      <p>
       In principle, it is not more special than any other beginnings of a 36 wave period of the Ninth Wave. (see
       <a href="http://www.xzone.com.au/9thwave.php">
        http://www.xzone.com.au/9thwave.php
       </a>
       ). May 24, is the first day of the 64th DAY in the Ninth Wave. However, it may be regarded as the beginning of a sustained effort to facilitate for people to create resonance with the Ninth Wave. This event will be followed by events on June 29, August 4, and so on. It is not to be looked upon as a singular event. Yet, it can be argued that
       <em>
        the chaos in the world
       </em>
       has come to a point where it becomes
       <em>
        a necessity
       </em>
       <strong>
        to create resonance on a larger collective scale with the wave that generates unity consciousness
       </strong>
       . (my emphasis)

       Im willing to bet we have a major solar event followed by the possible earthquake event on the west coast here. I believe we also have a comet passing this month? not to sure maybe the dates line up. Just my 2 cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       My ideas are based on solar observer on youtube among others. That and someone earlier posted about an earthquake event in the next 11-33 days. Please source me if anyone remebers

       None at all.
       <strong>
        It was a miscalculation by the archaeologists
       </strong>
       that some new age researchers who had not looked into the matter deeply came to embrace. It was very unfortunate that the Mayan calendar was popularized as some significant that would take place in a singular day.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not how the Mayan calendar works. Instead it describes shifting waves with wavelengths of different lengths sometimes bringing change over very long time periods.

       Haven't read Cayce in a long time, thanks for the reminder:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(. . .) The earth is conceived of as the third dimension and as a sort of laboratory for the entire system, because only here is free will so dominant. On the other planes, more control is kept over the soul to see that it learns the proper lessons. According to the Cayce readings, whatever is learned by the soul must be built into the life upon the physical plane, for soul growth must be made while on the earth plane through effort and applied will.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Cayce, the innumerable arrangements of stars and planets represent soul patterns, and the signs of the Zodiac are twelve fundamental patterns from which the soul chooses when coming into the earth plane for a new incarnation. They are patterns of temperament, personality, and mental attunement; and the phsyical body is considered to be an objectification of the soul pattern, a reflection of "the individuality of the soul."

       This is a time that we should collectively be raising the vibration. I am taking the day off work. Meditation and tuning in. Who knows what will go down? Likely some Trump stuff. FBI Director is supposed to testify on that day. Trump will be returning from Saudi Arabia and Israel. Interesting timing to say the least. Perhaps a major shift in politics. I've been researching around. I read some things today about the UN, Ancient Egypt stuff, and a place in Bulgaria called Sofia just following my own instincts and patterning. I have no clue what will go down but maybe that's not the point. Maybe we should just be tuning in.

       I was thinking the same thing, it would be good if a group of people could (would) meditate/pray/sit quietly &amp; contemplate; for a little while.

       I know I won't take the day off, but before work I can remind myself to keep it positive. Just be more mindful &amp; thankful.

       Yes! I created an event for collective focus at 12:00 Noon Eastern Time. It's for 5 minutes only. I figure if enough of us check in collectively for that long, that is powerful. My focus is to generate love and send it to the heart of Donald Trump. I do not support Trump at all politically but I felt this is something that perhaps most of us can agree is healthy. I am not sure what Universal Love would do to Donald Trump's heart. I suppose it may cause him to see his pain and step down from office in order to get help. I do not know but I do know that collectively intending this isn't healthy and should not offend anyone. The event has gotten very little interest though haha. Many are so polarized that it's hard to even get past the name. I see that Mr Trump is somewhat of a caricature or representation of a collective ego. He is indeed a perfect representative for all that is unhealthy in our society. But rather than hold him up and beat him like a piñata, as we have handled people we do not like historically, I believe that focusing upon his healing is the next step in consciousness. Just as I have had to be patient and loving with my ego so we must also be with the collective ego. We can thank this archetypal person for mirroring our faults and use it as a catalyst for change. First step in growth of this kind is to approach with love, assist with removing ego from collective control, and replace with conscious control. I see this as a tipping point. Where consciousness can take over even if only slightly more, like 51% if that makes sense. Just an idea. If you're interested, I have the event on the book of faces. I'm glad to link you up with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, my goal is to simply tap in and listen. You can certainly do the same from work. Simply being mindful. I will likely stay away from social media unless something major goes down (as I work in spiritual things) but will check in on Reddit. I would enjoy finishing out this conversation a day after at least. Also to link up with you given we are interested in this. There are future dates as well. Love and blessings

       Checked my work schedule &amp; I will be home the 24th (yay) , so I will "join" you at 12 noon EST for the 5 min. meditation, I'll have to "demand" time for peace &amp; quiet here. I'm sure most people aren't aware of May 24th, I only 'discovered' it. Quite often I'll stumble upon info that I didn't know I needed. At first it was uncanny but I appreciate whatever 'guidance' I receive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, you can send me the link, is it on fb? I don't have/not on it. I was going to PM you after the 24th (
       <em>
        anyway
       </em>
       ) to ask you about it, so we are on the same wave length, great minds think alike! ;)

       TBH I think Trump is a friggin' idiot (aka a psychopath). The world is a mess; those in power aren't going to remedy the situation.

       Great. Thank you! Yes, my opinion is the same. Sending love won't hurt though. I think doing so causes us to step out of our own comfort zones. Even if only a few of us do this, or join together in a high vibe, it is meant to be as it is. We may all have the perfect connection required to bring higher consciousness.
      </p>

       The event is on FB so if you don't have one you won't be able to access it I don't think. Either way others may be able to. Here's the link:

       I am a blogger and practice yoga. I work with individuals in spiritual counseling (no religious affiliation though; i know a good bit about religion though so I am able to work with those who hold a particular belief system without compromising it). I also provide talk locally. I currently do skype sessions as well and hope ion begin uploading my talks in June. I do counseling on walks for locals. They are called spirit walks. And talks called spirit walks.

       I'm not sure I want him to step down from office, because, if he does, he's likely to be replaced with someone who is more attuned with listening to the elite. Trump
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       have an ego; I am with you on that. But I believe that his ego results in his stubbornness, which is, I feel, preventing him from working completely against humanity, as many leaders have done in the past and which Hillary
       <em>
        would have
       </em>
       done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think channelling love into his heart is brilliant, just not as a means of getting him to step down. As insane as it sounds, someone like Trump might just be our only hope. Someone with enough ego to not listen to others, but someone with a big enough heart to be able to peer beyond the veil of ego when it matters and to make decisions based on Gaia's intent.

       I will be joining you tomorrow! I believe that this year will be the year we experience a mass-level awakening. A year ago, I hadn't an ounce of spiritual knowledge in me, but after a glimpse of awakening a year ago, I have spent my entire year letting go of ego, so as to become who I know I truly am. Thank you for making the event. Can't wait to feel and channel some love :)

       Great. I'll admit, my prediction is only an opinion. I have no clue how the Universe works things out. I think that channeling love that way does not hurt though. Thank you for joining. Much love!!!

       In truth, none of our predictions carry any
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       weight! You are just as 'right' with your predictions as I :)
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the only prediction we can both know is true is that, in every case, love
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       conquer all else. So happy to join. Namaste &lt;3
