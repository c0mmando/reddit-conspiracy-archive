       I think that I've seen enough. Its truly amazing how there's something completely the same about literally all of the answers. Its almost as if there's a hidden universal consensus that literally no one breaks from or ever wants to break from. It's certainly an excellent demonstration of what I wanted to see. It just adds more fuel to the, well...

       After roasting in a lake of fire for like half of eternity wouldn't just be super satisfying to know that one day Satan would be tossed with you in that same lake and ya just kinda point and laugh at him at that point.

       But you'll be roasting forever and ever and ever.  The roasting fire will never end, you wouldn't even have time to laugh, you'll just be wailing and gnashing your teeth.  Heaven sounds infinitely better than hell.

       Seems like I'd prolly kinda get used to it after a few 100 years... plus it's gotta be soooooo satisfying to see the dude that tortured you for so long get the same treatment... like I think that would be a super funny day in Hell... everyone would be like "Oh fuck! Satan is in the lake of fire!  Look everyone! Look at that bastard! Hahaha... don't like that do ya, big guy? Haha... now

       When your soul is condemned in hell, you won't be laughing know that it'll be forever.  I'm sure God made hell so you'll never get used to the pain, it's not called eternal punishment for nothing.

       Yeah... but forever is such a long time... and it would be sooooo hilarious the day that Satan gets tossed in the lake of fire... soooo funny. Taste of his own medicine. That day would be soooo epic... and all the people in Heaven would totally miss out on it.

       If the only joy you get from going to hell, would be to see satan get thrown into the lake of fire, then the cost out weights the benefits.  One small laugh for an eternity of hell. To each their own.

       I was just quoting a Nine Inch Nails song... I think Hell might be real... maybe not... just to be sure I made sure to accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior... There was a place you can fill out your name/signature in the back of the Bible that is a "Get into Heaven for free" card.

       I'm not sure a fictional messiah could ever stop people from going to Hell if its real. I think people's choices and actions define whether they go there if its real.

       It almost seems like the Joker and the Batman would be the same person, who kidnap you and then set you free. But both rely on fear, don't they? Just some thoughts.

       Well they are both the same exact amount of fake... Just like Jesus and Hell... if RoboCop told me to duck cause ED-209 was gonna shoot at me... I'd duck... cause if RoboCop is real... then I betch ED-209 is too... If Luke Skywalker told me to go find C3P0... I'd prolly see if I could find him... I wouldn't be like "Fuck you Luke... C3P0 isn't real."

       Hmmm so then there essentially are no actual consequences (that you would not actually like) for your actions? That almost sounds like something that would be a very good reason for someone to go to Hell... But since you don't think its real, you certainly aren't scared right?

       I'm not scared... cause like Hell has gotta have a bunch of interesting people there... and like everyone that died before Jesus was born... they all went to hell with no chance of redemption. I'll stand in solidarity with them... if my signing the Bible thing doesn't work.

       Ah so you aren't scared. Well at least you're honest. Outside of the fictional messiah and that story, I'd like to think that redemption is always something that comes before you continue to make the choices and do the actions that you will go to Hell for. I'd think that not stopping, not caring, and not having any remorse and regret would make you irredeemable, and rightfully so. I'd think that justice and retribution would be very real things indeed.

       That quote seems quite accurate. But remember, there were tons and tons of terminators, not just one. Do you think those terminators would deserve to go to Hell?

       Good question... which terminators are we talking about? I think T-1000 wouldn't go to Hell... but a T-800 probably would because they have organic skin instead of a mimetic poly-alloy... but would they go to Heaven if they were programmed with Prime Directives 100% in tune with the Bible? Cause I dunno if they could follow the original 613 Commandments... they could prolly handle 10 very well though... cause John told the T-800 not to kill anyone and he incapacitated like 40 cops with no fatalities.

       Terminators follow directions very well.

       But terminators could also choose, so I don't think that they were necessarily computers. Perhaps the terminators we speak of just try to be like computers in order to hide their choices and actions? I'd think that these terminators would absolutely deserve to go to Hell because of their choices and actions, as well as trying to hide behind acting like a computer to distance them from their actions. But analogies are fun, aren't they? ;)

       I don't think Terminators exhibited much freethought... they had a wide variety of protocols that must be adhered to... Even at the end of T2, Arnold was not allowed to self-terminate.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are the same... we are pre-programmed with internal mechanisms beyond our control... core-beliefs... morals... and when we act in according to these beliefs, then we really don't have free thought.

       In my mind, if God created the world, and intended for us all to be different cultures and different religions, meaning only some folks would grow up Christian, and only they get to go to heaven, then God can fuckin blow me. Because he's an asshole. Everybody who doesn't grow up worshiping Jesus has to burn in hell for eternity when they die? Fuck all that.

       That doesn't mean anything, infinite "possibilities" doesn't really mean anything, paradoxes occur, under infinite possibilities of like... Anything you can think of, eventually you will get an all-powerful being that has power over all possibilities, in essence, God.

       I don't know and don't care if it's real.  If it's real,  than its out of my hands. I live my life to be a good person by my own terms and morals,  not the one dictated to me by an invisible being floating on a cloud. Here's the thing with religions. If you give yourself to the God for that religion and beg for forgiveness than your in heaven, right? So,  you go murder people and feel sorry and beg for forgiveness and are off the hook? No,  thanks.  I'd rather be in the hell with all the honest folks.

       I actually think it is (was) entirely in your hands, since Hell is all about the choices you make and the actions you do right? Food for thought on that. But I don't think saying you'd rather be in Hell with all the honest folks is entirely honest in itself, wouldn't you say? I think you'd like to be with them, sure, but not in Hell. Does that mean you're scared of Hell?

       Literally,  paragraph of how backwards religion turns people.  No,  I'm not afraid of hell because who's to say my version of what hell is isn't so bad? Unless you've been there,  than this whole post is mute. And yes,  I was honest.  If hell is a burning Lake of fire,  I'd take that over "what exactly it takes" to get into heaven according to "god". Hell would be honest folks not hiding behind there mistakes thru a false god.

       To say this once again, I actually think that honest folk hide far more than they'd ever admit. Is your version of Hell something you would like? That's what it sounds like. Do you perhaps enjoy creating Hell and enjoy that? It only makes sense since it very much sounds like you like Hell. In fact, that sounds exactly like the kind of thing that would be the perfect reason for someone to go to Hell in the first place. Interesting how it all comes right back around, isn't it?

       How much Kool aid did you drink? So,  your not an honest person? You'd call yourself a liar? You don't make any sense.  I think people end up where they're mind believes they deserve.  If you think you are bad,  you'll end up in a bad place.  If you think you are good,  your mind will create a safe happy place.  It's like your final and ever lasting dream. I don't believe in hell,  so it doesn't scare me.  I said I'd happily go there,  to typical religious "version" of hell bc religion is so backasswards. When I die,  I die.  I accept that,  and my mind is neutral on the matter.  It just is what it is.  And I know I am a good,  kind person,  so when I die,  there is no fear bc I'm going somewhere I'm meant to be,  which will ultimately in some way or another be safe and happy. Do you need reassuring for any particular reason on this hell matter? Seems you are  itching and scratching a bit.

       I think that what you come up with in your mind to excuse you is nothing when compared to your choices and your actions. I'd think that continuing to choose and do the actions that are the reason you're going to Hell simply cements your fate and makes you irredeemable. I definitely don't need any reassuring, but I could be itching and scratching at something a bit, I don't know.

       I think that "god", or rather, his servants' leaders do as much as they can to create hell right here on Earth.  The fear of an imagined hell is just used to keep the sheep in their pen.

       Ah, so God isn't real then either? This is the honesty I've been looking for. That certainly means you definitely do not think there are any consequences for choosing evil and evil actions, right? There is no way that you think there are any, since God isn't real, and neither is Hell, and you aren't even scared of it is if it is real. Honest to a fault,
       <strong>
        <em>

       Don't project too much into it.  People are capable of good on their own, without need of a magical sky father to take all the credit.  In my honest opinion, "god" is the true evil in the world.  He is responsible for more genocide, rape, torture, and suffering than any tyrant in history.  Just look at the invasion of Canaan for a glimpse of what he's really like.

       The greatest trick the devil ever pulled, was not convincing people that he didn't exist.  It was convincing them that he was God.  And that he "loves" them.

       I think "hell" can be a state of mind. Maybe those who believe there is a hell would experience it. I've read about someone's NDE (near death experience), he claimed he went to hell.

       I think that's possible, imo, if we're able "to create" our 'world' by what we think.

       Did you see the movie (starring Robin Williams) called "
       <em>
        What Dreams May Come
       </em>
       "? I realize it was a movie, but some people really believe in a heaven &amp; hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plot:
       <br/>
       While vacationing in Switzerland, pediatrician Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) meets artist Annie Collins (Annabella Sciorra). They are attracted to each other, and bond as if they had known each other for a long time. They marry and have two children, Ian (Josh Paddock) and Marie (Jessica Brooks Grant). Their idyllic life ends when the children die in a car crash. Life becomes difficult: Annie suffers a mental breakdown and the couple contemplates divorce, but they manage through their losses.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the anniversary of the day they decided not to divorce, Chris is also killed in a car crash. Unaware that he is dead, and confused that no one will interact with him, Chris lingers on Earth. He sees Annie's attempts to cope with his loss and attempts to communicate with her, despite advice from a presence that this will only cause her more pain. When his attempts cause more sorrow, he decides to move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chris awakens in Heaven, and learns that his immediate surroundings can be controlled by his imagination. He meets a man (Cuba Gooding Jr.) he recognizes as Albert, his friend and mentor from his medical residency, and the presence from his time as a "ghost" on Earth. Albert will guide and help in this new afterlife. Albert teaches Chris about his existence in Heaven, and how to shape his little corner, and to travel to others' "dreams". They are surprised when a Blue Jacaranda tree appears unbidden in Chris' surroundings, matching a tree in a new painting by Annie, inspired by Annie's belief that she can communicate with Chris in the afterlife. Albert explains that this is a sign that the couple are truly soul mates. Annie decides that Chris cannot "see" the painting, however, and destroys it. At the same time, Chris sees his version of the tree disintegrate before his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chris laments that he can no longer see his wife and soon encounters a woman who he comes to recognize as his daughter Marie, living in an area resembling a diorama that she loved in her lifetime. The two share a tearful reunion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, Annie is unable to cope with the loss of her husband and decides to commit suicide. Chris, who is initially relieved that her suffering is done, grows angry when he learns that those
       <em>
        who commit suicide go to Hell
       </em>
       ; this is not the result of a judgment made against them, but rather their own tendency
       <em>
        to create "nightmare" afterlife worlds
       </em>
       based on their pain. Chris is adamant that he will rescue Annie from Hell, despite Albert's insistence that no one has ever succeeded in doing so with a suicide. Albert agrees to find Chris a "tracker" to help search for Annie's soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the journey to Hell, Chris recalls his son, Ian. Remembering how he'd called him the one man he'd want at his side to brave Hell, Chris realizes that Albert is truly Ian. Ian explains that he chose Albert's appearance because he knew that Chris would listen to Albert without reservation. Before they part, Ian begs Chris to remember how he saved his marriage following Ian and Marie's deaths. Chris then journeys onward with the tracker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chris must walk across the field of Faces of the Damned, stepping on their faces as he navigates across it. The damned can be heard talking, including a businesswoman who says she never over-billed her clients. Chris and the tracker arrive at a dark and twisted version of Chris and Annie's house. The tracker then reveals himself as the real Albert and warns Chris that if he stays with Annie for more than a few minutes he may be permanently trapped in Hell, advising that all Chris can reasonably expect is an opportunity for a final farewell to Annie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chris enters their now-horrific looking home to find Annie suffering from amnesia, unable to remember her suicide, and visibly tortured by her decrepit surroundings. Unable to stir her memories, the tracker sees Chris give up his quest to save Annie from Hell. But instead of returning to Heaven, Chris chooses to join Annie forever in Hell. As he declares to Annie his intent to stay, his words parallel something he'd said to her as he left her in an institution following the children's deaths, and she regains her memories while Chris is making her nightmare his. Annie, wanting nothing more than to save Chris, ascends to Heaven, bringing Chris with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chris and Annie are reunited with their children in Heaven, and all appearances are restored. Chris proposes reincarnation, so he and Annie can experience life together again. The film ends with Chris and Annie meeting again as young children in a situation that parallels their first meeting."

       I'd like to think that Hell would be a very real thing that wouldn't be based on belief at all. I'd like to think that a being's, or a group of beings', choices and actions would be the things that would send them there.

       I'd like to think that Hell would exist completely outside of any belief system, including religion, and that those who enjoy creating Hell for others that aren't part of their group would be the exact types to go there.

       So even those that don't believe it exist, could go there? I don't feel that's true because we (mentally) can

       Now it may be possible that an "evil" person having a conscious (about the wrongs they did) could put them in hell after death.

       I actually don't think you can mentally create what you experience. I think that if you choose evil and continuously do evil actions with no intent to

         ever
        </em>
       </strong>

       What about Satan? Isn't the only one you really want to go to Hell for eternity? I'd like to think that divine justice and retribution could be a real thing though, especially when some being, or a group of beings, choose evil, then continuously do so after being told to choose differently and do not ever want to choose otherwise and make that obvious.

       Why do you think anybody should burn for eternity? You realize that is just sadism right? Not even one of those elite pedos or w/e deserve such a fate, the mere eternity of it implies an injustice as it is over finite sins.

       I'd like to think that it is, and I'd like to think that its something evil beings think they wouldn't be scared of and would actually enjoy, yet simply wouldn't think its real because they are so arrogant that they think there is no way there could be any real consequences they wouldn't like for their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'd like to think that demons run it, and perhaps Satan himself oversees it and might not actually be who the evil beings say he is. I think he might enjoy tormenting, but only those who are evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       But those are just thoughts. :)

       Oh I'd like to think that its a beautiful place where those who aren't evil could watch from afar those who are, burn in total deserved agony and torment (that they
       <em>
        would not like
       </em>
       ) for the choices they've continuously made and actions they've continuously done with no intent to ever stop. I'd like to think that Hell is a beautiful thing to behold except to those who belong there.

       Is it real? Doubt it. Am I scared to go there? No. If God is all seeing and all knowing then he would know that I'd end up in Hell before he even made me, therefore there would be no point in creating me in the first place. Unless God is just making me to go to Hell which would contradict all religion.

       Reality is what you perceive it to be. No one persons reality is the same. With that said in my reality Christianity is about as real as harry potter. When a Christian starts talking about how if they live right by Jesus they will get into some make believe land in the sky when they day is the equivilant of me a huge Harry Potter fan actually believing a wizarding world exist and that my letter for Hogwarts got lost in the mail. So to answer the first part of your question , No I do not believe in hell or heaven. To answer the second part no I am not scarred of a place that is a fictional place, that would essentially be the same as me being afraid of Voldemort or Darth Vader.
