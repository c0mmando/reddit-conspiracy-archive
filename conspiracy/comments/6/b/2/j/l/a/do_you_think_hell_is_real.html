<p><strong>Edit</strong> I think that I&#39;ve seen enough. Its truly amazing how there&#39;s something completely the same about literally all of the answers. Its almost as if there&#39;s a hidden universal consensus that literally no one breaks from or ever wants to break from. It&#39;s certainly an excellent demonstration of what I wanted to see. It just adds more fuel to the, well... <strong><em>fire</em></strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah so you aren&#39;t scared. Well at least you&#39;re honest. Outside of the fictional messiah and that story, I&#39;d like to think that redemption is always something that comes before you continue to make the choices and do the actions that you will go to Hell for. I&#39;d think that not stopping, not caring, and not having any remorse and regret would make you irredeemable, and rightfully so. I&#39;d think that justice and retribution would be very real things indeed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question... which terminators are we talking about? I think T-1000 wouldn&#39;t go to Hell... but a T-800 probably would because they have organic skin instead of a mimetic poly-alloy... but would they go to Heaven if they were programmed with Prime Directives 100% in tune with the Bible? Cause I dunno if they could follow the original 613 Commandments... they could prolly handle 10 very well though... cause John told the T-800 not to kill anyone and he incapacitated like 40 cops with no fatalities. </p>

<p>Terminators follow directions very well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But terminators could also choose, so I don&#39;t think that they were necessarily computers. Perhaps the terminators we speak of just try to be like computers in order to hide their choices and actions? I&#39;d think that these terminators would absolutely deserve to go to Hell because of their choices and actions, as well as trying to hide behind acting like a computer to distance them from their actions.

<p>Had you done some minor searching, you would have seen the shear number of individuals for thousands of years have experienced demons... They are very real to some. </p>

<p>You ask if hell is real... Of course it is.</p>

<p>Or are you talking about cartoons here when you go down the hell hole and all of a sudden its fire and lava and more posts like this.</p>

<p>Hell is alive and well .. It just might not be what cartoons tell you it is. This certianly aint no heaven for the modest and caring human.</p>

That&#39;s what it sounds like. Do you perhaps enjoy creating Hell and enjoy that? It only makes sense since it very much sounds like you like Hell. In fact, that sounds exactly like the kind of thing that would be the perfect reason for someone to go to Hell in the first place. Interesting how it all comes right back around, isn&#39;t it?</p>

I said I&#39;d happily go there,  to typical religious &quot;version&quot; of hell bc religion is so backasswards. When I die,  I die.  I accept that,  and my mind is neutral on the matter.  It just is what it is.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s possible, imo, if we&#39;re able &quot;to create&quot; our &#39;world&#39; by what we think. </p>

<p>Did you see the movie (starring Robin Williams) called &quot;<em>What Dreams May Come</em>&quot;? I realize it was a movie, but some people really believe in a heaven &amp; hell.</p>

<p>Plot:<br/>
While vacationing in Switzerland, pediatrician Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) meets artist Annie Collins (Annabella Sciorra). They are attracted to each other, and bond as if they had known each other for a long time. They marry and have two children, Ian (Josh Paddock) and Marie (Jessica Brooks Grant). Their idyllic life ends when the children die in a car crash. Life becomes difficult: Annie suffers a mental breakdown and the couple contemplates divorce, but they manage through their losses.</p>

<p>On the anniversary of the day they decided not to divorce, Chris is also killed in a car crash. Unaware that he is dead, and confused that no one will interact with him, Chris lingers on Earth. He sees Annie&#39;s attempts to cope with his loss and attempts to communicate with her, despite advice from a presence that this will only cause her more pain. When his attempts cause more sorrow, he decides to move on.</p>

<p>Chris awakens in Heaven, and learns that his immediate surroundings can be controlled by his imagination. He meets a man (Cuba Gooding Jr.) he recognizes as Albert, his friend and mentor from his medical residency, and the presence from his time as a &quot;ghost&quot; on Earth. Albert will guide and help in this new afterlife. Albert teaches Chris about his existence in Heaven, and how to shape his little corner, and to travel to others&#39; &quot;dreams&quot;. They are surprised when a Blue Jacaranda tree appears unbidden in Chris&#39; surroundings, matching a tree in a new painting by Annie, inspired by Annie&#39;s belief that she can communicate with Chris in the afterlife. Albert explains that this is a sign that the couple are truly soul mates. Annie decides that Chris cannot &quot;see&quot; the painting, however, and destroys it. At the same time, Chris sees his version of the tree disintegrate before his eyes.</p>

<p>Chris laments that he can no longer see his wife and soon encounters a woman who he comes to recognize as his daughter Marie, living in an area resembling a diorama that she loved in her lifetime. The two share a tearful reunion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Annie is unable to cope with the loss of her husband and decides to commit suicide. Chris, who is initially relieved that her suffering is done, grows angry when he learns that those <em>who commit suicide go to Hell</em>; this is not the result of a judgment made against them, but rather their own tendency <em>to create &quot;nightmare&quot; afterlife worlds</em> based on their pain. Chris is adamant that he will rescue Annie from Hell, despite Albert&#39;s insistence that no one has ever succeeded in doing so with a suicide. Albert agrees to find Chris a &quot;tracker&quot; to help search for Annie&#39;s soul.</p>

<p>On the journey to Hell, Chris recalls his son, Ian. Remembering how he&#39;d called him the one man he&#39;d want at his side to brave Hell, Chris realizes that Albert is truly Ian. Ian explains that he chose Albert&#39;s appearance because he knew that Chris would listen to Albert without reservation. Before they part, Ian begs Chris to remember how he saved his marriage following Ian and Marie&#39;s deaths. Chris then journeys onward with the tracker.</p>

<p>Chris must walk across the field of Faces of the Damned, stepping on their faces as he navigates across it. The damned can be heard talking, including a businesswoman who says she never over-billed her clients. Chris and the tracker arrive at a dark and twisted version of Chris and Annie&#39;s house. The tracker then reveals himself as the real Albert and warns Chris that if he stays with Annie for more than a few minutes he may be permanently trapped in Hell, advising that all Chris can reasonably expect is an opportunity for a final farewell to Annie.</p>

<p>Chris enters their now-horrific looking home to find Annie suffering from amnesia, unable to remember her suicide, and visibly tortured by her decrepit surroundings. Unable to stir her memories, the tracker sees Chris give up his quest to save Annie from Hell. But instead of returning to Heaven, Chris chooses to join Annie forever in Hell. As he declares to Annie his intent to stay, his words parallel something he&#39;d said to her as he left her in an institution following the children&#39;s deaths, and she regains her memories while Chris is making her nightmare his. Annie, wanting nothing more than to save Chris, ascends to Heaven, bringing Chris with her.</p>

<p>Chris and Annie are reunited with their children in Heaven, and all appearances are restored. Chris proposes reincarnation, so he and Annie can experience life together again. The film ends with Chris and Annie meeting again as young children in a situation that parallels their first meeting.&quot;<br/>

<p>So even those that don&#39;t believe it exist, could go there? I don&#39;t feel that&#39;s true because we (mentally) can <em>create</em> what we experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they are both the same exact amount of fake... Just like Jesus and Hell... if RoboCop told me to duck cause ED-209 was gonna shoot at me... I&#39;d duck... cause if RoboCop is real... then I betch ED-209 is too... If Luke Skywalker told me to go find C3P0... I&#39;d prolly see if I could find him... I wouldn&#39;t be like &quot;Fuck you Luke... C3P0 isn&#39;t real.&quot; </p>
