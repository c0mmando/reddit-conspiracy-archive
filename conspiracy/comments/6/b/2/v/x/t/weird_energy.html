    <div class="md"><p>You have the ability to manipulate your aura. You are doing energy work with a focused attention.</p>

<p>One explanation is that when you focus on a certain area of your body and feel that tingly rush what you are doing is opening up the kriyas. Kriyas in general are .. consider them this way... there are millions of of microscopic energy points swirling in our aura. Some of the points become blocked through many ways. In general holding energy in one place too long will create a blockage or accumulation.</p>

<p>Now with kundalini, one of the points of it is to open these kriyas. I when you do kundalini or Tantra, this is precisely what happens. Usually though the body will spontaneously react with these are opened and the resulting from the body takes is usually also called a kriya. As anyone who has actually done Tantra can tell you , you can feel it when the kriyas are open and it is just like an adrenaline rush and total body buzz, tingling.</p>

<p>If any want a quick Tantra exercise ask. </p>

<p>But I think what you are doing is manipulating the kriyas in your aura. I would say this is just the beginning of this ability. Maybe you just need more info on the aura and the subtle energy body you are mastering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aha, gladly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simple I will just explain the method. Only preliminary is you probably want to be alone at first. best done lying down on a carpeted floor or mat with plenty of space around you. :) im not going to tell you what to expect. Just know it&#39;s harmless and very beneficial.</p>

<p>I call this The Swan.</p>

<p>First. Breathe in and out to the count of four expanding the length and depth to a comfortable relaxation of the body. Do a visual of white energy moving from head to toe and each part of the body relaxes as the light moves from head to toe. This is just to relax and keep the thoughts busy for a few moments.</p>

<p>Now the exercise:</p>

<p>While you inhale, move the light from Toe to the top of your Head while also making the verbal sound of Hahm.</p>

<p>Haaaaaahhhhhhmmmm.</p>

<p>Next exhale to the sound of Saaaaaaaaaaah.</p>

<p>Do this breathing, and visual, and sound ,for about 5-10 minutes.</p>

<p>The last part, I will say the amazing part, is to make one alteration in the exhalation and Sah.</p>

<p>Instead of one long drawn out Saaaaaaaaaah. You now do quick, choppy, short, fast, exhalation. So as to make the sound SahSahSahSahSahSahSahSahSah.</p>

<p>Godspeed, hahaha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its an instinctive feeling. Our animal, consciousness is gathering and collecting to a sharpened point of critical mass. There is an unprecedented, overload, of covert organized evil happening right now that is reverberating throughout mother nature, and karma is reaching a breaking point. </p>

<p>Mathew 24:4-8
4Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8All these are the beginning of birth pains.</p>

<p>See what is happening now is the slow laborious build up to the end of the world. If I had to say where we are at it would be the point of pregnancy where the baby flips upside down and starts slowly edging its way to the cervix.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that. Yea. That&#39;s a great description too. Weird part is it feels like it&#39;s something I already know, or something of that nature wants to be let out. ...Like some knowing about what we are. But it&#39;s not just me individually, it&#39;s also like the world is about to change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. That&#39;s spot on. It&#39;s like I&#39;m being called to go outside, like there is a secret that the natural world is screaming at me - but it&#39;s so loud I can&#39;t hear it. </p>

<p>And yes, it&#39;s like hyperawareness that something is happening, but there is nothing we can do to stop it. We just have to be ready for something... whatever that may be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve got a deep deception coming where apparently good ETs will sell us to employ coping strategies for tolerance of spiritual energy parasites, because they effectively work for the spiritual energy parasites, aka the dark, the fallen, the forces of evil. Evil is simply self-serving behavior at the expense of others. </p>

<p>Theft of people, places and things ultimately steals value from consciousness&#39; experience of existence. Spiritual energy parasites steal that value, joy, directly from consciousness, the most direct form of theft. This is where the path of evil leads. To be evil is to be a parasite. Consciousness makes this energy in loving, joyful states, and sheds it in fearful unpleasant states. So these spiritual energy thieves like to cause fear and suffering to release and collect this energy from others. </p>

<p>The Light™ says we should unconditionally love others, including these parasites. They&#39;ll say forgive others, all others, including these parasites. Then they&#39;ll continue to allow the infiltration, corruption, fear, suffering and energy theft of other races to continue. The Light™ is there to ensure that the perceived position benevolence occupies in our minds tolerates the Dark&#39;s spiritual energy harvesting, or else our good nature will persuade us to end it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how the Light™ works for the Dark. They are like HIV to the human immune system, which identifies, targets and eliminates parasitic creatures from our bodies. The Light™ disables the immune reaponse by convincing others to disable their fear, that fight or flight protection mode of life. The Light™ teaches others to not react as they virtually all initially feel and think from witnessing spiritual energy parasitism, which is to kill the parasites, of course. </p>

<p>This is how the duality, light/dark, polarity mind/body/spirit control system works in this area of the cosmos. The dark secretly molests your race through infiltration, corruption, causing dysfunction, fear and suffering and also uses subtle, covert behavior modification technologies that impose as our own thoughts. You can choose two prefabricated, allowed paths from the pressure. In the Dark, you can be a miserable, fearful, spiritual energy parasite that enjoys making others miserable. In the Light™, you can be an effortfully content, loving being that enjoys making others happier, but never can stop them from being molested by the Dark by employing effective strategies of controlling parasites like our bodies use.</p>

<p>Beings require fear and love to be independent, personally responsible beings. What good would a parent be without love? Or fear? Polarized beings are easier to control that those who balance love and fear. Their taboos can be played upon, which is a form of control by fear. The Light™ is controlled by the fear of appearing to be Dark. </p>
