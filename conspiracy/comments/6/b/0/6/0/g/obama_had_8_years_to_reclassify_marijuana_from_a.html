       The CIA is prevented by their charter from acting domestically.  They don't profit from drug related law enforcement actions that happen within our borders.  That would be the FBI and the for-profit-prison system.

       Yeah.  From wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Air America was an American passenger and cargo airline covertly owned by the US government in 1950 as a dummy corporation for Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operations in China. The CIA did not have enough work to keep the asset afloat and the National Security Council farmed the airline out to various government entities that included the USAF, US Army, USAID and for a brief time France. Essentially, Air America was used by the US government covertly to conduct military operations, posing as a civilian air carrier, in areas the US armed forces could not go due to treaty restraints contained in the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Accords.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Except for the name, there was nothing domestic about this airline.

       They meant that the CIA runs drugs to fund covert operations, not that they make money from federal funding.  Air America was a well known heroin transport line out of Laos and Cambodia; try somewhere other than Wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       And FYI, the war on drugs is fought overseas as well as at home.  And yes, the CIA receives federal funds to combat cartels overseas in the war on drugs.

       None of which matters, because reclassifying drugs here has nothing to do with what the CIA does in other countries.  Here, the supposed reason for enforcing any drug law is public safety.  But we don't give a shit about public safety in other countries.  In the places where we fight drug cartels overseas it's because their profits are used to fund wars, terrorism, destabilize governments that are friendly to us in favor of governments that are friendly to them, and buy weapons that are used to kill massive numbers of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can make pot 100% legal here and still be justified in chasing down cartels around the world who are growing or selling it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, domestic policy on pot has NOTHING to do with the CIA.

       Try regurgitating that garbage to CIA, DEA, and FBI agents who have been in Columbia since the '80s trying to stop cocaine from flooding our shores and see how hard they laugh at you.  "Let's legalize it here but still say we need to fight it overseas."

       So if we make pot (or all drugs) completely legal here, who will they sell it too?  Aren't we the biggest consumer of contraband?  Or anything for that matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that many signs point to some kind of conspiracy which sects of the CIA almost certainly have a hand in to keep drugs illegal here with the bonus that the CIA gets which is 
 A) continue the prison/industrial complex domestically 
B) Keep much of central/South America destabilized and hence not a threat/easy to control and sway.
       <br/>
       The warlords and drug cartels that run central/South America aren't being taken down for a reason, and I highly doubt that reason is we haven't found them.

       Bring on yet another set of downvotes for this comment, maybe even a ban.  But it's the truth, and has to be said:
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone who keeps saying "drugs" instead of "pot" is a fucking moron.  This is all within the context of why marijuana wasn't rescheduled, and the distinction is important.  Everyone who keeps making the argument you just made, or downvoting me because they are thinking it, is a moron.  The CIA doesn't profit from the prison industrial complex.  They don't own any, not even through shadow companies.  The money trail has been pretty thoroughly researched and documented in this area because our for-profit prison system is scandalous enough on it's own.  And anyone who thinks central and south american pot is a money source for the CIA has never bought any, at least not in the last 20 years or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weed that comes from there is "brick weed" and it's the nastiest thing you used to be able to find.  I couldn't get any now if I tried, because no one wants it anymore.  About 20 years ago it was the weed of last resort.  But what everyone wanted was kb from Canada.  And that's what people have been buying for 20 years.  Brick weed has faded, and Canadian pot has faded, because we are now able to get domestically grown weed of better quality without the risks of crossing the border with customs.  Anything grown outside of the country is no longer worth the risk, and that's been the case for at least the last 5 years.  There can't be any CIA conspiracy because the simple facts of the way the world has changed means the CIA couldn't have any interest in the domestic pot market anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF there is a conspiracy here, it's between the police unions/for-profit prison system and Obama.  But I think there would be enough interaction there that it would have been easy to follow.  IF there is a conspiracy, it does not involve the CIA.

       If you honestly believe that the CIA profits from the prosecution of pot users domestically, you don't have the mental resources to separate coincidence from conspiracy.  If they profit from pot at all, it's from it's production and sale, not arresting people.  Reclassifying pot would either have no effect on the CIA, or a positive one, if they are indeed doing anything involving pot domestically.

       What do yu think they are profiting off of?  The pot?  If you think that, you never buy any.  Shitty brick weed is all that gets imported from anywhere but Canada.  It is the weed of last resort.  And the cheapest shit there is.  The stuff people pay for, or used to, came from Canada, but I say used to, because that is being rapidly replaced by stuff sold here, since it's much easier to cross state borders than national ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who actually smoked pot knows the only way any federal agency could possibly have been profiting off of it for at least one, maybe two decades, is if they were operating a growery in canada, and that even if that was the case, that time has come and gone, unless the DEA can quadruple their budget so they can have the manpower to enforce the law in the states that have legalized it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's important to note, no matter what party your representative is a member of, it can't happen.  More than half of the U.S. has legalized some form of marijuana,  but the current classification is for drugs that are dangerous (lol) and have no medicinal use.  So most representatives can't vote to help the DEA without losing their jobs because their state has already voted in at least a minimum amount of support for some level of pot usage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if all the downvoters were right at some point in history, times have changed, and they changed before Obama took office.  This isn't a conspiracy.

       You should reconsider your notion of profit. If you bought a joint, smoked it and got superbly high off it, would you call it a net loss or gain for yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was no benefit- you wouldn't likely do it.

       The insurance companies did that. The ACA slowed it down.

       The entire point of feudalism is that you take the ruling class, and smash it into pieces.  Serfs answer to 'lords' (historically, a variety of titles were used), and lords answer to some sort of monarch, or royal court.  If you have a larger population, then some of the lords become middlemen - serfs will answer directly to someone like a baron, while a series of barons amswers to the lord.  Feudalism is all about giving the people an immediate regional representative
      </p>
      <p>
       This representation is imitated with the US congress, but it's a hollow imitation, because there is no contract between lord and vassal
      </p>
      <p>
       Feudalism worled for thousands of years because of the feudal contract, where lord and vassal both agree on their responsibilities and obligations to each other
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have now is a ruling class.  They aren't actually bound by anything to do what we want - hence the endless war in the east, the drug war, income inequality, private healthcare, etc

       Feudalism doesn't smash the ruling class into pieces, it grants the aristocracy absolute control of the arable land in their territory with which they use to exploit the peasant serfs who have no choice but to work for their lord to survive.

       Feudalism is literally the precursor to capitalism. With the death of manorialism in 16th century England, the feudal system evolved into agrarian capitalism which was then replaced by mercantilism during the age of discovery. In the mid 18th century the system shifted to industrial capitalism which led to our modern system of capitalism; the most dominant economic system for over a century, spread via globalization.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the problems we face with the aristocracy under capitalism are also present with the aristocracy under feudalism. If you think that becoming a serf will free you from the rich elite all you are going to get is a jew banker dick right up your ass.

       But that just sounds highly corruptable? In capitalism if my lord or boss is bad I can find a new contract. If it's the case with a lord, the other lords all still work for the same guy. There's no escaping it. Then it's a corrupt upper "royal" class that doesn't work and a lower class that has very rare or no chance for lateral movement.

       But...you just said it was an agent of the state ie: a lord giving contractual work to peasants. Sounds a lot like a business owner giving contractual work to the people, or a government giving out contractual work to citizens? How is that not similar?

       What gets me is the fact that he thinks feudalism is a solution to our modern day problem of having power concentrated in the hands of the few. Feudalism is like a blueprint for that sort of thing.

       We didn't have taxation under feudalism, we had sergeantry. The King owns all the land and the vassals pay tribute in the form of anything from gold to military service to grain. The contract varied from fief to fief.

       Even if I crafted a well thought out coherent and powerful piece, you'll just dismiss it, even might call me a shill or libtard. If you honestly believe, wholeheartedly, that there is the Democrats are actively helping illegals win, there is no amount of logic that would convince you otherwise.

       You're right, because I have seen enough evidence of it over the last eight years, not to mention Dems fighting for it before then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use as many logical fallacies as you'd like, the fact remains that Dems have pushed as hard as possible to make it easier for illegal aliens to vote, and have fought tooth and nail to keep ANY form of voter ID laws off the books.  "Voter ID laws are racist" you say? Tell that to Mexico and any number of third-first world countries that require AT LEAST one form of government issued ID to vote.  Walk into Harlem or Chicago and try patronizing the "poor minorities who can't even afford an ID," I'm sure they'd love that.

       This might have had more merit if it wasn't for the President of the United States granting amnesty. They are no longer considered illegal.

       This is, unfortunately for you, hearsay. It is literally "this is what Napolitano said" with no reporting or investigative journalism. Now if it did do those two things, it would have been a credible source. But alas, it is just a talking piece.

       Opinion piece trying to pass off as news. This might actually qualify as fake news but I don't care to make such a distinction. There are a lot of unverified claims. In fact this line from the article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "In terms of a check and balance that would prevent an individual who is a non U.S. citizen from registering to vote, that doesn't exist.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is a complete lie. Legal residents of the United States have the right to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I have no problem with these opinion pieces, but they are just that, opinions. I am sorry but if you consider this proof. Actual verifiable proof should have long swayed you that the Republicans have been practicing voter suppression, along with other atrocities committed by Republicans.

       Dems want illegals to get DLs.  Dems want to make getting a DL also automatically register you to vote.  Dems want illegals to be able to vote.
      </p>

       I understand that none of those articles contained a quote from a Democrat saying "well we just want to make it possible for illegals to vote," but that's what they're doing.

       You call making sure someone is who they say they are when they vote, voter suppression?  Countries around the world, including Mexico, have voter ID laws.  They're all racist atrocity committers too?

       I'm sure the self-righteousness of standing up for the oppressed feels good to you but, this is how the "oppressed" actually feel about voter ID laws:

       Again, you make extremely bold claims with no evidence to back this up. If it was so obvious, you would present some, at least lgoci dictates. No, Ami asking loaded questions to the uninformed public does not count. That is about as fluff news as you get. Instead, you should be using information gathered by studies.

       Asking black people in inner cities if they have IDs is pretty pertinent to claiming that voter ID laws are racist and disproportionately affect minorities.  How much more informed are you about minorities in inner cities than they are?

       You're the one claiming racism and "atrocities." I gave you articles that show what the Dems are doing and video interviews of the people affected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you're unable to see the truth unless it's spoonfed to you in a neat little quote or soundbite, doesn't mean the Democratic party has not actively pushed for measures that would allow illegal aliens to vote. Then cry racism (like you) when Republicans want to make sure only citizens vote.

       But fuck the integrity of our vote right?  Who gives a shit if illegals are voting in our elections as long as the Dems don't call us racist right?

       Had I posted five obscure links you would have bitched about that too.  You are wrong, and you know it, so instead of arguing the point you distract with garbage that has nothing to do with the subject at hand; being Dems using illegal aliens to pad their votes.  Go away and come back when you have something meaningful to say.

        As president, Hillary will build on the important steps announced today by rescheduling marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule II substance.

       Well I would say if you are 60% or more BLACK, then you are black.  The closer you get to 100%, the more you will have fully black features, culminating with 100% itself, being a full blooded black.  You could draw the line for BLACK as far back as 51% if you really wanted to, though I think that is disingenuous
      </p>
      <p>
       50-59% I would say is "mixed".  There are words for it; but for some reason they are all considered "offensive", so I won't be posting them here.  Again, you could draw the line for BLACK at 51% if want, but I think that is disingenuous
      </p>
      <p>
       Less than 50% is not black, for obvious reasons.  Someone with a decent % of black blood under 50% would be a mixed, but majority non black

       So what? That doesn't prevent other people from making such judgments. Objective scientific criteria don't oil the gears of social interactions. Ask anyone who 'looks a bit Muslim' or has a 'Muslim-sounding name', but isn't actually Muslim, if they're able to board a plane etc with the same ease as other white Christians.

       You do know Black is a race and Indonesian is an ethnicity, like Kenyan for example. Race is a concept used to divide people by class, not color. It has nothing to do with color, more to do with who gets rich, who stays rich and who stays poor.

       I think you have a serious misunderstanding of what race is. Race didn't exist until the 1700's to distinguish between who could have rights and who could not. Having rights directly affects the ability to own or have ownership. having ownership allows one to increase class status. Its a direct correlation.

       IQ is in no way relative to violent crime. Societies that have lower income typical (blacks, latinos) have higher crime regardless of intelligence. Race and class, once again, are directly correlated. Your argument is simply misinformed nonsense.

       IQ still has nothing to do with violent crime. That's a cherry picked argument altogether. Your argument sounds more like you're claiming people of a certain race have a certain IQ and commit most violent crime. You're neglecting the connection between race and class to support your intelligence argument, when anyone of any race could have low IQ and commit violent crime.

       Maybe you should research why instead of asking me. There's alot more to that question than you think. History shows migrants haven't always had it easier than blacks, and slavery didn't help blacks. Neither did Jim Crow. Blacks didn't have many rights until the 1950's and even then still were denied alot of opportunities. Also, modern migrants may have access to foreign scholarships like CAMP (college assistance migrant program).
      </p>
      <p>
       But just to end this argument, I'll just let you have your point. Blacks are stupid monkeys who can't read and commit crime and white are super awesome high IQ tax paying perfect people. There.  Happy?

       I think blacks would have been better off never coming to America at all. White would have had to farm their own land and resources, build their own railroads and roads. This country would have taken twice as long to be what is is today without free slave labor.

       I admit I was much less educated about this until you asked, there have been a few bills presented - 2011, 2012, and 2015.  Only the 2012 bill made it to congress, but clearly died.  It was reintroduced twice apparently, dying quickly each time.  I'd love to see the votes on that, while I'm sure Republicans voted against more often, I'm sure plenty of Democrats voted against it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways my basic opinion is that both parties are heavily lobbied by big pharma, who have good financial incentive to keep marijuana illegal.  The DEA is essentially non-partisan, and they recently reviewed the scheduling of marijuana and concluded it belongs as Schedule I.  They said there was no evidence of any medicinal benefit...  what the fuck!  There are literally mountains of evidence!  More than they can provide for many prescription drugs /rant
      </p>
      <p>
       Quick google search turned up
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_cannabis_from_Schedule_I_of_the_Controlled_Substances_Act">
        this wikipedia page
       </a>
       which included these notes (add '#2016' to the end of the main wikipedia page url to go to this section):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2016[edit]
In August 2016, the DEA rejected calls to reschedule marijuana, but indicated an increase in availability for research.[68]
The 2016 platform of the Democratic Party called for removal of marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, "providing a reasoned pathway for future legalization" of marijuana.[69] This language was approved in a close vote (81-80 vote) in the platform committee.[70]

      <p>
       So there is growing bipartisan support, but I seriously doubt it'll go anywhere.  It's important to remember these decisions aren't up to the president, he gets to sign or veto after the fact.  So while sure, Democrats seem more open to legalization, they aren't 100%.  I seriously doubt Hillary would have legalized it, Bernie would have but then again he wasn't really a democrat.

       Ya, that's cause there isn't any. Well, at least in their studies, which are all obfuscated to look that way.

      <p>
       They create dozens if not hundreds of tests to get the results they want, then throw out the rest and only use the ones that show the desired results. So ya, according to them there is no benefits.

       For a start, not reversing Obama's policy of lenient punishment for nonviolent drug offenders? Beyond that, IIRC Hillary said she'd reclassify marijuana as a schedule 2 drug and Sanders said it should be completely decriminalized. Instead we got a "God wants me to put drug users in jail". There's a difference.

       My point still stands. Sessions' new policy is put as many people in jail as possible, and he's very much against Marijuana decriminalization.

       Well Hillary got the push for legalization put onto the Democratic platform last July at the convention, for the first time ever. While Trump reaffirmed the push for total prohibition in the GOP platform during their convention. So their party platforms are one thing on the subject that's different.

       Good. "Unverified" is a valid tag. Anyone willing to step aside from the alarmism and the confirmation bias to find Trump guilty of something just because you don't like him, can clearly see that the "Trump is in bed with da Russians" reddit/mainstream-media circlejerk is a load of unverified sensationalist horseshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it, you want to believe it. So you blindly accept headlines and don't even fact-check the articles riddled with anonymous claims and exaggerated half-truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how badly you and millions of other people want "Trump is Putin's puppet" to be a verified fact, those of us who aren't brainwashed by party politics and who can still hold onto our critical thinking skills despite a worldwide media circus, are still waiting on ACTUAL evidence.

       Bullshit.  Republicans are the ones saying climate change is not as catastrophic as
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       scientists are claiming (as proved by climategate in 2009 where they were found to be cooking the numbers). And that we shouldn't gut American industry and pass laws that barely make sense in even the most dire of climate change projections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans are the ones that don't want the government to enforce a life tax on healthy Americans to subsidize unhealthy Americans who can't even take care of themselves (see massive rise in diabetes, heart attacks, and other weight related treatments).
      </p>
      <p>
       And I hate to break it to you but, people on both sides of the aisle are fighting for and against net neutrality, that one's a mixed bag.

       That's the beauty of secularism, religion doesn't make laws.  And the GOP is not a homogeneous religon, they are however (supposedly) all united in their desire for smaller government.  To argue against political policy because of someone's religion isn't very progressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro-life because babies are innocent. Pro-death because adults are supposed to know the consequences of their actions and take responsibility for them.  If you rape and murder you've given up your right to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a Republican, registered Dem, and not religious by any stretch of the imagination.  But the two party system blinds people from the legitimate concerns of their fellow Americans.  Why are your views more important than theirs?

       I'm not saying my views are right (I actually have a problem where I don't form opinions about things because I know how little I know) I just can't do the hypocrisy.  I understand that small government is the (R) calling card but too many rightwing law makers want their sky fairies rules to govern all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought babies are born with original sin... but still innocent?  More hypocrisy.  Also, all means all, not who we think is precious.

       I would argue vegans put less value on human life than animals and there is no hypocrisy there.  Women fighting for the hijab seems like brainwashing to me... they don't know any other existence.

       Right-wing law makers do what they do to pander to religious groups, no one in Washington is actually religious.  And those old GOPers are dying off, giving way to more pragmatic conservatives.

       You're asking me to defend religious notions after I told you I'm not religious and don't believe in them.

       Vegans putting more value on animal lives is the hypocrisy. All living creatures are supposed to be precious aren't they, including human lives?

       This is a perfect example of the kind of posts I love to see on reddit.  Personally I enjoy having my opinions challenged.  I can't say I love either party but I've always leaned Democrat (never voted Rep).  I guess the primaries left a bad taste in my mouth, and I expected Obama to do more to end the endless war we're in.

       There are good Republicans, truly fiscally conservative and socially liberal like Bill Weld. I have no problem voting for them, but they don't run the party now.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Democrats have their issues. Corporate democrats are a plague to the party. And the only cure is

       If you really believe both parties are the same, you're not paying attention. Example: minimum wage. While Bernie and Hillary were arguing over a $12 vs $15 an hour minimum wage, Trump was campaigning on

       Well at the very least she would have worked with her own party against the GOP. She ran on raising the minimum wage from before Bernie even entered the race, and it is part of the official Democratic platform.

       The Dems are never particularly harsh with Wall St, but the difference is still pronounced. You can't just take a hammer to it without tanking the economy. If the Republicans didn't keep going the other way, the small steps would actually add up to something.

       Read your links, thank you.  You have affected my opinion.  I can't say I'm 100% on board with either party, but maybe I'm being too much of an idealist.  I've never voted Republican in my life, but I've found myself more and more disenfranchised from the Democrats lately, especially after the primaries.  Again, thank you for the information.  I hope you're having a good day as well

       If I could give you a bit of advice;  Don't form your opinion using media, especially bullshit (news) that you find in this sub.  Find certain topics that are important to you and be mindful of bias while doing so.  It's going to take a couple of sources, but you'll end up finding places where you can reliably trust their judgement and reasoning in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       So once you've identified topics that are important to you, start researching how the parties vote.  Using their actions, you can come to a reasonably informed opinion on the differences between the parties.  They are quite pronounced on some issues and while the prevailing thought on this sub is that they're equally bad... that can only by said by those ignorant of party line votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say all of this as a Libertarian who is leaning a bit to the Left.  I specify that I'm leaning Left due to inadequacies in the Libertarian's fiscal platform when it comes to automation and their views on future fiscal policy.

       On the contrary, they promote a few wedge issues for people to fight over while they are actually unified on 90% of topics. Wedge issues typically have no major affect on the balance of power (transgender bathrooms for example) but then they file tax cuts for wealthy and global trade deals, etc.

       Literally the only stance that divides the two parties, at least among voter registration, is abortion. I've petitioned for signatures before for getting 3rd party candidates ballot access in the general election, and that's the only issue anyone cared about. They're both pro-war, they're both against self-ownership, they're both fiscally insolvent, ...
      </p>
      <p>
       It really bugged me that people only cared about abortion, especially since a wrong answer equaled no signature, meaning they don't even want to give you a chance on the ballot. Doesn't matter if you agree on 90% of other issues, even more so than either major party's candidate. They just care about abortion.

       The single issue voter like pro-choice / anti-abortion are part of the reason why it's so hard to break out of the 2 party system. But it doesn't mean they are the same. Democrats would not be trying to take away health care from 24 Million americans now. Democrats would not be trying to cut taxes for the top 1%. Democrats would not be trying to kill the EPA, pollute our rivers and streams to make corporations just a little richer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the 2 party system sucks and it's a false choice, but they are not the same.

      </p>
      <p>
       It's like, if you find a single gray hair on someone's head, all of a sudden blonde is the same as black, because you found some gray in both. The future of America, and the future of a lot of people's lives, is going to be vastly different because of this escalation in the war on drugs.

       Not sure if you're joking or not, because this sub has been full of partisan shit flinging for a while now.

       He ( his admin) locked Tommy Chong up for selling bongs but that is over and done with.  We are now dealing with sessions and a possible nation wide crack down on a new industry.  A move I must add goes against the Republicans beliefs.  It is anti-states rights, anti business  and anti-American economic progress.

       I'm not a Trump fan. I'm not an Obama fan (anymore... I was in 2008 though). I supported Bernie in the primaries but the DNC defrauded Bernie supporters out of $200 million and their time that could have been spent volunteering for a progressive who wasn't going to get cheated.

       He's definitely a right leaning Bernie supporter,  I have him tagged from the primaries and multiple Pro-Bernie subs.  I've also had countless people try and accuse me of being a Trump supporter when I'm on the complete other end of the spectrum.
      </p>

       These kind of attacks and accusations only serve to poison politics, it's the same nonsense that Republicans did with Obama calling him the worst President ever before he even took office.

       I just had a brief exchange with him.  Whatever you think it does to politics in general I have to be honest, I definitely don't think he is what he says he is.  He's super upset with Obama for not pardoning all the people in jail, but he doesn't care at all about Trump/Sessions bringing back mandatory minimums.  He blames Obama for them bringing back those harsh sentences.  It's just unreal.  My suspension of disbelief only goes so far.

       I just don't go in for the lesser of evils stuff.  If you vote for someone, you support them in my eyes.  When you vote for someone you're saying, "this person represents my values".

       Now that I have you here, a word on rescheduling.  Obamas executive actions did more to legalize than rescheduling ever would.  In fact the only reason the dispensaries stayed open is because of those executive actions.  Rescheduling does nothing whatsoever for dispensaries and less than nothing for recreational businesses.  They would still be illegal under the Controlled Substances Act.  The only thing that would change if it was moved to Schedule 2 is that the FDA would be able to approve medicines, most likely THC pills, to be approved by the FDA for sale by big pharma.  It would also allow for government research, but that's it.   Obamas executive actions were far more effective for medical dispensaries and the only thing that affected recreational businesses.

        Now that I have you here, a word on rescheduling. Obamas executive actions did more to legalize than rescheduling ever would. In fact the only reason the dispensaries stayed open is because of those executive actions. Rescheduling does nothing whatsoever for dispensaries and less than nothing for recreational businesses. They would still be illegal under the Controlled Substances Act. The only thing that would change if it was moved to Schedule 2 is that the FDA would be able to approve medicines, most likely THC pills, to be approved by the FDA for sale by big pharma. It would also allow for government research, but that's it. Obamas executive actions were far more effective for medical dispensaries and the only thing that affected recreational businesses.

       So what about all those people that Trump is now going to be putting in jail now that Sessions is ramping up the drug war and bringing back mandatory minimums for nonviolent offenders.  Why aren't you passionately defending them against Trump who has indicated he is going to be cracking down on recreational businesses in legal states?  I mean you do share responsibility for him being in office and Trump did lie that he would leave it up to the states before the election.

       Like Sessions said himself. If you don't like it we should have changed the laws. Democrats had that opportunity to change the laws or reschedule the drug and they did neither.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats (Clintons specifically) made mandatory minimum sentencing worse on drugs. Why would we trust them to do anything better?

       Yeah, now I definitely don't believe you are what you say you are.  Either that or t_D has warped your thought process.  Obama via Holder had just as much ability to prioritize enforcement of substances banned by the CSA as Trump via Sessions.  It's called enforcement discretion.  Obama used it to help users and Trump is using it to hurt them.  Democrats and Republicans made mandatory minimum sentencing worse on drugs.  There's literally no difference there.  The only difference is Democrats have been working to relax those laws as of late and Republicans are bringing them back.  I would trust them to do something better because they have been doing something better.  Wow have they got you turned around.

       Well you clearly are already since multiple people have posted your shenanigans over at r/t_d. What the democrats did was pretty selfish trying to shove Clinton down your throat, but I think that it's pretty naive to assume that you weren't played by the republicans in the process who now seem to be in the process of transforming your country into some sort of Authoritarian dictatorship. So have fun with that.

He literally just had Comey fired because he was getting worried about that investigation concerning Russia.

       Well I cast my vote in Iowa so it honestly didn't make any difference who I voted for.

      <p>
       What I did
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to do was warn Clinton supporters that she was a liability. Democrats didn't want to hold her or the DNC accountable for their actions though. I wonder if they have cognitive dissonance for not listening to our warnings.

       You wouldn't be commenting today about this if Democrats didn't subvert our democracy and defraud Bernie supporters out of over $200 million. You'd be thanking "President Sanders" for what he had already accomplished :) After all, he was the highest polling candidate in the general election. I don't fucking know why the most popular candidates in our country aren't allowed to be on the ballot. It doesn't make much sense.

       Fuck FPTP. We need scored ballots. Anyway I will GLADLY support Dems again if they:

      <ul>
       <li>
        Issue a formal apology for the rigging of the 2016 primaries + defrauding us out of over $200 million this apology can also come in the form of $$ ;)

       Well I gotta head off to bed, but I'll end by saying that once again, I do agree that what the DNC did with Clinton was complete bullshit ("But it was her turn!" as they kept saying, lol) and as a result they ostracised a large number of their supporters such as yourself who are now so bitter about what they did that you're literally willing to watch an overgrown manchild slowly tear your country apart from the inside.

       That's not a shot at you by the way, it's fair enough if you're upset, but it's kinda messed up that there is still almost 4 years of Trump to go in the Whitehouse.

       As a progressive I value my ability to influence politics through democracy much more than small progressive wins we are "given" by the elite few who control our elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our grassroots movement made Bernie the most popular general election candidate available among ALL voters (not just Democrats). If our democratic process actually represented the people, Bernie would have been on that ballot and we wouldn't be bitching about Trump right now. He'd probably be off making a new TV show or something.

       Your post history is just full of anti democrat, anti Bernie. And when news comes out about how Trumps AG is going to crack down on weed, you make a post that essentially becomes "but but what about Obama and his drug policies" to deflect.

       Good luck though. Yes, I voted for Trump but lesser of two evils does not mean you support someone. I was a Democrat for 10 years. I caucused for Bernie in Iowa and donated to his campaign multiple times. I left the Democratic Party in June after we found out that the Democratic Party was subverting our democracy, rigging the primaries, and defrauding us out of over $200 million.

       Yeah I got called out on it and nobody has done shit except call me out. There is no proof out there that says I'm a Trump supporter. Trump voter, yes. But Trump supporter, no. Instead, what you will find is me getting involved in Bernie's campaign early on. I started supporting him early on in 2015, I volunteered for his campaign during the IA caucuses and donated to him multiple times. I only left the Democratic Party (after 10 years) after we all discovered the truth that Democrats were subverting our democracy, cheating progressives, and defrauding us out of over $200 million.

      <p>
       Lesser of two evils does not mean you support either.

       You voted for Trump and posted a "rare pepe" to thank The Donald for their work.... There you go, wanna fuck off yourself then, or edit to reflect the fact that you were being super disingenuous?

       For how high and mighty and triggered you became, this sure was easy.

       You're so disingenuous I don't need to continue this discussion. It took all of ten seconds to find your post about supporting the Donald with a vote and a rare Pepe. Pretend all you want (I see how triggered you are) but you clearly have a pro trump agenda.

       Do you know how many federal raids there were under Obama on facilities in total compliance with local laws?  Just because the news didn't tell he upped the war on drugs doesn't mean he didn't.

       It's not deflection, it's reminding people in this time of hysteria that the last guy wasn't so great either, maybe take things in context.

       Exactly. There's no point to compare Trump to Obama because what Trumo is doing is shitty in its own right and doesn't need to be compared to Obama.

       He started out against gay marriage and look where we are now. He conceded that MJ should be decriminalized when he left office, I think that was actually pretty huge. He's the first black pres man, and one who was very conscious of this image, I honestly never saw him legalizing weed, but he did change course with enforcement in his second term and finally conceded the point. Look at how much progress legalization had made in the last eight years - you can knock him for not being hpbehind it but you've also got to give him credit for letting the states do their own thing and taking a step back. Sessions is going full bore the other way.

       He pardoned many nonviolent drug offenders during his last year in office. Are you familiar with the organized legalization movement? This has been their approach, to applaud gradual progress and not demand everything all at once. Patience has paid off. There is still a long way to go.

       Im not sure about CO, but in CA the credit unions wont touch pot shops, even though they're privately insured. Until it's not federally illegal, any FDIC bank can't touch them.

       I do not believe that was still the case during his second term. You also have to consider how many more dispensaries were in existence compared to the Bush years. I don't believe there were any during Bush Sr.?

       Are you SERIOUSLY giving credit to Obama for the fact that there were more pot dispensaries in the United States in 2016 that there were in 1993?  19,ninety-FUCKING-three?!?!  I dont understand why some people try so hard to defend Obama on this topic.  Any advances made were made in spite of him. Stop your fucking shit.

       No he is not.  He is stating that there were much more pot dispensaries during Obama's term.   Which mathematically would lead to more dispensaries being raided.

       Even though you completely misunderstood what was said you're still wrong. Obama did more for contributing to eventual legalization than any of his predecessors just by lowering penalties on low level drug offenses. The Trump administration has undone that progress entirely.

       Illegally operating based on state law operation were raided.  On top of that During the Bush years there were only a handful of medical states.  Under Obama just about half the country went medical and a good number legal.  On top of the on top the President does not micro mange everything the Federal government does.

       He had the chance to bring everyone black and white together. Instead he made relations worse IMO.

       No shit. But what the Trump administration is doing is reversing an Obama-era action to lower penalties on drug offenses. So it turns out that Obama took a positive action and Trump is reversing it. Obama was moving in a good direction, Trump is moving in a bad direction. And you're talking about how bad Obama was. Well let me tell you what your god emperor is doing.

       Easy thing to say considering his job is no longer making laws.  Maybe strong enforcement will force legislatures to fix the problem properly instead of giving law enforcement another subjective tool/hammer to use at their whim.

       You're right, it's not only marijuana, it's all drugs. This is a 2013 directive, telling prosecutors to avoid charging offenses that would trigger minimum sentences in case the defendant is not violent or a criminal:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/HolderMandatoryMinimumsMemo.pdf">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of the two directives mentioned explicitly in Sessions' new "put as many people in jail as possible" policy, in a footnote in the second page:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/12/us/document-Sessions-Charging-Memo.html?_r=0">

       It means that if you're a marijuana user, you will get harsher sentences now than before.

       Why rely on depending on the will of the justice department to either enforce or relax enforcement of certain laws? Just get rid of the law, right? I know I, for one, applaud the Sessions' justice department for stepping up enforcement of our immigration laws. The only diffeerence here is this is a law we all don't like or agree with. So we should be encouraging changing the laws fundamentally, not wishing for our leaders to just ignore laws we don't like.

       Sessions is forcing the Legislative Branch to actually own up to their laws. If they don't want people going to jail for nonviolent and drug crimes, they need to write laws that say so. It shouldn't be up to the cop and judge to decide how they feel about your case.
      </p>
      <p>
       The judicial branch should always be charging equal punishments for equal crimes. This is a push to prevent judges from acting as law makers from the bench. And for all crimes, not just drug crimes.

       Actually he didn't prohibit federal agencies from upholding federal law against large scale producers. In 2014, however, he was also the one who got legislation passed to put spending laws on federal agents trying to raid dispensaries in states it was legal. Right around the time CO and WA showed success in making recreational use legal.

       You may be right in that he didn't give the order.  Anyone who is in a position of power knows though that they are responsible for what goes on under them.  Some ppl may blame those under them, but those are not leaders imo.

       "Look, at least these politicians are trying to make lives better for the slaves. It's not perfect but it's progress."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the exact same. Sometimes there is right or wrong. I bet if Obama was the guy in my fabricated quote above people from /all would still be all over his dick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me again how Democrats have good judgment and human compassion please. You guys can repeat "he did more than Republicans" all you want but that did fuck all for the people rotting their lives away in prison for nonviolent crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big Billy Clinton signed the '94 Crime Bill that disproportionately harmed minorities and caused many of those non violent criminals to be there in the first place. Anybody that tries to counter this with "oh but the black caucus supported it" can fuck off as well. Have we not already seen how many times politicians do something terrible under the guise of something good? e.g. The PATRIOT Act, Iraq War, Vietnam, drug war, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes in hindsight you can see what mistakes you've made. Hillary had to speak a lot about hindsight. Personally I see "hindsight" as just another way to get out of any real responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some examples: Clinton did not support gay marriage until it no longer mattered politically, supported the Iraq War, supported unconstitutional spying, would have continued rotting away prisoners lives for nonviolent crimes, stored SAP docs on a private email server less secure than a public Gmail account, she cosponsored the Flag Protection Act of 2005, she fully supported the '94 Crime Bill, her husband who she constantly defended signed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, I think my point is made).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why Bernie's campaign did so well, because he had good
       <em>
        foresight
       </em>
       . In most of the big Democrat screw ups you can find a video of Sanders warning the country about what was going to happen. His campaign did quite well except for the fact that Clinton and the DNC lied to Americans, subverted our democracy and defrauded us out of over $200 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I love that everyone from /all keeps saying "now is the time to unite against Trump". Well,
        <em>
         we already fucking did that
        </em>
        , and they cheated the American people. We had a strong grassroots movement in Sanders but Dems cheated him. He was the highest polling candidate in the general election so why the fuck wasn't he on the ballot?

       Obama's actions leaves the door open for Republican abuse, which in turn inspires voters to vote democrat.  It's literally a strategical move at the expense of the voters.  If Obama descheduled Marijuana, Trump rescheduling it would be a disaster and he couldn't do it.  But instead using the dangerous policy of selective enforcement, Trump can come in and selectively enforce and piss just enough people off to vote democrat in 2020 or 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, I am going to blame Obama for not getting it right.  Both parties suck and trying to compare them is like trying to decide your lunch is going to be a douchebag or a turd sandwich.

       Apologist. A majority of the public wanted it and he used to do it. There are also many studies to state that it is non-harmful. He could have endorsed it and allowed it's legalization. That way, as I understand from a book that I have read, it could be kept in the hands of small business (not sure how that works, but if anyone can explain the excerpt from

       The president doesn't have the power to reclassify drugs. There are only two ways to do that. Either through congress, or through the AG.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       There were several petitions during Obama's terms send to the AG and all of them ended up in front of a court. The last one in 2013. The court ruled that marijuana has no accepted medical use and therefore will remain under Schedule 1. As long as this ruling stands, and this is not something the president can change, there will be no reclassification (unless you bring the congress together to write a pro-marijuana law).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also a catch-22. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 drug and therefore you can't really do research on it. Without research you can't show possible medical treatments. And without that it will be hard to give evidence to a court to overrule the standing.

       This is flatly untrue, especially for cannabis, which is a brachiodilatotor. Swimmers often smoke for precisely that reason. There are several herbs that can alleviate coughing and such by being smoked.

       Smoking itself is not harmful. Thats like saying contrails are harmful... it depends how often your actually smoking. The ocasional toker will see no ill effects at all. Hell the daily user who smokes at night will probably never get any harm done from it.

       Yeah not sure that I agree with this. You're still putting carbon into your lungs. You put carbon in your lungs every day passively to differing levels, but by smoking you're putting it in intentionally.

       You overestimate carbon and underestimate your lungs. The fact that you added "everyday" shows you are aware of this too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drink enough water and you'll have a splitting headache, feel the need to lie down, and never wake up. Everything is toxic. Dosage is what matters. A daily joint won't give you toxicity of anything, and your lungs will be just fine, if not in better condition assuming you live an otherwise healthy lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaping should still be advocated for though. Smoking is bad for you in other ways, like fucking your skin up. While cannabis contains properties beneficial for skin, smoking cancels them out.

       Yeah look, I'm happy to be proven wrong, but I've seen the lungs of someone who was a non smoker who lived in a city (allegedly) and there was a fair bit of carbon in them to the point that its hard to imagine it not affecting lung function. By inhaling smoke you're adding to it, and if you look at it over years I'm pretty sure you'd see damage.

       i dont smoke it.... i make a tea with it. from what i can see its not harmful. all studies i have read suggest its not actually harmful and may actually be very beneficial. to be clear i have also read studies that suggest it could be harmful but so far only if smoked. I agree that anything "smoked" must be harmful in one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       the one thing that winds me up is why its illegal  though. are they trying to protect my health? why do they care? i can buy bleach and down the bottle... i can buy a pen ad shove it in my eye.... wheres the line? why do they care??? they dont! the only thing i can see is that more studies prove its beneficial factors and it being a free plant is not good for some powerful businesses. it seems more of a power move than a health move in the legalization factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       since the internet and free speech is increasing i imagine it will be impossible to stop the legalization eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
       i am of the view that all drugs should be legalized...  educate people of the harm and benefits of all drugs and let the adult make their own mind up of whether they want it or not. who am i or u, to tell another human being they cant put "that" in their body!?!?!

       It was illegalised as part of the "War on Crime" that emerged after the Civil Rights movement as the new method of subjugating minorities once the colour of their skin wasn't legally inferior. It has been used to fuel the system of mass incarceration in America that makes billions of dollars for private corporations at the expense of the taxpayer. It's absolutely nothing to do with health

       While I agree with your sentiment this is slightly untrue. Marjiuana became illegal in the 1930's, not in 1965 when LBJ began his "war on crime." The timing was connected to two things: the end of prohibition of alcohol (1933), and the influx of Mexican citizens following the Mexican Revolution (early 1900's, 1910-1920ish).
      </p>
      <p>
       Harry S. Anslinger was the man in charge of the bureau of prohibition  when it came time for prohibition to end, and he quickly realized his job was about to not exist anymore. So he started investigating. My memory is slightly failing me on exact numbers but I believe he had 31 scientists research marijuana to find if it was harmful. About of those ~31, only 2 came to the conclusion it was harmful. Harry S. Anslinger used the opinion of those two scientists to convince congress that marijuana needed to be illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a huge racist element to it. This is actually when "marjiuana" 'became a common term for cannabis, this was done intentionally so people would associate it with the Mexican citizens who already had a negative stigma in the eyes of many Americans. Look up some quotes from Harry S. Anslinger, there would be large scale public outcry today if a politican/public servant said even as close to the openly racist shit that came out of his mouth. One of the most shocking things being he claimed that black men used marijuana to give to white women so they can sleep with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the novel but this is important to talk about because we are still enforcing a law created by an openly racist and vile man, I don't understand how people can claim that marijuana is illegal because it's dangerous. No, marijuana prohibition is rooted in racism, straight from the mouth of the man who created it. Of course LBJ and Nixon are both guilty of using marijuana prohibition to lock up civil rights activists, hippies and protest leaders but the true roots of its illegalization is a different kind of sinister. I would encourage everyone to read more into this time period and how the government managed to manipulate and change the population's view of marijuana so quickly. It's very interesting.

       Thank you for the extra information. I guess I got confused with Nixon's use of the illegality of the drug to target minorities, thinking that he was the one who made it illegal, when he was just giving it a bigger platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll look more in to Anslinger. Thanks for the heads up, I've been really looking closer at this sort of thing and each time you think you've discovered the extent of the evil, you open another can of worms and see how much deeper the rot goes.

       It was illegalised for many reasons. I've since learnt I was wrong about what I said (see the other reply to my comment). I suppose what I should have said is that the War on Drugs was  used to drive the system of mass incarceration and oppress minorities (especially black Americans).
      </p>
      <p>
       I still believe that racism was a big factor in it's prohibition, but I'm sure you're certainly right about the rest of it. I think the main thing is at the end of the day, it was all about corporate interests, and money. I'm sure they would have done it to white people too if they could have gotten away with it

       Happy to share my method of weed tea making dude:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) get some butter (anything fatty will do as thc is not soluble in water). i like to use around two tea spoons worth and stick it in a pan
2) grind some bud (i do between 0.25 and 0.5 grams at a time and mix it with the butter. If feeling lazy can just heat up the butter in the pan and pour in your ground weed
3) put in water, a couple of cups worth as it will evaporate. bring to boil then turn down heat to simmer
4) simmer for 45m to 1hr and top up water every 15m.
      </p>
      <p>
       done! add tea bags for flavor if you like or drink as is 
Can filter the bits out with a strainer if you want (i dont bother). the juice now contains all the dissolved thc :)

       Well to answer the "Why do they care what I do with my body" argument people always throw out. Because we live in a country with increasing social benefits and governmental assistance; legalizing drugs will only increase the amount of people utilizing these services. So the tax payer is paying for their kids, food and medical bills meanwhile they're spending what little they have on drugs.

       Saying it's harmful because inhaling smoke is bad doesn't mean it is bad itself. It just means the way people are using it isn't good. You can get all the positive from it by eating it without the negative side effects of smoking.

       It's disingenuous to suggest it's harmless when the way the vast majority of people use it is harmful.  I'm all for complete legalization, but I've seen a lot of disinformation from both sides.

       You are saying it's harmful because inhaling smoke is bad, I'm saying you don't have to smoke it. Point out something that is actually bad about using it that doesn't involve smoke in your lungs is bad.
      </p>

       There are a lot of things that are bad for you when you misuse them. That doesn't make them inherently bad.

       That's just not true. There have been multiple long-term studies that confirmed that regular use of marijuana that began before the brain fully matured impacted intellectual development, resulting in adults with lowered cognitive capacity, slower thought processes, and lowered overall IQ.

       Your ingesting of something that impairs mental function makes you a danger to yourself and others. If you secluded yourself to a desert island, then sure, heroin it up. But while you live in a society where your actions affect more then yourself, you have a certain responsibility to notake poor decisions.

       There is no excuse for someone on a bender to take up a hospital bed that could be better used to care for someone who fell ill, or suffered an accident, or some such.

      <p>
       And yes, weed does make you stupid and slow. It lowers your cognitive capacity significantly while the drug is in your system. Don't believe me, fine. It's easy to test. Grab a fifth grade math workbook, and try solving the problems whole sober. Then get high and try again. You'll notice the difference eventually, once enough of the drug has left your system for your brain to recover enough function to notice.

       Here's the thing Mr. Smartypants, I'm an engineering student who does far beyond the average 5th grade math problem on a fairly consistent basis. To take things further, you openly admitted to never ingesting drugs yet go on to describe what it will concretely do to someone who has. It would seem as if you have no idea what you're talking about seeing as how you already predicated your entire statement with the fact that you have no first hand experience with the effects of drugs. You can sit here and tell me that someone in your family is why you are so against drugs. Sorry, it wasn't the drugs that made uncle Billy a failure, its Billy.

       That is the most vague and generalized excuse for an argument I have ever read. Hyperbole. Woah. Digression. Anyways, if you are going to provide such a broad idea, you better back it up with more than people taking up hospital beds. This implies you believe all people who ingest things you don't think they should are in the hospital and that there is some shortage-of-hospital-beds pandemic sweeping the world. This is comical and most undoubtedly false.

       Weed does not make you stupid or slow. You also just stated you don't use it so how can you make such a broad generalization like that? My friend is a aquatic engineer who designs underwater pipelines for major corporations and he's been smoking weed since he was a teenager, and there are plenty of people in other fields of occupation just like him. Just because some people who smoke weed aren't as intelligent as others doesn't mean weed is the reason. Soda and fried food makes people fat too right? I drink soda often and I love fried chicken and I don't have diabetes nor am I even close to being overweight. Marijuana can be harmful and can impair early brain development but to say it makes people slow and stupid is downright incorrect. You seem to think you're intelligent, so, maybe you should try it and see if it makes you stupid, before you outright bash it by regurgitating something you read or heard elsewhere.

        The findings of this early study suggest that regular marijuana smoking results in symptoms similar to that of tobacco smoking with an increased incidence of chronic cough, sputum production, wheeze and episodes of acute bronchitis. These results have been replicated in subsequent longitudinal studies involving random or selected samples of populations in the USA.[4,15] Importantly, significant symptoms were reported with less than one marijuana cigarette smoked per day on average.[15] This suggests that respiratory symptoms can occur with fewer marijuana cigarettes than with tobacco cigarettes. This again may be related to the way marijuana is rolled and smoked.

       Vaping it isn't harmful. Eating it isn't harmful. Drinking it isn't harmful. Smoking anything is harmful, but cannabis can be consumed in many ways which are virtually, if not quite literally, harmless. Cannabis isn't harmless, only the smoking method of consumption.

       He's probably talking about a weed vaporizer, not an e-liquid vaporizer.  A weed vaporizer just heats up the air enough to turn the THC into a gas.  You're literally just inhaling warm air and cannabinoids.  It's not harmful.

       I was referring to dry herb vaporizers specifically. I should've specified that. I do agree that e-liquid vapes are likely harmful, and as such I steer clear of them, but dry herb vapes such as the Pax simply heat up the herb until the THC is released.

       Every seizure victim, who seizes in public, is considered to be a ''SCUMBAG JUNKY ASSHOLE FUCK IN ###MY TOWN'' to all cops, without exception. The dazed seizure victim, cannot immediately comply with lightning speed to the conflicting demands of the three cops who are code red called to the scene to deal with the ''druggie heroinning out on the sidewalk''. At once the three yell ''Dont you fucking move [all caps]'' and ''Hands out to your side'' and ''hands behind your back''. And then the violence begins. 100 questions per minute are barked from all three mouths , fingers poking in the chest, cuffs as tight as lug nuts on a tractor trailer.
       <br/>
       Hey,  what were you saying about harmful?
       <br/>
       Science says that 80% or so people with seizure issues, find relief from cannabis. Regular weed has worked well for me for 20 years, without being particular about seeking out cbd. Thc works fine for me too. Huh.
       <br/>
       Anyway, I haven't been roughed up by the cops in over 20 years. I feel less harmed. Purely anecdotal.

       I can and did. Much easier than when I quit drinking. I've actually quit smoking weed a few times for a couple years at a time with absolutely no fanfare. It's absolutely not like alcohol or cigarettes or anything that is actually addicting. And this is coming from someone who smoked through the day for multiple years the first time I quit. It's not hard. There's no withdrawal. Maybe a little but of boredom for a couple days but that's it.

       Lol no withdrawal, you've clearly never smoked weed. There is a withdrawl process.
      </p>
      <p>
       After quitting you start to get your REM sleep stage back, which allows you to have dreams again. As your body rids its self of the THC metabolites in your blood you can have headaches and have even fuzzier memory than when you smoked. The insomnia starts going away after a week, along with the night sweats from your body detoxing.
      </p>
      <p>
       After two weeks, your appetite begins to normalize, and lung function improves significantly. After three weeks, the full effects of lethargy, which is often mistaken as depression by pot smokers is almost gone, along with anxiety of not smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please, tell me more about there being no side effects of smoking weed.

       At the risk of me regressing to a middle schooler, let me actually make the correction:

       Because tbh with you, there's not a person I know (including myself a few years ago) who was a daily smoker who would argue that marijuana is addictive. It's like cigarettes except that most people who smoke weed don't smoke it as people who smoke tobacco smoke tobacco.
      </p>
      <p>
       You smoke weed on the daily: you get addicted. Not mentally, physically. You may not realize it at first but if you stop smoking, you'll have physical withdrawals. You'll get sick; you'll get headaches, you'll get nausea, you'll get body chills, you'll get insomnia, you'll get irritable. Anyone who's a real stoner (as opposed to a social smoker) will know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm actually a huge advocate of marijuana. But I'm a bigger advocate of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like alcohol. Most people who drink alcohol will never end alcoholics. But that doesn't mean alcohol addiction isn't real.

       It's chemicals that affect your brain and how it functions, and over time will change the chemistry of your brain and how it functions to where you can become dependent on it.

       Sure it's not on the same level as opioids, but let's not pretend THC is the same as a WoW addiction or something.

       Obama did more to normalize MJ use than any other president. I know that most of us wanted more from him, but the implication that he could have done more simply because the public wanted him to is very naive. I have to say, the OP does look like a deflection from the Jeff Sessions announcement today.

       He sure went all out into making gay marriage federally legal, probably because he was gay "at one time". After all, he "almost" got into a permanent gay relationship before meeting his wife, which he revealed in his latest memior.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was more of a stretch than to endorse state approval of a misclassified medicinal plant. It is possible that he was helping his interests and donors in the pharma field, as he also had notably helped the insurance companies further dwindle the middle class with Obamacare and governmental fines forcing them into a system that is now so corrupt, that even basic healthcare is simply unaffordable for the middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is probably more to him not endorsing pot. I can see why he wouldn't make it legal or endorse, as EVERYONE would be smoking it because "Mr. President said it was okay", queue little Timmy in 3rd grade lighting up. Plus Pot allows people to think about how bad the government/corporate married establishment has been screwing us and it's quite possible that the system might have to restructure in one way or another, which is bad because they have most people right where they want them, angry, in debt and working in a rut with no hope. Imagine if little Timmy realized the inherent repressiveness of the system at a young age. He probably wouldn't be busting his ass and worrying about never ending debt. He would probably just do something else to be happy and not live the "American Dream" which mostly leads to trying to obtain what you can't afford. This would obviously be bad for the government because a larger number of people may choose to live within their means and that's bad for the greed based economy... Just some ramblings of a non-conformist.

       It wasn't detrimental to any business—that's my point. Obama was perfectly happy to help legalize gay marriage because doing so had no negative repercussions for the Democratic Party. That's not the case for MJ legalization.

       This line of thought leads us to the possibility that he was complicit in serving Big Pharma and/or the Health Industry as a whole, over the needs of the people. It is a medicine after all, one that provides varying amounts of relief and could prevent a considerable amount of doctor calls and medicine.

       "The president's [Obama] response, and that of his attorney general, is that it's a job for Congress. But that's not true, says Brookings Institution Senior Fellow John Hudak. According to a report authored by Hudak and Grace Wallack, the federal Controlled Substances Act clearly details a process by which the administration can take marijuana out of the drug schedules or, at the least, lower its schedule so that medical research can proceed."

       It isn't habit forming. If anything, it's addictive, but only for compulsive types who become addicted to any old thing from which they derive pleasure. It's not chemically addictive, i.e. it is not habit forming, at least it's never been proven to be empirically, any way.

       I wouldn't say that. I'm all for legalization but there's plenty of people I dare a majority even if 60/40 that are against legal marijuana. There's still tons of conservative religious people in the US.

       It still comes across as hypocritical. You could have provided the source.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what you're talking about it's a grandiose claim to say "I think majority  of the people want it." So not asking the person who says "Most everyone wants it" for a source but asking me who said "I think it could be as low as 60/40" (a far more reasonable statement IMO) for a source seems hypocritical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way 57% is just over a majority so OP claims of "most everyone wants it" is wrong. It's in reality "a bit more than half want it." Now if it was 75% or higher I'd agree with y'all.

       It is grown from the earth and has high medicinal value. It is the right of the inhabitants of this earth to utilize it to heal themselves. One could say that God himself created it, same as Kratom, to ease suffering. So some people use it to get blotto. There is no way to directly die from its consumption. Fucking let them. Life is hard. Propaganda for selfish greed, allowing needless suffering, is intolerable.

       I agree it should be determined by the people but the fact of the matter is that it's a huge revenue stream so the states and fed are going to get involved in hopes of getting profit from it. Either be from legalization taxes or from the courts and prison system from enforcing it. In my state Ohio there was talks of legalizing it but the people found out it was a scheme to make the same rich people that started the legalization campaign even richer as they used the law to buy all the farms that would be allowed to grow that weed.

       This is not true. It is addictive. That's why it's in the DSM-V and listed as such. Much more research to show it's addictive than not. I think it should be legalized. But don't delude yourself. There are an enormous amount of people treated every year for cannabis addiction. Mental health counselor here.

       She's more dishonest than your typical politician.  She was a part of the "tough on crime" effort in the 90's.  She voted to authorize the Iraq war.  She voted for the Patriot Act.  She advocated allowing gun manufacturers to be sued for crimes committed with their guns.  She's a Corporatist.  She damaged the credibility of the DNC as an independent forum.  I didn't find her conversion on gay marriage sincere or believable.  She wouldn't support states legalizing recreational mj and hinted at clamping down on them.
      </p>

       More than anything, I just don't find her trustworthy.  I think she would have continued to get us involved in conflicts we have no business being in.

       I'm reallllllllly not a fan of the Trump administration apparently doubling down on the drug war. I think it's an unforgivable and backwards approach to take.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think referencing the lack of action by the Obama administration is a 'distraction' - I think it shows that regardless of how different two administrations may seem, they both follow the same set of rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doubling down on the drug war is only possible due to the Obama administration's inaction.

       How do you figure?  The Trump admin could immediately reverse any changes the Obama admin made to drug scheduling.  Any lasting change would have had to go through a Congress which wasn't friendly to relaxing the war.  I agree that the Obama admin is remiss in not changing the scheduling, but that shouldn't overshadow the progress made on relaxing federal sentencing for nonviolent crime and the allowance of states to make their own laws regarding recreational use, something that almost certainly wouldn't have been allowed under a Republican administration and certainly wouldn't have happened if Trump were president when Obama was.

      <p>
       That's a misunderstanding. The states that made their own laws regarding recreational use are still in violation of federal law - the lack of enforcement by the Obama administration doesn't change the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       My whole point is that there really isn't much of a difference between the two parties when it comes to drug policy. Democrats play slightly more 'good cop' while Republicans play slightly more 'bad cop.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama could have reclassified it but didn't. He CHOSE not to. He also could have used the bully pulpit to push for the issue, but seeing as he didn't even attempt to reclassify it, Congress' inaction isn't really much of a story.

       Obama did nothing but relax the WoD and speak against it.  Trump claimed to be for states rights on recreational then did a complete 180 after being elected and is ramping up the drug war.  Sorry, but your opinion has no basis in reality.

       No shit, I never said it was equal. I said that Trump wouldn't be able to escalate it in this manner if Obama had put actual effort into ending it.

       Since Obama didn't put any effort into ending it, Trump gets to just claim to be enforcing existing laws (which is correct, as shitty as those laws are).

      <p>
       As I said, I think the Obama administration's decision to relax sentencing for nonviolent offenders is significant, especially to those who would be rotting in prison now.  I think that and his deprioritization of enforcement allowed recreational use to become mainstream and come out of the shadows.  Could he have done a lot more?  Fuck yeah.  Should he?  Fuck yeah.  But that doesn't mean I have to ignore what he did which was more than any president before him or after.

       Tbh, shouldnt cocaine and heroin have tougher sentences?? I dont think theybjust ramped up marijuana laws... its all drugs. Marijuana continues to be voted for and now the latest state went theough legislature and that really ought to send a message to the trump administration.

      <p>
       Fully agree with you here - I think Session's words (and thus also Trump's words as it's his administration) are absolutely fucking absurd here.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the other drugs, I would definitely agree that they're a more serious problem that should be dealt with in a more serious way than marijuana (just as an example).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm not convinced that incarceration of users or low-level dealers really provides the benefits that proponents claim. But a solution involving treatment seems to be beyond what we're currently capable of as a country.

       Why do you think the President has so much power? Congress has given away their responsibilities so they don't have to take a stand for anything and have to defend it on the campaign trail. That's how you become a career politician.

       Their best interests are still somewhat constrained to what is generally publically acceptable. Our interests aren't principle, their funders interests are, but that doesn't mean we have no way of influencing them.   There's likely nothing they love to hear people say as much as "both sides are the same".  All they hear is "do you need me to bend over further for you?".

       I don't go in for the rationale that you can vote someone without supporting/endorsing them.  I only vote for someone if I feel comfortable defending them.  Until I see someone on the national that's morally defensible I'll stick to local elections.

       Because I could not knowingly vote for either of those candidates.  I cannot knowingly get behind a two party "this or that" voting system.  I voted for Obama in 2012, but that was because I actually believed in him, even though the republican majority basically blocked everything the left tried to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT is why I can't get behind parties, just a bunch of stalling and people blindly following their party.  Example: spineless Paul Ryan who blatantly talked against Trump in the campaign, but once he became the top candidate he fell into place and voted for and supported the guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't vote for president this year because I couldn't get behind billionaires becoming president, sorry.

       Did you really just blame Hillary Clintom for 9/11, even though she's never been president and it happened during Bush's presidency?
      </p>
      <p>
       The warmonger scum that pulled Bush's strings allowed it to happen, then blamed people who weren't responsible, and then used that as a pretext to take away pretty much all of the remainimg freedoms people in the US had.
      </p>
      <p>
       As scum as Clinton is, this partisan bullshit is disgusting, and you have spit on the graves of American terror victims by pushing it. It was Bush jr. who allowed 911 to happen and it was his father who created and empowered the groups responsible, and Republicans need to acknowledge that they are the ones who caused and allowed the worst terror attack ever committed by non-state actors.

       Why are you creeping through people's past comment history just because they feel inclined to express a point?  Do we all need to use alt accounts just to have validity and avoid personal scrutiny on this sub?  Or, could we all be dynamically-changing and adjusting individuals who might not hold the same viewpoint we did a few months ago?

       You can usually discount alt accounts by the lack of post history, dedication to a specific topic, and their being recently created.

       If you can't see anything alarming about combing through people's past minutiae to determine exactly who they are today and how justified you are in pillorying them in public...maybe you should look at all the comments you've made over the past 5 years and agree that the worst things you said define you the most.

       It doesn't matter who someone voted for, as long as they vote on there best interest and what they feel will is best for the future of the Country. 
Calling someone out for who they voted for is petty and cheap, that person is not in your shoes and you are not in there's so who are you to say  he voted for Trump so he has no voice in this. 
You are the problem with the domocrat party, you just gave someone that extra little push to the right when you might have had a chance to pull the person to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this crap coming out of Democrats is hurting your party and Trump will be in office for 8 years I will put a guarantee on that. If people are held back form saying something for fear of people like you, that's how a person like Trump gets elected because it's that big "fuck you" to the people holding them back.

       I'm not saying he has no voice in this, I'm just questioning the validity of his voice.  His vote combined with the timing of this post is highly suspect IMO.

       I think he has done so because it is useful for pointing out a common partisan tactic that is intellectually lazy. Obama does something disagreeable and the reply is "But Bush...!".  Trump does something disagreeable and the reply is "But Obama...!".  It is called deflection.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure what you mean about viewpoints changing in this scenario.  OP is a Trump supporter that is criticizing Obama in this thread.  That seems pretty consistent.  What viewpoint are you suggesting has changed?

       Man, this is Reddit.  Sometimes I come on this website drunk and get into meaningless arguments with someone over a typo.  Sometimes I comment just to make dumb jokes and engage in meme silliness.  And then other times I come to subreddits like this and seek to actually speak my mind and engage in some sort of meaningful conversation.  The point I'm trying to make is that if you like combing through people's past minutiae to try to paint a current picture of them, you better be willing to stand by every comment you've ever made as being fully representative of who you are as a person in the same vein.  Or else recognize the constantly-changing dynamism of personal perspective and don't engage in witch-hunting.

       You're not wrong. If you're gonna dig up dirt on someone, be prepared to have your own garden dug up too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is that OP is digging up someone's garden, and yet noone has tried to dig up his. He's the only one finding a connection there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It comes down to how willing you are to do research on someone's record, which in my opinion is intrinsic to the content of this sub. Conspiracy is the willful act of digging so deep into something that sometimes you forget to come back.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy you're talking to is doing way more, be it good or bad, than the normal redditor to make sure posters aren't just using the sub as yet another soapbox for their campaign.

       These Bernie type characters have been trotted out in so many elections over the last hundred years it is laughable. It can be hard to research the nobodies of elections through the years, when the mass media ignored them back then as well. Where would you look? News archives are full of nothing about the person ignored at the time.

       No, lesser evil voters are the reason why we get the same shit candidates every 4 years.  I chose to focus on local elections as it is the only real means to change this course. I won't lend legitimacy to national elections I know are corrupt.  I won't sign my name behind candidates who do things I can't abide.  You on the other hand, lend legitimacy to corruption.

       As a Trump supporter, OPs motives for bringing up Obama days after Trump's admin escalated the drug war are suspect.  There is a ton of political brigading in this sub and I find point it out relevant and interesting.  Simple as that. And considering the popularity of my comment, I'm not the only one who thinks it's relevant.  If you don't think the behavior of the source is relevant then that's your business.

       He's correct but he's definitely on a campaign to distract from the recent orders from the Justice Department.  His heart bleeds for all the people Obama didn't pardon, but he has no concern at all for all the people who will be put in jail by bringing back mandatory minimums.  Dude actually blames Obama for what Sessions just did.  Unreal.

       Besides rescheduling does less for the legalization effort than Obama's executive discretion on enforcement.  Even rescheduling to 5 wouldn't do anything to legalize. This is clearly a distraction from Sessions rolling back Obama's executive discretion on enforcement.

       They didn't have to try very hard, Bush was wildly unpopular and Obama was facing an opponent that was quickly going back on everything that made him a 'maverick', including picking dumb-as-a-rock Sarah Palin as a running mate.  That election was going to be a cakewalk for any Democrat that could ties his shoes.

       But Obama was president during a time when a wave of medical mj and general decriminalization took root; past presidents did not have that environment, not even close.  Not that any Republican would come to their senses, but other than Obama, it was Bill Clinton, and the 90s were a very different time.  Very little to no decriminalization or medical mj.

       Just a common sense observation. We know that Obama isn't strongly anti-marijuana in any way. He used to smoke himself back in his younger days. He has also publicly stated that marijuana should be treated like 'cigarettes or alcohol' and pardoned more non-violent drug offenders than any other president but he said this on his way out of the door. So not too impressive from Obama but still a billion times better than Jeff Sessions that wants to ramp up the drug war even more and is actively reversing Obama's positions on non-violent drug offenders. He believes if you went down for smoking pot in the 70's and are still in prison it's a moral imperative that we keep you there.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the first black president the scrutiny on him was immense. The narrative being spun by the right wing was that he was a radical leftist marxist secret member of the black panthers which given what we know now is absolutely hilarious but I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Obama came in and spent his political capital which was under so much aforementioned scrutiny on a massive campaign to legalize weed (which could have easily failed) then the attack ads write themselves. "Black President only cares about weed! Of course he does! "Whether you agree with his positions or not it's very obvious he chose to use his political capital elsewhere and his constant skirting away from the idea of totally legalizing weed is telling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I agree with that? Not really but it does make a lot of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this sub has been compromised by a lot of extreme right wing bullshit so I'm expecting downvotes but that's how I see it since I've been paying attention the entire time.

       He also spent during his first term $100 million more than GWB did during his eight years cracking down on legal medical marijuana dispensaries, about $300 million. Additionally, half of the raids between 1996 and 2013 were during the four years of his first term. (His second term was about the same, but I'm using these numbers because I conveniently have access to them.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The counter-argument here is that medical marijuana was more common during his term than in 1996 so of course there would be more. That's true, but we're still talking about spending hundreds of millions of dollars to actively do this, and considering it flies in the face of his campaign promises, I think the criticism still stands.

       That's also true and well worth noting as well. I'm no apologist for Obama. I don't think he's a demon from hell but I also don't think that everything he did was right by a long shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how much of that policy was there to prop up the private prison industry that Obama has spoken out against but also facilitated in scenarios like these.

       Legal marijuana I believe is an inevitability but there is going to be a lot of kicking and screaming to get there.

       I don't think the GOP itself would want to go anywhere near it. They're always trying to hard to convince everyone that they're not racist, I think if it came anywhere near them they would have backed away faster than a garter toss at a wedding.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I think with a lot of the GOP base it wouldn't have to be said.

       Of course it factors. Unfortunately, he had to bite a big bullet just to keep the option of having another black president possible. That's almost always the case when you're the first black person to do something traditionally reserved for white people in this country. No way does Jim Brown or Colin Kaep get the first NFL contract.

       Careful you don't straw man, you had a strong position before.  The argument isn't the binary "does it factor into his thinking", it's how strongly does it factor.  Among aaaaaaaaaallll of the factors weighing on a president's mind, and all of the actors, influences, parties involved, interests, agendas, lobby groups and policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is reason to believe it factored early but not so much later.  Given the wide array of much stronger influences and factors, the thing stopping him from doing it wasn't "oh shit well I'm black, or I would've definitely done it" is not chief among them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to argue that this is
       <strong>
        the
       </strong>
       reason that he didn't do it, don't bother responding, just downvote or something.  I don't think anyone in their right mind would believe that this is the literal cornerstone factor that trumps all other factors combined, though it's rational to believe that it's one small factor among many.

       So sad the amount of truth that statement holds. What's more ridiculous is that it transcends race. Legalizing marijuana is an absolute good. It helps those who use it medicinally. It supports those who use it recreationally. And more importantly it keeps A LOT of poor people out of jail regardless of their race.

Rescheduling would do nothing to affect that.  That kind of legalization would require Congress to change the law.  Rescheduling just allows the FDA to approve pharmaceuticals and the government to research.  All those businesses in legal states would still be violating federal law.  Obama's executive actions on enforcement discretion did far more than rescheduling even if it was moved down to schedule 5.

       Holder's "Smart on Crime" initiative (the one Sessions is doing away with) sent non-violent, low level drug offenders to treatment instead of jail, and made it so those offenders weren't charged with crimes that carry mandatory minimum sentences.

       I ignored the rest of your comment because it's simply false and a complete crock of shit. Obama did absolutely nothing to reduce crime sentences. Obama didn't grow up or live life as an African American. He has nothing in common with them so he didn't understand what they needed.

       Just remember, if it wasn't for Jeff Sessions, Obama would still be allowing Clinton policy to enslave more black people that any time in American history. Democrats treat blacks like complete shit.

       Great. So Sessions made a statement that wound back his own previously legislated mandates against crack users because it was unfair.

       Good for him. Big slap on the back.

       What is your point, though? He did one conscionable thing? A position he had to reverse himself on? What a fucking hero.

       It's actually pathetic to argue this point. Look at actionable work on the ground and what Sessions has actually done. Do you know who Sheldon Adelson is and the 100's of millions he has invested in keeping MJ illegal and the money he has donated to Sessions and co?

       So, I can tell that you're not very informed about how the government works so read this part slowly.

      <p>
       The Attorney General doesn't create the law. He upholds the law that Congress creates. Did you catch that? Read that part again because I can already tell that it's going to go over your head.  If you don't want the AG to uphold certain laws, change the law.

       That's not the discussion at hand you absolute hack. Stop deflecting. This is the discussion:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the Trump administration ramping the drug war up more than the Obama administration?
      </p>
      <p>
       And..
      </p>
      <p>
       Are marijuana users under more danger of incarceration and persecution under Trumps administration and with Sessions being the attorney general and advocating for tougher laws against recreational marijuana users?
      </p>
      <p>
       The discussion was never about the AG creating the law and the fact you just arbitrarily applied that position to me shows how weak not only your argument is but even your basic understanding of the discussion at hand.

       That's why it never happened. As racist a backlash Obama received as it was, the backlash would have been heavier if he was helping "criminals" (read as "black people") stay out of prison. At that point, trump probably would have won not just the electoral college, but also the popular election. Not to mention obama's own racist ass party was very much in favor of locking up minor drug offenders until just recently. Let's not forget it was slick Willy who invented the current prison apparatus.

       P.s. 
I don't care for Obama or trump. Or any president really since Kennedy, when looking back. All have been awful to all Americans.

       Nobody seems to consider that one person's cost is another man's profit.   Illegal drugs are a $150 billion dollar a year industry in the US alone and that's not counting prison labor or the pharmaceutical industry's interest.   And it's not all evil overlords, everyday decent men and women support their families working in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a politician's viewpoint why would you slash a profitable industry and put decent people out of work so Timmy can get high and play video games all day?   Legal weed makes a lot of money, but it doesn't make as much money as illegal weed.

       When you look at it like that it's not much of a conspiracy.

       This is an extraordinarily weak argument. Being the first black / female president does not mean you should avoid doing things that are desperately needed to fix a social issue with that demographic. He had an enormous mandate to reduce incarceration of young black men and an absolute imperative to do so as the first black president. It would have been very hard to have undermined him on this issue. The GOP would have looked racist and backward. This is a linchpin issue for me. I can see that so many things are actually beyond the power of presidents including banking cartels, the war machine and the intelligence services. However is neglect of black men, in particular cannabis incarceration, shows he was just another for show president.

       This is the problem the left has. They're always trying to find ways to make the right look "racist and backwards" when reality tells you that it was Bill Clinton that paved the way to put all the black people in prison to begin with. Then Obama did zero to change anything.

       You totally missed the point. I'm not making any partisan comment. Indeed my whole point is Obama was pretty much just another suit. I'm saying the argument that he couldn't of run with legalisation because the GOP would have somehow demeaned him for it did not hold water.
       <strong>
        If
       </strong>
       they had chosen to make it a race issue they would have looked backward and racist. That's simply a fact. Drug decriminalisation is a win win for the democrats. It's a wedge issue that the republicans are on the wrong side of. Unfortunately there is no appetite in the democratic party to do anything radical so it's going no where.

       Attributing a political decision like this to optics misses the practical reasons behind it. Legalization puts big pharma out billions of dollars. Pharma put 150m into an ad campaign lobbying for Obamacare to get passed. Obamacare has brought big pharm billions in profit. There was no way Obama was going to subvert such a close economic partner.

       Anyone who would make a political decision based on the skin color of the president is already lost to Obama's voting base. It was not a political move not to deschedule pot - anyone who would be offended for it were people who would never have voted for a black man anyway.

       You are making massive assumptions. I'm not a Hillary supporter so this dead end line of inquiry is ridiculous. Trump is the President. You are critical of Obama for not decriminalizing pot so, given your user name my question persists:

       When is Trump legalizing weed or is he just too obsessed with optics?

       So your criticism of Obama on this issue is what then? The guy you voted for is objectively worse on the marijuana issue. His attorney General is actively trying to put more pot smokers in prison or keep them there. What is your actual point?

       My point is that Obama once promised to put on a comfortable pair of shoes and stand in picket lines, but now instead he's taking $400,000 from big banks to give inspirational speeches to the elite.

       You voted for Trump. He is objectively worse on the marijuana issue. That's the discussion at hand.

       Your criticisms of Obama didn't stop you from voting for Trump who is objectively worse on those issues?

       The US currently houses 22 percent of the world's prison population.  If that number went up under Hillary, neither Democrats nor Republicans would complain.  If it goes up under Trump, at least the Democrats will bitch about it.  I don't why you choose to ignore the meaning of accelerationism, maybe you are confused about how spineless the Democrats have been the past few decades?

       Obama did not enforce the law. Trump and Session want
       <strong>
        increase

       pot enforcement. They not the same.

       I'm so sick of this false narrative. Did the Dems try to take away healthcare from 24 Million Americans? Or did they help 10-20 Million uninsured Americans get healthcare?
To be clear, I hate establishment Democrats just as much as I hate corporatist Republicans. But that doesn't mean I think all Democrats are Hillary clones. And there are differences between the two parties.
Democrats favor legalization
Democrats favor environmental protection
Democrats favor programs that protect our socal safe nets like Social Security, Medicare, and Obamacare
Democrats have a much better track record protected civil liberties (not a singe D voted for the anti-privacy bill)
A Democratic president had a bullet placed in osama's head
Let's work together to throw the establishment scum out from both sides of the aisle. Instead of trying to demoralize people with this false equivalency that both parties are the exact same.

       Give me a break -- rescheduling marijuana was never a goal during Obama's two terms. And what do you think AG Sessions would do about it now? At least AG Eric Holder under Obama gave judges latitude in federal drug sentencing. Sessions' former aides in the Senate are now lobbyists for one of the largest private prison corporations

       . Back in February, private prison stocks soared when Sessions issued a memo rescinding the DOJ's commitment to reducing the use of such prisons. Gee, I wonder how Sessions' portfolio was looking after his announcement about sentencing guidelines this week?

       This needs to be the top comment. OP's comment history shows that he is a partisan hack who has it out for Democrats. I'm not trying to defend them in any way, don't get me wrong. Fuck them. But this is completely pathetic deflection from the current administrations position, even when they are the ones who could currently actually work to reschedule it without obstruction due to their control over all branches of the federal government, if they actually gave a shit about the issue, which any sane minded person would have known they didn't far before the election.

       It isn't that you're either or, that's not what I was getting at. I understand why you despise the Democratic party, im on the same boat with you there for many of the same reasons. But namely in this sub, that can have a tendency to upvote things like this soon after the current administrations position is unsurprisingly made clearly public, they're not always upvoting it out of complete objectivity, instead because "Obama!", so it is in this context, it is interpreted in a very partisan way to those who it is mainly reaching. We don't need another reason to try and rationalize AG Sessions' actions when this administration could have easily came back and reverted a rescheduling anyways. And like BigSphinx said, aside from the INSANE opposition you know that Republicans would have put up for rescheduling, AG Eric Holder and the Obama administration were if nothing else, lax on "enforcing" federal law, and some federal judges were less harsh in their sentencing for low lever offenses. It wasn't perfect in any sense of the word, but "incrementalism", as shitty as that is for so many issues and is much like Hillary would have gone for, we now instead have AG Sessions coming in wanting to destroy any progress we have made on this issue over the past 8+ years.

        But namely in this sub, that can have a tendency to upvote things like this soon after the current administrations position is unsurprisingly made clearly public, they're not always upvoting it out of complete objectivity, instead because "Obama!", so it is in this context, it is interpreted in a very partisan way to those who it is mainly reaching.

       we saw yesterday. I say propaganda not because Sessions isn't a piece of shit (he probably is), but because BOTH parties are responsible for the mess we are in.

       Yes, because they're both beholden to their pharmesutical donors and don't actually give a fuck about their constituents. I get it. Sessions is definitely a piece of shit. I'm sure you've heard the "I knew some good people in the KKK until I figured out that they smoked weed" quote. At least under Obama, he realized that going hardball on this wasn't going to be popular, and he backed off in ways that weren't simply rescheduling, which on its own wouldn't have fixed all of the problems, it would again just be another incrementalist step. (Now cannabis would be on the same level as meth instead of heroin! Yay?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't strawman me with fucking slavery man, that has nothing to do with this. How about the well over a thousand people who Obama excommunicated for low level offenses? He can only do so much when he was facing the party of "NO" for 8 years. Imagine how they would have spun total legalization if that's what Obama pushed for. Again, not defending him, because if he and the Democrats actually gave a fuck they could have worked through it when they had their supermajority, just like they could have gotten us single payer or a public option, but they didn't. I'm not here making excuses for them. But you cannot deny that what they did was worlds ahead of the Trump administration making "progress" like a monkey with a sledgehammer smashing the delicate foundations that we had to continue moving forward on this issue.

       And what about the Democratic Party rigging the primaries against Sanders, subverting our democracy and defrauding Bernie donors out of over $200 million. This post isn't simply about Obama, it's also to highlight the fact that both parties have fucked us over for years.

       Here are some of their bipartisan efforts: '94 crime bill, Iraq War (Clinton voted for it), keeping FPTP, unconstitutional spying, prison systems (via '94 crime bill etc), telecommunications mergers, droning brown people (this has been going on for ~16 years now).
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys can keep shitting on Trump, but he only became president because Democrats didn't let the most popular general election candidate on the ballot even after the public found out he was cheated throughout the primaries.

       The irony being that marijuana arrests are predominantly made on blacks. He couldn't see fit to prioritize reclassification of marijuana... to save the lives of his fellow african americans that are being disproportionately destroyed by stupid senseless marijuana arrests. Nope.

       He did nothing for the USA. Fucking nothing.

      <p>
       He allowed every single criminal banker get away. He rewarded them for their fuckery with the bailout and then made 100 percent sure that not a single charge was ever brought.
      </p>
      <p>
       He dropped more bombs, in more different countries than any previous president. He didn't close Gitmo... it's still fucking open.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gave the US a piece meal piece of shit Healthcare system that was hand written by lobbyists and coporate whores. Single payer is the only solution but Obama had zero interest in that. His financiers were the insurance companies that would lose everything if single payer ever comes to pass.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many other countries provide a single payer system. The USA could have it tomorrow. 
Fuck Obama. He has proved once and for all that he is an absolute piece of shit with his recent 400k speech.

       When Obama was elected the democrats had a super majority. It was filibuster proof. They could have passed anything they wanted without a single vote from a republican. Obama CHOSE to not give us single payer. He CHOSE to not give us free college or invest in US infrastructure or allow us to import drugs from Canada to bring down prescription medication prices. Obama could have done ANYTHING when he took office. He was the most popular president at the time and the democrats had control of all 3 branches of government. Stop lying to yourself. You made a good choice voting for him. McCain and Romney sucked but that doesn't fix everything Obama did wrong.

       Ok, drug war bad. Everyone agrees. Obama at least relaxed on the prosecution of marijuana users, sounds like Sessions wants to go back to enforcing mandatory minimums. Obama only had two years with a democratic majority, not that they would have overturned classification if they had all 8. But this tit for tat thing is a bit much,. I hardly think that what you are saying is an excuse for digging deeper into the war on drugs, do you?

      <p>
       Classification is at the executive branch's discretion at the DEA.  The legislature can also alter it, but the POTUS doesn't need them to reschedule drugs. Obama should have appointed a DEA head who would reschedule or directed the head to do so. He is remiss there, but that shouldn't discount the immense progress he made in relaxing sentencing and respecting state's rights.

       When are people gonna learn the president or sessions doesn't control this shit. Its all for show. The elites control was legal and what's not. And if Trump or sessions really do have control, they're probably following orders. People need to be compliant for them, which psychedelics or weed give people a more open mind. Money is very influential but this shit runs even deeper then that.

       Oh boy, this post is hilarious.  Trumps people are going after the weed and all you got is "but Obamaaaaaaaaaa"
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure Obama did not legalize it.  He had maybe a two year window were he could have.  He never claimed he would legalize it either.  He did however order the DEA to stand down and let states that legalized to do their own thing.  Which if you are right leaning you should of praised because of states rights and all.  Now he have the so called party of states rights wanting to crack down on.......states rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is okay to criticize your party and call them out on this move.  No one is going to think less of you and in fact you would win over a bit of trust from the other side if you did.

       Truth is you won't find anything. I was a Democrat for 10 years and left the party to become an independent in June after America saw that the Democratic Party cheated progressives, subverted our country's democracy, and defrauded Bernie donors out of over $200 million.

       Democrats are slavers, republicans are the same. At the end of the day the socialist left and the Zionist left are all part of the same problem. I too voted for Trump to fix it. But the fact that a person votes for another person doesn't make him a partisan hack. We all agree on the existence of a problem and it's perpetrators.

       Yeah Obama would have squandered literally all of his political capital if he tried to reclassify marijuana. I'm a huge proponent of drug legalization but I can understand why he would have focused his energies elsewhere given things like the worst recession in 70 years, multiple wars, etc. He didn't even have a Dem congress after 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to make it a race thing but having the first black president be super gung-ho on legalizing drugs would have driven the racists even crazier than they already were.

       You don't have to love it to see that putting people in rapey work camps for possessing it is fucking inhuman. I don't use it personally, but I'm tired of paying to cage people who are no threat to society.  On the contrary, they benefit society by boosting the economy and increasing tax revenue.

       You probably know more than you realize.  The successful ones generally don't talk about it nor is it a big part of their life.  Having worked in both IT and the restaurant industry, I can tell you that there is a huge number of smokers working within either.  Hell, when I worked in a callcenter I saw a guy roll a joint on his desk right out in the open. There was that little concern.  I remember this one hilarious occasion when another of my coworkers emailed the CEO to ask if the company would ever impose drug testing and he responded, "sure, send me your drugs and I'll test them for you".

       I smoke weed, and have for all of my adult life. Maybe it's because I live in a legal state, but no one here is questioning it. In fact, most people here see it as much safer than drinking a couple beers. And no one here cares.

       Good on you to protect the billionaire from criticism OP. He really needs your grass roots support as his cabinet increases the penalties for casual marijuana users. I assume you are in support of that since you want to draw a false equivalence with the previous administration. Because if you're not in support of that WTF is this post about?

       On the other hand, had Obama reclassified marijuana, the Republicans would have made it their priority to return it to schedule 1 status, because they're doing everything possible to undo Obama's legacy.  (See for example net neutrality, which Republicans supported until Obama did.)  So by doing nothing, Obama ensured that progress towards the eventual legalization of marijuana continues unabated.

       To be fair, he had admitted he wasn't gonna do that. I'm not sure where the notion that he ever endeavored to reschedule cannabis came from, but there's no truth to it.

       He's definitely worse because Sessions has been making threats. I work in the cannabis industry and business is down 30 percent since Sessions made his first statements hinting at greater federal enforcement. Places are shutting down. No one wants to risk going to jail.

       He literally instructed the Feds not to spend federal money going after businesses that were legal in their states. They did go after dispensaries that weren't following state laws. His memo is the only reason legalization was able to move forward. Almost half the states are medical now, and 8 states plus DC legalized for adults during his term.

       While Obama didn't do a lot in the ways of advancing current marijuana policy, he did a lot to protect it behind the scenes. I think he was picking his presidential battles, and weed wasn't on the top of the list. He did a good job with weed for my taste.

       I don't understand particular nuances of the executive branch.  As I understand it, Congress has given the Food and Drug Administration plenary power to determine the schedule of controlled substances. My understanding is that the president may direct that the FDA change the schedule of a particular substance,  just as he may direct any department secretary or  German

       There were many more important issues at the time. Plus if you took a government class you would've known that a president can't just declare something is legal now. With the congress and legislature we have now it's gonna be impossible that marijuana gets rescheduled.

       He openly stated he'd like to have it treated like cigarettes or alcohol.
He said he wouldn't interfere with states choices to legalize for recreational use. (He kind of renegged on that one, but not entirely).
He allowed more universities to conduct research on marijuana, rather than just the University of Mississippi.

       I believe the problem for Obama was several international drug control treaties that USA is signed up to, preventing legalisation.
       <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/3157924/why-a-56-year-old-un-treaty-stands-between-you-and-legal-pot/">
        Canada is currently facing the same obstacles.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       USA has an extra option which Obama​ used: allow states to decide for themselves on status of marijuana. The Federal government, which is signed up to these treaties would not be breaking them, while the individual states are not signed up to the treaties. It's a loophole.

       If you pay attention to what is said underneath it all the light may be there. Sessions and the new Drug Czar have indicated that they will enforce the laws as written and that if the states want it changed then congress and the house should change it. Sessions is a hardliner enforcing the laws that are in the books. Thing is the laws should not be there and that is the challenge I believe Sessions is sending to his bosses. I will enforce the laws as written........ If you want change then do your jobs and change it..........

       The marijuana issue will eventually be resolved when it is categorized as legal, akin to tobacco.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will never be re-categorized as Shed-1 for the simple reason that it's medicinal properties cannot be dosaged accurately in natural plant form due to the vagaries of plant growth.  Even across multiple plants grown together in the same area, the properties shift slightly due to different aspects of watering/sunlight/soil nutrients where each plant pushed its roots, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schedule I substances are described as those that have the following findings:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being unable to meet standardization of dosage means MJ in natural form cannot meet standards 2 and 3, which means no Schedule-1 classification for weed in the form you smoke.

       Obviously Cannabis should be legal and it's a travesty that people are imprisoned for drug possession but I'm more pissed that he didn't give us single payer health care. We voted for change and progress. He had a super majority, and instead of giving us all Medicare he gave us Romney care.

       It disappoints me to see absolutely horrible things like Fentanil, and Carfentanil defined as Schedule 2 when a single dose of either is more than enough to kill.  Meanwhile, this harmless plant is still mislabeled as Schedule 1 knowing that THC is chemically impossible to OD on.

       The funny thing is, the executive actions the Obama took relaxing drug penalties did far more to advance legalization than rescheduling ever would.  Rescheduling would do nothing whatsoever to allow legitimate pot businesses within legalized states to remain open because they would still be illegal under the Controlled Substances Act.  What rescheduling would do is allow the FDA to approve pills and extracts for manufacture by pharmaceutical companies and it would also allow for government research.  It does nothing to change the law for dispensaries or the sale of whole flower.

       Ok, then what else did he do? There are still thousands of nonviolent criminals locked away and rotting their lives in prison. I'm going to keep defending them over Obama because they can't defend themselves.

       He also never addressed ending FPTP, and FPTP is exactly the reason why Republicans are allowed to exist. So if you really don't like what Republicans are doing then you can blame Democrats for 50% of it because they are half to blame.

       If we had scored ballots then both Bernie &amp; Clinton could have been on the ballot as Democrats, and we wouldn't even need primaries so Bernie couldn't get cheated that way. Bernie was the highest polling general election candidate and actually promised real reform for nor only Mary Jane, but he promised that we wouldn't lead the planet in incarcerations after his first year.

       I do get it. He didn't reschedule it and he didn't do anything for the thousands of prisoners still locked up. These are two different things that Obama did to continue fucking over the American people due to the same issue.
      </p>

       Rescheduling is something Obama actually could have done, and it would have helped. Not that we should be content with moving it down from schedule 1 to schedule 2, however.

       If these convicted criminals are truly your concern you would already know that blaming Obama for not rescheduling the drug would do nothing for them.  They were convicted of breaking the law at that time.  Far more than rescheduling the drug would need to happen in order for their sentences to be reduced or commuted.

       I hope weed remains illegal forever and every pothead in this country rots in jail for life.  In fact, I seriously hope Trump is considering bringing over the policies of Duterte and we can legally shoot piece of shit drug users on sight.

       Well since obama has been president tons of states have been able to legalize marijuana or establish medical marijuana programs.

       look at that chart, it was vastly different when bush was in office.
Obama allowed the states to enact their own laws and did not interfere with their efforts.

       Because Obama didn't reschedule Marijuana, Trump has no option but to reverse Obama's policy of lower penalties for non-violent drug offenses? Interesting hypothesis.

       I don't like either party, but the Dems were at least trending in the right direction on this issue. This is a huge step backwards, and knowing how draconian this administration is proving itself to be, there is likely more to come.

       Would future generations have looked down on our government if we banned slavery before that idea became popular?

       Likewise, would future generations have looked down on our government if we legalized marijuana before it was popular? (this is besides the fact that it was unpopular in part due to societal associations with crime, etc, which is a catch-22)

       For a start, not reversing Obama's policy of lenient punishment for nonviolent drug offenders? Beyond that, IIRC Hillary said she'd reclassify marijuana as a schedule 2 drug and Sanders said it should be completely decriminalized. Instead we got a "God wants me to put drug users in jail". There's a difference.

       You do know Black is a race and Indonesian is an ethnicity, like Kenyan for example. Race is a concept used to divide people by class, not color. It has nothing to do with color, more to do with who gets rich, who stays rich and who stays poor.

       I'm reallllllllly not a fan of the Trump administration apparently doubling down on the drug war. I think it's an unforgivable and backwards approach to take.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think referencing the lack of action by the Obama administration is a 'distraction' - I think it shows that regardless of how different two administrations may seem, they both follow the same set of rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doubling down on the drug war is only possible due to the Obama administration's inaction.

       No shit, I never said it was equal. I said that Trump wouldn't be able to escalate it in this manner if Obama had put actual effort into ending it.

       Since Obama didn't put any effort into ending it, Trump gets to just claim to be enforcing existing laws (which is correct, as shitty as those laws are).

       It was illegalised as part of the "War on Crime" that emerged after the Civil Rights movement as the new method of subjugating minorities once the colour of their skin wasn't legally inferior.

       Well to answer the "Why do they care what I do with my body" argument people always throw out. Because we live in a country with increasing social benefits and governmental assistance; legalizing drugs will only increase the amount of people utilizing these services. So the tax payer is paying for their kids, food and medical bills meanwhile they're spending what little they have on drugs.

       *I'm for legalization but this is the argument of the opposition.

       Their best interests are still somewhat constrained to what is generally publically acceptable. Our interests aren't principle, their funders interests are, but that doesn't mean we have no way of influencing them.   There's likely nothing they love to hear people say as much as "both sides are the same".  All they hear is "do you need me to bend over further for you?".

       "The president's [Obama] response, and that of his attorney general, is that it's a job for Congress. But that's not true, says Brookings Institution Senior Fellow John Hudak. According to a report authored by Hudak and Grace Wallack, the federal Controlled Substances Act clearly details a process by which the administration can take marijuana out of the drug schedules or, at the least, lower its schedule so that medical research can proceed."

       If these convicted criminals are truly your concern you would already know that blaming Obama for not rescheduling the drug would do nothing for them.  They were convicted of breaking the law at that time.  Far more than rescheduling the drug would need to happen in order for their sentences to be reduced or commuted.

       Well Hillary got the push for legalization put onto the Democratic platform last July at the convention, for the first time ever. While Trump reaffirmed the push for total prohibition in the GOP platform during their convention. So their party platforms are one thing on the subject that's different.
