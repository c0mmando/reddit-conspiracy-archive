       Firstly, no. I don't believe all Jews are evil. However, I cannot help but notice their overpowering and immensely disproportionate representation in politics, media, banking etc, it's simply a statistical fact. The federal reserve, neoconservative politicians, virtually all major media outlets etc, their place is so powerful and usually in a negative way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to fight my own prejudices. However, I'll see someone in an interview pushing for war, or defending the indefensible, and I'll think to myself "I bet he's Jewish". So i go to check, and too many times it turns out to be true. Too many to be a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I just a victim of propaganda? Am I an anti Semite? If so, how can I prove myself wrong and lay these feelings to rest?

       A Jew is not necessarily a Semite. See my post about how "they" are changing language today - literally changing the definition of Semite to positively include people who speak Hebrew and more broadly - jews.  It's the epitome of doublespeak.  Find an old dictionary and look up the word Semite - don't let them control your thoughts - define words for you.

       Everyone should have a dictionary from pre-1930. I actually originally caught on to this because of AA. See, our big book was written in 1932 using pretty sophisticated language, compared to what a fresh off the street alkie could be expected to understand at least. So, to understand exactly what the founders meant, we need a time period dictionary.

       Why do we need a time period dictionary?
Because they change the fucking words.

       I'd second this idea but expand it to all books.  History, science, everything.  Information now is too fluid but if you have that info in a book, you know when it was printed and hasn't been tampered with (if it was true to begin with that is).

       You'll mature into it. Overcoming decadese or even a lifetime of propaganda is very very difficult. But that experience you describe is so typical, a lot of people report that after they break free of the conditioning. Realize that antisemite is a propaganda term bar none, and the very fact that it's on the tip of everyones tongue is proof of an absurd level of privilege that the very people fighting 'white privilege' enjoy without even being aware of the hypocrisy. But jews and being aware of hypocrisy don't mix in the first place.

       Yup you're exactly right. Same thing happened to me. See a name, check it, jew. Ive accepted it. I can handle the ridicule that comes with it because I know I'm right. Others that ridicule just aren't on your level. If they took the time to research the real truth no matter where it goes they would end up just where we are. Don't let political correctness throw you, its there for a reason.

       Literally man. Sometimes I'll be doing well and start to not judge Jews as a collective. But then I'll see, yet again, someone on the news advocating something completely abhorrent. And I'll think to myself "don't do it", but then I end up googling the person and I swear more times than not, they are Jewish. Sometimes I can't believe have frequent it is.

       100% same thing for me (it happened a lot when I seen a politician saying stuff I would consider not normal for American to say so id look them up yup ofcourse jewish). I think that's part of their game, most people just think oh its just another white guy. When in reality they are probable dual citizens. And you can only serve one master.

       I appreciate your self awareness and reflection on the subject. Many just take the data of which you spoke and then let the anti-semitism go rabid.

       One of the best ways that I look at it is that most of those people aren't really, fully Jewish behind closed doors. It's a costume. They worship something much more sinister.

       Personally, I see the same issues with all 3 Abrahamic religions and can easily understand that it is something that turns the average person into a pawn, where they can be doing something bad but be sold on it as a good thing. The only people I have actual issues with are those at the top of the pyramid, the rest at the bottom are just useful idiots who aren't really doing anything malicious.

       I guess the important part is to still treat individuals with respect, until proven otherwise. It is perfectly normal to have some form of internal judgement formed based on their characteristics (this is human nature, we analyze everything we see, our brains see patterns) but the difference is any criticism should be levvied at the ideology itself, rather than any people in particular.

       Same thing with Islam, I find the ideology abhorrent, but I would never translate that over to individual people. Even if the ideology makes them do bad things, I consider that more reason to analyze said ideology deeper to understand how that is accomplished.

       You are not antisemitic for noticing.  A carefully crafted narrative has been made and runs within our society, one that protects them at all times.  No questioning allowed.  In Germany, you can be imprisoned for up to 5 years for questioning the holocaust, the numbers that really died, etc.  It's the only topic you are not allowed to pursue.  Now why would that be?  Hmmm.

       Misinformation was so awful during the nazi regime they had to make holocaust denial a crime. They also don't have a first amendment. Also, other authoritarian regimes are obvious much, much worse (turkey, Russia, etc..)

       Germans were shocked at the realisation of what they had done. Hence, the laws, a strong state propaganda, solid education system. It worked, as they find themselves to be the most democratic/free country and basically the only hope for sanity to win over madness.

       Christianity outlawed usury, so Jews filled the gap. They were used by monarchs to charge interest on the citizens and steal their money.

       Getting rid of monarchies and instituting democratic-capitalism gave bankers all the leverage.

       I am ethnically Jewish but have a desire to bring these banks down. But maybe if my parents were wealthy bankers offering me a job I'd have a different opinion. I'd like to think I'd stick to my ethical convictions regardless but you see what I'm saying?

       100% get what you're saying. It's not so much just the fact Jews have these positions, it's also what they do with it. Not just banking either, the media and Hollywood is literally riddled with it. It's so obvious to me it's kinda scary that nobody talks about it openly? I'm no Hitler lover by any means, but he is constantly brought up as a defence if you call the Jews out for their actions.

       Yea Hitler was put in power to use as a straw-man against nationalism and any 'conspiracy theories' about banks/freemasons. On the flip side, he also serves as a psyop on independent thinkers such as yourself to turn them into National Socialist bigots, who can be put down with ease and with the pleasure of the public.
      </p>

       What distinction is there between the media and the banks? The current MSM doesn't even make a net profit, they're completely reliant on drug and arms dealing profits from the CIA. Jeff Bezos, owner of Washington Post, got $650 Billion from the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of media psyop specialists that aren't Jewish. Alex Jones is clearly not Jewish, neither is Michael Aquino. And yet they're pretty talented at subversion. Read the list of the people involved with MK-Ultra and it's not like all of them are Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're just grasping at a simple explanation because reality is sad and harsh. It's easier to demonize one group than accept that there's a global coalition of people dedicated to ruling over a slave class.

       The more I get into the Jewish Question it seems that Israel is actually inhabited by Khazars who are actually some kind of impostor Jews, so what we know as Jews are really Khazarians, or something. Don't know much about this yet. But they apparently just pretended to be Jewish but remained Baal worshippers.

       Hi!
As we hope you can appreciate, the Holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with. While don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the
       <a href="/r/History">
        /r/History
       </a>
       mods have created this brief overview that addresses common questions, and included a short list of introductory reading. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.
What Was the Holocaust?
The Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.
But This Guy Says Otherwise!
Unfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as "Revisionists", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, "entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust."
It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.
So What Are the Basics?
Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership. First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.
The early killings were carried out foremost by the Einsatzgruppen, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the Einsatzgruppen, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too.
By early 1942, the "Final Solution" to the so-called "Jewish Question" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.
Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these "Reinhard" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.
The Camps
There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps were later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as "extermination through labor". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and "allowed" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.
Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.
The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.
Several camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.
How Do We Know?
Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. This site catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I'll close this out with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.

       The 6 million is  Bullshit, pure and utter, bullshit. It's been scientifically and mathematically proven to be fabricated.  Also even if it were true it's nothing compared to the 25 million russian christians killed by the Jewish bolshiveks. Where are the memorials and museums for the Russians?

       The majority of American congress is Roman Catholics, there are over 160 Catholics in congress. Only ~5% of congress is Jewish. Both houses are presided over by Catholics: Paul Ryan in the House and Mike Pence, a self-described evangelical Catholic in the Senate.  The majority of supreme court justices are Catholic. The head of the Supreme Court is Catholic, John Roberts. I have documented over 50 Catholics involved in Trump's transition team and his advisory panels.

       The Federal reserve, the most important bank in America, is controlled by Catholics. The most powerful members of the fed boards of governors, Jerome Powell and Daniel Tarullo are both Jesuit-trained Catholics. Tarullo and Powell chair the majority of fed committees and the most important ones at that. That includes the committee of the affairs of the board of governors itself. They also control the lending of money to the federal government and supervise and grant approval to all banks in America in general. Even Janet Yellen's husband is a professor at Jesuit Georgetown University. And there are countless people working within the fed that are paid more highly than Yellen as well.

       So I'm afraid you have fallen into the propaganda of neo-nazies. That's okay though, for, now that you realize this you can join in fighting the foremost enemy, which is the Roman Papacy and Jesuits.

       Care to share? Sometimes I'll delve in to the topics of Zionism and Israel with my friends to see what sort of reactions I get. The whole Jewish thing though is much harder to say. I mean israel is more of an accepted political discussion, but Jewish or even Zionist domination of our countries will make me sound like a rabid Nazi. Do you try and share your views?

       You've been brainwashed since a kid to think any negative opinions on the jew is bad. People for millennia have been saying the same thing and trying to convince the world that it's everyone else and not the jew that are to blame is beyond ridiculous. There's a reason the jew have been kicked out from countries 109 times through out history.

       You're average non-billionaire Jew is no different than their non-Jewish counterparts. And I have no doubt that the billionaire Jews would have no problem sacrificing both groups to further their agenda.

       To me it's telling that the group setting monetary, foreign, and cultural policy are of one religion or ethnicity and no one cares or finds it unusual.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if they were all mormons? Or moonies? Would their shared religious affiliation matter then? Or their texts, which may or may not call for subjugation of all other religions? Or atheists?

       "Firstly, no. I don't believe all white men are evil. However, I cannot help but notice their overpowering and immensely disproportionate representation in politics, media, banking etc, it's simply a statistical fact. The federal reserve, neoconservative politicians, virtually all major media outlets etc, their place is so powerful and usually in a negative way.
I try to fight my own prejudices. However, I'll see someone in an interview pushing for war, or defending the indefensible, and I'll think to myself "I bet he's a white man". So i go to check, and too many times it turns out to be true. Too many to be a coincidence.
Am I just a victim of propaganda? Am I racist? If so, how can I prove myself wrong and lay these feelings to rest?"

       The difference being, Jews are a tiny, tiny proportion of the population. So the analogy does not equate.

      <p>
       Before world war one, 80% of US Jews were employed in manual work, most of them in textile factories.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1930s, about 20% of the Jewish men had free professions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antisemitism was further weakened after World War II and the restrictions on hiring Jews were reduced and later canceled as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 1957, 75% of US Jews were white-collar workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rise of Jews to positions of power and wealth was a hard fought battle. They literally pulled themselves up by their bootstraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       The over-representation of Jews compared to their percentage of the population in the industries you mentioned above is not intentional, it's a result of the successes of Jewish immigrants and their descendants.

       Can you provide any information to back up this statement? To go back to my original reply, I could make this same point about people who are of any race, religion, or creed. Example: "Christians are so powerful and usually in a negative way."

       I don't mean to be blunt, but assuming that someone is Jewish because they do something you consider indefensible is kind of textbook anti-antisemitism. What you are describing here is a process of actively confirming your prejudice. It's also textbook confirmation bias. Do you ever consider that if look up the religion of people doing good things there will be Jewish people there as well? You say you find 'too many to be a coincidence' but if you are trying to confirm your own belief about Jews from the onset then you are going to be prone to only noticing those results which affirm your perspective.

       Yes. I am Jewish. I had a bar/bat mitvah. There are Jewish people who believe in everything and anything. There are Jewish people who smoke weed all day. There are Jewish people who love president trump. There are Jewish people who believe that the sate of Israel is committing war crimes against Palestinians. There are Jewish people who believe the earth is flat.

       You are only an Anti-Semite if you chose to actively be one. Everyone has implicit biases. You seem to recognize your own. This is an important moment, in fact. will you chose to broaden your mind, seek other perspectives, and realize that the world is to complicated for statements like Jews = bad? Or do you double down on your original beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antisemitism is a tired, old ideology. It's been around for literally hundreds of years. Blaming Jews for things is literally a tradition.
