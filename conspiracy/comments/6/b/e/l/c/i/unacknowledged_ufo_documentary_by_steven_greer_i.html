<p>Greer&#39;s work in collecting the largest group of eyewitness testimony and documents that detail the black UFO projects that have been of interest to the Deep State since the 1940&#39;s is unprecedented. His work gets shilled to death of it being called a nothing burger, and yet I have never seen a single refutation of the vast collection of eyewitness testimony he has collected that dominates 75% of this film.</p>

<p>Whatever you want to call it, Blue Beam is real and Greer warns about that in this documentary as well. For a man who is supposedly only in it for the money, he is speaking quite a bit of truth to power in this film. You can check out my post history, I am just someone trying to find the truth, but with the &quot;Stargate&quot; phenomenon in full swing right now, I think everyone being aware of Blue Beam is vital.</p>

<p>I understand there is a lot of legitimate people who buy into the criticism of Greer, so I encourage you to at least watch the film and refute what&#39;s in it instead of attacking Greer&#39;s character.</p>

<p>Just so everyone is on the same page, this means Dr. Greer owns and operates a vacation ranch where people can pay top dollar to see allegedly real UFOs fly over the property every night.  Embarrassing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame, too, because many of the eyewitnesses he has endorsed seem very genuine.  It&#39;s almost like Greer is an agent working to discredit these people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much about this practice do you <em>actually</em> know? This is cited whenever anyone wants to debunk or &quot;expose&quot; Greer but it always boils down to people just repeating what other people say &amp; it&#39;s circulated as fact. </p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t &quot;own &amp; operate&quot; a ranch. A retreat center is rented. And different locations have been used. </p>

<p>Much of the fee is determined by what center is used. My workplace has a yearly retreat &amp; the cost is based on the amount of people, what we want for meals, &amp; how long we&#39;re staying. Greer&#39;s event is for an entire week &amp; lodging/food is included with the fee. </p>

<p>I really have no idea what kinds of UFO sightings are taking place. But I don&#39;t think you do either. You&#39;re calling it &quot;embarrassing&quot; but that seems more in judgment than anything else. It&#39;s certainly not a firsthand or even slightly informed point of view. </p>

<p>Unless I&#39;m wrong. <em>Have</em> you looked up these events &amp; results before? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you&#39;re right.  I looked into it a little further and it&#39;s closer to what you described.  I don&#39;t think he even owns the business, he&#39;s just closely affiliated with it.  They do most of their events at a ranch near Mt. Adams.</p>

<p>The retreats do have absurdly frequent UFO sightings though.  Just check out ECETI on YouTube or google.  Their own website has <a href="http://www.eceti.org/Conference_pictures_003.jpg">this</a> photo tagged as &quot;Ultradimensional Contact during the skywatch at the 2006 Science, Spirit and World Transformation Conference.
Many miracle healings occurred to campers in the field that night.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of that other one but it seems like a cheap (&amp; intentional) knock-off of what Greer is doing. <a href="http://www.eceti.org/james_gilliland.jpg">Their founder looks like a stereotypical cult leader</a>. I feel terrible for the people that he lures in with the garbage he puts out. And it clearly does a disservice to any kind of legitimate work in the field. </p>
