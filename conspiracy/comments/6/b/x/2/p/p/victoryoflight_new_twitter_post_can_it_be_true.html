    <div class="md"><p>Nice! For those who don&#39;t have an hour to kill, around 1000 AD, the leader in trying to create an assassin&#39;s guild created a paradise-like castle full of fruit and wine, made the initiates believe they&#39;d died (through drugs) and had gone to heaven and back. They were seduced, fed, etc. He also used a lot of trickery like having a guy look like his head was chopped off, claimed to have seen the afterlife, then actually kill him.</p>

<p>So, it contributes to the notion of promising Muslims a heaven full of virgins and paradise for their service.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth a watch.  </p>

<p>Very amusing when thinking of the parallels of today.</p>

<p>And I agree, I remember listening to this one and thinking about how modern day Islamic extremism in the form of AQ, ISIS, Al Shebab, etc is perhaps an outgrowth of these earlier occult control systems. Their inception at the behest of the CIA only underscores this hunch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does.</p>

<p>And one thing I notice about the playbook is that it never changes. When you recognize the patterns back then, it can be applied easily to understand any present-day situation. When I was studying the color revolutions, for instance, it was the exact same formula in every country. </p>

<p>They are either a) wholly unoriginal. Interestingly, if you believe the &quot;archon&quot; theory it&#39;s believed they&#39;re incapable of any creativity and they have to work on what&#39;s basically replication and plagiarism alone. Or b) it&#39;s worked for so long they haven&#39;t needed to change anything. Not sure what it is but it makes our jobs easier.</p>

<p>While i do find posts like this interesting, i find it equally disturbing that so many people jump right in and believe it.  I don&#39;t understand this particular story 100%, but i kinda lost interest when i found out that Podesta sacrifices babies and children to these reptilian evil aliens that mighty also be demons, but a fleet of good aliens or angels is also showing up to save us or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about something else. Try to imagine, really try, that you are in your room or someplace and at this very moment, an alien knows exactly where you are, what you are doing and generally your thoughts and feelings. </p>

<p>Now if Aliens do exist, would a &#39;good&#39; alien or civilization try and make contact with someone here on earth? Imagine that, imagine an alien trying to communicate mentally and then appearing before you. </p>

<p>Your mind would melt out your skull. I am an extremely open individual who wants to see aliens but I genuinely believe a real encounter would leave most people catatonic, let alone irrevocably changed for the rest of their days, and probably not in a good way. </p>

<p>If aliens exist, I think &#39;good&#39; aliens would understand any meetings with any humans would be far too detrimental to try. </p>

<p>Go check the Twitter feed you thick skulls. You will see where we hit Trump, Putin, Medvedev, Hillary and others all at once with dead to rights evidence re: 9/11 and Israel&#39;s involvement.</p>

<p>Then just YESTERDAY there is a leak about how Trump shared with Russia that Israel was going to try and carry out ANOTHER 9/11 scale false flag event via its baby, ISIS.</p>

Until he deleted that tweet about working for the DNC, I thought he was someone who smoked too much pot, was trying to figure things out and got himself caught up in something (similar to how he got caught up in Obama and the DNC at one point. Recently, on this thread from his reddit account <a href="/u/moderndayTJ">/u/moderndayTJ</a> he claims he&#39;s a person referenced in the Book of Revelation. Here&#39;s the thread, &#39;It&#39;s time you knew the truth&#39;. (I think red flags should FLY up when you see a title like that). Look at his claims in there.

(giving reason for the Obama account following him and 630k others) What is your response to that? Or his claims he had Comey arrested? The 4chan post on 5/10 said the arrest of Hillary was happening that day. Where&#39;s that? (And how many times are you going to fall for that one, sheesh)</p>

<p>And I would never suggest anyone give up their skepticism. </p>

<p>I would only argue that people REALLY look. Don&#39;t just listen to some audio/video and assume that because it&#39;s hard to believe it must be false.  Check out the source material then keep track of where it all goes. </p>

<p>Many of the predictions from his inside sources have proven to be true again and again. -much to my surprise. specifically regarding the slow disclosure movement. </p>

There were all kinds of infrared and Other types of photos of the object, even one which showed a partial block of it and then the object moved past the block. Frame by frame.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. As a reference here is his tweet on working for the DNC.
The account has a few tweets as far back as &#39;09, but then a wide gap between them. Obviously, people take breaks from social media, but I&#39;d wager dollars to doughnuts that there was a lot of pro Obama stuff (and likely other things of the current nature) tweeted during that time which was then deleted after he jumped on the Trump train. I think he&#39;s almost off of that too now, but is hanging on and leaning in his favor. Should tell you a lot. </p>

<p>Edit- Oh what a coincidence! He deleted the tweet saying he worked for the DNC. Here is my original post about it a few days ago.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6b87g7/stargate_truth/dhl4zq3/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6b87g7/stargate_truth/dhl4zq3/</a></p>

<p>I would hope this occurrence seals the deal for some of those wondering how legit this stuff all was/is.</p>

Someone else pointed it out first (I&#39;ll look for their name and post to give them the credit) and I then did my best to put 2 and 2 together. As you can see, those who agree with him do nothing to say the tweet about him working for the DNC is false. </p>

Some folks got up in arms initially because Obama was his 1st follow. Barry follows 630k other folks. Initially the account had a tweet about at once working for the DNC &amp; having a change of heart. I rationalized that this is why the Obama account followed him, not any of his recent information. His posts go back to &#39;09 and he probably also tweeted a lot of pro Obama/DNC crap at that time, but deleted it when he jumped on Trump&#39;s train. Since I referenced that tweet though, it has been deleted. THAT should tell you a whole bunch about this person&#39;s intent.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m willing to discuss both politics and UFOs and I do find it interesting with the recent disclosures. However it just feels like a giant LAARP. Some of the people telling their &quot;stories&quot; can barely keep a straight face. They are high on story telling ability but low on facts or evidence.
For instance:
<a href="http://www.drboylan.com/altimarianslanded.html">http://www.drboylan.com/altimarianslanded.html</a>
He claims to worked with an alien race know as altimarians in 2008.
Yet his best piece of evidence of them is... a drawing?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.drboylan.com/index.html">http://www.drboylan.com/index.html</a>
and I find him repeating much of what is being said in other places. 
The drawings make everything seem so fake. The issue is there is too much written/story evidence and not enough hard evidence (photos, video) Which is a lot harder to LAARP.</p>

<p>Corbett discussing how alien UFOs are probably just a psyop:

    <div class="md"><p>high on story and low on evidence? It may seem that way but much of what he is saying does actually have more evidence to it, you just aren&#39;t aware of it. </p>

<p>The &quot;alien UFO psyop&quot; narrative just doesn&#39;t hold water. Secret space programs and a breakaway civilization? yeah sure but non-humans are  very evidently  part of the picture. </p>

<p>I am sure they have used the &quot;alien&quot; cover as a means to muddy the waters but the evidence is overwhelming that there are indeed non-humans interacting with earth. It doesn&#39;t have to be one or the other. That&#39;s what makes this issue so hard for people to understand . We have been conditioned to accept one thing or the other and maintain an worldview inside of a narrow frame. </p>

<p>Consider the Alien abduction phenomenon. There are literally millions of people who claim to have encountered non-human E.t. life and this phenomenon, contrary to popular belief, stretches back all through human history. This phenomenon includes actual physical evidence by way of objects made of exotic metals removed from people&#39;s bodies. </p>

<p>You can always keep making the argument that really it&#39;s just human beings concealing themselves with mind control, ect but after a while it seems to be multiplying unnecessarily. </p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t explain the alien skulls or the tiny mummified body that was featured in the Sirius documentary. DNA testers said it &quot;couldn&#39;t be medically classified&quot;.
  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/23/sirius-documentary-dna-re_n_3135628.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/23/sirius-documentary-dna-re_n_3135628.html</a></p>

<p>that&#39;s not even the half of it but I digress...</p>

<p>Disclosure is a work.</p>

<p>Lets assume ETs are real and we&#39;re not alone as our simple human intelligence on this planet, which is reasonable to say after enough research. Under our current system there is no reason to push real disclosure outside a facade to try and catch people into a net to continue the division. It would not benefit those at the top of pyramid and those who are in the know that have a kind enough soul to want to reveal this information would never do so until after they have passed on. They&#39;ve likely been involved in terrible things and would not be willing to atone for those sins in this dimension.</p>

<p>Our way of life as we know it is likely coming to an end sooner then later, this ayylmao thing is probably a step towards the deconstruction of the modern world view.  Then the culling will begin.</p>

<p>Avoid the light. </p>

<p>But Delonge claims it has been postponed. Even worse, it coincides with June 1st and warnings against &quot;false ET gifts&quot; presented at least one year ago. </p>

<p>&quot;Beware the bearers of false gifts and their broken promises.
Much pain, but still time. Believe there is good out there.
We oppose deception. Conduit closing. 0x07&quot; </p>

<p>Biblical context puts Delonge on the side of deception, with its canonical warning that Satan will appear deceivingly as an &quot;angel of light&quot; in the end days.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Fall of Man was the story of mankind eating a &#39;gift&#39; (apple from tree of knowledge) and gaining powers unfit for eternity and Eden. This was an act of deception and a trap to harm mankind. </p>

<p>If mankind gets another gift like that, it would explain the need for &#39;apocalypse&#39; in order to wipe out the poison. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Fuck</em> a &quot;calvary&quot;.</p>

<p>We need to be the God damn calvary ourselves God dammit.</p>

<p>Humanity is not weak, yet we&#39;re <em>acting</em> like weak pieces of shit idiots.  A &quot;calvary&quot; is not what&#39;s needed at all.  What&#39;s needed is <em>us</em> as a species to get up off our lazy, weak-acting asses, come together as the one united species that we in fact all are, and fight together against what the elite on this planet are doing to us.  It&#39;s as simple as that.</p>

<p><em>WE</em> NEED TO BE THE &quot;CALVARY&quot;.  And we&#39;re not doing that.  We&#39;re not stepping up to the plate and saving <em>ourselves</em>.  Therefore, even if what VictoryOfLight is saying is true (and I have a feeling it&#39;s actually not), then that &quot;calvary&quot; needs to simply be sent back where they came from...because so long as we don&#39;t pull up our <em>own</em> bootstraps as a species and get to work on the problems that we have in front of us OURSELVES, we don&#39;t <em>deserve</em> any sort of &quot;calvary&quot; to come in and &quot;save&quot; us.  We don&#39;t <em>deserve</em> saving.</p>

<p>We have to save OURSELVES.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.</p>

<p>The disclosure of the truth of ET existence on and around this cosmos, galaxy, solar system, and <em>planet</em> does indeed need to happen.  I agree with that.  However, we as a species have just been wading in weak sauce for far too long, and ET disclosure alone isn&#39;t magically going to suddenly get us to stop acting the way we&#39;ve been acting for quite a long time now.</p>

<p>WE need to stop acting that way ourselves, like VOL said in the statement you quoted.</p>
