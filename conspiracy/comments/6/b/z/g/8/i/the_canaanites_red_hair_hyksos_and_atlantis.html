       It's awesome to see a post about this. One of my favorite subjects and I've researched extensively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the Canaanites are connected to the Khazarians... and the Hyksos are the true Tribes of Israel (lineage of Abraham). The Khazarians have been pretending to be the true Israelites and are the Jesuits/Zionists today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Hyksos are the red-haired Egyptian Pharoahs who brought horses into Egypt...  Jacob, Joseph the Patriarch, Moses, etc were Hyksos. They were not native to Egypt and probably looked slightly Asian, yet had reddish or blondish hair. (see the mummies of Yuya and Tuya, parents of Ay).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Khazarians would be more connected to the Priest class of Egypt, (black sorcerers of Atlantis) and were enemies of Akhenaten.
      </p>
      <p>
       What most people still do not realize is that Moses and Akhenaten are the same person. Ay (father of Nefertiti) is the biblical Ephraim, son of Joseph the Patriarch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scota, the daughter of Akhenaten (Moses) and Nefertiti later settled in what became Scotland and took those genetic traits with her.

       Very interesting! I had a genetics test and the results show that my paternal haplogroup is e1b1b1a2 which is from Egypt and king ramses 2 shares it! I also have red hair and Ashkenazi DNA. I thought maybe I was of Canaanite descent. I have a very tiny amount of Turkic DNA, Yakuts, so thought maybe I got that from khazaria. I think J is more Arab and Jewish so idk if e is good. But maybe j is just people pretending to be true Hebrews.

       The author Ahmed Osman wrote several books about Akhentan/Moses and the Amarna Period in Egypt. He is the only writer to accurately draw parallels between many of the biblical events with the historical Egyptian events... and oddly enough Sigmund Freud figured out that Moses was Akhenaten as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biblical historians have mis-timed the events written about by hundreds of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of my personal contact experiences with my guides (long story) have provided me with some additional information about my incarnations during this period of Egypt. I lived a life as one of the Hyksos figures, and is probably why I'm so fascinated by the subject.

       Not a physical relation, but a soul incarnation. Our incarnations from lifetime to lifetime are not bound by bloodlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while we can trace our DNA back through generations on a physical level, and you do carry DNA memory this way, we may have lived within completely different families through those times as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have the identity of a lifetime I lived during the Amarna Period from contact with my ET guides and studied as much as I could on my own, given a few clues to go on.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all to say, that at our most fundamental level we are souls having brief physical lifetimes again and again.

       Everyone has spirit guides of some kind... the population of earth is mostly comprised of souls who have evolved only on Earth from simple life to more complex, but there are also millions of souls who come from other parts of the galaxy and have descended into 3rd density to live a human life. It is not as rare or special as it sounds, and everyone is equal as a part of Source-Creation. It is just a matter of perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big difference is that Earth-native souls have been thrown back into the reincarnation program again and again by inter-dimensional beings called Archons, with no control over what bloodlines they end up in. The non-terrestrial/ET souls volunteer to live on Earth so that we may assist in freeing the population from the Archons (basically demons) and other negative ETs who have been secretly running things for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we are all becoming more awake and aware in the past few years, evolving in consciousness, more and more of us are receiving 'downloads' or telepathic messages from our guides. This happens during meditation, but other times as well. This is going to increase until the point in time where our ET soul families are able to reveal themselves during open contact. All of this will happen in the near future. Everyone will benefit from this and it will be like a new golden age on Earth.

       During the past 25,000 year cycle of our solar system around the Milky Way dark groups have infiltrated our planet and through free will have tricked us into playing along with a system that has hidden our true potential and abilities from us. This all began with the fall of Atlantis during a time when the advanced civilizations turned to warfare, greed, and fell away from spiritual truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       These archons are from another part of the galaxy (Andromeda) and are parasites who feed off of human bio-energy (loosh) through the co-opted religions, our corrupt financial systems and through the rituals carried out by satanists and luciferians. Most people in power within the government are these kinds of people and they do these rituals in secret. The Cabal/Illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Archons are coordinated by a being that in ancient gnostic texts is called Yaldaboath.
      </p>
      <p>
       The light is return again to the planet, and all of this happens through the will of the Source-Creator. The vibrational frequency of all life on earth rises and through this we are again able to connect to our higher dimensional selves. We are able to 'choose' to be free, and thus our ET soul families are able to intervene on our behalf. They do no save us, but we save ourselves with their assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The archons also work with the Draco Reptilians, sometimes other groups like Mantids or Greys. They are unable to stop anything that is happening now, and the changes happening to us are inevitable. Positive ET groups are standing by, waiting for the moment of 'compression breakthrough' of light from the galactic central sun (center of Milky Way). When this happens, many plans will be triggered including the mass arrests of these satanists, release of hidden technologies, and shortly after, open contact with ET civilizations.

       I think this has something to do with the Shuman resonance, or however it is spelled. The electromagnetic energy increasing, effects the frequency our bodies and brains work at, allowing us to achieve higher states of being and perception, allowing us to 'download' knowledge and be in contact with extra-dimensional beings.

       I did think the correlation to Schumann applied as well, and had been telling people as much. I think this might be incorrect though... I'm not totally sure. The spikes of the Schumann are much higher lately, although the average frequency is not rising in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not discount the concept though, and everything you said is very true.

       I have a question. You say the Khazarians are pretending to be Israelites. I'm assuming they started this pretending long ago. But wouldn't the Khazarians of today not even know about the pretending? These Khazarians of today would think and believe they are of Israeli descent, right? They don't know they are fake/pretending. Am I making sense?

       Many of them are able to keep their memories from lifetime to lifetime, because they also control the incarnational system itself. These are people like the Rothschilds and other bloodline elite who the public doesn't see. They live very long lives feeding off the bio-energy of children through blood ritual and sacrifices to the archons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The archons and Draco descend into 3rd density and their souls enter the bodies of these bloodline family members. They can exist here in non-physical as well, on the astral/etheric planes.

       Most Khazarians/Ashkenazis have nothing to do with the evil stuff, this is just the chosen lineage of the dark groups based on their unique ET DNA. All humans have ET DNA, some more than others... basically all humans evolved to the point of neanderthal and the visiting ETs engineered the human body to a more advanced state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the Jews of Israel are very defensive about being God's chosen ones but this is unfortunate brainwashing. The God of the Old Testament, Yahweh, was just one of many who came to Earth. There is also Yaldaboath who factors into the deception as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionists/Jesuits/Khazarians/Wahhabists who hold the most power, who practice satanism know exactly who they are. The ones at the top of the 'pyramid'. It's the general public who doesn't. Jews are the victims of the fake jews/Khazarians.

       Okay, some of this seems far-fetched to me. But, I have an open mind. I admit that it could all be true. But, I am still a skeptic on some of it.

       I will tell what I do think is true (although I have no solid proof). I think there is a group of elites who practice Satanism. And these people are the extremely wealthy elites who control everything.

       Not specifically, but as far as I can understand, the genetic diversity of humans is due to the differences in ET genetics each race/ethnic group is sourced from.
