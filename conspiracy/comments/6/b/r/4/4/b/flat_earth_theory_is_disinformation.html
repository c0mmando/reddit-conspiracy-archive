       In fact it's the globe earth theory which is new and unproven. Humanity has believed the world is flat, motionless and covered for most of our existence as thinking beings until just a few hundred years ago when mainstream science adopted and stuck with a single man's theory. The globe may just be a scientific fad!

       What if they just brigaded the flat earth theory by making believers look stupid? TPTB do it to other conspiracies. Obviously is Neil Degras tyson or whatever make such a big point to criticize it

       What if Flat Earth theory is ridiculed and called disinformation so that people become skeptical of those doing the ridiculing and investigate for themselves, only to find out that the theory may hold water? This is getting too next level for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously, is flat earth something worth looking into? I really am getting skeptical of the attacks against flat earthers, much like the MSM's discredited campaign against Trump.

       The problem with FE is that there are simply too many holes in the logic. Gravity does not work on a flat earth. Why do we see different constellations in different hemispheres? Why are all the other planets spherical? If you have a powerful zoom lens, you can go around the outside edge of lake michigan and watch the city skyline sink below the horizon as you get further away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think the FE movement spawned as an antithesis of 'scientism' which is basically science as a religion. Science is not a higher power or something to be worshiped and 'believed' in, its something to be tested and explored. Thats why I encourage all flat earthers to first pick a shape that you think the earth is, then devise an experiment to test that theory.

       Every point you've listed here I've see a a flat earth video address and convincingly explain. They seem do to it in a logical scientific way and they don't resort to name calling like lots of people I've seen attack the flat earthers with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying flat earth is true but the people debating flat earthers really need to watch their videos listen to their arguments and provide convincing counter points without name calling and obvious distraction tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes those of us on the fence wonder why the globe model is being defended so poorly when it should be super easy to defend. Ive even seen videos of celebrity scientist resort to name calling or blatantly avoid someone's question by answering one they didn't ask.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flat earthers come off as cool collected and their  arguments well thought out. Their opponents look like they're just covering their ears calling names and yelling. ? ? It makes me confused and suspicious.
      </p>

       Not saying flat earth is correct but something feels off.

       Every time they make one of their 'proof' videos, its either disingenuous or easily debunked. They hide behind multi-hour videos in which they make false statement after false statement, usually because they don't understand physics. There is no flat earth model for gravity that makes any physical sense, I've asked many times and gotten a few different answers. The most common is that we simply 'sink' in air because we are more dense. Here is my response to that claim:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thats not a plausible explanation. Density is not a force, its a measure of mass per unit volume. For an object to move, a force has to act on it. If there were no gravity and you placed a rock in water, it would not move as there is no force acting on it. The force that causes an object to sink is gravity.
First lets talk about how fluids behave. As you get deeper in water, pressure increases as more and more water is on top of you pushing down. So lets say you are scubadiving and you are sitting right at 5ft depth. At your feet, the water pressure is higher than at your head. To calculate the force, you would multiply the surface area by the pressure. On the lower half of your body, you are being pushed on harder than the upper half, so the net force is actually UPWARD, that is why you feel lighter when you're in water than when you're on land: The density gradient in water is higher because its a more dense fluid. The reason you sink is that you are being pulled down towards earth harder than you are being pushed upward by pressure differences.
So lets say that it is pressure differences holding us down (even though we know that the pressure gradient is actually pushing us up), in that case, more dense objects should fall faster than less dense objects. But we can demonstrate that thats not true: drop a block of lead and a block of wood: they fall at the same rate, meaning density does not effect the rate of descent. Additionally, if density gradients were causing us to 'sink' to the earth, if you were to pull a vacuum in a glass container and put an object in it, that object would not sink as there is no density gradient to sink in. Or you could make the argument that it should sink FASTER, because you can't pull a true vacuum, so it would actually just be less dense air. Neither are the case: it falls at the same speed.
       </p>

       They've also never explained why you see different constellations in the southern hemisphere. They'd made the claim that you can see the north star from everywhere, but thats completely false, you can't see it in the southern hemisphere. If you actually ask that in FE subs you'll get banned, or they will default to 'you're brainwashed into thinking they're different' or 'none of what we see or understand is true'.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say that you can zoom in on a ship that has 'disappeared' over the horizon to bring it back into focus... this is true only at a certain distance, where distortion and mirage from the water's surface is keeping it out of focus, if you continue to watch the ship, it disappears hull first over the curve. They will make all kinds of videos showing a ship far out but moving parallel to them, not away from them, and pretend that that proves their point.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       When confronted with these things, they either say they are fake, shills, or more commonly they will draw lines tangent to the curve of the earth,so assuming that you are an observer with 0 height, then pretend that objects should be hundreds of feet below us, but that is not an actual line of sight, its a tangent line.

       heres a video where a flat earther tries to use physics to show inconsistencies in gravitational theory:

       Great video for the first half, but then he misunderstands the fact that he is really looking at accelerations due to forces. I explained why the masses cancel:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The reason the mass of the smaller object doesn't matter in this set of equations is that in this case, gravity is the force that is turning the larger object. A larger object has more momentum, so it is harder to turn, but its larger mass also means the attractive force of gravity is larger. The force doesn't 'go away', the mass of the object is just important to both the object's momentum and the force of gravity.
Tie that mass ball to a string and spin it around, then tie a bowling ball to that same string. The bowling ball is harder to turn because it has more momentum, but also there is more tension in the string, aka more gravitational force.
Then for his next point about the mass of jupiter, they are observing the moons of jupiter orbit jupiter, meaning the big M in that equation is the mass of jupiter, so they can solve for that by observing the time it takes the moon to orbit jupiter and observing how far the moon is from jupiter.
When he talks about the force being 'no longer a force', he has a system of 4 equations on the board, but he only cancels mass from 2 of them, but keeps the equals sign. Thats incorrect algebra, you divide through by mass, so Fc/m = v2/r = GM/r2= Fg/m.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Every time you point out a fallacy, incorrect math, incorrect physics, or suggest an experiment to show that their logic is incorrect, they either ignore you or come back with a similar slight misunderstanding. I didn't have all of this math and physics down cold, I could maybe be tricked by their arguments. I admire the fact that this guy tried to use physics to show something was off, but he just made some basic mistakes like not doing correct algebra and not understanding the concept of inertia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I am so passionate about this is because we should ALWAYS be seeking truth, math and physics are one way to do that. In the physical, non-supernatural realm, those are the tools we are given: observation, logic, math. When we abandon those for blind belief in an ideology, we are giving up an important aspect of what makes us human. FE is a clever twisting of the truth to push an agenda, the irony is they shout 'OPEN YOUR EYES, WAKE UP PEOPLE!' but they are so invested in their belief, that to give up on it when presented with evidence would be to give up a part of their identity. So I don't get angry when I debate them, but I do think its sad.

       Look into it. There are people here that ridicule flat earth but are waiting for September 23rd for a rare occurrence in the heavens. How is that possible on a ball hurtling through space? How is it that the ancients could tell time by the same stars we see now? How is the north star visible from every country on earth if it's a spinning ball? A good zoom lens can prove there is no curvature and people say flat earth logic is flawed...ok. Look into it man.

       Because the constellations change seasonally with our orbit around the sun, and if you keep track of what constellations are visible and where they are in the sky, you can notice seasonal patterns.

       Thats not true, You can't see the north star from australia, in fact you have a completely different set of constellations in the southern hemisphere. Don't just believe me, though, go check it out for yourself.

       Not true, you can help get rid of mirage from the surface of the water, you can use that lens to prove the earth has curvature. The easiest way is to drive around a large lake with a city on its banks. As you get further away, notice how the skyscrapers sink below the horizon. Zoom in as much as you want, they will keep sinking as you get further away. Nikon p900 is great for this.

       I enjoyed Flat Earth videos and the ideas in them very much for about a year or two but I haven't seen anything new or interesting in a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got started with the Math powerland videos. There are two, each about an hour long and he only says the ideas plainly towards the end of the second video. These were some of the first FE videos ever. What took him 2 hours to get to is now summed up in a 5 minute video. Just not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was recently watching a long version of this NASA video with my 6 year old. It's a famous video with Flat Earthers cuz its one where the woman astronaut is giving the tour of the ISS. So often the videos show certain parts of the tour pointing out things that look fake, all well and good but when I watched the whole tour i could not believe what i saw! The woman goes into the Cupola of the space station, the viewing area with all the windows, and she pans a video camera all around! Filming out of all the different windows! Showing the Earth and parts of the ISS in a long continuous take. I had been looking for footage where an astronaut pans a camera around, and Flat Earth videos mention how u can't find such footage- so when i found said footage, in a longer version of a video FLat Earth videos so often reference...kind of a "F*ck Flat Earth moment for me.
