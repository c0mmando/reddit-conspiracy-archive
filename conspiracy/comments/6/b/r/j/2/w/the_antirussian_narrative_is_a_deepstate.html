       There's no question, folks. The mainstream media's anti-Russian crusade is a conspiracy for the Deep State and the globalist financial system. While the Democrats probably viewed this as an opportunity to discredit Trump, it seems that the plan to attack Russia with propaganda, to justify an arms race and further sanctions, originated long before the 2016 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three main interests driving this propaganda effort to discredit and attack Russia:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic Party, in order to attack Trump and explain the election loss; this has already been extensively discussed elsewhere so I won't bring it up here.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The globalist financial system, and the big banks,
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The military-industrial complex.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       In 2016 Russia announced that it would start selling oil to China on the Yuan rather than the
       <a href="http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/saudi-arabia-has-lost-asia-russia-now-chinas-biggest-oil-partner/ri12611">
        dollar
       </a>
       . Over the past decade Russia's acceptance of the Yuan has driven a vast increase in its market share of Chinese oil imports, from 7% in 2000 to 15% today. Saudi Arabia, which once dominated this export market, now faces critical competition from Russia. Russia's 2016 announcement that it would transition fully to the Yuan in its sales to China represented a threat to Saudi Arabia and the petrodollar system more generally.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrodollar_recycling">
        petrodollar recycling
       </a>
       supports the globalist financial complex, by keeping third-word nations beholden to powerful multinational creditors and American banks. In essence, in danger of oversimplifying this idea, Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar sell their oil in dollars. They export largely to emerging economies like China and third-world countries in South Asia. To purchase this oil, India and China need dollars; to get dollars, they need to sell debt to American banks. As such, the sale of oil in dollars not only maintains demand for the dollar, which benefits American financial institutions, but forces third-world importers to accept loans from multinational banks, thus keeping these countries beholden to the global financial system. The reason for the Deep State's support for Saudi Arabia and complicity in their promotion of Wahhabi terrorism is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       because they sell us oil; on the contrary, less than 6% of our oil supply derives from Saudi Arabia. The reason the establishment supports Saudi Arabia is because the country props up the global petrodollar system.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past ten years, however, Russia threatened this system by starting to sell oil to China in non-U.S. currency. When Qaddafi's Libya likewise left the petrodollar and planned to sell oil for gold, they were immediately deposed by Clinton's murderous cabal. Now Libya is a failed state destroyed by civil war. I think the Clinton cabal, and the Deep State/financial establishment more generally, recognized a far graver threat in Russia's sale of oil and natural gas to Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the past several years, China's government has been planning a pipeline and infrastructure system to link the Western Provinces and Central Asia directly to Pakistan and South Asia, culminating in the announcement of their
       <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/china/belt-road-initiative-china-plans-1-trillion-new-silk-road-n757756">
        Silk Road system
       </a>
       . This project could relocate the global center of power and threaten the economic hegemony of the United States. Furthermore, when completed, it will allow Russia to sell oil directly to India, Pakistan, and South Asia, and greatly expand its market share. If Russia continues phasing out dollars for its oil exports, and competes directly with Saudi Arabia in oil sales to India and Pakistan, the petrodollar system will be grievously threatened. These export markets will no longer need to indebt themselves to American financial institutions to buy oil. Especially if Russia sells oil for gold or through direct trade (e.g., exchange of equipment or materials), the globalist financial hegemony will be threatened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence why the globalist finance-controlled Deep State is attacking Russia with its propaganda networks, to justify additional sanctions and economic containment of this country. Furthermore, the powerful military-industrial conglomerates, the arms complex, are certainly interested in the opportunities of a new Cold War and anti-Russian arms race, to say nothing of dragging the U.S. into proxy wars in Syria, Eastern Ukraine, and the Caucasus. Since the end of the old Cold War these high-tech industrial conglomerates, which only survive because of government funding, have been itching for a new Arms Race and opportunity for profit. They certainly stand to benefit from a military escalation with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the entire mainstream media embarks on a propaganda campaign, make no mistake, there are other forces at work. Never trust the MSM and its anti-Russian bullshit. They're trying to attack Russia at the behest of powerful financial and industrial interests, in addition to the Clintons and their cabal.

       Or, you're wrong and Russia is actively trying to drag down democracy all over the world by supporting candidates that will pull out of treaties and distance themselves from their allies, giving us plenty of reason for concern if our leadership has connections they are lying about. So it could be either one really.

       One is perfectly rational, and makes a great deal of sense, putting most global events into a coherent chain.

       The other is irrational fear mongering, appealing to a psychotic fear of foreigners who hate freedum.

       It's not just you.  The entire red scare narrative boils down to "they're a bunch o evil commie bastards who hate murica, hate freedum, and want to destroy the wurld.". I haven't seen a
       <em>
        rational
       </em>
       presentation of why the RUSSHINS are so evil, and have meddled in every American controversy ever.  Russia stays fairly isolated, militarily, staying close to their borders, and not meddling/murdering all over the planet, like murica does.  Sure, they have their problems, but not on the global murderous scale that we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrast this, with viewing international events through the prism of The petrodollar/financial imperialism narrative.  Suddenly, nearly every single invasion, war, conflict, and propaganda blitz makes
       <em>
        rational
       </em>
       sense.  It's evil, greedy, disgusting, but
       <em>
        rational
       </em>
       , because it makes sense, and no matter how much propaganda is thrown at us, it doesn't make any sense at all, under the "muh RUSSHINS!!" narrative.

       I would suggest listening more to all points of view. There is a strategy by powerful people of "wagging the dog". When things are not going well, you find an enemy that can be easily villified (Putin is a monster, and indeed Russia is an enemy that should not be trusted. They do meddle in the affairs of European and American politics, but we do the exact same thing) to attract attention away from other serious issues. The Russian narrative is being parroted by all the big names in corporate media right now, and the major players of western government are doing the exact same thing while in close league with the intelligence agencies. This is a red flag and should make people weary of what these elites are up to. Beware, watch,and listen.

       I only hope that if they do bring down the petrodollar, that they don't set up China as next next big imperial nightmare.  China has many of the same "capitalist" globalist players, and they have no problem enslaving their own people.

       Read the Trilateral update on Russia Containment (the original study from 1995 is worth it as well).   You can see what worries them and what they are after:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Develop  a coordinated strategy with Europe to establish a 20-30% target for U.S LNG energy exports.
       </p>
       <p>
        Revise  the  law  on 
U.S.  natural  gas  exports
,  which  simplifies  export  licensing 
procedures  for  gas  shipments  to  U.S.  free  trade  partners  by  presuming  that  such 
exports serve the U.S. national interest, but does not extend the same presumption 
to U.S. allies.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What worries the deep state about its Middle East policy and Russia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The  location  and  sheer  size  of  Russia’s  land  area  impacts  the 
disposition  of  issues  ranging  from  the  selection  of  transport  routes  for  energy  and  other 
trade to the maint
enance of supply lines for NATO forces in Afghanistan.
       </p>
