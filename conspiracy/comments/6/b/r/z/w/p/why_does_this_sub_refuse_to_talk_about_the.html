    <div class="md"><p>Because nothing substantial has been provided to back the insinuation that Americans should fear Russia, or that Russia has done anything wrong at all. It&#39;s really quite absurd that people are still talking about it.</p>

<p>As someone else pointed out yesterday, there&#39;s still way more circumstantial evidence backing up Pizzagate than a Russian conspiracy to meddle in US affairs. So it looks extremely suspicious watching the mainstream corporate media twist themselves in knots to defend something they can&#39;t prove or properly explain - while calling other more believable conspiracies &#39;debunked&#39; that haven&#39;t been.</p>

<p>Since Trump took office the commenters in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are now primarily about getting Trump out of office, same as <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.

<p>My understanding:
*There&#39;s the heavily disputed dossier. 
*Jeff Sessions met the ambassador (in his capacity as a US Senator, in his office, on the record)
*Flynn used the word sanction in his conversation with the ambassador.
*Clapper says the investigations so far have provided no evidence of collusion. </p>

<p>Is there anything more substantial that I missed? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been no public evidence and the MSM has repetitive mislead the public on the topic email leaks. For example you had multiple leaks from multiple sourced (DNC, Podesta, Gucifer2.0 etc). MSM doesn&#39;t talk about any specifics. For example Podesta&#39;s emials for not &quot;hacked&quot;, he fell prey to phising attempts. DNC emails were probably from a leaker. The MSM beats the drum of &quot;Russian Hackers&quot; but there are no details or nuance.  Furthermore there has been little new information revealed about any of this stuff since October. And after the election people decided to care about it. This gives the appearance that this is only an issue because the wrong person lost. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the DNC then refused to let the FBI look at their server. The main intelligence agencies can&#39;t be trusted. Why should we trust the FBI when they haven&#39;t gotten to even look at the server? The NSA spies on everyone. And lied to the public about it. The CIA hacked congress when they were investigating their crimes related to torture. None of these groups have earned any public trust and constantly lie.</p>

<p>Further more we recently learned that Russia had access to thousands of yahoo accounts. Huma Abedin has a yahoo account. There is a pretty good chance the Russian government has every email that Huma received and sent. None of these emails were leaked. They would be farm more damaging and possible contain classified information.  If Russia really wanted to damage Hillary why not release those?</p>

<p>Russia may have tried to get information from some campaign members but that is normal intelligence gather that most nations do.</p>

<p>There is motive for pushing this narrative. This Trump/Russian conspiracy has damaged the Trump administrations ability to govern and forced them to change some of their foreign policy goals. Trump can no longer easily work the Russia in Syria for example. The DeepState wanted regime change there so there is motive for pushing this narrative for that reason alone. Trump is a dangerous figure in for the government and media establishment. He isn&#39;t a politician and he didn&#39;t rely on the traditional media. He has shown you can get to the oval office without the establishment&#39;s blessing, and if he is successful other people may copy him. Instead of a party insider you could have a Bloomberg or other billionaires directly participating in the politic class instead of just paying them off with campaign contributions. </p>
