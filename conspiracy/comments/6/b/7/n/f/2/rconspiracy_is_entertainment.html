    <div class="md"><p>Okay. take the topic of alternate history. It&#39;s very wide. Some people attempt to track down historical sources of information that conflict with the current narrative (I think they do this pretty successfully). Other people take this into speculation, &quot;what if scenarios&quot;, with weak evidence. And still others chase what mostly consists of repeated tales and stories that build upon themselves into alternate realities. Now any of this could be true, but the burden of truth lies with the presenter of the idea. Is it aliens? Lost civilizations? Interdenominational beings, break away civilizations? Or just fantasy?</p>

<p>Take the franklin scandal, for example, and the dutroux affair. The info at the fringes of these very real political cover-ups deal with luciferianism in the power elite. What does this mean?

<p>r/conspiracy is an invaluable reference for determining baseline truth on many issues.  </p>

<p>Visiting r/ conspiracy helped me to determine what stories were pure crap and those that could have merit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look into things myself a lot as does my uncle.</p>

<p>Mostly this place is just entertainment watching trolls role play trying to convince others the earth is flat, reptilians own us, trump is the best man ever and hillary ate babies on slices of cheese pizza while playing ping pong.</p>

<p>The mods encourage it all so I am guessing they like the sub to be entertainment based as well.</p>

<p>I just like seeing how well people can create the fictions they do here on those things. Some of them are probably psych students doing experiments here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted outside this sub, and then people go through your post history and then say: &quot;I see you post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot;. As soon as normies (hive mind) see that, they downvote to hell, even if what the user is saying is correct. Textbook shilling and smear tactic. Looking at you JTRIG cunts. </p>
