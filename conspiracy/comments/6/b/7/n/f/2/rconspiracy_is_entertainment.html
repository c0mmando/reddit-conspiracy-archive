       I've posted outside this sub, and then people go through your post history and then say: "I see you post in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ". As soon as normies (hive mind) see that, they downvote to hell, even if what the user is saying is correct. Textbook shilling and smear tactic. Looking at you JTRIG cunts.

       It's certainly different than reading the MSM, but it is so quickly splintered (I would argue) along the lines of what people find entertaining.

       Okay. take the topic of alternate history. It's very wide. Some people attempt to track down historical sources of information that conflict with the current narrative (I think they do this pretty successfully). Other people take this into speculation, "what if scenarios", with weak evidence. And still others chase what mostly consists of repeated tales and stories that build upon themselves into alternate realities. Now any of this could be true, but the burden of truth lies with the presenter of the idea. Is it aliens? Lost civilizations? Interdenominational beings, break away civilizations? Or just fantasy?

       There are truly strange things in this world. Some of these things can be gleaned through research into the stuff that we do know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the franklin scandal, for example, and the dutroux affair. The info at the fringes of these very real political cover-ups deal with luciferianism in the power elite. What does this mean? I dont know exactly, but I think it leads you to think that other things could be happening that we have no idea of.

       The kinks of the powerful and mechanisms to control them are well documented though vigorously denied. Bit's of it leak to the MSM to scapegoat a few and end investigation. There are legitimate sources that document this,but it take more than some r/conspiracy posts to follow the truth. If r/ conspiracy functions to just wake people to possibilities then I agree is a good start.

       IMHO if you're driving yourself crazy waiting for something to happen then it's time to take a break and focus on your well-being. The world will exist when you check back in and there's no harm in letting the world exist without your attention for a bit.

       It's really the basis of my question. What is a legitimate investigation into the nature of reality and control and what is just for fun. Perhaps it's up to the individual. I just thought that some/many people would say, It's just kind of fun to talk about aliens running the world".

       I don't come here to fund unified theories that explain how the world works in one sentence and entertain that thought. That's what movies are for I like to see how some people who post stuff here look at the corruption in the things going on around the world. Since its the only place I know to chat about this stuff besides talking to the people around you.

       Just noticing this too. Lots of eerie Larpy looking twitters and 4chan about 9/11 truth coming out of the Clinton investigation. The attack on sessions yesterday may mean that he's gonna get into the investigation. Not sure, the GCP dot is also very abnormal currently if that means anything to you.

       r/conspiracy is an invaluable reference for determining baseline truth on many issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, last year, there was so much BS promulgated by the MSM during the election, it became difficult to know what the truth was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Visiting r/ conspiracy helped me to determine what stories were pure crap and those that could have merit.

       Personal I would write the people off before the theories. One thing that I've found is the depth is rather shallow. People are great thinkers with shallow minds

      <p>
       The biggest message here is missed I feel.

       That is the need to still support/conform to a preconceived concept of reality. Even OP was pretty much politics lol aliens.

       The way the "world is controlled" has nothing to do with the way it works.

       Well, I think the difference between "how it is controlled" and "the way it works" is an interesting idea, though ism not sure i understand it. I chose entertainment meaning that most people just have a passing interest in a topic and find it amusing to see what others have to say about it.

       Mostly this place is just entertainment watching trolls role play trying to convince others the earth is flat, reptilians own us, trump is the best man ever and hillary ate babies on slices of cheese pizza while playing ping pong.

       The mods encourage it all so I am guessing they like the sub to be entertainment based as well.

       I've posted outside this sub, and then people go through your post history and then say: "I see you post in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ". As soon as normies (hive mind) see that, they downvote to hell, even if what the user is saying is correct. Textbook shilling and smear tactic. Looking at you JTRIG cunts.
