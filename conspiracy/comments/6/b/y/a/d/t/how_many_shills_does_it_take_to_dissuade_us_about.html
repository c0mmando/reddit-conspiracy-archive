    <div class="md"><p>Alright this comment is straight up division tactic.</p>

<p>Bro, there are tons of us that have been here longer than the last year. We know shills along with compliant admins have been actively trying to censor anything against their bullshit narrative. They are actively using T_D to censor anyone who speaks out against their narrative. You are not fooling anyone. Anyone can do a quick archive lookup of what Reddit and the from page used to look like up until the shills showed up and fucked everything. Before you respond take a look at r/all the last couple weeks and then take a look at r/all from any random dates in 2011, 2012, 2013.. All the way up until I say 2014/2015 we&#39;ve all seen the writing on the wall. We all called it out, we all got censored. The shill tactics being used simply aren&#39;t fooling anyone. It&#39;s a nice show boat by the elite but even they know their shit isn&#39;t working. This has been talked about for years around here. The shills have finally figured out who to come after. We don&#39;t give a fuck about sides and that&#39;s what they want to shut down. But you can&#39;t shut us down. No matter how much money and shills they throw. We are winning. </p>

<p>I ou take a look at the sticky post on the front page you can how dramatic the turn was here in r/conspiracy </p>

<p>Exactly. Bravo. That&#39;s what drives them crazy. People who advocate liberty are neither left-wing nor right-wing, they don&#39;t fall for the dialectic, and don&#39;t suffer from identity biases. And that&#39;s dangerous, subvsersive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about us. It&#39;s about the <em>normies</em> that occasionally venture into the fringe glossing over things, the general impression shills create is the one <em>they</em> get.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no point crying about this, because their <em>employers</em> own this place. There&#39;s been enough incidents by now, I hope atleast, to show even the most critical thinkers <em>they</em> own the internet.</p>

<p>They can nuke reddit threads (through shills and mods, admins if necessary -we all remember the sneaky, shadowy, stuff that happened, rite?-, they can nuke the chans, they own the big media websites and they&#39;ve shown they can even take down (partially) legitimate alt-news websites almost instantaniously when posting sensitive content (pizzagate cough).</p>

<p>We don&#39;t stop them, we can&#39;t, the interwebz don&#39;t work that way. Despite what you might believe, the majority of people don&#39;t come into direct contact with their actual power like we do. They think the internet is of the people for the people. What is astroturfing (shilling) for us is <em>the internet</em> for them, which has always been the exact purpose of these tactics.</p>

<p>We are only a very small portion of the actual population. To push back against pretty much the entire front of the internet (youtube, reddit, google, the big ISP&#39;s/domain hosts, ...) you&#39;ll need alot more people aware of this issue, which there just isn&#39;t at this moment.</p>

<p>So I suggest you try to ignore it. If you&#39;re debating (or fighting) them you&#39;ve already lost (by spending the time you could&#39;ve spend researching conspiracies!), and like you pointed out, for us &quot;insiders&quot; it&#39;s very easy to spot this behaviour. </p>

<p>If you ever push a normie into conspiracy territory (like a friend or relative), this should be in the 101. Learn to spot it, then ignore it, or downvote... or both.</p>

<p>Good luck brobeans.</p>

<p>The only time I&#39;ve disagreed with an action they&#39;ve taken is when they flaired a few posts critical of DT as unverified. Which was the only time it was ever used. But that has since been addressed. </p>

<p>The only two things that I really see enforced are no personal attacks or doxxing. Which are both very much needed. Other than that they take a rather hands off approach and allow the community to decide what content hits the FrontPage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t read too much into it, my algorithms are borrowed from work and modified to assign tags based on how closely a poster&#39;s history aligns to known talking points, methods, keywords and phrases, narrative timing, and other patterns - linguistic, mostly - from known propaganda sources. Above an 85% match to the aggregate model of known Kremlin sources and you get a Russian tag, more than a 60% match to the model developed based off of the behavior of ISIS recruits and such, and you get a different tag, etc.</p>

<p>Oh, and it works to identify alternate accounts; basically anyone pumping their own posts and not using a clever means to mask themselves is likely to be identified. The thing is, though, you can tweak such things to yield whatever results you want. Using them to censor people is means entrusting whoever designed and manages them to have absolutely no ulterior motives.</p>

Advertisers use this sort of science to target users.  A form of shilling that is certainly more real than what we accuse each other of.  Why shouldn&#39;t we have the same power?

    <div class="md"><p>How would you 100% define a shill?</p>

<p>I think this is the thing many people don&#39;t realize about shilling; there aren&#39;t that many shills out there and the bots mostly work sites like Twitter where conversation is less likely. Well, vote bots are another matter. The whole point of the shills and Twitter bots is to get people to pickup on their various propaganda pieces or favored news stories via Twitter, then use vote bots to pump it up on other sites. It&#39;s much cheaper than trying to pay-per-post on Reddit - and it works, because so many people from Reddit and what not have accounts on easy-to-bot sites like Twitter. One shill can run a lot of Twitter bots, but Reddit bots are super obvious.</p>

<p>So you end up with a lot of people picking up shills&#39; talking points and repeating them all over the place - which is the real point of shills. To get real people repeating their narratives for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a hypothetical.. u/bigoilbastard is shilling for the kock brothers. He has three alts he uses as sock puppets, which he plays as dirty eco-conscious hippies. These three alts use lame arguments which he consistently defeats with his working class everyman logic.  He uses fifty of the kock brother&#39;s dummy accounts to upvote himself and slightly less for the three sock puppets for visibility.  These fifty dummy accounts have each not posted in more than a year but have never gone less than twelve hours without voting.  The fifty dummies are used for seven other shills each with three sock puppets as well as to strategically up and down the organic activity in relevant subs.  The algorithm I&#39;m imagining would apply a probability to dummies based on the unlikely nature of their activity, and then weigh that probability against all the users they vote on to determine who is shill/sock and who is organic.  A chrome/firefox extension would than tag each user with a percentage similar to RES tags.  Users of the extension do with that information what they will, after clicking it&#39;s lengthy EULA. It would be no different then the &lt;85% you gave me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d need a lot more than three strawman accounts; it&#39;d be an inefficient use of time, anyway. As ever, efficiency lies in mass repetition; spam gets the job done. You carefully tailor your narrative in various ways to catch the attention of different audiences, then release it into the wild en masse. You plant the seed and then allow it to spread organically. You make fake news sites, fake science journals, fake consumer groups; then you make more than reference those as sources, to give them all some measure of legitimacy. After which you fire up the bots and hit Twitter and sites where all you have to do is fire and forget. Then when your sites begin to appear on places like Reddit, you fire up the vote bots and promote them while rewarding commentators whose narratives most closely resemble the ones you&#39;re looking for. Maybe even promoting strawman arguments for them to easily defeat. It looks much more natural and unscripted that way and it has a much greater impact. Plus, people <em>do</em> respond to votes to different extents. It can drive people away from subs or encourage them to more extreme behavior.</p>

<p>Well, my point is just that it&#39;s one thing to tag people for amusement and your information - especially if you made an intellectually honest, technically best efforts attempt at designing your system. It&#39;s another to use it to ban people, that&#39;s all. I could see that getting out of hand real fast, depending on who was at the helm. Not everyone reacts to even small amounts of power very well and saying your code is open-source is one thing, but you can&#39;t just leave your servers wide open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These posts are getting so old. I&#39;ve seen people on both sides of this continually complain about shills from the other side. That word is so fuckin corny to me at this point and I&#39;ve been called one a thousand times. If you want a safe space where everyone agrees with you, head back over to the_donald. Plenty of people to circle jerk with about Seth Rich.</p>

<p>Truth is the guy who broke this new story about him is a fox news contributer who later went on Hannity and said he didn&#39;t have proof. Then the source he named came out and said they didn&#39;t have the computer anyway. The family came out and said this guy was full of shit.</p>

<p>But you don&#39;t care about any of that because you want to keep believing in this Seth Rich conspiracy. </p>

<p>Partially because you probably hate the DNC and I&#39;m guessing you support Trump and hope one day you can prove that Seth was a whistlblower and the Russians had nothing to do with the hacks. That&#39;s the reason you believe what you believe. Some of us don&#39;t buy that shit. Part of growing up is realizing that people can disagree with you without being paid to do so. </p>

<p>Rule 10:
Posts that attack this sub, users or mods thereof, will be removed. Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, depending on context. First violations will usually result in a warning but bans are at the mods&#39; discretion.</p>

<p>They definitely broke this rule, but they tried to make it look like they weren&#39;t. There are more than a few posts in their history doing this as well, so it wasn&#39;t their first offence. I can completely understand if you think the rule is wrong and should be changed, but from what I can see the rules were enforced as stated. Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Rule 10:
Posts that attack this sub, users or mods thereof, will be removed. Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, depending on context. First violations will usually result in a warning but bans are at the mods&#39; discretion.</p>

<p>They definitely broke this rule, but they tried to make it look like they weren&#39;t. There are more than a few posts in their history doing this as well, so it wasn&#39;t their first offence. I can completely understand if you think the rule is wrong and should be changed, but from what I can see the rules were enforced as stated. Am I missing something?</p>
