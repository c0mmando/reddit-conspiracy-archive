       Today, the FCC voted to move forward with their plan to slash net neutrality regulations, despite and
       <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15626278/net-neutrality-spam-bot-fcc-leak-data">
        growing evidence

        questions
       </a>
       about whether this activity is being funded by companies like Comcast and Verizon.) Since comments opened at the FCC

        someone
       </a>
       has submitted over 450,000 anti-net neutrality comments using real names and addresses without people's permission.
      </p>

       To counter this, we are launching
       <a href="https://www.comcastroturf.com/">
        Operation Comcastroturf
       </a>
       , a tool you can use to find out whether a fake comment against net neutrality has been submitted using your name and address without your permission. We've already received hundreds of emails people reporting that someone has posted comment against net neutrality in their name. We need to get redditors, journalists, the FCC, and state attorneys generals to look into this ASAP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s the link to check if your name and address were used:

        search directly
       </a>
       in the FCC’s database if you prefer.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you discover that your name AND address (or a previous address associated with you) have been used fraudulently, please emails us at

          reported
         </a>
         that more than 450,000 suspicious comments -- all containing the same misleading rhetoric, many submitted in alphabetical order and in perfect formatting, opposing net neutrality protections -- have been submitted into the FCC’s docket. It seems extremely likely that a significant portion of these comments are completely fake, and were submitted using real people’s names and addresses without their permission.

         that a significant portion of the suspicious anti-net neutrality comments use names and addresses found in breached databases including River City Media and Modern Business Solutions.

         Fight for the Future directly interviewed more than a dozen people and confirmed that they had not filed the comments in question, nor had they signed any petitions that could conceivably have used that comment text. Our campaigner knocked on doors in her zipcode in Tampa, FL and spoke in person to several people whose information had been used to file a comment without their permission. We interviewed these people thoroughly and ensured that they understood the issue well enough that they could not have filed a comment and forgotten about it.

         </a>
         to show evidence for its claim that a DDoS attack took down their site during the exact same time that large numbers of pro net neutrality comments would have been flowing in from John Oliver’s segment on Last Week Tonight. Security experts and even a former senior FCC staffer

          have disputed

         Fortune

          has reported
         </a>

          widely reported

         that a group allied with the cable &amp; telecom lobby,
         <a href="https://www.americancommitment.org/">
          American Commitment
         </a>
         , rented space on several email lists oriented towards older conservative voters and sent misleading emails soliciting comments to the FCC opposing net neutrality rules.
         <strong>
          Given the large number of comments they collected (~1 million) the cost of the list rentals would have been extremely high.
         </strong>

       <li>
        <p>
         It was also
         <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/net-neutrality-email-american-commitment-116553">
          reported in Politico
         </a>
         in 2014 that the American Commitment letter was submitted to members of Congress using suspicious, out-of-district addresses,

          including from constituents who didn’t recall sending such a message

         The text of the misleading anti-net neutrality comment has
         <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-bot-is-flooding-the-fccs-website-with-fake-anti-net-neutrality-comments/">
          been tied to
         </a>
         the relatively unknown group Center for Individual Freedom. The group claims that they have been collecting signatures through an online web form, but that form does not appear on their website or social media.
         <strong>
          It would be extremely unusual, if not impossible, for a letter that is not visible on the web or social media to attract even tens of thousands of signers, much less hundreds of thousands.
         </strong>
         The only way to accomplish that would be to spend potentially tens of millions of dollars on list rentals and advertising.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       We’re encouraging journalists, the FCC, Redditors, and state AGs to investigate this situation, and calling again on the FCC so disclose any info they have on the alleged DDOS attack and the person or organization behind these likely fraudulent comments. We are also calling on Journalists to reach out to ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T to ask if they are funding this activity, or funding any groups that could be engaged in this activity.

       I appreciate you doing this.  While my name wasn't used (I only get my own result), I searched a few common names and it's pretty amazing how many were submitted with the exact same comment.  It makes me feel like the time I spent writing my own was a waste, since it gets lost in all this BS.
