<p>Onto the topic: After a conversation with co-workers, (anti-Trumpers) it was clear they thought Trump should be impeached for his ties to Russia and that he should be investigated. What wasn&#39;t clear, to any of them, is EXACTLY what he had ties to and WHY he was being investigated. I feel like this is the sentiment of most of the &#39;liberals&#39; I encounter.</p>

<p>So, lets hear it. This should be fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth is...no one truly knows because no one has actually presented any evidence. At this point it&#39;s just a bunch of wild speculation by everyone, including the Congress, the media, Trump supporters, and Trump detractors.</p>

<p>No one has presented evidence of guilt or innocence. It&#39;s a fucking shit show right now. To me, it feels like we&#39;re all being trolled. Instead of telling us, &quot;Hey! We have a great fictional story for you to watch once a week,&quot; we&#39;re being fed a real life fictional story. Not saying that&#39;s what&#39;s happening, but that&#39;s what it feels like. The whole thing is quickly approaching the absurd and outlandish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know. It&#39;s just all so fucking crazy at this point that I feel I have no other choice but to make fun of it all.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like sensory overload. Nothing makes sense. Everything is confusing. It feels like we&#39;re just being presented with one outlandish thing after another to drive us all insane. If someone wanted to destroy humanity, this is how they would do it. Chaos from all angles. Again, not saying it&#39;s intentional, but that&#39;s what&#39;s happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, like Alex Jones (half-truths with a crazy character) says, it&#39;s in information war, and the battle is for the mind of the people.</p>

<p>We are currently in a stealth world war 3, Deep State (Cabal) vs the good guys. From my POV, we&#39;re on the right path, and everything&#39;s under control. Either Trump stays and we keep on that track, alternatively, he gets impeached for some bullshit reason and we get a military coup.</p>

<p>The Cabal is not winning this one</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well one thing is for sure, as I see it. No matter what happens, this doesn&#39;t end well for the country.</p>

<p>Either he stays in office, and the media/congressional assault continues on to who knows what. These people clearly do not want this man leading the country. Whether their current suspicions are accurate or not, and even if they are proven wrong, they will stop at nothing to remove him.</p>

<p>Or - He&#39;s removed from office, and even if impeachment is justified, there are a lot of people in this country that will go to war over that.</p>

<p>Either way, the outcome is not good in my opinion. That&#39;s why I think we all, Trump supporters or not, as Americans need to calm our tits and reground ourselves a bit. Buying into the chaos is just making shit worse.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no PROOF OF INNOCENCE. Wtf? You can&#39;t prove a negative. That&#39;s why we abide by the principle of &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot;. The burden of proof is on the NWO, not Trump. If they had ANYTHING, it would be out by now. Still nothing.</p>

<p>All I see so far is a bunch of chickens running around the yard screaming RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA</p>

<p>...Like its the 50s all over again and anyone who has anything other than hostile contact with Russia must be a communist.</p>

<p>So really, to second the question...WHAT is the exact crime? Because &quot;Ties&quot; and &quot;Communications&quot; are not a crime by default. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you mean Donald Trump <em>specifically</em>.. the answer is: nothing. There is not one single thing Trump has done to even give the impression that he&#39;s a Russian plant. Not a damn thing. </p>

<p>His cabinet however has some &quot;inappropriate&quot; ties to Russia, if you want to call them inappropriate. But to do that, you&#39;d have to base your claims on the fact that Russia is for some reason our mortal enemy. Why? Why is Russia our enemy all of a sudden? Russia has been one of the only other countries fighting &quot;the war on terror&quot; and since that&#39;s supposedly been our goal since 2001, I&#39;ve never been able to wrap my head around why they&#39;re an enemy all of a sudden.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not all of a sudden. There is no war on terror. Russia is against Zionism. The U.S. is all about that Zionism. We cheer it on and pop champagne over it even though most people don&#39;t even know what the fuck it is. Russia is the new enemy because Russia doesn&#39;t put up with Zionist bullshit and they&#39;re aware of what Israel is doing. So the media, owned by israeli&#39;s, is forcing you to believe that Russia is our enemy because they&#39;re a threat to the status quo. Which is where Donald Trump comes in. </p>

<p>No one knows what the fuck he&#39;s doing. Is he working with Russia to bring down Zionism? Looks like it sometimes. Other times he&#39;s the greatest friend to Israel. The goal is to give you so much information, so much of it conflicting- that you never truly know what is real or what is fake. Our ability to distinguish between the two is gone. We don&#39;t know anymore. Keep your enemies and your friends guessing and you can get away with literally anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpInvestigation/">This is a good place to start reading if you are interested</a></p>

<p>An example:</p>

<p>Trump and his staff have repeatedly claimed they have zero ties to Russia and that they didn&#39;t communicate with them.</p>

<p>Except, that Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn secretly met with Sergey Kislyak (top Russian spy) at Trump tower in December.</p>

<p>Jared Kushner also secretly met with the CEO of Vnesheconombank (Russian bank tied to Putin) 12 times, and failed to disclose that or any of his meetings with Russian officials on his security clearance form.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-vnesheconombank-trump-toronto-hotel-2017-5">That Russian bank that Kushner met with, also financed Trump&#39;s Toronto hotel.</a></p>

<p>These are just examples, and I can provide more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Subsequently, demonstrations by pro-Russian groups in the Donbass area of Ukraine escalated into an armed conflict between the Ukrainian government and the Russia-backed separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk People&#39;s Republics. In August, Russian military vehicles crossed the border in several locations of Donetsk Oblast.[26][63][64][65][66] The incursion by the Russian military was seen as responsible for the defeat of Ukrainian forces in early September.[67][68]</p>

<p>In November 2014, the Ukrainian military reported intensive movement of troops and equipment from Russia into the separatist controlled parts of eastern Ukraine.[69] The Associated Press reported 80 unmarked military vehicles on the move in rebel-controlled areas.[70] An OSCE Special Monitoring Mission observed convoys of heavy weapons and tanks in DPR-controlled territory without insignia.[71] OSCE monitors further stated they observed vehicles transporting ammunition and soldiers&#39; dead bodies crossing the Russian-Ukrainian border under the guise of humanitarian aid convoys.[72] As of early August 2015, OSCE observed over 21 such vehicles marked with the Russian military code for soldiers killed in action.[73] According to The Moscow Times, Russia has tried to intimidate and silence human rights workers discussing Russian soldiers&#39; deaths in the conflict.[74] OSCE repeatedly reported that its observers were denied access to the areas controlled by &quot;combined Russian-separatist forces&quot;.[75]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody wants to impeach Trump because he has ties to Russia. The FBI is investigating into if his campaign colluded with them before the election. Flynn lied to the vice president about the content of his conversation with the Russians and sanctions. So he gets fired. The FBI was investigating Flynn before he was brought into the white house. Trump knew that and still brought him in. Next thing we know, Trump brings in Comey and asks him for his loyalty. Comey didn&#39;t play along. According to this memo, Trump asked Comey to back off Flynn. Trump hasn&#39;t denied the contents of this memo. He hasn&#39;t said shit. And usually he&#39;s all over twitter denying this stuff by now. So next thing we know, Trump fires Comey and admits to Lester Holt that he didn&#39;t like this whole Russia investigation. </p>

<p>If Trump was trying to obstruct justice by pressuring Comey, then firing him, then threatening on twitter, then that is an impeachable offense. We will find out more soon when Comey testifies. </p>

<p>Honestly I don&#39;t get why you guys march around all day everyday screaming that all this is fake. If Trump and his campaign are innocent, all of you have nothing to worry about. So of you&#39;re so confident, just wait till the investigation is over and we&#39;ll see what comes out. But the fact that there are several threads on here every single day accusing the media of making all this up tells me that you guys are nervous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve been paying attention at all, the investigation is into whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Did Russia offer them these hacks to help in win so he could get in the white house and remove the sanctions on Russia and help them out in any other way. That&#39;s what they are investigating. I&#39;m sure you can easily Google &quot;Trump Russia investigation&quot; and you could easily find out what this is all about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What specific sanctions. The ones placed 2 months after the election? We had sanctions on them starting in 2015 but they got much tighter in January after the election. </p>

<p>The reason we don&#39;t take it serious is because of how much the media shoves it down our throats and tells us we need to believe it. It&#39;s a distraction. </p>

<p>Can you imagine if Trump received the debate questions beforehand from Fox news? Or cheated in the primaries to become the nominee?  We have flat out proof that one candidate cheated. Yet they don&#39;t care. (They wouldn&#39;t care even if she won)</p>

<p>Most people do care about the Russia stuff. I don&#39;t because it makes no difference. Wikileaks already has proven that our government can fake where any cyber attack comes from. HRC literally said let&#39;s talk about Trump and Russia in her emails like a year and a half ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fine if you don&#39;t care. But a lot of people do care. Wikileaks works for Russia. The only reason they are currently relevant is because Russia gave them all these hacks. Check their twitter feed. The entire thing is posts attacking democrats, attacking the FBI, attacking Podesta, and spreading Seth Rich conspiracies. You know what&#39;s missing? Anything bad about Trump or Russia. Russia censors it&#39;s news and murders journalists. You&#39;d think assange would care about that if he was such a warrior of the truth. </p>

<p>The DNC favored hillary, yeah that wasn&#39;t cool. But it really doesn&#39;t matter at this point does it? that shit is over now. Hillary wanted to hit Trump on Russia because it was a political tactic. Trump attacked her on her deleted emails. I&#39;m not running around saying that the Hillary drama was all made up just because Trump used it as an attack. </p>

<p>To be honest, a great deal of the Trump-Russia smoke was generated by Trump himself with his persistent blanket statements of &quot;no deals with Russia, no connections to Russia!&quot; Which continuously get proved false. He has refused to be transparent with this shit from day one, which means, to me, he&#39;s hiding something, maybe something not even Russian-related in the end. </p>

<p>The Russian government is the only reason Assad is still in power which you probably feel is somehow a bad thing. We paid billions to terrorists to illegally overthrow a government..all because Israel and Saudi Arabia wanted us to.</p>

<p>Russia kept a government in power and didn&#39;t allow it to become Libya or Iraq.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I accidently found this comment from you thanks to the reddit android glitch(I added it at the end.) That is a good answer as to why I&#39;m not worried. </p>

<p>But also, Russia didn&#39;t hack our voting booths and..can you honestly say Putin influenced your vote? Because he didn&#39;t influence mine and I haven&#39;t found anyone who will say Russia actually made them change their vote. You know barely anyone actually reads wikileaks right? Go to the mall and 9 out 10 have no idea what a podesta email is.</p>

<p>I think some Trump people may have talked to people in the Russian government but I don&#39;t think it is is 1/100th of the big deal the MSM wants you to believe. HRC had emails with Saudi Arabia and was taking caimpaign money from them...would the media have went crazy if she had won? No but you could paint the EXACT same scenario with any politician you wanted.</p>

<p>In an absolute worst case scenario (I&#39;m not saying this happened.) the Russians got a hold of Podesta emails and told Trump they will release them if he helps them out with sanctions? To me that is nothing. Our CIA does black ops like that all the time. I guess I don&#39;t care because I feel our government would deserve it and I&#39;m glad that it shows they aren&#39;t invincible. But still we have seen zero evidence of this and I think it is all a psy-op just like you said:</p>

<p>&quot;See, I still think Trump is part of the cabal and that all this political firestorm all a psy-op. People are starting to trust the FBI, for example, because they&#39;re after trump. It&#39;s all a show. Meanwhile, Trump and his cronies are filling their pockets.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people may not know &quot;podesta&quot; but people know the Clinton emails. The smear campaign against Hillary (which was mostly justified) was a targeted attack. The fact that nothing was released against the Republicans or Trump signals to me that someone was trying to get him into office. It&#39;s fairly obvious that Trump and his folks have economic ties to Russia, especially the oil industry. </p>

<p>I agree that it&#39;s nice to see the US put in its place, but it&#39;s still bad for us the citizens. The Russian goal, it seems to me, is to cause massive political division in the US. So either we have a president who is either incompetent or a Russian puppet, or half the country rallies against Trump and the government. Either way the Russians win. While a Russian victory is a victory against neoliberals (which is a good thing) it&#39;s a victory for neoconservatives, which is just as bad as a neoliberal victory. The only people getting fucked by this is us, not the deep state or the elites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I accidently found this comment from you thanks to the reddit android glitch(I added it at the end.) That is a good answer as to why I&#39;m not worried. </p>

<p>But also, Russia didn&#39;t hack our voting booths and..can you honestly say Putin influenced your vote? Because he didn&#39;t influence mine and I haven&#39;t found anyone who will say Russia actually made them change their vote. You know barely anyone actually reads wikileaks right? Go to the mall and 9 out 10 have no idea what a podesta email is.</p>

<p>I think some Trump people may have talked to people in the Russian government but I don&#39;t think it is is 1/100th of the big deal the MSM wants you to believe. HRC had emails with Saudi Arabia and was taking caimpaign money from them...would the media have went crazy if she had won? No but you could paint the EXACT same scenario with any politician you wanted.</p>

<p>In an absolute worst case scenario (I&#39;m not saying this happened.) the Russians got a hold of Podesta emails and told Trump they will release them if he helps them out with sanctions? To me that is nothing. Our CIA does black ops like that all the time. I guess I don&#39;t care because I feel our government would deserve it and I&#39;m glad that it shows they aren&#39;t invincible. But still we have seen zero evidence of this and I think it is all a psy-op just like you said:</p>

<p>&quot;See, I still think Trump is part of the cabal and that all this political firestorm all a psy-op. People are starting to trust the FBI, for example, because they&#39;re after trump. It&#39;s all a show. Meanwhile, Trump and his cronies are filling their pockets.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of this being basic anti-Russia rhetoric is interesting to me. I try to imagine the perspective of Putin&#39;s regime and their IC-- we can pretty much do whatever we want as far as the cyberwar stuff and propaganda, just like the CIA does, but with us the minute we get called out, we can return to the McCarthyism/Red Scare rhetoric and make the Americans look foolish and fight amongst each other. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a weird deal overall. This board specifically is (rightfully) obsessed with CIA world fuckery, but hardly ever mentions the KGB legacy of Putin&#39;s regime (Putin was the actual FSB director for fuck&#39;s sake), never talks about the &quot;Gerasimov Doctrine,&quot; refuses to even consider that Assange may be a GRU operative at this point, is very closed minded on the whole. Not to mention the literal Russian spy rings busted in the US within the last decade, for some reason these are all ghost topics, and if you bring them up at all you get, predictably, MUHHH RUSSIA!!</p>

<p>From my perspective</p>

<ul>
<li>Russians are awesome</li>
<li>Putin&#39;s regime is fucked up</li>
<li>Russia&#39;s IC is fucked up (like ours)</li>
<li>Even if collusion didn&#39;t happen, their intel operations could have attempted to manufacture the appearance of it happening (funnel dark laundered money into campaigns, Manafort, Page, perhaps wholesale disseminating the dossier themselves, getting a dopey guy like Flynn into deliberate trouble. This would fit with the whole &quot;play all sides&quot; mantra Putin allegedly follows. </li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s alot of angles to this thing. Obviously it would be great to have better relations between Americans and Russians, but the deep states of both countries are always at odds over something, and both at fault, but neither will ever admit it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your perspectives, and I say shame on users who dismiss any threads regarding the wrong doings by the Russians, or any other country for that matter. </p>

<p>I just think they (Putin/Russia) are an easy target to be a scapegoat or patsy for sensitive subjects (DNC rigging the primary, incriminating email leaks, ect...). </p>

<p>If you have a general public who is ready to jump on them because they are &#39;commie pigs&#39; it makes it very easy to slide something like the Seth Rich murder past us by screaming RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. The US is definitely an easy target for Russian media as well, which while they&#39;re right on from time to time, it&#39;s the omniscient &quot;it&#39;s always them&quot; kind of shit that gets tiring and is hard to believe. </p>

<p>Every country has their big bad boogeyman, total constant war and whatnot. It makes identifying actual shittiness next to impossible, the cry wolf syndrome is very potent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d suggest watching &#39;Get Me Roger Stone&#39; on Netflix. Just the first 20 minutes, where they describe how Roger Stone and his old law firm <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black,_Manafort,_Stone_and_Kelly">Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly</a> used to operate. They were the ultimate dirty political operators, would plant false stories in the media to smear the opponents of whoever they used to work for, and invented the PAC to funnel dark money to their candidate. Then, after their candidate was president, they would make tens of millions of dollars lobbying the president they just got elected into helping the most unsavory groups on the planet - central american and African warlords/dictators. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say this is along the lines of this. Nothing illegal, so DJT will <em>not</em> be impeached; but still very shady.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seth Rich produced emails and was killed for it. Wikileaks confirms source, then Wikileaks guy who received emails is killed. Then MSM blames it all on Trump to cover for Hillary because Trump is eventually going to go after her and others (Drain the Swamp). In the background the guy they say was the handler for emails (Flynn - former top intelligence official) is being accused of running point, but reality of the matter is he has dirt on Hillary&#39;s involvement in Arab Spring and giving asylum to a know terrorist, heroin kingpin and launderer Gülen - who now lives in Pennsylvania and who also gave money to Clinton&#39;s Foundation and most likely election campaigns. They&#39;re basically trying to cover all this up. Problem is all Gülen investigation files from the past were moved to counterintelligence at the FBI which can&#39;t be used in court to convict him. They were at other departments and under investigation for money laundering, trafficking and terrorism run overseas right here in the good ol USA. There&#39;s also a CIA handler involved but I forget his name, lol. That&#39;s the back story that&#39;s not in the news. They investigated Flynn early on and Trumps campaign knew this when they brought him in. He&#39;s a direct threat to Obama and Clintons wrong doing hence the whitewashing. It&#39;s going to get interesting I&#39;ll tell ya that. I doubt any of the spy stuff comes out though, but who knows. I guess the biggest issue of it all is most of this stuff is proven fact, but is being pushed by MSM as conspiracy theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t do anything wrong, our mainstream media has been pushing  anti-Russian propaganda way before Trump was even elected. I think Trump&#39;s lack of involvement in Syria is pissing off the deep state (aka the Zionist). They are still waiting for Assad to get toppled so that they can occupy the region and break up the country by redrawing borders. Logically it is in our best interest to stay out of the Middle East and remain cordial with Russia. Time and history has proven that Israel&#39;s interest comes first. </p>

<p>Here is a very brief timeline of events: </p>

<p>In 2008, the U.S. pulled its troops out of Iraq. They made sure to leave behind CIA-military trained Al-Qaeda terrorists so that the new Iraqi government could not flourish. These empowered scumbags were terrorizing civilians and raping Iraqi orphans. They also had occupied Iraqi territory where the oil rigs are located. </p>

<p>Fast forward to 2011, the alleged &quot;Arab spring&quot; protests began and caused civil unrest in Syria. The primary opposition group at the time, the Free Syrian Army initiated the civil war. There is a lot of debate on whether or not this opposition group was legit to begin with. It didn&#39;t take long before the terrorists from Al-Qaeda factions in Iraq came through and infiltrated the FSA. </p>

<p>In 2013, they managed to frame Assad with the Ghouta chemical attack. The mainstream media stepped up its Anti-Assad propaganda. Turkey had began allowing foreign invaders into Syria to occupy land and wage war to create the so-called Islamic state. Israel was providing medical assistance to these terrorist. This is when Iran and south Lebanon got involved in helping the Syrian Arab Army fight off these terrorist. A couple years later, Russia also got involved which has made it extremely difficult to get rid of Assad. </p>
