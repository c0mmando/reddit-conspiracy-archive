Control over people, governments, territory etc I know this already. What I don&#39;t understand is that they are trying to establish a new world order that has all these advancements in technology and a future of new information and so on. My point being, by hiding all of these hidden technologies and advancements from the general public they are not only holding us back, they are holding themselves back. If they just came out and told the world what kind of underground technologies are being made we could progress as a species so much faster. Its frustrating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars also floods his movies with Masonic symbology. Yoda is the name of a Masonic teacher. The Djed-eye (Jedi) comes from the ancient Egyptian. The idea of Jedi Knights and a round table comes from the Knights Templar. Skywalker is the name of the 13th Tzolkien in the Mayan calendar, the symbol of which looks just like the top of Luke’s flight helmet. Anakin comes from Anakim or the Sons of Anak in the Bible and Darth Vader no doubt comes from the “Da’ath” black sephiroth of the Jewish Kabbalah. These occult interpretations of Hollywood movies and TV programs are well understood by initiates, but purposely meant to bewilder the public. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djed">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djed</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory. They are charging something or someone (an entity?) You know of the law of attraction? Like energy attracts like energy good or bad, now hold that thought. Every show, movie, form of media etc whatever it is on a day to say basis we see or don&#39;t see (subconsciously) their occult symbolism. A great example is the show gravity falls, targeted at kids. They are blatantly open about occult symbols and Illuminati or the invisible hand whatever you wanna call it. Point being, through all of these subliminal messages and subconscious interactions our energy is going to something sinister whether we know it or not. The energy we manifest through our subconscious seeing those symbols gives energy to whatever they are trying to manifest into this reality. I believe they are using our energy without us knowing to charge something </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what I&#39;m looking for. I know why they don&#39;t share with us. Control and power and knowledge blah blah blah yeah I get it. I want to know why they are holding themselves back so much. If they want a nwo and have a means of getting there, why are they wasting all of this time setting us back and themselves back? What they are doing now isn&#39;t very beneficial. They are getting money and holding private meetings and experiments, but what good is any of that If you&#39;re not going to do anything with it? Why is humanity as such a stand still.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, 10-11 month old aluminium foil hatter here.</p>

<p>Alot of this might ring familiar already and it might end up being all over the place.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve gathered thus far, there seems there is a force of nature from which mankind has an inherent ability to tap into and can harvest from. The commoner could assume more control if we knew. I think there&#39;s a possibility by now there are kinetic/vibrational/other energies which, when used correctly could even cure cancer if we wanted it, or if we were &#39;evolved&#39; enough.</p>

<p>It seems to be an inherent ability which we may have possessed but have lost after being conditioned through organized religion, and other methods. Yet they&#39;ve been peddling all these other methods that offer partial solutions, and generate alot of revenue through (patents and monopolization, etc.)
It&#39;s not that every single one in certain communities, that be scientific or health, are involved, but some unwillingly cater to them due to said system we&#39;ve been living under for so long. </p>

<p>It seems maybe sometime within the age of ancient civilizations, rulers were well aware of this and the tradition carries on til this day, in regards to power and religious doctrines maybe, not so much of what we see today in technology, I can&#39;t say.</p>

<p>Anyway, one would think we&#39;re more materialistically based nowadays.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that their interests lie as much in the advancement of  mankind, as advancement in (and it&#39;s partly spiritual) in mankind to make us is more accommodating to their rules and beliefs, so they try to have us go down the same road and adopt this &#39;mystery religion&#39;, thus making us accept their reign.</p>

<p>If they keep hidden technology it benefits them because as long as they get to exploit it exclusively, chances are they remain in power.</p>

<p>A recurring theme is this fascination with a &#39;New Age&#39;, &#39;next tier civilization&#39;. I see it more or less as a seductive way of swaying people into a world where they retain nobility, under the false pretense that we&#39;re all going to be &#39;gods&#39;, while the commoner will have minimal sway, other than being workers because man is apparently so &#39;inherently evil&#39; and incompetent that they&#39;ve decided that it&#39;s best they rule us. Maybe they&#39;re setting way for a global worship of these deities which is mentioned ostensibly throughout history.</p>

<p>Muh 2 cents.</p>
