        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">0</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/paulie_purr.html">paulie_purr</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have no full-proof confidence of this claim, merely wanted to relay my personal connection to some rumor confirmation (I&#39;m not trying to LARP or spread disinfo, though clearly that&#39;s something a LARPer would say. I laugh as I type this, and feel squirmish and ridiculous, but wanted to relay the claim anyway). So full disclaimer: take this as you will.</p>

<p>My buddy I grew up with in the Bay Area has been couching around Europe with friends he made through the social media art scene, recently returned to the US and called me last night, more than a little drunk. He&#39;s a serial barfly prone to emotional outbursts and frightening uncomfortable-truth rants (still love him though)...I want to highlight that he can be a mess, but has never been a liar. Certainly he has no incentive to lie to me. He&#39;s the most prominent Sanders supporter in my life, extremely critical of the Clintons and somewhat defensive of Trump on the whole (doesn&#39;t rant about LITERALLY HITLER/NOT MY PRESIDENT, knows the media plays Trump up into being a hysterical monster, distorting facts left and right). </p>

<p>Nonetheless, when the state of things came up during our call, things got interesting. He spent five plus years living in DC with his mom who worked in biotech before moving back to the Bay for health reasons, during which he made a few Republican friends who work on Capital Hill and often gossip about shit going down behind the scenes of the news and politicking (while at the bars). </p>

<p>My buddy claims his friends (I&#39;m assumming two people) are confirming the Louise Mensch/Claude Taylor-authored rumors of Trump, Pence, Ryan all being implicated in something big and bad that will drop soon, and that GOP leadership is actively planning next moves for the fallout and succession shakeup (probably falling to Orin Hatch). He repeated the &quot;bigger than Watergate&quot; claim as being their words, not his. My buddy didn&#39;t really give much detail  beyond the basic nature of a major shakeup being taken not only seriously by these Hill-based Republican friends of his, but being taken as fact, resulting in political salvaging mechanisms already falling into place. Could be Russia-related (laundered money finding it&#39;s way into their campaigns?) or not...my buddy&#39;s been big on the idea that something fiscal and Russian mob-related is behind all the Trump suspicions, not that the dossier is true or that Trump really is a traitor. </p>

<p>Of course, persistent anti-Trump Hill-connected Republicans would be the type to confirm extant rumors of Trump being dirty and going down, but Pence and Ryan are GOP establishment mainstays, not sure why they&#39;d be included. Take all claims therein with massive grains of salt. I would like to confirm that my buddy is real, our conversation was real, and I fully believe him when he says he has Hill Republican bar friends from his years in DC (he&#39;s probably the world&#39;s most affable guy). Now, as far as their claims...results TBA. Could be more bullshit, could be real gossip and legitimate fear from the capitol.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a scenario that could play out regardless of whether or not Trump and co knew of it&#39;s existence or actively colluded...Russian intelligence maybe using their resources and shell-company capabilities to get dirty, traceable money into their campaigns, essentially planting evidence that would inevitably come back to bite them and sabotage things. This would fit snuggly with the &quot;playing all sides&quot;/subvert US democracy ideas...they expose the DNC and do what they can to get their favored candidate elected, while also internally fucking over the Trump camp and the high-level GOP establishment that has ridden Trump to power. It&#39;s pretty ingenious, clearly something the CIA would try and pull off, and I wouldn&#39;t put it beyond their competitors. I remember Ryan utilizing hacked/leaked Dem official emails at some point during his campaign, Trump obviously did it often, Pence is central to the Flynn/Kislyak sanction discussion fiasco. Crazy shit overall. We&#39;ll see how it shakes out.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mensch scooped the FISA warrant story from October, Taylor was recently spot on with predicting the Flynn-related FARA deal and present grand juries before the stories broke on MSM (and right before the Comey firing). Most of what they claim could easily be unconfirmed over-reach (I&#39;m looking at you Mensch, who sees Russian spies in the shadows 24-7).

    <div class="md"><p>Evidence obtained from a court-approved FISA warrant could certainly be used toward a sealed indictment. I don&#39;t believe she said exactly what you&#39;re saying, has spent a few days trying to clarify. Her and Taylor&#39;s &quot;report&quot; about sealed indictment doesn&#39;t mention the FISA thing at all. </p>

<p><a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/05/14/exclusive-sealed-indictment-granted-against-donald-trump/">https://patribotics.blog/2017/05/14/exclusive-sealed-indictment-granted-against-donald-trump/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Separate sources with links to the intelligence and justice communities have stated that a sealed indictment has been granted against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>While it is understood that the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution means that, until Mr. Trump is impeached, he cannot be prosecuted, sources say that the indictment is intended by the FBI and prosecutors in the Justice Department to form the basis of Mr. Trump’s impeachment. The indictment is, perhaps uniquely, not intended or expected to be used for prosecution, sources say, because of the constitutional position of the President.&quot;</p>

<p>There is no evidence that Russia hacked the DNC and it was most certainly Seth Rich that leaked to wikileaks.</p>

<p>The acting head of the FBI had his wife&#39;s Senate run paid for by Terry McAullife, long time Clinton crony.</p>

<p>Finally, here is a list of who has said there is no evidence of collusion so far:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No opinion on Clapper saying our institutions are under attack by trump and that the Russians are involved? A lot of those videos are also old and before trump fired comey.

    <div class="md"><p>Clapper lied under oath already. He is not a trustworthy guy, but is definitely no friend to Trump and part of the Obama/Clinton crew. That is why him saying he knows of no evidence of collusion is significant, and he WOULD know if it existed. He was also receiving the PDBs. But, of course Russia is conducting cyber operations against us, as we do against everyone else as well.</p>

<p>Comey needed to be fired as he has politicized and ruined the credibility of the FBI in the eyes of the public. Everyone was agreeing he needed to be removed or step down before it happened.</p>

<p>I do not think the white house lied. Everyone knew Comey&#39;s time was limited, and if you didn&#39;t you haven&#39;t been paying attention. Rosenstein DID make a recommendation, he obviously agreed with Trump. That isn&#39;t taken out of the equation just because Trump was going to fire him anyway. Pretty obvious that there were a lot of reasons for Comey&#39;s firing though. </p>

<p>Comey should not have been prolonging this Russia hysteria. They have no evidence that Trump did anything wrong, but want to find some. He is a Clinton guy from way back, however, so it is no surprise.</p>

<p>In the context to which you are referring with &quot;trump admitting that he fired him because of the Russia investigation,&quot; you are wrong again.</p>

<p>What Trump says is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But regardless of [the] recommendation, I was going to fire Comey. Knowing there was no good time to do it!</p>

<p>And in fact when I decided to just do it I said to myself, I said, “You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty clearly here he says there was no good time to fire Comey, and then explains WHY the Russia-Trump thing did not stop him. He is explaining that the Russia-Trump thing is made up, and he knows it, and this is why firing Comey now did not matter to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it pretty clear that trump said that? He says the Russia investigation was on his mind, and he also tried to manipulate listeners by referring to himself in the third person and concluding it was fake. You&#39;re taking the person that is being investigated at their word that the Russia collusion is fake? </p>

<p>Clapper said that the report he got didn&#39;t include any evidence, and since then he&#39;s changed his tune. Anyways, your original point was that Dems admitted something they never said, and that people not fully involved in the investigation claimed there never was any evidence, not that they weren&#39;t aware of any evidence. I just wanted to point out this isn&#39;t a Democrat vs Trump political smear campaign, this an FBI vs Trump ongoing investigation. Dems have little say on the matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is perfectly clear. Look at the context. He comments on the timing of the firing, then goes on to address everyone&#39;s problem with it, the timing. Trump asks himself, ya know, all of the Russia stuff is made up, so why would now be a bad time to fire him. This is his thought process. If you can&#39;t understand that I can&#39;t help you.</p>

<p>They did admit it....I gave you the links, that I know you didn&#39;t listen to. Even Maxine Waters said they have no evidence of Trump collusion and she hates him with a passion. </p>

<p>Trump himself isn&#39;t being investigated. If you notice no one has disputed that claim in his letter firing Comey. Senator Grassley even made a point to say that in their briefings he has heard nothing to contradict that statement. No one has come out to say Grassley is wrong.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done talking to you though. Total waste of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ. Waters said that all the intelligence agencies have proof that Russia hacked the DNC(they even did it again with France) she says she herself hasn&#39;t seen evidence of collusion, and it&#39;s why the investigation is important. 
The trump campaign is under investigation. Playing semantics as to whether it&#39;s trump personally or whatever isn&#39;t fooling anyone. The trump campaign is suspected of collusion and they&#39;re investigating as to whether trump was involved(rumor has it a lot of the GOP was involved). Then on top of all the distortion and fake news, you take trump at his word &quot;You know this stuff is so fake, I&#39;m just gonna fire comey because its so obviously fake. Instead of being confident of my innocence, I&#39;m just gonna lie about the reasons for the firing of the mana that is investigating.&quot; The blind naivety amongst his supporters is stunning​.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m still responding...you clearly have chosen which side you want to believe and are not following the facts.</p>

<p>The fact is no one got to analyze that DNC server except Crowdstrike, not even the government. Comey said this in one of the testimonies. No evidence has been released either. As I said before, Crowdstrike used a former analysis  of theirs to justify their DNC findings, and that analysis has been debunked.</p>

<p>You are calling things fake news and distortions but I seem to be the only person providing sources. I have used only things that have come straight from people&#39;s own words, so I don&#39;t know where the fake news is there.</p>

<p>He never lied about why he fired Comey. The guy did a shitty job, even the Democrats agreed.</p>

And I can only support the GOP&#39;s house of cards falling if they take down the other side with them — because even the most outlandish claims of the psychotic Louise Mensch types are no worse than the things we already KNOW the Obama and Hillary camps and their allies have been up to as well.
