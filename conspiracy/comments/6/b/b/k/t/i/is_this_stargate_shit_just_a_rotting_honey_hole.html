    <div class="md"><p>Goode and Wilcock are full of it. How anyone can take them seriously is beyond me.</p>

<p>Any and all UFO related phenomenon is kept under the most compartmentalized, high security you can imagine and is not allowed to see the light of day. Yet here&#39;s Corny Goone, talking about how the aliens come pick him up in his back yard for missions and how the deep state is at odds with them.</p>

<p>It reads like a 10 year old boy&#39;s imagination as he&#39;s playing in his tree fort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He seems to be acting as a popular semi-credible sounding disinfo layer to deflect people wanting to delve into more serious treatment of claims about the SSP. And you&#39;re absolutely right. They talk about it a bit in the videos in my post, but the guy who &quot;hacked&quot; NASA and discovered the off-world officer list was going to be extradited and hit with a 70-year prison sentence supposedly. That&#39;s absolute peanuts in comparison to what Goode is putting ut there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re talking about Gary McKinnon, right? Didn&#39;t Obama try again to extradite him from the UK after Bush failed to? I don&#39;t think it ever came to fruition, but the fact that the US government was openly opposed to McKinnon adds an amount of validity to his story.</p>

<p>Unless McKinnon was <em>meant</em> to &quot;stumble upon&quot; the photos he saw back then. I could easily see NASA making it easy to find the &quot;alien&quot; photos. Once you find those, you would stop looking, thinking you found the smoking gun, when in reality the real gun is still hidden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if you were tptb, isn&#39;t that exactly how you&#39;d promote this to a public that is mostly skeptical of government? Make it seem like a huge secret that needs to be hidden at all costs? Just like how the now-compromised Wikileaks is releasing all this old CIA info designed to set people up for this new narrative?  It truly seems like the beginning of the Grand Delusion. People on this sub have been prepared for this for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is telling some of the accounts that are coming negative at this conspiracy too. Like, a week ago if you asked me about stargate theory I would give you the slightly humorous one I have kicking around in the back of my head about SG-1 as a partial disclosure. This is something I put a bit of thought into, but didn&#39;t really believe it. My wife and I are huge fans of the show, so we have a bias there.</p>

<p>So, there has been some interest in the subject this weekend, and I was like that&#39;s fun, I can jam to this. But then some of the shill accounts started coming out against it. And I am like why the fuck would they do that? This would be a great diversion of energy for the sub. </p>

<p>So, I am moving this from &quot;hilariously unlikely&quot; into &quot;might actually be something here&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man I&#39;m sitting there too. Never seen the show, but hearing an anecdote about how one of the episodes is the government trying to cover it up or something is pretty fishy.</p>

<p>And if you study the ancient Sumerian texts like u/ModernDayTJ seems to have, and read the bible in the proper symbolic context, and add that to what people like you and I already know, our reality is practically manufactured and spoon fed to the masses to maintain control and inequality in the world, and the theory fitting. And a lot of things about it that seem to fit together, the blockchain and all of that wild stuff seemed to be related to this stuff at the very bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>I just wish we had more evidence to <em>prove</em> that all of this is related, but I guess we all have to rely on that weird gut feeling we have when we think about the topic. I just want the Clinton investigation trials to happen, 911 truth to come out, and we learn the truth about our ancient history, that would be fantastic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is that it never ends. The show must go on and the bible holds the keys to timing its finale. An Epilogue for a prologue. A Jewish calendar is merely piggybacking off the roman calendar since the last time we reset and cut off the bloody past horror show of a cannibal famine. The truth is that your music industry is entirely corrupt as they orchestrated the sodomy of my life and souled me out. Kobain was nothing more than a bastard puppet used as a role model for a faithless and wicked generation that has no sense of shame. The kids today don&#39;t stand a fighting chance which is why we have the pleasant dream of Heaven for the obedient son since they won&#39;t know any better as they have yet to reach levels of conceptualizing the world that calculus has afforded us. Religion cultivates the symbolism necessary to push humanity towards the highest level of math as we reach for the stars. The double edged sword of science is the power to save and kill but the musicians have become arrogant and attempted to place themselves above the higher power that math nerds chase. The musicians only did that as a reaction to the theatrical poetry left in the bible from antedilluvians where secularism dominated the world. Robots and Science afforded us the tech to heal blind people and walk on water and everything the bible tells us as miracles and power of human ingenuity. This power to save caused us to flood the earth and so the days must be cut short as we follow the all too predictable fate of a macro population curve akin to Easter Island. We have over harvested and now destroy the earth attempting to bring order out of chaos and so our collective conscious created God to set a limit on man&#39;s power over each other as we enslave the world by conquering weaker cultures. The truth is that too much truth will kill you and your ego. Masonic Vampire Rapists run the world from behind the veil of power akin to twilight. Hence the meme machine that produced &quot;Still a better love story than twilight&quot;. Its a me, the spicy meme lord because my life was souled-out to provide your pop culture. Enjoy the illuminatro this year. The Govt lies about everything. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s impossible that this could be legit aliens and that the &quot;evil mystery schools&quot; are an analogy for aliens, or maybe the rejection of those aliens.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, it&#39;s the evolution of this topic that I find very strange.</p>

<p>The topic gets posted in the middle of a Sunday night. Everybody is all hyped about it with maybe 10% of the people who say an iteration of, &quot;hm, a little weird but whatever rocks your socks I guess.&quot; Monday morning hits, and suddenly it&#39;s 80% of the commenters saying &quot;disinfo,&quot; &quot;psyop&quot; or, &quot;conspiracy nutters.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, we have posts like this one ridiculing the info further, and others who claim that because he didn&#39;t get the name of a boeing airline correct the whole thing must be garbage. </p>

<p>In addition, most of the people doing the mocking are posters I&#39;ve not witnessed to be active users. </p>

<p>My vote = this guy being the real deal. Or at the very least, he is professing what he himself believes to be the truth with no ulterior motive such as disinfo, psyop whatever. </p>

<p>He connects a lot of dots that when explained on the whole as he&#39;s done may sound bizarre... but when each piece is individually investigated it starts to make a whole lot of sense. There&#39;s a wealth of additional info to support his premises. Thus, I believe the people who reject his theory out of hand and refuse to contemplate any of it are either shills, or they are not well-informed or well-read. </p>

<p>As a learned language, English has at least as many speakers as Chinese, and is most definitely a more popular second language, by far.</p>

<p>People understand english in Spain, México, Russia, The Netherlands, UK, USA, Australia, India, Thailand, Turkey... I can go on and on.</p>

<p>Any example of a more widely understood language?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing about the use of the world &quot;universal&quot;, I&#39;m saying regular people around the world know English as the universal language.</p>

<p>Some years ago I remember hearing people at the language facility at my University saying that mandarin was going to be the next one, but I don&#39;t think they were right, I see more and more people learning English as a basic language every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know that a lot of the things they&#39;re referring to were refuted. Bill Cooper realized they were giving him fake documents, as I&#39;ve posted about before.So, they can&#39;t be talking about aliens.</p>

<p>At the same time, they&#39;re trying to take credit for the firing of Comey. Could be anything from the actual party responsible, to generally good people trying to make a name for themselves by claiming responsibility for something they didn&#39;t do, to evil people setting up a fake alien invasion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my very humble opinion but:</p>

<p>Seems like a poisoning of the well, whether that&#39;s his intention or not.  I buy a lot of what he has to say about Bushes, 9/11, Zionists, Wahhabis and such, but I don&#39;t buy anything he&#39;s pushing about aliens and stargates.  It will be easy for normies and the shills who herd them to point at all that shit wrapped up together there and say &quot;oh you think the government is lying about 9/11, you must believe in all of this other nonsense too, ya crazy!&quot;</p>

<p>I suggest reading up on your 4chan High Level Insider AMAs - I suggest that the regimental status-quo is being challenged by a group that has a more positive outlook and plan for humanity - the current regime will paint them as the ones trying to bring about &quot;The New World Order&quot;, as we know it if you search for NWO on youtube - but in reality, the NWO is an age of growth and enlightenment, as opposed to the Old World Order, which is a model for oppression, and slave vs ruler, which is how we have lived for thousands of years.</p>

<p>This is the best that they can think of to try to resist them lol &quot;ALIENS TRYING TO CREATE THE NWO!!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re talking about Gary McKinnon, right? Didn&#39;t Obama try again to extradite him from the UK after Bush failed to? I don&#39;t think it ever came to fruition, but the fact that the US government was openly opposed to McKinnon adds an amount of validity to his story.</p>

<p>Unless McKinnon was <em>meant</em> to &quot;stumble upon&quot; the photos he saw back then. I could easily see NASA making it easy to find the &quot;alien&quot; photos. Once you find those, you would stop looking, thinking you found the smoking gun, when in reality the real gun is still hidden.</p>
