       To "victoryofthelight" LARP guy -- because I know you're reading this: If you want to pretend to drop deep, deep knowledge, you're going to have to get your basic details about 9/11 correct, even if that requires revealing evidence of the crime. A lot of us know what happened that day. We are your target audience. You can't just bullshit your way through this and expect us to lap it up. You gotta come clean,
       <strong>
        win our trust
       </strong>
       ...
       <em>
        THEN
       </em>
       re-direct us into stargates or whatever-the-fuck you have planned. (You may respond here or on twitter or via inter-dimensional portal -- by which I mean my butthole.)
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW, this appears to be a reasonably large PsyOp. I kind of want to see where it goes, but... yeah.

       As I pointed out in a related thread:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some of what he says is accurate. A good portion of it, on the other hand, is obvious bullshit. For example, the York Rite does not have 32 degrees. That would be the Scottish Rite, as well as the lesser known Egyptian Rite. He also mentions "Reptilians" which is blatant disinfo and nonsense. Speaking of disinfo and nonsense, the "Stargate" concept is literally from a movie and television series. There is no credible evidence, or alleged witnesses or whistleblowers to confirm one actually exists outside the realm of science fiction. The only real "Stargate" program was an experiment carried out by the CIA to test the accuracy of remove viewing to gather intelligence. It's hard to tell if that person actually believes their own rantings, or if they're just fucking with people. As far as Obama following him on twitter, that isn't necessarily significant, let alone proof of anything, as his account automatically follows back a good potion of his followers by default.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is classic disinformation, to speak the truth one minute then taint that information with half-truths and lies, and fringe theories that have no proof or evidence (even circumstantial) to support their validity or plausibility, thus making the truth regarding the other theories appear equally as fringe or nonsensical by association.

       There are a few small errors but the vast majority of what he commented on is in fact true and easy to verify.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stargates are real. It's easy to think it's fake but because of the way reality is structured through quantum mechanics it is in fact possible and the ancient builder races are rumored to have built a few.

       Corey Goode speaks of the secret space program and these star gates. He is the most reliable whistleblower we have right now in regards to the secret space program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skimming this thread and it's comments it's abundantly clear many people here are not familiar with these concepts and are quick to shoot down such information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I implore you guys to keep an open mind. Also Gaia streaming which has David Wilcock's show wisdom teachings and Corey Goode on Cosmic Disclosure is only charging 99 cents for a month of streaming. It's a metaphysics Netflix and goes into quantum theories and red shift and other cosmic phenomenon that have been going on like planet changes and other interesting information. I suggest you guys check it out it's highly informative and will blow your mind.

       You're hardly completing things, a technical specification that was wrongly said is not a basis for debunking anything comma especially when we're talking about 747 vs 757 vs 767. I have listened to experts in their field get a detail like that wrong before and they don't even believe they said it wrong. When you are presenting information, it can be hard to be perfect. I don't know why you are expecting anything to be perfect...

       As far as why he is hovering over the thread, I will admit I hover over threads about comic book theories that I thought up because I. Interested in what responses I get. It doesn't have to be a Psy Op. I don't really understand the push back either, none of this has been really pushed as genuine truth, it's still all very much behind the curtain at this point. This guy is saying that I'm feeling is coming, but I think all of us are sitting here very skeptical until something does happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said we, we all know that we don't get to know what is really going on at the highest levels or in the darkest corners. That is what's driving this, and the only thing we know for sure is that corruption is abound.

       It's not even so much the original mistake -- although it's a pretty big one. (747s are well-known as big boys.) It's the correction. If it's legit: Why hover a

       You're being extremely silly. Have you ever worked in a professional capacity? Experts make mistake and typos all the time, in the field of their expertise. Hanlon's Razor, look it up. Critical thinking is really important if you don't want to end up participating in a psyop yourself.

       I've never been a professional COINTEL guy, no. So perhaps this is a bit of armchair quarterbacking, but whoever commissioned this thing is gonna be pissed it got botched so badly -- especially considering all the media assets it burned. It's really beyond salvage at this point, though, again, I'd love to see how the storyline is supposed to play out. Maybe PM me?
      </p>
      <p>
       Serious question: Do they get their money back in cases like this? Or is it just a professional reputation thing?

       I'd say it's going a deal better than this thread is for you ;)

       You have no interest in serious or substantive discussion, you just want to hammer on your talking point. PMing you would be a complete waste of time, at least on a public forum there is an outside chance some other person will absorb the common sense that you are unable to.

       Yep, I think that fully qualifies as a shill accusation. You've been towing the line for some time and I've been waiting for something reportable. Thanks.

       Oh I totally think twitter Stargate boy is a shill. And if he's posting here.. well.. draw your own conclusions.

       As much as you'd like to try to imply it with ellipses, reading r/conspiracy implies nothing but an interest in conspiracies. Unless you are similarly implicated, as you're reading this very thread! how suspicious...

       You can try, but you don't get to define the target audience for his message; it'll find its way to those it's meant for. If that isn't you, that's okay. The cool part is everyone else that isn't you will be making a decision about where his message belongs in their world. He's only attached to getting his message out; whether people believe him or not isn't his concern.
