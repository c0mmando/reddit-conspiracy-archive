       Edit 2: if you think pizzagate is fake there's a 25000 reward for those who can debunk it, which has yet to be claimed.

       Upvote this to counter the shill army... seriously this is insane...

       Don't you love how the media doesn't provide proof of anything, yet "connects the dots" and is completely "circumstantial" yet they spin those things around on pizza and pedogate like nobodies business. They say, "oh look trump and russians met!" - we say "Clinton rescued a woman arrested for child trafficking" - who I might add, was told twice, not to go into haiti without permits because she would be arrested on child trafficking charges, but somehow that warning didn't sink in, twice, now she's the head of amber alerts, and her lawyer in haiti was actually wanted in 4 countries, for what? You guessed it! HUMAN TRAFFICKING! - Hmmm that could of been some seriously dumb assness along with one fucking hell of a coincidence to throw in a lottery winner as well with the amber alerts(edit: when she was returned to the states was put in the position of being in control of amber alerts - the ones that, you know, report missing children)... seems to me that pizzagate has a lot MORE evidence than the Trump-Russia Collusion. Let's see, Trumps advisors met with Russian officials and did not disclose this, even under oath, which could be a sign of collusion, or a sign of warnings from Russia about the deep state, i'm being bipartisan here. So why, must I say, was one immediately discounted as "fake news" while the other is heralded as Truth, while both seem to have ONLY circumstantial evidence behind them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Throw what you got out - I wanna hear it
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I personally see more evidence than is needed to "believe" in Pizzagate, which is but a small faccit of pedogate, which includes epstien, savile, cyril smith, frued, sir edmond heath, the detroux case of belgium, franklin cover up, and the mcmartin cover up... so... yes... this is only the small bit of the truth that is out there...

       I'm sick of hearing how Pizzagate is circumstantial when concrete info gets deleted on account of "doxxing" and "witch hunts." I've seen it happen too many times at this point.

       This is the thing that really  solidified my belief that shady shit is going on. I was watching the chans when someone realized the camera had moved and you could no longer see Comet. The next day, well what do you know, here comes Mr. Welch to save the day. Then the camera just went back to its usual spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then came all the witness statements and articles, some people said multiple shots fired, some said 1, some said none. Eventually it settled into the narrative that there was 1 shot and it happened to go through a locked door and destroy their computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we find out the shooter has an imdb page and was arrested just weeks prior to the shooting for running over a teenager, but wasn't charged. Hmmm...

       They weren't under any investigation.  Anyone could've destroyed that hard drive in any way they wanted to.  Even if the shooter was a false flag to make pizzawhatever look bad, shooting the hard drive was unnecessary and counterproductive.

       Wow Internet stranger, I never thought about it like that! I guess I should change my mind now that I've read your 1-sentence opinion presenting no evidence at all to defend your statement. I guess you were right the whole time, maybe my tinfoil was on too tight. Your strong logical ideas have made a non-believer outta me I'll tell ya that much

       I mean, the entire premise is built on a meme created by 4chan (cheese pizza = child porn). And besides the weird handkerchief email, almost every other one is purposefully taken out of context and/or completely over exaggerated.

       What did Wiener have to do with Podesta's emails?

      <p>
       He's definitely a piece of shit, but he doesn't have much to do with what sparked the original theory (from what I've seen) other than the connection with Huma. Hell, Hillary isn't even directly implicated in the scandal itself based on the emails.

       Any time I see someone say "shot up a pizza place" or "they think Hillary Clinton is raping children in the basement of a pizza place can you believe that?" or the like, I know the person has an agenda or, at best, has only done cursory perusing of MSM sources on the matter to make up their mind.

       I'm sorry, but I really don't understand where you are getting this from.  I followed the whole thing both here, on /pol/, and elsewhere over the course of weeks and months.  Nobody was asserting anything about this legendary basement in the beginning.  I really don't even understand who developed the narrative about the basement.  The only people who are obsessed with literal child rape happening right on site at comet pizza, and treating "pizzagate" like it's about THAT and just that, were people trying to dismiss the whole thing, or the poorly informed consumers of the media trying to dismiss the whole thing, people who can't or won't apply critical thinking to the evidence but are conversely idiotically credulous about anything that appears in print in a source they foolishly trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was always about more than just Comet Pizza, let alone the non-existent basement (although IIRC there is a basement in one of the adjacent properties owned by the same people and directly connected to CPP, which I hesitate to even mention because I don't personally give a hoot about the basement).  The pedogate investigations have branched out in so many different directions by now, Comet Pizza is just a FOOTNOTE to this whole debacle.

       Exactly. Mountains were moved to cover up pizzagate and control the narrative in its wake, and prevent too many people from following that rabbit hole any further.  The scope of this coverup effort was really something to watch unfold in real time, and ironically became one of the main things convincing me that there is definitely some "there" there.   I mean just look at the trying-way-too-hard language some nervous Wikipedians use to assert that pizzagate is "debunked" here:

       Yes, last fall I was following it daily. Watching articles get scrubbed and edited, people calling it out and posting archives. The absolute craziest thing was when people noticed the traffic cam outside Comet had been moved [so you could no longer see Comet], and the next day the "shooting" happened. Then the camera went back to its usual position. I'd think it was a load of shit too if I hadn't seen it all as it happened.

       Fake news term was invented to discredit pizzagate. Watching the media Panic so hard and rush to debunk is what convinced me there was something there. If it was really just a crazy story they would ignore it.

       Pizzagate is about trafficking minors and money laundering via the art market. It's much bigger than that, but I don't think PG is a setup.

       I disagree. Pizzagate is catchy and piques curiousity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed part of the push to call it "Pedogate" comes from shill accounts who want to dilute the investigation to take heat off the weak link of Alefantis, Kleinman, and the CPP crew.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I agree that the investigation has gone way beyond Comet. I mean look at the re-energized censorship push that just happened with Glacier Dental.

       They're already trying to with "Pedogate". However, I think, unfortunately, the investigations have been too tainted with hyper partisanship that I don't think it will be given as much attention as it should.

       Pizzagate was a political hit job, grasping at straws. And now the entire topic is going to suffer because of it.

       It was only left politicised because of the stupid "left" making it a political identity issue. I see no reason at all to give the immoral stupid a safe space.

       For people honestly interested in this it was never about left or right. Just about nailing the scum of the earth publicly. Who cares if they wear a red or blue batch. That's just a problem for people who don't honestly care.

       It doesn't matter if it's too left politicized, because that's the FUCKIN' TRUTH. You ever notice how people who claim righteousness and unity ate typically far more depraved than those who openly embrace it? Example, they always say Alabama has a higher penchant for searching for gay porn despite having backwards beliefs on homosexuality. I believe that same idea applies here. But god forbid, our sweet loving democratic overlords could never be sick depraved people because that would destroy my belief system! No, it must be everyone else who is wrong!

       Watergate was Watergate. Labeling something a '-gate' nowadays is almost a way to trivialize, mock, and dismiss it. (i.e. deflategate) It doesn't add to its credibility, it distracts from it and makes it seem uselessly derivative and an overreaction. You don't need some buzz worthy catchy name to bring something attention. As the saying goes "The truth is like a lion. It will defend (and propagate) itself. Actions like selling t-shirts further takes the wind right out of the sails (pun intended) and to a casual observer makes it look like a marketing scheme and based in personal agenda.

       The etymology section is really interesting, seems a Nixon surrogate at the NYT started calling everything -gate almost immediately following Watergate, seemingly as a ploy to dilute the effect of the scandal.

       I attack the whole Trump Russia thing because I think it's a fabrication based upon a relationship they had when they warned him about Clinton and deep state, i don't doubt maybe some money was involved, but that's my theory. but I mean that's really nothing in comparison to an assassination and blame an entire country for hacking to cover your ass, then exposing the entire project mockingbird Armada. I mean it's like red propoganda, hey get mad, hey get mad, and sure enough you have kids running around vandalizing shit about Trump. I mean the CIA flew in drugs through Arkansas with Clinton's brother during his reign, that's a pretty fucking crazy level of insanity right there. You have the cia run media basically trying to get you to buy it's false agenda and narrative to eradicate the sitting president whenever Clinton would of gotten away with some of the most vile shit on this planet, and no one would of batted an eye... not one... I mean the cia is a huge human trafficker
... I personally think Clinton's a Satanist too... podestas just as fucked up, abromovic etc. Making an example is what he said avour the leaker. You honestly have to ask yourself why the dark evil ones are pushing this agenda,  I don't think anything's truly going on, but why not investigate let it all under the light

       If the media is pushing it like this, it's pretty much bs in my opinion, I say we should look into it, but look who's pushing it, ask why are pushing it, what have they done in the past, are they really trustworthy, what else have they done, you really need to understand who they are, then decide for yourself. They avoid pizzagate, but this is totally real. I mean it honestly looks like a ploy, it might actually have some evidence but it's entirely bolstered.

       This is such a terrible argument. Trump-Russia collusion is being investigated by the FBI and is cited as truth every day by the msm and our politicians.

       The thing with pizza gate is that when you look into it there are too many coincidences for something fishy not to be up.
The biggest one of all is that with no prior knowledge to breitbert or his research, the same names, terms and crimes popped up again...this time through circumstantial evidence found within verified leaked emails.
But deniers will say it's another coincidence...

       Yea I mean leaking info on podesta for child sex trafficking was supposed to happen the day after he died. Then his coroner dies right after a preliminary result from arsenic, abromovics Twitter handle was 666 then it changed, I wonder why, and yea the evidence piles up but they just shout Russia and the sheep follow. Thank God though, so many people are waking up

       That's pedogate, not Trump Russia collusion, and I agree with you, it's fucked up. I think there was a reason the deep state tried so hard to not get him elected. I think he's a better bet, that's for sure. Also when you get into these lawyers there's not much you can do, they're all sleezy some have integrity, but I think it sucks the soul out. I think wikileaks supported Trump for a reason, because he's a better bet, and yea I don't want to accept it, because it sucks, nonetheless even with that i still have hope. Nonetheless this push for impeachment is obviously trying to get him out for some reason. Yea I personally think epstein was mossad for blackmailing politicians. I don't doubt that Trump was a part of that in some way, but nonetheless this is where we're at, I have faith.

       So the new narrative seems to be another flip (like changing democrats' "fake news" -term they invented/used into a Trump-term), trying to accuse Trump of being the center of it? There's a lot of you saying this in the thread right now. You realize how obvious it is?

       Pedogate can be more defined as a satanic cult who procures children then rapes and murders them, worldwide. As I said, I do not doubt Trump's involvement with epstein, but you'd also have to include the others that have flown down there too, like stephen hawking, chris tucker, naomi campbell, kevin spacey, etc, etc and implicate them as well. Which i, too, do not doubt. Do I find Trump to be a sexual deviant, yes. Do I think he's raped women? I honestly do not know, but I wouldn't doubt his involvement with Epstein. Do I think he is satanic? No. Do I feel as if he knows more than he lets on? Yes. Do I think that there is a deep state plot that is being run against him? Yes, it's painfully obvious to me. Do I feel as if he's working with them? No I do not. Do I feel as if he's a part of the Mossad/CIA satanic cartel? No I do not. Do I classify him as a Bush or Clinton (CIA ran drugs through the Clintons, Bush was head of CIA)? No I do not. Do I view him as an outsider? Yes. Do I think he is better than these people? Yes. Do I see the
       <em>
        POTENTIAL
       </em>
       for him to change the status quo? Yes. Do I have hope? Yes. Do I honestly think that there is a deep state agenda directed directly at him? Yes. How did I draw these conclusions? Whenever Trump bombed Syria, the deep state cabal media praised him, saying the sight was
       <em>
        beautiful
       </em>
       - heralding him a hero for BOMBING SYRIA - Then praising him for NK - WAR MONGERING - No mention of Russia - none - that story
       <em>
        vanished
       </em>
       - but wait after he stopped - after the cold silence about WW3 being about to start - IT KICKS BACK UP THEY ALL HATE HIM AGAIN - He's all in for Russia again - He's a puppet of Vladimir - He's working
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       them via blackmail - Seth Rich leaked the emails of the DNC - if that goes out - the jenga pieces fall - the Russian DNC hack was false - a major aspect of collusion to undermine the democratic process
       <em>
        cough Clinton cough DNC cough totally undermined democracy
       </em>
       (points finger at russia with no evidence) - The Government is an EVIL entity... it truly truly is... I mean MOSSAD has CIA oversight... ISIS is CIA - the CIA flies in drugs and sells them to you - threatens MLK - killed MLK - injected crack into black neighborhoods - helped drug cartels from mexico recently - and run the media - you honestly can't give these people a bone - as I said it's unwise

      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised even though I voted for Trump if he was involved in Pedogate and is good friends with the Clintons. I even wouldn't be shocked if the truth came out some day and revealed that those who pull the strings decided it was better to have Trump be President instead of Hillary, because it would be easier to create an endless distraction for the public and keep their eyes off of Pedogate.

       He's been a long time friend of both the Clintons and of Epstein. The reason he hasn't "locked her up" is because if any of them involved go down then they drag them all down with them (that's how blackmail rings stay functional - everyone has dirt on someone else, they all agree to do what they can to make it look like they're not on the same team, so that they maintain the control of information and power). I think the Trump-Russia connection is real, but the narrative of their hacking the election is bullshit. I think the Clintons knew this but didn't say anything until he was in office and they needed a story to distract from pizzagate when that began to break. Just as Trump knew about pizzagate but didn't say anything. But when he started using conspiracy-like language in his speeches in the run up to the election (in retrospect, it's obvious he was simply pandering) he accidentally helped the pizzagate researchers get a bit of momentum. This is why Clinton seems to have got at least a bit genuinely angry/scared at Trump becoming president. That and the fact she was probably promised the position at the last Bilderberg. The pig bankers in trump's administration are jumping ship partly for show and partly because they actually don't wanna be caught up in all that when it comes to light. That administration is a mix of wolves and pigs. But tptb need to push the Russia story because they need a distraction from pizzagate. Also why north Korea seems to have entered the mix - people aren't believing the shit with Syria so they need a new enemy. Tptb have several potential plans and paths to pursue to keep the masses distracted. Russia/NK/China is just the one they're using at the moment.
       <br/>
       I reckon if the people make it known and be vocal about not believing these phony war-provoking attempts and if pizzagate really makes serious public momentum then tptb will pull out all the stops and go fake alien invasion. Something I've learned over my ufo and alien research is that ET species don't need anything from earth, don't care for, and don't want to invade. They want us to sort out own shit out before becoming part of an interplanetary society. Any alien invasion would be a human-made false flag and is the last resort. Pizzagate threatens that because it reveals how the sociopathic power structure has held its form for so long. I think they'll pursue Russia/NK/China though through to the very end before "aliens."

       Along those lines, there's been a bit of RUMINT lately that Australian Intelligence has tapes of Donald with an underage girl and so far isn't leaking them due to the age of the girl.

       The problem I see with both is that they are contaminated with partisan political motives and willful ignorance regarding similar behavior from whatever 'side' they support. It pushes people away.
Presenting the 2 theories as opposing one another is a blatant illustration of this point.

       Pedogate isnt partisan at all... it's global and transcends parties, pizzagate is just a part of it that's nonpartisan as well. No one wants children molested. Also one is run by the deep state run media, this goes way way beyond politics. One story is being run by the media as truth and the other as fake news yet the fake news one has a lot more evidence than this current story, and one is a deep state agenda being pushed as truth... I don't think collusion is happening at all and it's all a push to impeach someone who's a threat to the deep state

       I think that they exist, but that the deep states afraid of him, that he's not a guy to get on but to have hope for, the deep state is running hard, they deserve more focus because they far are worse, by a long shot.

       Do you not know of the existence of the deep state? And why would assange support Trump? I'm suggesting there is a reason to hope, rather than your view, aka they're trying to impeach him for a reason, he poses a threat. This whole Russian bs is insane

       I'm just going to make one statement and then I'm not engaging discussion with you any further. Just because msm doesn't like him and folks in what you (and Trump) define as the "deep state" seemingly oppose Trump, doesn't make him the 'good guy' by default. It also doesn't show his intentions are pure and he's separate in any meaningful way from them. I'm not saying the Russian narrative is entirely true or false, but ridiculous criticisms are created, often by his own supporters, and propagated in attempt to get others to lump them in with more legitimate concerns and dismiss them altogether.  I don't understand how people can honestly and intellectually see Trump as an 'outsider' based upon his past business history and appointments/decisions he has made thus far in his campaign and presidency. Some folks have 'silver tongues', Donny doesn't. He's a dime a dozen snake oil salesman, appealing to people's emotions and frustrations with the political system. I can see how people might think some type of philanthropist may bring something refreshing to the political spectrum. But you're choosing a corrupt businessman (who's bankrupted casinos; think about that, it's not easy to do) over a corrupt politician. Some folks realize that and want to use him to completely annihilate politics altogether, which I understand (and if done in a certain way with a certain intent I think can really get somewhere). However, to think he's a honest, sincere person with good intent for this country as well as possessing the aptitude to run it? That's pretty much terrifyingly and paradoxically comically ludicrous to me.

       He's the lesser of two evils imo, I never said he's pretty, he's better than Hillary by a long shot though and I voted for her. There is a reason the deep state, illuminati, whatever words you choose to define them as, doesn't want him in office, there's a reason he's put under the gun of impeachment, this would never, and I mean never, happen for Hillary, who is in on the deep state, the CIA know the Clinton's very very well through cocaine trafficking. I'm sorry but assange backed him at one point, I have a reason to have more hope with him than Hillary, his first NSA believed in pizzagate. There's quite a bit more to it all, but the deep state attacking him IS a sign he's not on his team otherwise it would be a whole other ballgame.

       Pizzagate is supposed be an incredibly wide ranging worldwide crime with potentially hundreds of victims and likely thousands of people involved down to the menial dock workers and everything... and there isn't one even supposed victim? These millionaires and billionaires are Willy nilly picking up people's children, raping and murdering them and doing it again and the best evidence I've seen is weird art and a bullshit secret language?

       "supposed victim." the idea is that the victims are the some of the children that go missing every year where the cases are never solved.  they would be hidden somewhere and never let into the public.  now how would anyone be able to pin point these victims

       This still gives hundreds, if not thousands of potential loose ends. These kids disappear from somewhere. Almost all of them with concerned parents. There are people who have to work on docks and have to work on boats. The rich also don't do everything for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's fine... but this is also the amount of evidence for
       <strong>
        literally nothing
       </strong>
       . You're describing why there can't be actual evidence for hundreds of rape-murders. So "weird-art" and pretend languages will just have to do...

       Pizzagate is a bout an international criminal group (or groups) involving institutionalized child sex trafficking and ritual abuse among wealthy elite and politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not about a pizza shop basement where Hillary Clinton is selling children and the only people who argue this are the mainstream media who, in collusion with members of this criminal group, seek to undermine a real investigate and public awareness.
      </p>

       So where does that leave you? Are you willfully ignorant or are you just confused.

       Anti russia agenda serve a cause to many stakeholder the biggest being the military industrial complex. Whereas the pizzagate does not serve the agendas, and even goes against the wallets who pay for the anti russia bullshit atm.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO no matter what money talks and it is saying russia is bad, communication with russia is now collusion and pizzagate is to be ignored as its detrimental to the image of the payers (1%)

       You say "entirely circumstantial" but there seems to be the tacitly saying "weak and spurious evidence".

       Circumstantial evidence .... IS EVIDENCE.

       I honestly wish pizzagate was real.  It's actually disappointing that you kids made all this up; because it definitely seemed like something I would have supported.

       The entire thing is believed because of some 4chan users taking a boring e-mail and pretending it's code (even changing the code from what it actually is to fit the story). It's really, really dumb.

      <p>
       Let this serve as an example, there is no evidence of pizzagate. This was your defense of it, and it was nothing, absolutely nothing. Pizzagate is built on suggestions, not evidence. You physically cannot debunk it, because the only reason it exists is because it's based on assumptions, and is not based on logic. There are no counter proofs when logic is, by default, being ignored.

       Right, he shared info diplomatically about a threat to both country, which wasn't classified, as the president of the USA it is impossible for him to disclose classified information, aka what he says, by law, can not be classified, not to mention that it's nothing other than fear mongering war like propoganda. I could tell you that Hillary Clinton saved a convicted child trafficker from Haiti who's lawyer was wanted in 4 countries for human trafficking and serendipitously placed as the head of amber alerts, the ones who notify the world about missing children, but somehow that doesn't classify as evidence to you. You're lack of detailed information on the subject really just supports my notion that you have no clue to what you're saying.

       Secondly, I didn't go into it because it's 100% irrelevant to my point. You're trying to discredit me with some convoluted nonsense to avoid arguing my point, since there truly is no evidence of pizzagate. Besides, the statement you put there is not evidence of anything, and not just because you were wrong, and I explicitly stated I wasn't going into it. My knowledge on Trump's current scandal is completely irrelevant to my knowledge about pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's probably no point in arguing with you anyway, since you're too full of yourself and just ignore logic and reason. But i'm interested in what kind of "evidence" you can provide of pizzagate, and just how easily it's shot down (really easily is the answer).

       Not at all, I'm sorry that you can't see what I've said, I just put it simply, so I didn't spend all of my time presenting an argument to someone who wouldn't even consider it because they've already drawn their conclusions. Do you believe Russia or Seth Rich leaked to wikileaks? Do you trust the three letter agencies that have sold drugs in this country while illegally spying? Remember how Vietnam started.

       She was caught twice when warned she would be arrested on child trafficking charges, she was stopped the first time and didn't heed the warning and didn't get approval and tried again, which is incredibly suspicious.

       The relevant operation was not with bad intent, the intent was to help the children that were caught up in the earthquake in Haiti. They didn't have proper authorization, and were therefore charged with kidnapping (even though it really wasn't). Bill Clinton stepped in because the intend was initially good, but the paperwork wasn't in order (which is not too surprising given that the situation was chaotic and the organisation new).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton's support of the organisation is way closer to altruistic support to an incompetent organisation, rather than a sinister plot to make child porn.

       I disagree, whenever you're trying to save children by putting them up for adoption you should have paperwork in order, having not done this once is passable, but after trying to do it twice and being warned by authorities that she would get charged with child trafficking is much more suspicious. Then, her lawyer, was a known human trafficker wanted in 4 countries for human trafficking. The intention was broadcast as good, but charities and organizations that do illegal things have a nice looking cover, while underneath the illegal activities can take place.

       I agree that they should have had their paperwork in order, but that's not the point of contention. There was no bad intent. She was never found guilty of child trafficking anyway, she was originally accused of it, yes, but it was reduced to a much lighter charge. the judge clearly didn't agree with you, and I trust a judge's judgement way over yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's the gap in your story: the story does not support that Hillary has any hand in child trafficking, but because you ASSUME bad intent, it does. It's an assumption, it's not evidence.

       The evidence for negative intent is more than positive intent in this case imo, because you have a, now convicted, human trafficker involved and you have a definite warning being issued stating the charges that would happen. She had children on a bus 3 days before and they were removed and she was warned she would be charged at that point. Imo you'd have to be doing something that you didn't want people to find out in order to not follow the legal procedures. Illegally abducting children is a big deal, which is what she legally did and knew about but ignored. She didn't listen on something that serious, which should raise some red flags, and tried again and was charged this second time, which any reasonable officer would do. The ICE also found pedophiles in Haiti trying to procure children, so this also shows that people were trying to do this. The SoS has a lot of power around the world and the Clinton Foundation isn't without controversy in Haiti as well. Also you must question Clinton here, because she isn't without controversy throughout her life.

       Again, none of that is evidence, it's all suggestions (outside of just assumptions). If your story was 100% as you said it was, it would still not be evidence, it's a suggested link (which is still pretty weak).

       Now for the contents of your argument:

      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Everyone agrees with the first part, the second part doesn't make too much sense (You mean illegally?) As I said, there was no such intent, she was judged as having no such intent. Everything points to it being a poor attempt at helping victims of the Haiti disaster. It makes sense that Hillary would try to help an effort of helping children in Haiti, since it's the right thing to do.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The ICE also found pedophiles in Haiti trying to procure children, so this also shows that people were trying to do this.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And yet this person was specifically founded not guilty of that charge.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a very invalid argument. We should question literally everyone on everything then.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not an argument. It's very loose, it's based on the assumption that the bad outweighs the good, it's from a position of more knowledge than anyone at the time, and a bias against Hillary herself. This is just some loose threads you're trying to connect with logical leaps and assumptions. It's not evidence.

       To the first part, I mean under the definition of law. What is defined, legally, as child trafficking and that what was committed. Sorry about that, I should of put in some more context for a better understanding. The more fishy thing to me is her being warned not once, but twice. If you're really trying to remove children from a country for their own good, you'd have the legal documents in order, not just because you're running an orphanage but because it's the right thing to do, for yourself and the children. You honestly can't assume that someone would go down there with the intention of setting the children up an orphanage for adoption without paperwork. Imagine if that happened in the United States, you'd probably be put into a mental institution for being mentally unfit to take care of the children if not prison for child trafficking. You're taking children out of a country, not to chuckie cheeses. The fact that she was warned about this and attempted it not just once, but twice shows a high level or incompetence, or worse. And then on top of all of this incompetence you have her lawyer being wanted in 4 countries for human trafficking, including children. The first part can be written off as incompetence at a severe severe level, we're talking about abducting children out of a country without paperwork after knowing that she would be arrested, then having her lawyer being wanted in 4 countries is like lightning hitting you twice. The courts ruling doesn't mean much whenever you are a SoS, just remember the OJ case and by that same logic we can assume that the intention of OJ Simpson was good whenever he didn't kill those people. I agree with you that most courts are just but it's a matter of fact that they are all not. Still, to me, this outweighs the evidence of the good.

       I really think that's up to incompetence, impatience, etc. Even if they wanted to end up kidnapping the children, having done the paperwork would still be better, since by the time you've been warned twice, everyone knows you're going to do it. Even if nobody knows ahead of time, you still have to cross that border, they know that. It's purely plain incompetence. Heck, even if it was malice, it was incompetent malice. If I were trafficking humans, and needed a defense in court, aiming to be cleared of guilt, the LAST thing I would do is hire a lawyer that is wanted in 4 countries for exactly that.

       Before you say "nobody is THAT incompetent", there is no limit to people's incompetence. We all know that.

       So you're saying that even though most courts are just, you're assuming that this one time it wasn't?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again though, it's very much a (weak) suggestion of a link which may more may not incriminate Hillary a bit, but it's by no means evidence of anything to do with pizzagate. It's interpretation of facts, assumptions, not evidence. This is the kind of thing pizzagate is relying on, and that's exactly why it has no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like how theories about Paul McCartney being dead have nothing concrete either. There are hints that MAY suggest he actually died, but mostly, they're just coincidences. If you look hard enough, you can find evidence to support anything. Most of the time, they don't have to make up an incorrect code though (which was the case for one of the very first e-mails that talked about pizza gate, the one about handkerchiefs.)

       Having the paperwork insures a paper trail... Saying that it would be wiser for child traffickers to have a paper trail isn't true at all. It was after an earthquake, so you might assume a less secure border. The man wasn't known to be a trafficker during the time of the case. The OJ reference is just validation that courts are not arbiters of truth.

       Avoiding a paper trail is to avoid a lawsuit. There's no point in avoiding it if you go straight into a lawsuit anyway by not creating it. Creating a paper trail would definitely not have gotten them into trouble.

       The court relies on evidence and proof. If you can't prove something, as far as the court is concerned, it did not happen. So as far as a court is concerned, Pizzagate doesn't exist.
      </p>

       Again, this is not evidence, just the assumption that they're child traffickers, and working from there. I think you now understand what I mean by the sentence "Pizzagate has no evidence".

       You assume that it was their incompetence that drove them into a lawsuit rather than an intention to hide something, this is a fallacy. Obviously the woman is smart enough to be put in charge of the amber alert system so she can't be that incompetent, not the level of incompetence you are describing. Creating a paper trail would of gotten them into trouble if they had other intentions. Creating a paper trail is a negative thing if you're a child trafficker, as you don't want any evidence left behind. You do not know if she planned on crossing the border or had other plans. Courts do rely on evidence and proof mostly, but saying that it solely depends on whether you have evidence or not is another fallacy. You can simply look at a grand jury and the special prosecutor presenting the information to them. However he presents the "evidence" can sway an entire investigation and trial. Again, you're attempting to say that proof and evidence equal court and that by the court's ruling that there is no evidence or proof, which is another fallacy. According to you, OJ is innocent and that he was proven, without a doubt, innocent, and that your mind should reflect that regardless of what you actually know, which is another fallacy. You also fail to mention the lawyer who was wanted in 4 countries for trafficking human beings, seems like a good person who knows how to do exactly what the courts had convicted her of, until a high level state official who's been shown to be corrupt, stepped in and helped. You assume that her word has no power and that this changing of sentences via her direct influence had solely to do with facts, again another fallacy. Then you just keep repeating your mantra of no evidence. Again you're not weighing both sides of the evidence out and objectively viewing the entire scenario, but rather you already have your mind made up on the axiom "Pizzagate has no evidence" thus build your story out of that, or at least it seems. Because any rational person would not claim that a weak inference is made whenever a woman is caught child trafficking after being warned by officers, not once, but twice, detained, and has her lawyer wanted in 4 countries for child trafficking that she might actually be a child trafficker. Saying this is a weak correlation is beyond delusional.

       Weighing both sides equally? Wait a minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the sides is made up evidence based on logical falsehoods and made up bullshit, the other side is stating that it's made up bullshit. Pizzagate is clearly made up conspiratorial bullshit. It's like telling me to treat medicine and alternative medicine fairly.
      </p>
      <p>
       There literally is no evidence. The story you're trying to sell is not only filled with your own assumptions and interpretations, but also not evidence for pizzagate. It's loose threads that you're trying to connect yourself by assumptions and interpretations that you then sell as facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Pizzagate has no evidence" Is my belief, one that you're reinforcing by presenting no evidence and clinging on to some made up bullshit and your own interpretation of an unrelated story. It's nonsense.

       Woop, fallacy town, here we come!
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a fundamentally wrong thing about Pizzagate, and that is the assumption that "since there are these things that correlate, there must be conspiracy", which there often isn't. Your "evidence" is not hard evidence, it's "loose pointers" (gonna call them that to illustrate a thing here). You then say "well, we don't have hard evidence, but we have SO MANY loose pointers, it must be true!", a notion that is very dangerous and can be completely false and lead you very far away from the truth. Ever wondered why mathematics is so bloody rigorous to the point of it being a nuisance?
      </p>
      <p>
       There once was a school of mathematics that didn't do rigor, that just proved things by "use this fact shown here". With this lack of rigor, they eventually were able to prove complete and utter nonsense by their abominations. Rigor is extremely important in proving something, and that's what's missing in pizzagate, and that's ignoring evident falsehoods. That rigor is also missing in your story. It's never just a statement of facts, it's always "This is true, and that was obviously by that!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes a lot of knowledge about logic to be able to see why you can't talk this loosely about these things. If you don't see that, there's literally no point in continuing this conversation, since we're not going to effectively communicate.

       I really don't think we can move much further either, I think we have reached a fundamental difference in perspective that shows that we are at an impassable point. My perception and background differ from yours thus giving you and me a completely different interpretation of facts here. 
I have heard enough to deduce that this leads to something else, thus not fall in line with the CNN, Anderson Cooper Narrative, rather than the MSM narrative that also pushes the safety of things like roundup and bill nye, aka I'm pretty sure you find RoundUp nontoxic. 
I also think you fail to see quite a bit of things and this mentality that you have is viewed as the only one based in logic and reason.
And whether you like it or not you can't ever not be objective as you like, subconscious biases rule the tides of the mind like no ones business. 
Again here we go you say "loose pointers" and that's all the evidence we have for the Trump Russia Collusion and you have swallowed that hook too, ignorant of EVERYTHING you've just said, but i'm sure you'll somehow skirt around it again too. 
Go ahead I personally might be done here depending on how you respond.

       Right, give me some examples of evidence that I've falsely seen? Was it that Laura Silsby was arrested on human trafficking charges? Was it that she was warned twice not to go into haiti from the dominican republic with officers warning her that she'd get charged for child trafficking without a permit? Sure you'd think that she would heed this message, but no she didn't. She loaded up a bus of kids in haiti and some other people got suspicious called the cops over, and they took the kids off the bus and gave her a warning saying she will be arrested the next time, because she didn't have permits, then, low and behold the genius of this woman, she KNEW she had to get permits, but decided to TRY AGAIN to go into haiti, WITHOUT PERMITS, and loaded up another bus this time, and was caught AGAIN! GENIUS! NOTHING FISHY HERE! She had no permits! Warned TWICE! and then was arrested on child trafficking charges. But wait, billy mays here, there's more! Her "lawyer" in her court case in haiti, was none other than a wanted human trafficker in 4 countries! How many coincidences add up to make the probabilities of this a billion to one? Wait... that's right! The Clintons came down there to rescue her! Personally! That she had to be free'd for doing nothing wrong, not the ICE found pedophiles attempting to take kids out of haiti either, anyways, this lady should gamble more often amirite? then she just somehow moves into the top position of the amber alert system which gives alerts for missing children... I mean - this ladies just a series of unfortunate events right? and nothing more? right? I mean this is just the tip of the iceberg too - we can go into more if you'd like

       yes it does - why? - it directly links clinton to child trafficking - clinton had many events and fundraisers here - where you find stuff like this -

       Yes, last fall I was following it daily. Watching articles get scrubbed and edited, people calling it out and posting archives. The absolute craziest thing was when people noticed the traffic cam outside Comet had been moved [so you could no longer see Comet], and the next day the "shooting" happened. Then the camera went back to its usual position. I'd think it was a load of shit too if I hadn't seen it all as it happened.

       This is the thing that really  solidified my belief that shady shit is going on. I was watching the chans when someone realized the camera had moved and you could no longer see Comet. The next day, well what do you know, here comes Mr. Welch to save the day. Then the camera just went back to its usual spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then came all the witness statements and articles, some people said multiple shots fired, some said 1, some said none. Eventually it settled into the narrative that there was 1 shot and it happened to go through a locked door and destroy their computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we find out the shooter has an imdb page and was arrested just weeks prior to the shooting for running over a teenager, but wasn't charged. Hmmm...
