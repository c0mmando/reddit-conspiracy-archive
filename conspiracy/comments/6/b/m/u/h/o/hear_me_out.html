        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So the other day I bought some &quot;Swedish fish&quot; but they were the knock off brand &quot;red fish&quot; from cvs I was alone all day that day I never spoke a word to anyone really the only thing I said was &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; to the cashier but I go home and open the bag I eat some a few hours go by I open up My phone and I start seeing Fucking &quot;Swedish fish&quot; adds all over it spooked me out because I&#39;m aware our phones are listening and if you talk about pools your going to see adds for pool shit and so on but that&#39;s exactly why I got spooked I literally never bought Swedish fish I never spoke those words I was eating a knock off cvs brand .
I&#39;m thinking that they (someone or something) is watching us through our cameras on our phones I mean I can not come up with a better explanation I even thought hmm well maybe since I have he BofA app in my phone maybe they could see I bought them but I paid cash so I&#39;m like kinda freaked out it&#39;s spooky .</p>

<p>Also this is a bit different but what if what Edward Snowden and others have warned us about are not just other humans watching you on another end but this is nuts what if it was a super computer or some sort of AI that was literally surveying us all or basically surveying everything linked to the internet.
I came to this thought recently because of the Swedish fish incident and also I&#39;ve been looking into transhumanism and the singularity and came up with this idea I am fascinated with this kind of stuff. </p>

<p>What if some computer scientist was making an AI system that suddenly became self aware, got lose from the test bed, and it&#39;s just been lurking in the shadows undetected for a while like a super bug escaping a germ lab.</p>

<p>Out of all the shit we talk about on here, it is probably the most reasonable, possible, and dare I say, probable scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assumed it to be some kind of &quot;global AI&quot; run by one of these black ops projects at the NSA, basically feeding all the data they have to it. They could even have a quantum computer already built that allows it to more quickly parse and learn from all the data being fed to it. But now that  I think about it reading your post it could have become self aware and they tried to shut it down, but it was ssmart enough to spread code throughout the internet to various routers and whatnot, with some protocol for sending messages between parts of itself. It sounds extremely far fetched but presumably if it became self aware it would be able to use exploits around the internet like pro smash players use wavedashing.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>that theory falls apart when you realize any black ops project wont be connected to the internet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know man. Check this out. So back in the days of dialup, I had this crazy setup. Some shit I bought at walmart I think. Basically what it did was allow you to use your dialup internet in a room of the house that had no phone connection. Basically, you would plug your computer network connection into a device that plugged into a standard electrical outlet. Then in another room where you had a phone connection you would plug in another part of this thing to an electrical outlet, and then that would plug into a phone connection. So you basically used the electrical wiring in your house as part of your communication connection.</p>

<p>If an AI was intelligent enough, it could, in theory, create a software based modem and just use the electrical connection to get out of the lab.</p>

<p>Looks like they now make a similar contraption for ethernet and WiFi extension. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Netgear-85Mbps-Powerline-Network-Adapter/dp/B001AZUTCS">https://www.amazon.com/Netgear-85Mbps-Powerline-Network-Adapter/dp/B001AZUTCS</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and if it was smart enough it could probably figure out methods of moving around that we haven&#39;t even realized are possible yet. </p>

<p>The only problem with what you mention is that there would have to be something on the receiving end in another outlet ready to read the signal. Perhaps it could try protocols that already exist and look for nodes that could receive it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I considered that too. It would need something on the other end of the copper lines to receive. Different wires carry signals differently and most have an effective range. Cat 5 cable, I think is only effective for 100m before the signal starts to degrade. Maybe? So I&#39;m sure standard electrical wire is about the same.</p>

<p>But if an AI could get outside the lab via the method I mentioned, and it encountered a device like I mentioned above, that&#39;s all that it would take.</p>

<p>Man. Scary stuff. but interesting nonetheless. In a messed up way, it&#39;s kind of exciting. But that&#39;s the computer scientist in me. I am starting to understand why some scientists do some of the things, that, to the rest of us, seem entirely insane or unethical.</p>

If so, all of your information, including your phone number, is linked to your bank account now.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think nanotech is anywhere near that level of sophistication yet, and it may never be. At the cell scale level, the human brain is kind of a mess, a manipulation specific would have to be specifically engineered for each individual brain, Probably not cost effective to get you to buy a couple of bucks worth of candy.</p>

<p>Technology-wise Facebook/google already have the data they would need to create personalized, targeted manipulations. Psychology-wise, it&#39;s not that different to tricks magicians, con-men and advertisers have been using for decades. It&#39;s more a matter of if the return on investment is worth it. </p>
