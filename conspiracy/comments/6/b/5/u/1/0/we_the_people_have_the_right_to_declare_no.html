      </p>
      <p>
       This got exceptionally poor reception, so lets experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a politically apt person. However it's so pervasive now that i feel we should address it. Not per say as a conspiracy though it could be construed as one. We are not bound by the processes invented by in which we declare our leader. In fact we have the right to say anything and petition for anything we desire. So allow me to pose this..
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not have to stand idle and allow Trump to be Commander and Chief. No i am not referencing impeachment, as he has not been proven to committing an impeachable offense. I'm simply stating we can oppose anyone elected into office, and claim "We do not want you to be our president". Article 2 section 1 clause 6 of the constitution permits congress to make a case for this. It is then up to the senate and house to decide the validity of claims for and against this process. And via the Presidential Succession Act congress will have to decide who can hold the position of POTUS. Simply put
       <strong>
        we the people
       </strong>
       have the right to a motion of no confidence. They would have you believe this is not possible. However it is written into our constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our rights, and elected officials responsibilities are suppressed, not overtly, subversively in how we are taught, conditioned and coerced.
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitution is a real thing, and it binds us as citizens of this nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you to all who participated. This was fun.

       If your resentment for Trump is so much so that you are willing to forgo the logic about what you are proposing, then they have won - their game of emotion has you by the balls.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to get rid of Trump, and NOT see another stooge installed, I recommend you quit playing the outrage game, and start looking into suppressed technology that these folks in this sub are disemminating: r/new_American_system
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not enough to just be outraged and demand a different president and expect anything resembling true change.  The system overall needs a facelift, and major infrastructural projects like these are the type of things that create growth and solve all sorts of problems

       I always wondered.. If the reason people from over the world always say "americans are stupid" is because A. They just thought we were dumb and couldn't do math and low IQs; or B. Because it is so obvious to other countries looking in that we are a conquered people, but its no apparent to us because we're the oppressed

       I wouldn't be opposed to that. I am certain that's why he's VP. There's a bigger secret behind Pence than any of this trump bs. Look into Pence, realize Paul Ryan would be VP in this scenario. And you think hillary lost.. ha, This has been planned since Trump gained traction in the polls. The bigger secret is privatized war profiteering and national indiscretion to foreign acquisitions by congress. Our whole system is fucked. I know that that. Trump is going nowhere. This was all a test. Im feeling particularly feisty today. So here's a fun one for you. Trump will go.. the question is to what end? War, peace, dismemberment of the empire, or maybe he will just go golfing.

       you are, well not intrinsically, more empirically. In an experimental kind of way.

       I think Trump is bad, but he's no worse than either of the Bush family scum or Clinton the rapist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton killed half a million Iraqi kids by starving them to death. Bush II was president during the most deceptive and horrific false flag in American history and may well have unleashed a century or millennia of satanic madness.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're trying to stop the crazy train by tossing Trump, you're at least a generation too late. Maybe Trump'll at least burn some of the entrenched horror down through sheer incompetence.

       If that is your hope than you are as deluded as they come. Trump is here to further the same agenda you hope he cures. It's all a ruse, and doesn't matter anyway. Trump will go, but not how you think or i suggest. tell your friends.

       He may be, but as I said, he's not nearly as competent. He may well fuck it all up. Bush, Clinton, Obama--they were disciplined, they'd been raised through the "system." Trump, even if he's one of "them," is clearly not liked by a lot of them. I think you're letting your blind hatred blur your awareness of what's happening here.

       The cat in office, along with his predecessors, is functioning solely as a figurehead of the corporation. Love him or loathe him, we the people have much bigger problems than the person with the title of president.
