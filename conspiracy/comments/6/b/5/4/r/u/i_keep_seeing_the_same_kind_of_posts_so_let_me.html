We are, unnecessarily, spending billions annually enforcing, prosecuting and incarcerating people for marijuana related offenses (<a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/aclu-thewaronmarijuana-rel2.pdf">https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/aclu-thewaronmarijuana-rel2.pdf</a>).

<p>This is a good point, but its not the rule. I merely stated the rule., I don&#39;t like it either. I think we need a general rule requiring the government to make reasonable efforts to enforce the law. Then, there would be fewer laws and more consistency with law breakers. :)</p>
