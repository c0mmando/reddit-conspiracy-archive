       IMO this is not enough. It's basically a nation-wide medical marijuana bill. There are only 4 states that don't have some form of medical marijuana law (Nebraska, Idaho, South Dakota and Kansas). We should be proposing full scale legalization. We are, unnecessarily, spending billions annually enforcing, prosecuting and incarcerating people for marijuana related offenses (

       It doesn't change the fact that the content of his character doesn't reflect that he's open to change. An honorable person would be saying "come on guys, we need to fix this." I feel the same way about police, when I was arrested for cannabis possession all the officers that I talked to, including the drug task force, told me that they thought that it should be legal and that most of their job was arresting people for cannabis. I would never, even for a day, continue doing something that I disagreed with for a paycheck. That is gutless and dishonorable behavior and we, as a society, should not tolerate it.

       So you are judging him and his character just because he his does his job and duty when you feel it is unpopular to do so?

       What he thinks of the laws is irrelevant because he does not make the laws.

       I totally understand that he doesn't make the laws but he is in a better position than most to be outspoken about what the right thing to do is. I judge his character based on his archaic stance on the issue himself and I judge police officers on their stance that it should be legalized yet being complicit and still going to work every day and ruining people's lives. I think that doing something that you don't agree with for a paycheck is deplorable.

       Not really. The most general rule you may have heard:
      </p>
      <p>
       Government is not required to enforce the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions do not have a duty to enforce any particular law or even to enforce it fairly unless there is a specific exception.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can show me in the statute exactly where he must prosecute this law, or if you can show me a violation of the Constitution,

       This is just circular logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Trump is not a lawyer or law enforcement agent and was not elected to be one. Sessions does not prosecute drug offenders. That is not his job. His main job entails representing the united states interests in the supreme court.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys want to turn people against Trump and his administration so badly yet you have no idea of what these people's job and duty actually is. You just want to jump on the trendy hate bandwagon.

       Let's go through this step by step. You said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is his job and duty to enforce the existing law as principal legal officer. (self.conspiracy)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I responded to modify that by pointing out that there is no such rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot show me such a rule.
      </p>

       Your original statement has not been proved. You have the burden of proof. Use it or lose it. :)

       Yes my title wasn't fully correct I was just making the point that he has no power to create law. His actual duties are here

       You know what's really messed up? I wasn't even disagreeing. I was merely refining your point to say that he is not obligated to enforce the law. But you wanted to argue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just posted two specific rulings that say there is no requirement to enforce the law. Now, if you disagree with that, the burden of proof is on you. Linking a title page to a statutory scheme does not prove anything. :)

       Trump was elected with one of the primary promises of his campaign was that he would start enforcing the peoples' laws rather than ignoring them or selectively applying them according to the whims of special interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think he should just make a few exceptions for laws you don't like, then he probably should just make a few more exceptions for other laws that other special interests don't like, right?

       This is a good point, but its not the rule. I merely stated the rule., I don't like it either. I think we need a general rule requiring the government to make reasonable efforts to enforce the law. Then, there would be fewer laws and more consistency with law breakers. :)

       That isn't true.  The DOJ administers the DEA, and sorry - enforcing federal laws with marijuana WILL have an effect on states with medical and recreational use.

       Maybe the federal laws should be changed then. To operate with no concern for the law is the very definition of tyranny.

       But that doesn't change the DEA. A lot of the "drug laws" are really DEA regulations, which can be changed with the stroke of the pen.
