        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is honestly unreal to see how much the simple murmur of the term flat earth is enough to make everyone come out of the woodwork to downvote, leave rude comments, insults, etc. I rarely see any actual responses to the claims being made by Flat Earthers. For instance, when someone posts a video clearly showing ISS fraud on tape, no one actually attempts to debunk the claims, there are only insults. Why are people so against this topic? Aren&#39;t true conspiracy theorists supposed to entertain every conspiracy that comes their way? I find it interesting how the government lies to us about quite literally everything, yet it&#39;s too far-fetched to imagine that we didn&#39;t land on the moon, satellite pictures are fake, the ISS is a hoax (harnesses, CGI, etc.). The evidence is all there to be honest. I hope this sub reaches a day where people can talk about flat earth without being reprimanded.</p>

<p>For anyone interested in Flat Earth/NASA Hoax videos. I highly recommend that you check out these channels. They truly red pilled me. Be careful which flat earth websites you look at, some are intentionally dis-info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no arguments for a flat earth. I have not seen or heard one piece of evidence, nothing. Never, have I ever, been led to think the Earth was flat, not even for a moment. There&#39;s more evidence for ghosts, bigfoot, aliens, demons, and almost every other conspiracy theory/paranormal phenomenon. </p>

<p>What makes people think the Earth is flat? It seems like it may be their distrust for scientific authority, and in turn they have created illusions of grandeur. That is if anyone actually believes the nonsense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Video evidence of NASA astronots using harnesses on the ISS. Video evidence of NASA astronots using CGI on the ISS. No real pictures of Earth from space (despite 19b a year - inb4 Earth is too big). No real images of satellites from space. The very few real ones are blatantly photoshopped. How are pictures being taken of satellites being taken if they&#39;re moving 17,500 mph. Evidence of gravity in ISS (microphones falling). Evidence of harness strings etc etc. Evidence of bubbles coming out of astronot helmets. I can&#39;t feel the Earth spinning. No curve from airplane (I&#39;ve been on many). Footage where news station accidentally cuts to footage of people on a staged set with a large ball where they most likely edit the Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, and you listed only the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no explanation for these other than &quot;the earth is round, so there must be&quot;.</p>

<p>Once you stop yourself from telling yourself it&#39;s round, and try to look for actual anwsers, you&#39;ll find that list only to keep on growing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why can we see mountains/landmarks over 150 miles away? (calculate the drop due to curvature)</li>
<li>When going from north to south (or south to north) across the globe, the <em>speed</em> at which your rotating changes. This is called acceleration/deceleration and the human body is quite adept at detecting it. Why do we detect none when travelling from Africa to Europe, for example.</li>
<li>If the spinning of the earth caused the equator to bulge out slightly (+- 10 Km), why doesn&#39;t the water bulge out instead? Water is alot more flexible than rock (I hope I don&#39;t need to prove this :S), so wouldn&#39;t it make more sense that water collected itself around the equator, instead of rock?</li>
<li>The stars following a perfect circular trail. This is explained by the earth turning once around it&#39;s axis a day. Makes sense, untill you realize the earth is also revolving around the Sun, and the Sun is revolving around the center of the galaxy.</li>
<li>Why do some planes make &quot;emergency&quot; landings that make no sense on a round earth? A quick trip to google/youtube will provide plenty of examples.</li>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the speed at which your rotating changes
My rotating does not change. The speed at the point I&#39;m at, moves faster relative to the &quot;empty&quot; space outside our atmosphere. Relative to earth, I&#39;m rotating once a day, no matter where I&#39;m at.
If the spinning of the earth caused the equator to bulge out slightly (+- 10 Km), why doesn&#39;t the water bulge out instead?
Water is attracted to the moon and and it&#39;s not affected that much (if any) by the rotation of the earth. And water evens out easily over an area, and makes a flat (not as flat as you like) surface. Easier than rock at least. Did you notice?
The stars following a perfect circular trail.
Ask the ancient civilizations about this. Earth also wobbles (The Precession of the Equinoxes). It makes quite good sense to me at least.</p>

<p>But when I stand on the beach at sea level I no longer can see the other beach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You eyes can only see so far. It&#39;s called the vanishing point. This same illusion happens when a ship appears to disappear across the &quot;curve&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>More lies.  It&#39;s not a vanishing point.  It&#39;s the limit of human vision.  We can only perceive three dimensional objects of that size at a few miles or so.  So when the object blurs out of sight, the location and behold!, a telescope, which can see <em>much</em> further, can &quot;see&quot; the object again.</p>

<p>If you have a <em>clear</em> telescopic view of a ship going below the horizon, and then try to zoom in on it, it will absolutely <em>not</em> magically reappear.</p>

<p>You can actually measure the drop of the horizon using a theodolite. An example being <a href="http://m.imgur.com/iB89TnJ">here.</a> Another one being from a plane like <a href="http://m.imgur.com/cBrTtzR">here.</a></p>

<p>If you, for some reason, don&#39;t trust theodolites then there are other proofs.

<p>The hypotenuse, C, is the side opposite the right angle. That is the distance between the top of the cliff and the boat. The hypotenuse is longer than either of the other sides of the triangle, and therefore the distance between the top of the cliff and the boat is larger than the distance between the bottom of the cliff and the boat.</p>

<p>You can rent a small jet and have a pilot fly all around Earth. Hell you can rent a hot air balloon and fly around the planet yourself. Plenty of people of done this. You want to know how I know? Because I&#39;ve seen Atlanta. I have been to music festivals with a hundred thousand people. I have personally flown over LA, Tokyo, Seattle, Atlanta, Dallas, and Spokane, and I have seen the number of houses surrounding those cities.  This world is filled to the brim with people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit I&#39;ll drink a beer with you. I just don&#39;t think you actually believe the Earth is flat. There&#39;s an enormous possibility that humans are being manipulated or tricked by some powerful entity, but I don&#39;t think scientists and governments are in on it unless they&#39;re fake. Then I ask, why is God gaslighting us?  WTF, though, you don&#39;t really believe those things. I&#39;m just an ass hat sucker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t always think it was flat. I remember diving into a 6hr Flat Earth video, and I got about an hour into it and thought, hmm that&#39;s interesting. But I never really cared too much for the whole debate. However, I already thought NASA were frauds. I&#39;ve just seen too much damn evidence that shows how fake NASA and the ISS is. I think they put all of it in our faces. Hell, Simon Peggy, or whatever the dumb masonic bitch&#39;s name is, just broke the record for the most day spent in space. When she returns in September, she&#39;ll have spent 666 days in space. I&#39;ve seen an astronaut with the eye of horus tattooed on him. All of the astronauts are masons. They get off on this kind of stuff imo. I think scientists, especially governments are certainly in on it. C&#39;mon man, you think this New World Order stuff is just a joke? For the average person it is, but for them, it&#39;s their true end goal. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve hijacked this planet. They&#39;ve infiltrated our language. I&#39;m not even sure humans were supposed to have a language. We spend our weekdays in a weak daze until we&#39;re weakened until the weekend. We Languish in our languid language, in anguish ever since the ancient times of the Anglish angus and the phony Phonetic Phonics of the ancient Phoenician Pheonix. </p>

<p>English was created from the ancient Phonic Phonetics of the Phony Phoenician Phoenixes, and it reflects the creativity and cunning genius of the human race, which, of course, is not a race at all, unless you&#39;re just another rat, caught in the daily maze of the rat race of this human race against one another.</p>

<p>We draw money from our banks which are the edges of a river, which FLOWS in CURRENTS to the SEA, which is why its called CURRENCY, because our CASH FLOWS like pyroclastic ASH FLOWS toward the SEA, which is why we can trace back the ROOTS of all modern TRADE to the ancient Phoenician TRADE ROUTES,</p>

<p>Spelling - spells. Writes - rites. Vowels - vows. Cursive - curses. Syllables - sibyls. </p>

<p>This planet is fucked up to the max man. At least in my opinion. Everywhere I look I see the occult. You can type in just about any term, for instance &quot;Mary Poppins Illuminati&quot; and you&#39;ll get results. Hell, I&#39;m sure you can type in &quot;Whinnie the Poo Illuminati&quot; and you&#39;ll get a decent youtube video on it. </p>

<p>I truly understand how hard and how bogus it sounds to believe in God in 2017. We&#39;ve got kids with bone cancer, hurricanes, tornadoes. We&#39;ve got fluoride in our water, chemtrails in the air (bio-engineering, it&#39;s real, trust me). Our schools prevent critical thinking. Our government stymies democracy. Churches crush spirituality. Everything is upside down. </p>

<p>It can be difficult to see through these evil fuckers in government, but when you let go and accept that they&#39;re working with evil forces, I just let go. The further I dove into the depths of darkness, the more I was fucking empowered by the light. I feel invincible with God by my side. You would probably think I&#39;m even more crazy for believing in reptilians, and the goddess sophia, and christ. But I think this is one grand story for us to experience. I think God is about to reveal himself to the world soon. I just have this feeling in my gut that it&#39;s all about to fall down, really soon. I don&#39;t expect this link to help you much, but it just might. <a href="http://www.thepearl.org/Sophia.htm">http://www.thepearl.org/Sophia.htm</a></p>

<p>I am very positive Sophia (goddess of wisdom) is a real entity, and that she leads you to Christ. She has appeared to me in a dream before. I know it was her because what she did in my dream she did in the dream that another youtuber had. She had otherworldly beauty. I&#39;ve also had an otherworldly reptilian dream. </p>

<p>I think these sick fucks are working with these reptilians that live in a different dimension. Hence the reason for child sacrifices etc. I think they use the adrenochrome in the blood somehow to work in this dimension. I don&#39;t fucking know, but I hope I find our real soon. Cheers. </p>

<p>By the way, regarding your comment where you ask why the horizon always rises to level: It doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Have you ever measured it yourself? Next time you fly with an airplane install a theodolite app on your smartphone and simply measure the drop. Should be about 3.2 degrees on 10km height. People have already done this, like here: <a href="http://walter.bislins.ch/blog/media/Horizon-is-not-at-eye-level.jpg">http://walter.bislins.ch/blog/media/Horizon-is-not-at-eye-level.jpg</a></p>

<p>Jordan Peterson has some interesting things to say on this subject. Listen to his interview on Joe Rogan (#958).</p>

<p>Basically, we&#39;ve got a movement in society that believes in nothing. When you believe in nothing, you can believe in anything. Everyone is possible, and nothing can be dismissed out of hand, according to this mindset. Not even flat earth. It&#39;s complete bullshit, but it has gained a strong hold on the public consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ISS fraud &quot;proof&quot; I see most often are easily debunked though</p>

<p>The one with George Bush being wheeled through NASA with the video playing in the background of astronaut in front of a &quot;blue screen used for simulation&quot; is actually <a href="https://youtu.be/iginxrFn3jg">this experiment on Circular Motion</a>. The never ending evidence of &quot;wires&quot; that&#39;s supported by clothing at weird angles is easily explained by the fact that clothing doesnt fall flat against the skin in 0 gravity.</p>

<p>There is nothing Flat Earth has that cannot be better explained by the Globe Model. Flat Earthers cannot even make a functioning world map that addresses the shortfalls of Flat Earth. Every equidistant azmuthal projection that Flat Earthers use is based off the globe model, which is evidenced by the heavy longitudinal distortion in countries further from the North Pole. </p>

<p>Flat Earth also cannot explain days in Antarctica or the Northern Regions where the sun does not set or rise. </p>

<p>If the sun appears to set due to perspective (going further away) it would shrink as it sets, as with the moon. This does not happen in real life.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be much more willing to consider FE a possibility if there was a single working map of the known world that works on a FE as effectively as a globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>I never mocked the flat earth, in my 15 years of reading/researching conspiracy topics, but I always figured it just &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot; be flat. Part of that reason is that u keep telling yourself it can&#39;t possibly be flat, no matter how good the arguement they bring forward. U keep telling yourself it can&#39;t possibly be flat because, like fe&#39;ers claim, it&#39;s what we&#39;ve been told since we were born.</p>

<p>Then about a year ago, I started doing the in-depth research. Coriolis effect, stars, sattelites, plane tracking, horizon and curvature drop measuring, gyroscopes in planes, ...</p>

<p>There&#39;s too much valid points being made to completely write it off as a psy-op. On top of this, like you pointed out, the amount of shilling is unreal for the flat earth theory.</p>

<p>Combine all the empirical evidence (listed above + all the NASA fakery) with all the trolling and extremely degenerate behaviour, and despite everything we&#39;ve thaught, the earth is most likely flat.</p>

Specially sense we all grew up believing that we went to the moon (which we didn&#39;t) and that there are millions of galaxies out in the Universe (which probably isn&#39;t the case, if Flat Earth is true which we will NEVER truly know)
But just imagine the reaction not only this community would have but entire world if we found out we were living in a giant Snow globe. It&#39;s time to face the facts, we will never know. No matter how many facts you throw at people they won&#39;t believe you, regardless of the proof you have there will always be something to counter your argument.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a simple one you can do yourself:
Hang a fairly heavy weight (20 kg or so) on a long line (5 m +) with a gimbal at the top. Swing it. Observe how the line of swing seems to rotate over time. Congrats, you just demonstrated that the earth is rotating, which only makes sense if it&#39;s a globe.
The real mystery here is whether you&#39;re a shill or just uneducated?</p>

<p>You can observe the same effect with a smaller pendulum, it&#39;s just that the frequency is higher and it doesn&#39;t swing for as long so your window of observation is tighter.  Of maybe just go see Foucalt&#39;s pendulum in Paris for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I can entertain all sorts of ideas. Do I have any idea of the shape of the earth we live on? Probably not but my problem with the flat earth theory is that I&#39;ve lived on a freaking boat and if the earth is flat, tell me where everything went if it&#39;s that easy to see everything for miles all of the time. I really do enjoy hearing all of the ideas but sending a balloon up and calling that evidence is just not enough for me. 
The mathematical perspective is interesting but it doesn&#39;t discredit a round earth at all it only proves that it&#39;s possible we&#39;re living in West World and simulation theory.</p>

<p>I will say that the hate it gets is annoying because we should let people say what they want to say but I do understand why no one wants to hear it.</p>
