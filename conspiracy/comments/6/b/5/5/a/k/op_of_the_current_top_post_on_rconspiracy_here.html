       This is the kind of bullshit that happened throughout the primaries and is somehow still going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Criticism of Democrats does not mean I align with Republicans. I even voted downticket Democrats to mitigate Trump's power and have admitted that over and over here on this site, yet still these unfounded claims
       <em>
        without citing proof or even a little evidence
       </em>
       keep getting upvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I voted for Trump. But I only did so because Democrats subverted our democracy, rigged the primaries against progressives,
       <a href="http://jampac.us/dnclawsuit/">
        defrauded Bernie donors out of over $200 million
       </a>
       , and cheated America out of the highest polling general election candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO it was more dangerous to give up on democracy than allow Trump in the White House. If we don't have democracy or any say in politics, then wtf is the point of bitching on Reddit in the first place? What if we're stuck with 2 worse candidates that they select for us in the future? What then?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if anyone can find any proof of me being a Trump supporter and not just anti-Hillary, like the post reads, I'll buy you 6 months of Reddit Gold. And I hate doing that because I'm not a huge fan of the owners of this site that allow certain things (like CTR) to exist here. That's how confident I am that you won't find anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       PLEASE CITE YOUR PROOF WITH A LINK
      </p>
      <p>
       Final thoughts: should users like myself be harassed on this website via unfounded claims? e.g. users like
       <a href="/u/JakeT-life-is-great">
        /u/JakeT-life-is-great
       </a>
       who lied + astroturfed this website in attempt to make other Redditors believe his lies about my political beliefs and change the conversation from real arguments to combating his lies?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/69exrs/yes_bernie_would_probably_have_won_and_his/dh6l372/">

      </p>
      <p>
       Oh... and I got banned for 21 days from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       for incivility for responding to him. Maybe if mods would stop allowing users to lie (key point here), astroturf &amp; stalk other users this website would be a better place.

       voting FOR someone (Trump) is not really the same as voting AGAINST (Hillary) someone.

       i realize that's "splitting hairs" ... but... seriously tho:  a lot of sanders supporters voted

       That, as well as other things.  Her passing out at the 9/11 ceremony pretty much ruined any chance she had of winning.

       The Russians didn't stop Hillary from campaigning in Wisconsin and Michigan. The Russians didn't alienate half of the Democratic voter base with primary rigging and tone deaf messaging.

       The longer the Democrats and their apologists continue to pass the buck for that massive election failure, the longer the Democrats will continue to lose at all levels of government. Hillary was an awful candidate who ran an awful campaign. End of story.

       Trying to call people a "Trump supporter" as a shaming tactic instead of refuting their arguments is intellectual laziness at the least, and a shilling tactic at the worst. "Everyone who disagrees with me is a Trump supporter!" Is just as bad as "Everyone who disagrees with me is a shareblue shill!"  It's two sides of the same fucked up coin.

       You know we the people have the right to declare no confidence in Trump. Having him removed from office for the litany of offenses he has accrued but also because he does not qualify for office. In that he has not sufficiently provided proof of competency for the position of commander and chief.

       Vermonty Python probably cost Democrats the election. We kept trying to fire warning shots to the Democratic Party and they kept censoring us. Maybe if enough people could have heard our message they would have put in the most popular general election candidate available.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually the mere fact that the most popular candidate wasn't on the ballot or even in the debates says that our democracy is rigged against the people.

       The simple truth is that the DNC decided they'd rather lose to Trump than let someone like Bernie Sanders in the White House. They had ample warning that this would happen via polling, online commentary, and months of telling them "Bernie or Bust". They didn't care.

       Voting for a candidate is supporting them. That's how voting works. You can vote against someone without supporting another candidate you don't like by either not voting or voting third party. The ideological inconsistency it takes for a Bernie supporter to go and vote for Trump is beyond me. Trump was obviously fraudulent in his campaign promises. He was associating with neocons and other establishment conservatives before the election. He had big name donors like Robert Mercer who supported fucking Ted Cruz before switching to Trump. You didn't do your research, OP, and you only have yourself to blame.

       In this election what you are describing is a neutral vote. I voted against Clinton by voting Trump and voted downticket Democrats to mitigate any possible negative impact of a Republican congress. In the end, neither of my votes mattered. Trump didn't need Iowa and the rest of the state voted in Republican legislators.

       Abstaining is the only neutral vote. Why not vote Dems down ticket while picking Stein or something (especially if you believed your vote wouldn't matter anyway)? You can't vote against Goldman Sachs by voting for Goldman Sachs. That argument doesn't hold water.

       So, and why lie (especially one so easily disproven) saying that none of my posts got above 300 pts?

        why are you worried if people think you are a Trump supporter

       Because I
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to support Democrats, but I will only do that if/when they
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/New_Movement/comments/69gpjz/a_short_list_of_demands_to_the_democratic_party/">
        reform
       </a>
       . Democrats sure as hell aren't going to reform if I am a Trump supporter (I'm not and never have been), but they
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       reform to attract progressive &amp; independent voters.

       The Democrats might have been great at one time but right now, they got compromised by evil and lost.

       voting FOR someone (Trump) is not really the same as voting AGAINST (Hillary) someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       i realize that's "splitting hairs" ... but... seriously tho:  a lot of sanders supporters voted
       <strong>
        against
       </strong>
       Hillary by ticking the Trump box.

       Maybe if the DNC didn't run someone that is universally distrusted and scandalous people wouldn't be forced to use their vote as a "never Hillary" vote.

       The Russians didn't stop Hillary from campaigning in Wisconsin and Michigan. The Russians didn't alienate half of the Democratic voter base with primary rigging and tone deaf messaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       The longer the Democrats and their apologists continue to pass the buck for that massive election failure, the longer the Democrats will continue to lose at all levels of government. Hillary was an awful candidate who ran an awful campaign. End of story.
