       People with money can literally pay politicians to think whatever they want them to think. Why hasn't there been some kind of effort to get this banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should people/businesses be able to donate to politicians in exchange for having said politician represent your political views?

      <p>
       Yes/No?

       Totally agree, I've never heard a solid argument for lobbying, unfortunately the only ones who benefit are the ones who would be asked to outlaw the practice so it'll likely never end.

       I think my problem comes with unlimited donations from private groups being free speech, if it's people, I don't mind them contributing, but non human entities I oppose... Not a huge difference ultimately, but humans have some exclusive rights

       Lets say Sheldon Addleson, Bill Gates, and Soros all donate 5 million dollars to the next Dem's presidential campaign. Is there a difference, in your view, if these 3 men created a super PAC that donated 15 million dollars to the same campaign? From what Im getting t seems like youre saying the first would be okay but the second wouldnt. Please correct me where im wrong, thanks.

       I don't have a good answer to that because while an individual should have the ability to donate money to a campaign, it is undeniable that most who do so expect a kickback.

       I agree. Thats why it should be up to the voters to educate themselves with the help of the media. Its a great way to get voters to care about informing themselves because everyone knows this shit happens, and legislation I find will keep actual social change from happening; appeasing for now sure, but Im sure theres ways around it. They always find a way

       Man, but the sources of information are compromised between the state delivering info and the media distributing it. That much is the call card of this sub, but how do we honestly teach people who are entrenched in this system to pilfer through information themselves? I don't want to be hopeless, but the monstrous gears of existing institutions cast large shadows

       Expecting voters to educate themselves is like showing my dog the toilet and expecting him to know what it is and how to shit in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the media to educate voters is like showing my dog the toilet and the using a shock collar every time he uses a different toilet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: a conservative leaning but independent household decides McCain just wasn't their guy, they vote for Obama in 2008. Wrong toilet. They then spend 4 (or 8 in this case) years watching Fox News and being "shocked" for using the wrong toilet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing can be said for the independents who hated Hillary and voted Trump. Watching CNN for the next 4 years is the shock.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media is fucked. It's followed the same polarization trend as national politics over the past 25 years and it's shit. "Political media" should be an honest attempt at passing on the happenings of the government to the people, none of the major news networks do that. Maybe local channels and papers try, but the 24 hour profit chasing constant news channels need to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason I think if mass media started focusing on the economic impact of governmental polices across the board, it might actually help the bias. The WSJ is the most trusted news source in the US. Why? They don't care what party is running what, only how their readers portfolios will be impacted, and they try to give an accurate prediction people can rely on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now most of what I just said was pure speculation, but focus on the first two parts... voters are willfully ignorant and mass media feeds off of that. Asking voters to educate themselves is a far-fetched dream.

       The first is better because it is easier to control/monitor. You have an election, and each candidate is nominated by a party. In an election, and within an election period, only political parties that have nominated running candidates can run campaign ads, or do any campaign related shit. If a candidate is running independent, they can have a designated organisation that does that campaigning for them. When I say campaigning, I mean buying airtime, making billboards, all that shit. PACs cannot campaign for a candidate, only parties. This way you control the flow of money in elections. Parties have to keep records of where they get their money from, and it is all public if it's over a small amount. If you want to support a candidate, you cannot call up a company and run your own ads, nor can you set up your own secret organisation; it has to go through the party that nominated the candidate, and it has to go public.

       Do you expect every elected official to have complete, in depth, detailed knowledge of the vast number of things that might come before them in the 2/4/6 years they were elected for?  Do you think that a senator should seek counsel on say, the logging industry and the effects of potential legislation before voting on said legislation?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's lobbying.  If you write to your congressional representative because the're talking about something you don't want them to do, that's lobbying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue isn't lobbying, it's the money associated with lobbying.

       I don't see individuals ever losing the right to donate money in America. Corporations over the past 30 years have gotten closer to the government but they're still banned from contributions directly.
The problem with banning all money in politics is that only rich people can run for office, rich people who made their money from owning large businesses.

       Not at all.  The problem is that you have to replace the loss of campaign contributions with something else, the elections have to be way shorter and have to deny outside funding of any kind.  Candidates must have completely transparent finances, and all political advertising must be banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to get money out of politics is to go overboard on the government control, and that would only work if the citizens are informed and highly active.  So....it won't work.

       Exactly. It doesn't help that most people think individuals are just throwing unlimited amounts of money at candidates and corporations are just selecting politicians and buying them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lobbying/Contributing to Campaigns are both very heavily regulated. The people up top, they don't pull shady shit under a microscope. They do it behind closed doors, have shell companies set up to accept "donations" or just happen to land a cushy high 6 figure office job after their political career comes to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone has a solution to how to end that then I want to hear it. Eliminate money and people will find a way to influence others.

       there are candidates that still believe that holding an office is a public service and have high moral standards. unfortunately the only way to get elected or to get anything done once elected is to get one's hands dirty and play ball. If the rules were changed, or more transparent then maybe these white knights might stand a chance in making a difference.

       Or you take money out of politics and make bribery illegal in all forms. The fact that it isn't illegal is the reason the world is ruled by the rich. The amount of money you have is directly proportional to the amount of power you have. There is even a Princeton study that proved the US is an oligarchy.

       Ah but the government specifically forbids "special interest groups" from lobbying because they don't wanna be persuaded by said special interests, however businesses are considered a "national" interest so they're free to do so, kinda fucked that the government says the people in the country aren't considered a national interest but the big businesses and their profit margins sure are!

       Lobbying is a way to inform elected officials about something they may now understand. Lobbying plus kickbacks, bribery, and insider info (used for 'smart/convenient' investments mostly) are where things go wrong. It's money in lobbying that's the problem.

       The Truth is Ruth.  There is an effort to End Citizens United,  which basically makes buying off politicians legal,  and Justice Ginsberg is the one justice who is vocal in opposing it.  You can donate to the cause,  EndCitizensUnited.com. Our politics are so messed up that even though this is an issue that crosses party lines,  they make it out to be some far left thing,  but it isn't.  It's the wealthy eating the poor, and both parties are corporate whores.

       It's​ legal bribery, that's all. I've heard the argument that if they didn't receive campaign contributions then only the rich would ever win because they'd just bury all their competition with self promotion, but since the rich at the only ones who win anyways that's a pointless argument.

       Yes, the lobbying itself is one of the main reasons, but the money that comes with it is THE main reason. Business should in no circumstances be allowed to donate to political parties/candidates. Elections should be publicly funded and only small donations from private citizens allowed.

       I've been thinking it would be an interesting idea to start a citizens lobby.  Some sort of crowdfunded way to fight fire with fire.  For one, we might actually get some politicians to do what we want for once, and secondly it would serve a satirical purpose since it's absurd we'd need to pay or politicians to do things on our behalf, beyond just voting.

       Regardless of what the law classifies as donation for candidates, I would not consider it a donation if the politician is expected to be a vocal representative for said personal/corporate interest in return for the investment.
