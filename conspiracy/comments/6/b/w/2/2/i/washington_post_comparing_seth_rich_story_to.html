       I remember the same wording used, verbatim for the Buzzfeed coverage of the "Pizzagate Shooter"..
      </p>
      <p>
       They know exactly what sentiments are being invoked when they use connotations like that.
I'd say I'm hopeful that the majority will read the article and recognise the tactic- but I'm not. So I won't.

       I believe the term was coined by First Lady Hillary Clinton during the sex scandals of the late 1990's. She called it a 'vast right wing conspiracy'. It's come full circle again eh?

       This is the thing that doesn't make sense to me:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The story is that the DNC was hacked by Russians.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Voter Expansion Data Director of the DNC was a man named Seth Rich. Seth Rich was slated to begin working for the Clinton campaign (by multiple reports, through I don't believe this to be an essential piece of the story).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mere days before the DNC Wikileaks releases, Seth Rich was gunned down in a nice neighborhood of NW Washington DC. There is no known motive for the murder, and nothing appeared to be taken from Rich.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There has been zero information released to the public of any progress in any (if any) ongoing investigations into his murder.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Democrats have been aggressive in using victims of gun violence to push their anti-gun agenda (it's their policy, I don't mean that dismissively) in the news. Yet RIch's death has been largely ignored by the Democratic establishment.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Democrats, along with Democrat-friendly media outlets (just being real here - some outlets are Republican-friendly, some are Dem-friendly) have been heavily pushing the story of the Trump campaign having some sort of insidious connection to the Russian government,
         <em>
          including
         </em>
         the potential for collusion to damage Clinton in the election.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Democrats and Democrat-friendly media outlets have been pushing any potential damaging stories about alleged Trump-Russia connections, but have have seemingly not considered the fact that this completely random murder (not robbery, just murder) of someone who had access to DNC computer databases may be related to the hacks.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       My own opinions notwithstanding, it doesn't make any sense for the Democrats and the media looking into the Trump-Russia allegations to ignore the Seth Rich story. In fact, the only time they bring it up is to mock and shame people who think there may be more to the story than "random, purposeless murder of someone who has a connection to the biggest news story of the past year."
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wouldn't they want the public thinking about this? The way I see it, there are three possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Seth Rich was compromised by or working for the Russians. In this case, it could be the smoking gun that shows not only that the Russian interference went deeper than believed, but that they were willing to kill Americans to keep their story covered.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Seth Rich was killed in a random bout of gun violence for now apparent reason. In this case, a man who dedicated his life to voter expansion efforts and Democrat interests was yet another victim of senseless gun violence and shows the need (in their view) for stricter gun control policies. Especially in light of the potential looming impact of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller">
        DC v. Heller
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Seth Rich was involved somehow in releasing DNC information to Wikileaks. In this case, and only in this case, his death is something that raises serious questions the Democrats would not like explored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the silence?

       All of Trump's problems would go away if he could prove Seth Rich was the leaker and Russia didn't hack the DNC. Yet even he has acknowledged the DNC emails came from a Russian hack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the Russian story does threaten Trump's legitimacy as President, and he has done everything to undermine the investigation, including pressuring Comey to drop it and firing him after he refused.

       They are not both built completely on conjecture, nor is there absolutely zero evidence, pizzagate did not completely dominate the news cycle, and the Dems smear themselves by engaging in satanic sexual child abuse and killing Seth Rich and anyone else who takes a stand against they're corruption. You're argumentation is based solely on fallacious reasoning. Away with you!

       Hi dude, what's up? Just took a look at your profile and all you seem to do is attack people's posts without contributing anything of value to the conversation. I get that you have a lot of opposing views as people in this sub and that is ok. There are things that I hold as true that I often  find myself thinking are mental by my own admission and would expect that most rational people would too with out the context of what has lead me to believe what I do. Yet I wanted to reach out to you to see why you carry on this way. What do you think there is to be gained\ what difference do you think you are making by just saying there is no evidence? How is that constructive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I agree with you just because Podesta works for the Washington Post does not automatically discredit it, but in my oppion it is odd that they make the comparison at all. If the reaoning that you think they are basing this off of is that both stories have no evidence then way make connection with pg and not any other "debunked" conspiracy? Let's argue the points of the story at hand and not try and lead readers to make any ansumtions of a current story by saying it is simular to this other story in the sense that it is fake. Doesn't that seem a bit odd and sort of sounds like they want the reader to make that connection instead of presenting the reader with the information on this story and having the reader make the connection after they have had the chance to weigh the information presented?

       Hello sir! Hope your day is going well. Just wanted to say that I don't see Podesta being a high level player in the conspiracy realm. He's a dork. First, the Pizzagate stuff is, in all likelihood, just not a real thing. Then there is the email where he talks about punishing leakers. If you read the entire email in context, including the message that preceded it, it's clear he's talking about cutting off information to those who are leaking it. As in, if a campaign staffer leaks information, that person should be shunned. Taking words out of context can make them seem sinister. Right now, he's our most vocal proponent in the political circle in D.C. for UFO disclosure. Please stop burning that bridge.

       You should never presume guilt without evidence. Calm down, clear your head of pre-conceived ideas, and look again. You will not find a single piece of evidence that could convince any rational person of your beliefs. You've been had. Podesta is not a pedophile, or at least, we do not have any real evidence to back that assumption up. If you need a conspiracy to pin on the left, look into Michael Hastings' death.

       I already did that today though! Seriously, why are you so angry? If we ever want to be taken seriously by the public, we need to stop with the doxxing-witch hunt mentality. May I ask, what convinced you about Pizzagate that you aren't willing to look at again from a fresh perspective?

       Interesting distinction being drawn in the narrative today by blue teamers... Wheeler alleges that he has seen proof of Rich's communications with some member(s) of Wikileaks. Blue partisans are jumping all over the fact that Wheeler acknowledges no contact with the laptop (implying that this is a lie). Still, Wheeler is a private investigator (perhaps with the resources of a firm that has NSA level access), in which case he
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       have seen the emails. The only way to prove it, though, is if Wikileaks publishes their correspondence with Rich, or if Wheeler somehow publishes what he claims to have seen.

       Wasn't there a middle man between Wikileaks and Rich that "killed himself" shortly after Rich was killed? If no one else remembers I'll look it up.

      <p>
       Asking Wikileaks to affirm this is like asking someone to give up their life duty for one situation. They're a safe haven for whistleblowers all over the world, they can't compromise that otherwise there's no point for them to exist anymore.

       Let's assume the investigation is cold due to lack of evidence. How does throwing out wild accusations and speculations contribute in any way to the investigation or to solving the murder? It only adds confusion.

       Of course, if your goal isn't to clear anything up, but rather to muddy up the waters (disinformation), well then throwing out wild accusations/speculations Grade A Tripe.

       What? I can think of the San Bernardino shooters right off the top of my head. They used a third-party forensics company to hack the phone. They had to trust that third party didn't mess with the data since that third party had unfettered access to the phone. Investigators never obtained the data themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, that's actual hard evidence. You can choose to ignore it if you want, but at least it exists. Something that can't be said about the Seth Rich being the leaker accusations.

       , not to mention that the DNC refused the FBI access to their servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, CrowdStrike's DNC report has

       <a href="https://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2017/03/23/what-is-crowdstrike-firm-hired-by-dnc-has-ties-to-hillary-clinton-a-ukrainian-billionaire-and-google/">

       <p>
        Lol of course you lead with that. Too bad that CrowdStrike has been caught falsifying data on Russian hacking in Ukraine, not to mention that the DNC refused the FBI access to their servers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You can believe that they falsified shit, but that doesn't detract from the fact the the evidence actually exists. You merely believe it's fabricated based on zero evidence of your own. Even if they made a mistake before, that doesn't constitute evidence of them fabricating anything.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In addition, CrowdStrike's DNC report has come under serious fire because none of the data is conclusive to any Russian hacking.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Serious question: What
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       constitute "conclusive" evidence of Russian hacking? An intercepted letter from Putin himself describing the operation? That could be faked, too. So, what
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       constitute "conclusive" evidence?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also, the CTO of CrowdStrike, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a member of a very anti-Russian ThinkTank, the Atlantic Council, and has also donated $10 million to the Clinton Foundation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So what? How does this in any way imply that they would fabricate evidence in their investigations into their own leaks?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Guccifer is also a Romanian and has no ties to Russia.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So what?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So your entire hacking narrative is based on a company under fire for falsifying hacking data headed by a person who has financial ties with the Clintons. Not fishy at all right?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you owned a company that dealt with sensitive data, would you want the FBI poking around your computer systems? Do you trust the FBI that much? Why should the DNC? If you hired a security company to look into a recent hack, would you hire a security company that you know and trust? Or would you hire some random company/organization that you know nothing about, that may not have your best interests at heart?

       Yes, you're right, that's why they hired CrowdStrike, considering the co-founder has a marked anti-Russian bias and is a high-level donor to the very parties he is "investigating." You have to be beyond idiotic to think that there is not a significant bias there.

      <p>
       Alright buddy let me spoon feed you the information
       <em>
        I linked in my original post
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me start with CrowdStrike falsifying hacking in Ukraine:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        An influential British think tank and Ukraine’s military are disputing a report that the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has used to buttress its claims of Russian hacking in the presidential election.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CrowdStrike report, released in December, asserted that Russians hacked into a Ukrainian artillery app, resulting in heavy losses of howitzers in Ukraine’s war with Russian-backed separatists.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told VOA that CrowdStrike erroneously used IISS data as proof of the intrusion. IISS disavowed any connection to the CrowdStrike report. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense also has claimed combat losses and hacking never happened.
       </p>
       <p>
        The challenges to CrowdStrike’s credibility are significant because the firm was the first to link last year’s hacks of Democratic Party computers to Russian actors, and because CrowdStrike co-founder Dimiti Alperovitch has trumpeted its Ukraine report as more evidence of Russian election tampering.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Next, regarding the hacking "evidence" regarding the DNC. Please pay extra attention to the part I bolded:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The FBI/DHS Joint Analysis Report (JAR) “Grizzly Steppe” was released yesterday as part of the White House’s response to alleged Russian government interference in the 2016 election process. It adds nothing to the call for evidence that the Russian government was responsible for hacking the DNC, the DCCC, the email accounts of Democratic party officials, or for delivering the content of those hacks to Wikileaks.
       </p>
       <p>
        It merely listed every threat group ever reported on by a commercial cybersecurity company that is suspected of being Russian-made and lumped them under the heading of Russian Intelligence Services (RIS) without providing any supporting evidence that such a connection exists.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike Crowdstrike, ESET doesn’t assign APT28/Fancy Bear/Sednit to a Russian Intelligence Service or anyone else for a very simple reason.
        <strong>
         Once malware is deployed, it is no longer under the control of the hacker who deployed it or the developer who created it. It can be reverse-engineered, copied, modified, shared and redeployed again and again by anyone.
        </strong>
        In other words — malware deployed is malware enjoyed!
       </p>
       <p>
        If ESET could do it, so can others. It is both foolish and baseless to claim, as Crowdstrike does, that X-Agent is used solely by the Russian government when the source code is there for anyone to find and use at will.
       </p>

       Are you serious? You didn't offer any evidence that they faked the malware. None at all. Saying they made mistakes/detractions before doesn't prove they are faking the malware in the DNC leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are simply questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the evidence they faked the DNC hacking evidence? No, making mistakes before doesn't mean they faked the DNC hacking evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence, in your opinion,
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       "conclusively" prove that Russia was behind the attack?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That is beside the point
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No it's not. You want the DNC to open up their computer systems to the world, when opening it up to a security firm they trust is the same action
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       else would have done.

      <p>
       Ok, let me illustrate an example for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say someone was murdered in your house, and the murder weapon (your kitchen knife) had your fingerprints on it. This is concrete evidence that you are the murderer, but it is still circumstantial.
       <strong>
        Anybody could have used your kitchen knife
       </strong>
       . And since it already has your fingerprints, it is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       conclusive evidence that you were the murderer. We need to look at motive, ability, opportunity, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, Russia's fingerprints don't mean that they were the hackers, but they had the motives, abilities, opportunities, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the conclusions they reached (
       <strong>
        which could be wrong
       </strong>
       ), but there is no evidence at all that they faked the malware. That means that it's up to you to either believe the evidence reaches a threshold or not.
       <strong>
        My point is that the evidence actually exists
       </strong>
       . It's concrete/hard evidence that can be analyzed. It my not be definitive "proof", but virtually nothing is, unless Putin admits to it himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Seth Rich/leaker accusations lack any and all hard evidence
       </strong>
       . At this point, it's about weighing out which has stronger evidence and what are the most likely possibilities.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I never said they faked the DNC evidence, I said they faked the Ukraine hacking evidence. Multiple security firms have called them out on their bullshit, which you would know if you actually read the damn articles.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I read the article you linked that makes the original claims. It says "erroneously" "misread" the data. Where does it say they faked it?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      <p>
       Please give an example. We could have video footage of Putin himself ordering the hacking, but you could claim that that could be "faked", too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What is an actual example of evidence you would accept as conclusively proving Russia's involvement in the hacking?
       </strong>
       What evidence cannot be "faked"? What security firms, specifically, should have been entrusted instead?

      <p>
       This analogy does not fit this scenario at all. In our case these fingerprints can be faked, as the Vault 7 leaks illustrated. If they can be faked, then that means they cannot be used as evidence to pin you for the murder. The knife is also not a good analogy. Let me give you my own analogy that would fit this situation better:
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say that the murder weapon used was a pistol originally manufactured in Russia. However, it is known that the blueprints of this weapon have been leaked to the world before. So any part can manufacture, modify, and use this weapon and make it look like it was the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is where we are at: both the murder weapon AND the finger prints can be modified by ANY party to attribute it to someone else. And that is all the evidence we have. Therefore the current evidence CAN NOT be attributed to a sole party. You would need DIRECT LINKS of Russian officials carrying out the murder in the form of camera feeds, internal documents, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
       I do not have extensive experience in hacking to really give you a good answer on this. I simply know that the current evidence is not nearly enough to attribute to one party, the Russians. Someone more knowledgeable who is reading this, please chip in. I don't like to speculate without basis, I hope you understand.

      <p>
       You are correct, it's all circumstantial. But the circumstantial evidence is significant in this case. Seth was shot twice in the back without anything stolen from him. Wikileaks offered $20k to people who can get information regarding his murder. The DC police, who have been known to be comprimised already, have found no leads to the murder. In addition, they have confiscated his laptop, which MAKES NO SENSE for a supposed "botched robbery." In addition, all of the statements from the family actually come from a professional PR spokeperson from the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I'd like to remind you the the DNC members came out after the leaks and vehemently denied the emails being true, despite them being DKIM verified. The emails showed the corruption, hypocrisy, and arrogance of all of the parties involved.

       Doesn't point to him being a leaker though. In fact, I'm not sure this points to anything at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a simple possibility: There were 2 robbers, Seth fought back (signs of struggle per his family), while entangled with one of the perps, the other one shoots him twice in the back. They flee in a panic leaving him alive, breathing, and conscious.

       This doesn't point to him being a leaker, though. Not every murder case is easily solvable.

      <p>
       Well, Seth Rich
       <strong>
        worked for the DNC
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, you ignore that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         He had no motive
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He had no computer science/hacking background
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He had no direct access to all those emails without said background
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So, do you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       think the admittedly circumstantial evidence is stronger that Seth Rich was the leaker?

       Just gonna chime in here with some relevant experience I have working for the criminal justice world. If the case is truly cold, then it's not hindering the case by talking about a speculative reason he was gunned down. A cold case implies it has no movement. Therefore, nothing is being slowed down, or made unclear, just because the public has some ideas. Law enforcement is used to the public coming up with theories for high profile cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, law enforcement doesn't get "confused" or anything with people talking about the case. So don't talk shit as if you understand how investigators actually do their work, because it's clear you don't. Along with most people tbh.

       hinder real investigations by diverting resources (e.g. pizzagate shooter, having to answer and deal with the volume of calls from internet armchair detectives, having to deal with the press, etc). Do you really think these wild speculations have zero ramifications?

       Logic is that the dnc is run using organized crime tactics. This includes bribery, corruption, but it also includes when bribery corruption or blackmail don't work then violence is used to enforce your will. This is how th emafia. The project veritas videos show you exactly how the dnc employs a win at all costs attitude. Now we not only brushed and bleeding event attendees, we have organized and armed riots to intimidate the public, and we have the murder of Seth rich. The clinton body count is enough to bring them All in for questioning!

       actually conspiring about Seth Rich.  Give it a rest.  You are not going to win this argument YOU brought up to a pool of conspiracy theorists trying to make sense of the death of someone that was close to the DNC.   Seth Rich's death is definitely odd and if you are not willing to admit that, even on the surface, it
       <em>
        looks
       </em>
       weird, then there is no hope for you so don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out....

Then click the shutdown button on your computer and go outside where it's likely pretty nice outside.  Take some deep breaths and do something positive.  Maybe pull some weeds in the yard or wash a car.  Maybe you live in NY where you don't have a lawn or a car so if that is the case, hop on the D train and go to Coney Island and buy something cheap and have a laugh. Maybe if you smoke weed, try getting high first and it will make things even better.

       Look one of two realities exist. Either Seth Rich died of a robbery gone wrong, or it's something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of now the official story is that it was a robbery gone wrong. If that reality is the truth, then this truly is a cold case and it'll likely never ever be solved. No amount of public opinion on the matter would solve that case regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes I do believe that wild speculations aren't hindering any investigation of Seth Rich. Police and Federal agencies have publicity folks, those who handle the tip lines, and others so they can receive public sentiment and evidence, without hindering the actual investigators. Yes I know how this work. The main investigator(s) doesn't take every single call personally from the press or public. In fact, chances are they don't take any calls, and instead rely on the
       <strong>
        team
       </strong>
       that is built for handling popular cases like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was the something else, then we still haven't discovered exactly what it was. Though most people are speculating it was the WikiLeaks connection based on surround evidence. Nothing concrete but some speculation of surroundings could lead someone to that conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the WikiLeaks reality is the truth, then all this speculation is
       <strong>
        helping
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And who gives a fuck if a conspiracy theory
       <em>
        "confuses"
       </em>
       the public. That's not muddying the waters but trying to have a discussion about possibilities. The public doesn't need to be highly informed like an investigator does, so it doesn't matter if this is confusing for some people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just to cover my bases. The pizzagate shooter in no way, shape, or form, hinders the Seth Rich investigation. Field officers (not investigators) and dispatch would be the ones who respond to something like that. Those resources are meant to be used in that manner so it's not a waste to have a field officer come and arrest someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I hate when people talk like they know a subject, and then inject their own bias and opinions and lack of situational knowledge, into said subject. It's obvious you have a civilian's understanding of the criminal justice world and aren't actually involved in it day to day. Seriously, stop talking like you're an authority on the subject of how investigations get handled. It's obvious you aren't.

       I only came up with two because that's the debate here... obviously it could be something else beyond what we are discussing, but why waste time coming up with ideas and theories besides the one that's being discussed currently. It could have been a guy high on meth and acting violently. It could have been a jealous ex lover. It could have been
       <strong>
        anything
       </strong>
       because we don't know yet. However the two leading ideas (based on whatever little evidence exists) are the WikiLeaks and robbery narratives. So STFU and stop trying to play "got ya" as that doesn't make you more credible. You just seem sad and petty at this point. You can't even admit you're perhaps wrong and don't have a true understanding of how investigators do their job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want a list of companies and government agencies I work with in the criminal justice world? Look you probably have a job in an industry that's different from mine. If I came on reddit and started talking like I was knowledgeable or an authority on whatever it is that you're very familiar with, then you'd be annoyed by the armchair analyst who doesn't know shit and it'd be obvious to you that I wasn't knowledgeable.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have an idea of how police resources are "used" but it's clear to me that you don't understand the reality of how a modern police agency operates. You have a very Hollywood understanding of it, as I'm guessing most of your exposure in your life to criminal justice has been through TV and Movies. For me, it's my day to day job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I misunderstood why you originally referenced the pizzagate shooter. I thought you were trying to link it to Seth in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       What magical "logic" do you have here that I'm not seeing? Your argument is based off your own ignorance of the very subject of police investigations and the teams that are around the investigators to support them. Do you really think you ought to be spreading your idea of how investigations work, when you honestly don't have a clue?

       I'm glad you're not arguing that anymore because it's obvious you never had a real solid argument to begin with. Hence, I called you out on your bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'm not accusing you of being a
       <em>
        bad investigator
       </em>
       or something. I'm was purely arguing that you don't understand how investigations are ran from day one, until they day the case is closed and everything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not hear to argue that citizen investigations are useful or not, but to take you down a peg and get you off your high horse of "I know everything".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not here to give one side more or less credibility because the truth is
       <strong>
        I don't know
       </strong>
       the truth of what happened to Seth. I'm not afraid to admit what I don't know. You should do the same in the future and don't talk about subjects like you're an authority on it, without the prerequisite knowledge required.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want the truth of the case to come out so Seth can get the justice he deserves. If it's just a thief, then great, we caught the bastard. If it's a collusion or something bigger, then let's get to the bottom of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I don't call everyone out on their bullshit because I'm not an expert in everything to be able to call out the many "dumb" people I see here.

       The rampant allegations/speculations directly and negatively affected a real life investigation. An innocent person's life might not have been taken if it weren't for anonymous internet vigilante "investigators" making wild accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are trying to make me believe that they will definitely not negatively affect an investigation when there's examples of it happening before. I don't need your validation to understand that these people can negatively affect real world investigations. It doesn't matter where you work.

       Everything out of your mouth is bullshit in these comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your example proves that mob mentality can hurt an
       <strong>
        individual
       </strong>
       , but did nothing to prove that public speculation hurts
       <strong>

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what would I call out the Seth Rich and PG investigators for? For "bullshit"? Read my comment again dimwit. I'm saying I don't call them out because I don't have an authority or knowledge of the subject. I don't know more about PG and it's related subjects than the investigators who are involved. So why argue with them when I have less information and knowledge than they do? So I can be like you and publicly display my ignorance?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could tell them I disagree with their analysis on something, but I don't have proof or anything that could straight up prove them wrong. The difference between us is you're full of yourself and think you know everything there is to know, and everyone else must be wrong. I have a realistic world view that says I don't know everything, but I sure as fuck know more than you about what is actually detrimental to a murder investigation and what isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honest question, do you genuinely believe that your armchair analysis of how criminal investigations are carried is more truthful and knowledgeable than someone who works with law enforcement 5 days a week? Like do you honestly believe that you know more than anyone here about how this shit actually works?

       You're right, had the FBI kept their faces hidden, we would've caught the bombers and had a successful investigation! Oh wait they caught them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple terms. FBI likes to keep mass murderers faces hidden until their caught so as not to create sympathy for them. However, other individuals that weren't the bombers were being targeted by the public. To help those individuals from being harassed, or worse, they released the photos early. No where in your quote does it say the FBI had a more difficult time because they had to release the photos early.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk why we are arguing the Boston marathon bombing though. This argument is about Seth so let's jump back to there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Seth Rich case is different than the Boston case obviously, so the police response isn't going to be identical.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Seth's case it's either a cold case at this point, or something else. If it's a cold case then this public speculation
       <strong>
        has no real effect on the case since the case isn't going anywhere anyways.
       </strong>
       If it isn't a cold case, then either the WikiLeaks and Seth Rich people are right, or the investigation is something else entirely and being kept hidden from all of us, in which point they would be ignoring any WikiLeaks related stuff anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       So which is it of those? Is it a cold case? Is it something else entirely that is so secret that the FBI and D.C. Police have said nothing, or is it the WikiLeaks thing? Idk which it is, I'm not advocating for one over the other. I'm simply saying that at this point, public speculation isn't going to hurt the case nor hinder investigators. Do you have something to back up your claim that this does impact the current investigation? Don't try and reference a different case, keep it about Seth because that's the debate and this is derailed enough as it is.

       They released the pictures early. They wouldn't have because they didn't want the suspects to flee. They were trying to pinpoint their location. The fact that they released it early might have caused the resulting police chase, which resulted in an innocent person getting killed. The
       <strong>
        investigation
       </strong>
       isn't just to ID people. It's to find them. It's to avoid messy confrontations. It's more than just ID. You're just being obtuse because you tried to call me out on bullshit and you were wrong.

      <p>
       Guess what? I don't know if it's hurting this one (not yet at least), but I do know that it
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       hurt investigations, and you've provided absolutely no evidence to prove that it doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at the original comment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You would think they would be wanting to help solve his murder since Seth was one of their own
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I simply proposed that the reason people don't wildly speculate and accuse is because it can hurt investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you or do you not agree with this statement?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say, "Well
       <strong>
        IF
       </strong>
       it's a cold case, it's not hurting it", but that doesn't address the original post nor propose any evidence whatsoever that the case really is cold. You're merely being contrarian, and when I showed you a real life example of an investigation being affected, you move the goalpost.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll just state this one more time in an attempt to get this through your thick skull:
      </p>
      <h1>
       Just because we don't throw out wild accusations, doesn't mean we don't want the murder to be solved. In fact, throwing out wild accusations/speculations can HURT a real investigation. The exact opposite of what "we're" being accused of. Not throwing wild accusations/speculations does not make me a shill.
      </h1>
      <p>
       If you disagree with this, then we've reached an impasse. If you agree, then what's the fucking problem?

       I conceded on the Boston argument, not as a way for you to say "See I'm right!" but as a way to get you back on topic. I thought my thick sarcasm would've been obvious in that post.
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument has been about the Seth Rich investigation; you're the one who is trying to talk about other cases as if they are relevant. My argument is still the same; I don't think public speculation into a possible Seth Rich and Wikileaks connection hurts the current "official" investigation going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's go back here. I called you out because of your lack of knowledge regarding how investigators handle high profile cases. According to you, this would distract from the investigation and then cause issues because now it's a distraction and hindering the investigation. I was arguing that given the circumstances and complete lack of any recent news in the investigation, that it wouldn't cause harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you say I've provided no evidence... on the contrary, I've told you some of what an investigation is like for high profile cases. I can't provide a nice typed up document by the lead investigator saying it doesn't hurt, but what I can say is from my previous experience on how detectives I have
       <strong>
        worked with
       </strong>
       have no issue with people speculating about cold cases. In fact, public speculation is what keeps cold cases active a good chunk of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the burden of proof is on you dude. If you're so worried about this hurting the investigation that you try to shut down any talk about it, then show us the evidence you have that is making you so anxious. If you have no evidence that speculating about Seth and WL is hurting the investigation, then why are you claiming it does?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Because you're an armchair criminal justice lawyer apparently
       </strong>
       . You're trying to say that a different type of public speculation is the same as a mob witch hunt. (note, the Boston "mob hunt" for an active terrorist is different than a popular online theory that SR leaked emails to WL and was killed for it)
      </p>
      <h1>
       I was correcting you in the beginning, and arguing with your dumbass, that this type of speculation has no bearing or effect on a case that hasn't had any official progress in a long time; given my experience in criminal justice and having had worked with detectives and case files. Also, you can't compare two cases and two different types of public interaction and call it a tie. Different cases, different police force, different crimes, different victims, different public reaction, and a significant difference in the public involvement. This is why I'm calling you a casual viewer of the criminal justice world. You think you understand, but you really are lacking the understanding of the differences of the two you're trying to compare. It's apples and oranges.
      </h1>
      <p>
       Let's keep yelling! /s
      </p>
      <p>
       I never once called you a shill and don't believe that you are one. I just think you think too highly of yourself and believe that you know a lot more than you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, read my comments again you illiterate fuck face. I never was making a
       <strong>
        blanket statement
       </strong>
       that the public being involved in an investigation could hinder it. My argument is purely the Seth Rich murder case and has nothing to do with any other cases. Read my comments again if you really think I'm trying to apply this general argument to every single nuanced case in the world. I didn't change my argument, you just lack basic comprehension.

       The public need to be highly informed. That is the only way to hold these elites accountable. The D.C. Police have an atrocious record and have lost the publics trust. Just look up what happened to the missing D.C. Girls. 
The police want no one watching what they do because they do not want to be accountable. This is not a political game where they are going to pay back the favor of being hired by the democratic mayor or democratic police chief. This time they are going to have to the public and sunlight is the best disinfectant of corruption!

       Sorry my point wasn't that the public
       <strong>
        should
       </strong>
       be confused or left in the dark. I was stating that an investigator doing his or her job doesn't rely on  public knowledge and sentiment. The public can have no clue as to what is going on, and be confused, but that doesn't change the day to day job of an investigator. That was simply my point. That it doesn't matter if the Seth Rich and possible WikiLeaks connection confuses people or the public. Either way the job of the investigator is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideally the public is aware and knowledgeable about most, if not all, things regarding corruption, investigations, and our law enforcement. And ideally we find the truth of all this craziness going on on D.C.

       The public aren't investigating the case, they should be responsible enough on their own. We shouldn't need to avoid confusing them, because usually they aren't really the brightest. We are all part of the public anyway.

       It does help in the same way passing out missing flyers help drive support and demand for justice. We can choose to hold water for any case we see fit, and not just the 'important' ones that the news tells us to care about.

       This is not about the public. This is about justice. The only people who care about public perception are the murdering conspirators: the dnc. Who stopped at nothing to win the election. They cheated in the primaries, they cheated in the debates, they hired violent individuals to attack trump supporters, Obama met with a convicted felon bob creamer almost monthly during the election. If you think the kind of people who break the law so blatantly draw the line at murder think again. They sanctioned violent crime against innocent and unarmed people! This is a level of evil that will murder for their own advancement!

       All you can do for a cold case is collect evidence and give it to the police department. You have to convince them that the case isn't cold, and if you're lucky they will actually listen and set up a new detective to rework the case. Most of the time they will tell you it is pointless and that there is nothing they can do, kinda like what you're saying.

       There was a ton of local coverage before Wikileaks offered the reward money.  Before Wikileaks, they blamed poor lighting as a contributing factor to this "random murder/robbery" and got pepco or whoever was doing work in the area to put in some temporary lighting.  Then Wikileaks stepped in with the money and suddenly everyone felt safe again because the murder no longer looked random.  Maybe Julian is a real estate investor in Bloomingdale?

       lol.. And here come the shill accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if you ever ask this about the people pushing the Seth Rich/leaker narrative. Fake news sites need views, just like the MSM. Steve Bannon of Breitbart is the President's right hand man for God's sake. Breitbart is also conveniently pushing the narrative. Is it not possible that there are "shills"
       <em>
        pushing
       </em>
       the narrative? Why do you only accuse the people who disagree with you as being shills?

       I'm not in this thread to talk about Bannon or Breitbart. I'm here to talk about Seth Rich and what happened to him. If you think they're connected then by all means discuss it. But from my perspective you're nothing but a shill trying to derail a conservation about Seth Rich. Everybody knows there are a million places here on Reddit to talk bout the Russians and Bannon and all that crap. Why don't you go there?

       You guys fear alternative means of getting info, so you develop the fake news propaganda. You use as examples clickbait websites and other things that have existed on the internet for many years, tied with the Russian narrative, and then throw around "fake news". WaPo even brought in the disturbing "prop or not" group to try and "sniff out Russian propaganda", and had to pull back embarrassingly when they were getting a back lash about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys attack elite pedophilia and say it does not exist, and yet events like the franklin cover-up and the dutroux affair clearly show it exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see anything that is against your point of view as a Russian attack, thereby shrouding the arguments of your opponents in a veil of treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do all of this with the support of the major players in government, intelligence, and MSM on your side... Do you ever feel that maybe you are a stooge for corporate elites? I know Trump is a stooge, but right now he is a stooge that the elites hate. Why are you on the side of the plutocrats? Why are you such a blind conformist to a reprehensible system?

       Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of Crowdstrike is a Russian expat, and hates Putin. Crowdstrike is the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       organziation that was allowed in the DNC servers. Every single "report" by other organziations and government agencies were based on the data Crowdstrike provided to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI didn't even do an independent analysis. They relied on Crowdstrike's data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crowdstrike was
       <em>
        hired
       </em>
       by the DNC to do an "investigation."
      </p>
      <p>
       And Grizzly Steppe is Ukrainian, not Russian, any competent investigator would know that. But Crowdstrike's report went ahead and said it was Russian malware.

       Well, speculation is kind of the point of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       But people who come in here deflecting and arguing with speculation by referring to speculation they think is irrefutable evidence get downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some more speculation. I honestly think there are Russian ties to Trump's team. Podesta knew that, and when the leaks happened and it was pretty clear that HillCo was doomed, I think Podesta et al immediately started framing the Russian argument and set it in motion with Crowdstrike's help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting hacked by Russia, with whom Trump has ties, is a much better story than having your internal collusion dumped on the web by a disgruntled staffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody here, especially me, has all the information. We only know little parts of a bigger story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our goal here is to try to put it all together, and that requires a great deal of speculation.

       Plus it is an unwritten understanding here that any narrative the msm pushes, relentlessly, without evidence is certainly not to be trusted.  So, by analyzing behavior response.  If CNN, wapo, etc demonize a working theory of investigation that has tons of circumstantial evidence (rich, pizza, etc) while simultaneously pushing the Russian hack narrative without any evidence... Its almost a given this community will embrace the former over the latter.  Thusly, anyone defending the opinions of CNN over anything else is is suspicious right out of the gate.

       And fairly, I don't believe that anyone here defending mainstream opinion is necessarily a "shill," they are just here defending what they believe, and using their evidence to support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are shills, but there are also people who find it amusing that they are called shills just for posting and defending what they believe is "popular opinion," and that drives them to keep posting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And anyone coming in here with a bias that the majority of folks who regularly post here in support of conspiracy are "crazy" are going to leave further inspired in their own belief, because confirmation bias is tough nugget to crack.

       what you call wild accusations are actually theories grounded in circumstantial evidence. If the police would do their job and expose the killers and question podesta about his email that demanded an example of the leaker then maybe there would be an investigation. Theories are part of an investigation. They do not hinder an investigation.

       What is not funny is there is a pattern of whistleblowers who are intimidated and threatened to enforce silence. There is a climate of fear and criminals who are walking free as we speak because too many whistleblowers have been murdered, jailed, and threatened. This is not funny but tragic.

       I think their angle is the family really wants you to stop with baseless claims absent any evidence. The main guy who claimed to have evidence had to retract it because he said he heard it on fox news and just assumed they had evidence. The reporter in question then went on to say it was an anonymous claim that she couldn't verify.

       They'd still have an awful lot of complaining to do. Missing body cam footage, no belongings missing, first murder in that specific area since 2009.

       When they pull a culprit out of their head the only thing they do is prove that everything is bullshit.

       people demanding answers to unsolved deaths even years later is pretty standard in unsolved death situations.

       people hypothesizing that an unsolved death that looks fishy is fishy is also pretty standard.

       I guarantee this is a strategy right out of a playbook to defuse focus on the issue.   It makes me want to know the truth even more.   Are their paid organizations trying to side track conversations on these issues?   i dont get it.

       This entire thread has been completely hijacked by shills. I'm starting to think there are three or more users in here that could be the same person on multiple accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at their account history, all they do is stick around
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and try to derail and disprove certain topics. Another trend I've noticed is they tend to hide their vote counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for open discussion of ideas here, nobody wants an echo chamber. But this is targeted opposition to specific topics while somehow pushing the Russian narrative in threads that have nothing to do with it.

       That is exactly why I said 4 months ago to stop pushing and shilling the whole pizza pedo thing. The 'evidence' was shaky at best and though there were a lot of odd coincidences and circumstantial factors; it was never serious. This sub and others totally discredited themselves by pushing a literally half baked theory and now when there is actual evidence they can say here they go again... good job guys! (whether or not pedo thing is true is one thing but has not even been close to being proven so the fact that it was pushed so hard is ridiculous. I said at the time i thought it was a total shill operation to make free thinkers look crazy. )

       Some of us had fucked up childhoods involving Skippy peanut butter. So if getting the idea from your personal experience with being molested is considered 'projecting'.... Then yeah. Not all of us grew up with lollipops and sunshine.

       Let's step back for a second, how much overlap is there between the groups invested in Seth Rich and PizzaGate? Whether you think there is meat on the bones of these theories or not, there are certainly similarities.

       The great thing about these dirrea posts is that the volume and fragmentary style makes them impossible to respond to, even though each individual element evaporates under critical analysis. In your haste to create a flood, you don't even bother to differentiate between the different people you are accusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask any pizzagater what they believe to be the 3 most convincing pieces of evidence. Most don't bother to respond, because on an intuitive level they understand that no individual data point holds up under analysis. (Caveat: the handkerchief with pizza related map email is certainly suspicious, but drugs/hookers is a much more parsimonious read. The pedo code thing from 4chan is ridiculous to anyone who thinks on it for a second.)

       I assume you're a shill, it's beyond deniable, it's like Savile all over again. Your brain can't accept it because you don't want to. Alefantis visited the White House, goes on foreign trips to Cuba, has pedophilic social media where he posted #hotard on a child photo. His charming IG friends have child coffins and pictures of dolls as "art". 
The only way to ignore the fact that Podesta and Alefantis are elite pedophiles is to ON PURPOSE ignore the totality of what was revealed. If you focus in on irrelevant details and focus on explaining them away (that is what you're doing make no mistake) one by one without weighing them together, you're not being intellectually rigorous. You're being a jackass. Or an adorable little#hotard or something

       Look one of two realities exist. Either Seth Rich died of a robbery gone wrong, or it's something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of now the official story is that it was a robbery gone wrong. If that reality is the truth, then this truly is a cold case and it'll likely never ever be solved. No amount of public opinion on the matter would solve that case regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes I do believe that wild speculations aren't hindering any investigation of Seth Rich. Police and Federal agencies have publicity folks, those who handle the tip lines, and others so they can receive public sentiment and evidence, without hindering the actual investigators. Yes I know how this work. The main investigator(s) doesn't take every single call personally from the press or public. In fact, chances are they don't take any calls, and instead rely on the
       <strong>
        team
       </strong>
       that is built for handling popular cases like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was the something else, then we still haven't discovered exactly what it was. Though most people are speculating it was the WikiLeaks connection based on surround evidence. Nothing concrete but some speculation of surroundings could lead someone to that conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the WikiLeaks reality is the truth, then all this speculation is
       <strong>
        helping
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And who gives a fuck if a conspiracy theory
       <em>
        "confuses"
       </em>
       the public. That's not muddying the waters but trying to have a discussion about possibilities. The public doesn't need to be highly informed like an investigator does, so it doesn't matter if this is confusing for some people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just to cover my bases. The pizzagate shooter in no way, shape, or form, hinders the Seth Rich investigation. Field officers (not investigators) and dispatch would be the ones who respond to something like that. Those resources are meant to be used in that manner so it's not a waste to have a field officer come and arrest someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I hate when people talk like they know a subject, and then inject their own bias and opinions and lack of situational knowledge, into said subject. It's obvious you have a civilian's understanding of the criminal justice world and aren't actually involved in it day to day. Seriously, stop talking like you're an authority on the subject of how investigations get handled. It's obvious you aren't.

       The public aren't investigating the case, they should be responsible enough on their own. We shouldn't need to avoid confusing them, because usually they aren't really the brightest. We are all part of the public anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does help in the same way passing out missing flyers help drive support and demand for justice. We can choose to hold water for any case we see fit, and not just the 'important' ones that the news tells us to care about.

       I already did that today though! Seriously, why are you so angry? If we ever want to be taken seriously by the public, we need to stop with the doxxing-witch hunt mentality. May I ask, what convinced you about Pizzagate that you aren't willing to look at again from a fresh perspective?

       This is not about the public. This is about justice. The only people who care about public perception are the murdering conspirators: the dnc. Who stopped at nothing to win the election. They cheated in the primaries, they cheated in the debates, they hired violent individuals to attack trump supporters, Obama met with a convicted felon bob creamer almost monthly during the election. If you think the kind of people who break the law so blatantly draw the line at murder think again. They sanctioned violent crime against innocent and unarmed people! This is a level of evil that will murder for their own advancement!

        One of the most interesting details from the Washington Post's steller tick-tock of the F.B.I. investigation into the Boston Marathon bombings has to be the reason they decided to release the photos of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev: to fend off Reddit and the New York Post.

       Their investigation was directly affected. They released those pictures early because of the rampant speculation.

       They wouldn't have done it if it weren't for the rampant speculation.

       They released the pictures early. They wouldn't have because they didn't want the suspects to flee. They were trying to pinpoint their location. The fact that they released it early might have caused the resulting police chase, which resulted in an innocent person getting killed. The
       <strong>
        investigation
       </strong>
       isn't just to ID people. It's to find them. It's to avoid messy confrontations. It's more than just ID. You're just being obtuse because you tried to call me out on bullshit and you were wrong.
