<p>I remember the same wording used, verbatim for the Buzzfeed coverage of the &quot;Pizzagate Shooter&quot;..</p>

<p>They know exactly what sentiments are being invoked when they use connotations like that.

    <div class="md"><p>This is the thing that doesn&#39;t make sense to me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The story is that the DNC was hacked by Russians. </p></li>
<li><p>The Voter Expansion Data Director of the DNC was a man named Seth Rich. Seth Rich was slated to begin working for the Clinton campaign (by multiple reports, through I don&#39;t believe this to be an essential piece of the story).</p></li>
<li><p>Mere days before the DNC Wikileaks releases, Seth Rich was gunned down in a nice neighborhood of NW Washington DC. There is no known motive for the murder, and nothing appeared to be taken from Rich.</p></li>
<li><p>There has been zero information released to the public of any progress in any (if any) ongoing investigations into his murder.</p></li>
<li><p>The Democrats have been aggressive in using victims of gun violence to push their anti-gun agenda (it&#39;s their policy, I don&#39;t mean that dismissively) in the news. Yet RIch&#39;s death has been largely ignored by the Democratic establishment.</p></li>
<li><p>The Democrats, along with Democrat-friendly media outlets (just being real here - some outlets are Republican-friendly, some are Dem-friendly) have been heavily pushing the story of the Trump campaign having some sort of insidious connection to the Russian government, <em>including</em> the potential for collusion to damage Clinton in the election.</p></li>
<li><p>Democrats and Democrat-friendly media outlets have been pushing any potential damaging stories about alleged Trump-Russia connections, but have have seemingly not considered the fact that this completely random murder (not robbery, just murder) of someone who had access to DNC computer databases may be related to the hacks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My own opinions notwithstanding, it doesn&#39;t make any sense for the Democrats and the media looking into the Trump-Russia allegations to ignore the Seth Rich story. In fact, the only time they bring it up is to mock and shame people who think there may be more to the story than &quot;random, purposeless murder of someone who has a connection to the biggest news story of the past year.&quot;</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they want the public thinking about this? The way I see it, there are three possibilities.</p>

<p>1) Seth Rich was compromised by or working for the Russians. In this case, it could be the smoking gun that shows not only that the Russian interference went deeper than believed, but that they were willing to kill Americans to keep their story covered.</p>

<p>2) Seth Rich was killed in a random bout of gun violence for now apparent reason. In this case, a man who dedicated his life to voter expansion efforts and Democrat interests was yet another victim of senseless gun violence and shows the need (in their view) for stricter gun control policies. Especially in light of the potential looming impact of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller">DC v. Heller</a></p>

<p>3) Seth Rich was involved somehow in releasing DNC information to Wikileaks. In this case, and only in this case, his death is something that raises serious questions the Democrats would not like explored.</p>

<p>Why the silence?</p>

<p>All of Trump&#39;s problems would go away if he could prove Seth Rich was the leaker and Russia didn&#39;t hack the DNC. Yet even he has acknowledged the DNC emails came from a Russian hack. </p>

<p>Also, the Russian story does threaten Trump&#39;s legitimacy as President, and he has done everything to undermine the investigation, including pressuring Comey to drop it and firing him after he refused. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi dude, what&#39;s up? Just took a look at your profile and all you seem to do is attack people&#39;s posts without contributing anything of value to the conversation. I get that you have a lot of opposing views as people in this sub and that is ok. There are things that I hold as true that I often  find myself thinking are mental by my own admission and would expect that most rational people would too with out the context of what has lead me to believe what I do. Yet I wanted to reach out to you to see why you carry on this way. What do you think there is to be gained\ what difference do you think you are making by just saying there is no evidence? How is that constructive?</p>

<p>Now I agree with you just because Podesta works for the Washington Post does not automatically discredit it, but in my oppion it is odd that they make the comparison at all. If the reaoning that you think they are basing this off of is that both stories have no evidence then way make connection with pg and not any other &quot;debunked&quot; conspiracy? Let&#39;s argue the points of the story at hand and not try and lead readers to make any ansumtions of a current story by saying it is simular to this other story in the sense that it is fake. Doesn&#39;t that seem a bit odd and sort of sounds like they want the reader to make that connection instead of presenting the reader with the information on this story and having the reader make the connection after they have had the chance to weigh the information presented?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello sir! Hope your day is going well. Just wanted to say that I don&#39;t see Podesta being a high level player in the conspiracy realm. He&#39;s a dork. First, the Pizzagate stuff is, in all likelihood, just not a real thing. Then there is the email where he talks about punishing leakers. If you read the entire email in context, including the message that preceded it, it&#39;s clear he&#39;s talking about cutting off information to those who are leaking it. As in, if a campaign staffer leaks information, that person should be shunned. Taking words out of context can make them seem sinister. Right now, he&#39;s our most vocal proponent in the political circle in D.C. for UFO disclosure. Please stop burning that bridge. </p>

You will not find a single piece of evidence that could convince any rational person of your beliefs. You&#39;ve been had.

Wheeler alleges that he has seen proof of Rich&#39;s communications with some member(s) of Wikileaks. Blue partisans are jumping all over the fact that Wheeler acknowledges no contact with the laptop (implying that this is a lie). Still, Wheeler is a private investigator (perhaps with the resources of a firm that has NSA level access), in which case he <em>could</em> have seen the emails. The only way to prove it, though, is if Wikileaks publishes their correspondence with Rich, or if Wheeler somehow publishes what he claims to have seen.</p>

<p>Also, the CTO of CrowdStrike, Dmitri Alperovitch, <a href="https://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2017/03/23/what-is-crowdstrike-firm-hired-by-dnc-has-ties-to-hillary-clinton-a-ukrainian-billionaire-and-google/">is a member of a very anti-Russian ThinkTank, the Atlantic Council, and has also donated $10 million to the Clinton Foundation.</a>.

<p>Serious question: What <em>would</em> constitute &quot;conclusive&quot; evidence of Russian hacking? An intercepted letter from Putin himself describing the operation? That could be faked, too. So, what <em>would</em> constitute &quot;conclusive&quot; evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright buddy let me spoon feed you the information <em>I linked in my original post</em>.</p>

<p>Let me start with CrowdStrike falsifying hacking in Ukraine: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>An influential British think tank and Ukraine’s military are disputing a report that the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has used to buttress its claims of Russian hacking in the presidential election.</p>

<p>The CrowdStrike report, released in December, asserted that Russians hacked into a Ukrainian artillery app, resulting in heavy losses of howitzers in Ukraine’s war with Russian-backed separatists.</p>

<p>But the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told VOA that CrowdStrike erroneously used IISS data as proof of the intrusion. IISS disavowed any connection to the CrowdStrike report. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense also has claimed combat losses and hacking never happened.</p>

<p>The challenges to CrowdStrike’s credibility are significant because the firm was the first to link last year’s hacks of Democratic Party computers to Russian actors, and because CrowdStrike co-founder Dimiti Alperovitch has trumpeted its Ukraine report as more evidence of Russian election tampering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, regarding the hacking &quot;evidence&quot; regarding the DNC. Please pay extra attention to the part I bolded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI/DHS Joint Analysis Report (JAR) “Grizzly Steppe” was released yesterday as part of the White House’s response to alleged Russian government interference in the 2016 election process. It adds nothing to the call for evidence that the Russian government was responsible for hacking the DNC, the DCCC, the email accounts of Democratic party officials, or for delivering the content of those hacks to Wikileaks.</p>

<p>It merely listed every threat group ever reported on by a commercial cybersecurity company that is suspected of being Russian-made and lumped them under the heading of Russian Intelligence Services (RIS) without providing any supporting evidence that such a connection exists.</p>

<p>Unlike Crowdstrike, ESET doesn’t assign APT28/Fancy Bear/Sednit to a Russian Intelligence Service or anyone else for a very simple reason. <strong>Once malware is deployed, it is no longer under the control of the hacker who deployed it or the developer who created it. It can be reverse-engineered, copied, modified, shared and redeployed again and again by anyone.</strong> In other words — malware deployed is malware enjoyed!</p>

<p>If ESET could do it, so can others. It is both foolish and baseless to claim, as Crowdstrike does, that X-Agent is used solely by the Russian government when the source code is there for anyone to find and use at will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you serious? You didn&#39;t offer any evidence that they faked the malware. None at all. Saying they made mistakes/detractions before doesn&#39;t prove they are faking the malware in the DNC leaks.</p>

<p>Here are simply questions:</p>

<p>What&#39;s the evidence they faked the DNC hacking evidence? No, making mistakes before doesn&#39;t mean they faked the DNC hacking evidence.</p>

<p>What evidence, in your opinion, <em>would</em> &quot;conclusively&quot; prove that Russia was behind the attack?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is beside the point</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it&#39;s not. You want the DNC to open up their computer systems to the world, when opening it up to a security firm they trust is the same action <em>anyone</em> else would have done.</p>

<p>You are more than a little slow. Sigh. Ok, listen closely. <strong>The malware used could have been deployed by anybody. There is no evidence that the Russians specifically were the hackers because, again, THE MALWARE COULD BE USED BY ANYONE.</strong></p>

<p>I never said they faked the DNC evidence, I said they faked the <strong>Ukraine hacking evidence.</strong> Multiple security firms have called them out on their bullshit, which you would know if you actually read the damn articles.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How about, for starters, evidence that cannot be faked by the CIA or any competent hacking firm who could access these programs? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ok, let me illustrate an example for you.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say someone was murdered in your house, and the murder weapon (your kitchen knife) had your fingerprints on it. This is concrete evidence that you are the murderer, but it is still circumstantial. <strong>Anybody could have used your kitchen knife</strong>. And since it already has your fingerprints, it is <em>not</em> conclusive evidence that you were the murderer. We need to look at motive, ability, opportunity, etc.</p>

<p>Similarly, Russia&#39;s fingerprints don&#39;t mean that they were the hackers, but they had the motives, abilities, opportunities, etc.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the conclusions they reached (<strong>which could be wrong</strong>), but there is no evidence at all that they faked the malware. That means that it&#39;s up to you to either believe the evidence reaches a threshold or not. <strong>My point is that the evidence actually exists</strong>. It&#39;s concrete/hard evidence that can be analyzed. It my not be definitive &quot;proof&quot;, but virtually nothing is, unless Putin admits to it himself.</p>

<p><strong>The Seth Rich/leaker accusations lack any and all hard evidence</strong>. At this point, it&#39;s about weighing out which has stronger evidence and what are the most likely possibilities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never said they faked the DNC evidence, I said they faked the Ukraine hacking evidence. Multiple security firms have called them out on their bullshit, which you would know if you actually read the damn articles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read the article you linked that makes the original claims. It says &quot;erroneously&quot; &quot;misread&quot; the data. Where does it say they faked it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about, for starters, evidence that cannot be faked by the CIA or any competent hacking firm who could access these programs? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please give an example. We could have video footage of Putin himself ordering the hacking, but you could claim that that could be &quot;faked&quot;, too.</p>

<p>So please:</p>

<p><strong>What is an actual example of evidence you would accept as conclusively proving Russia&#39;s involvement in the hacking?</strong>
What evidence cannot be &quot;faked&quot;? What security firms, specifically, should have been entrusted instead?</p>

<p>This analogy does not fit this scenario at all. In our case these fingerprints can be faked, as the Vault 7 leaks illustrated. If they can be faked, then that means they cannot be used as evidence to pin you for the murder. The knife is also not a good analogy. Let me give you my own analogy that would fit this situation better:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that the murder weapon used was a pistol originally manufactured in Russia. However, it is known that the blueprints of this weapon have been leaked to the world before. So any part can manufacture, modify, and use this weapon and make it look like it was the Russians. </p>

<p>So this is where we are at: both the murder weapon AND the finger prints can be modified by ANY party to attribute it to someone else. And that is all the evidence we have. Therefore the current evidence CAN NOT be attributed to a sole party. You would need DIRECT LINKS of Russian officials carrying out the murder in the form of camera feeds, internal documents, etc. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I do not have extensive experience in hacking to really give you a good answer on this. I simply know that the current evidence is not nearly enough to attribute to one party, the Russians. Someone more knowledgeable who is reading this, please chip in. I don&#39;t like to speculate without basis, I hope you understand.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are correct, it&#39;s all circumstantial. But the circumstantial evidence is significant in this case. Seth was shot twice in the back without anything stolen from him. Wikileaks offered $20k to people who can get information regarding his murder. The DC police, who have been known to be comprimised already, have found no leads to the murder. In addition, they have confiscated his laptop, which MAKES NO SENSE for a supposed &quot;botched robbery.&quot; In addition, all of the statements from the family actually come from a professional PR spokeperson from the DNC. </p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;d like to remind you the the DNC members came out after the leaks and vehemently denied the emails being true, despite them being DKIM verified. The emails showed the corruption, hypocrisy, and arrogance of all of the parties involved.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t point to him being a leaker though. In fact, I&#39;m not sure this points to anything at all.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a simple possibility: There were 2 robbers, Seth fought back (signs of struggle per his family), while entangled with one of the perps, the other one shoots him twice in the back. They flee in a panic leaving him alive, breathing, and conscious.</p>

<p>Other examples of botched robberies where they flee in a panic without taking anything:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If we believe WL has integrity in protecting their sources, it&#39;s more likely they are obfuscating the real source than revealing him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The DC police, who have been known to be comprimised already, have found no leads to the murder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn&#39;t point to him being a leaker, though. Not every murder case is easily solvable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they have confiscated his laptop, which MAKES NO SENSE for a supposed &quot;botched robbery.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Says who? I still haven&#39;t seen evidence that this actually happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, all of the statements from the family actually come from a professional PR spokeperson from the DNC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, Seth Rich <strong>worked for the DNC</strong>.</p>

<p>Additionally, you ignore that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He had no motive</p></li>
<li><p>He had no computer science/hacking background</p></li>
<li><p>He had no direct access to all those emails without said background</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, do you <em>really</em> think the admittedly circumstantial evidence is stronger that Seth Rich was the leaker?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just gonna chime in here with some relevant experience I have working for the criminal justice world. If the case is truly cold, then it&#39;s not hindering the case by talking about a speculative reason he was gunned down. A cold case implies it has no movement. Therefore, nothing is being slowed down, or made unclear, just because the public has some ideas. Law enforcement is used to the public coming up with theories for high profile cases. </p>

<p>Also, law enforcement doesn&#39;t get &quot;confused&quot; or anything with people talking about the case. So don&#39;t talk shit as if you understand how investigators actually do their work, because it&#39;s clear you don&#39;t. Along with most people tbh. </p>

<p>I asked how does it help., At best it does nothing. At worst, it <em>can</em> hinder real investigations by diverting resources (e.g. pizzagate shooter, having to answer and deal with the volume of calls from internet armchair detectives, having to deal with the press, etc). Do you really think these wild speculations have zero ramifications?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look one of two realities exist. Either Seth Rich died of a robbery gone wrong, or it&#39;s something else. </p>

<p>As of now the official story is that it was a robbery gone wrong. If that reality is the truth, then this truly is a cold case and it&#39;ll likely never ever be solved. No amount of public opinion on the matter would solve that case regardless.</p>

<p>And yes I do believe that wild speculations aren&#39;t hindering any investigation of Seth Rich. Police and Federal agencies have publicity folks, those who handle the tip lines, and others so they can receive public sentiment and evidence, without hindering the actual investigators. Yes I know how this work. The main investigator(s) doesn&#39;t take every single call personally from the press or public. In fact, chances are they don&#39;t take any calls, and instead rely on the <strong>team</strong> that is built for handling popular cases like this.</p>

<p>If it was the something else, then we still haven&#39;t discovered exactly what it was. Though most people are speculating it was the WikiLeaks connection based on surround evidence. Nothing concrete but some speculation of surroundings could lead someone to that conclusion. </p>

<p>If the WikiLeaks reality is the truth, then all this speculation is <strong>helping</strong>. </p>

<p>And who gives a fuck if a conspiracy theory <em>&quot;confuses&quot;</em> the public. That&#39;s not muddying the waters but trying to have a discussion about possibilities. The public doesn&#39;t need to be highly informed like an investigator does, so it doesn&#39;t matter if this is confusing for some people. </p>

<p>Also, just to cover my bases. The pizzagate shooter in no way, shape, or form, hinders the Seth Rich investigation. Field officers (not investigators) and dispatch would be the ones who respond to something like that. Those resources are meant to be used in that manner so it&#39;s not a waste to have a field officer come and arrest someone. </p>

<p>Again, I hate when people talk like they know a subject, and then inject their own bias and opinions and lack of situational knowledge, into said subject. It&#39;s obvious you have a civilian&#39;s understanding of the criminal justice world and aren&#39;t actually involved in it day to day. Seriously, stop talking like you&#39;re an authority on the subject of how investigations get handled. It&#39;s obvious you aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>lol... So you&#39;re familiar with &quot;real&quot; investigations, but you could only come up with <strong>two</strong> possible realities here? Are you serious?</p>

<p>I&#39;m checking out of this conversation, it&#39;s clear I&#39;m not arguing with logic here.</p>

<p>And, btw, the Pizzagate shooter reference was meant as an example of how speculations/accusations can result in real world negative ramifications. Ramifications that divert resources and hinder <em>real</em> investigations into <em>real</em> crimes. It&#39;s an illustrative example and the reader does not need to be a cop to see how diverting resources hinders real investigations. There are costs to dealing with this shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only came up with two because that&#39;s the debate here... obviously it could be something else beyond what we are discussing, but why waste time coming up with ideas and theories besides the one that&#39;s being discussed currently. It could have been a guy high on meth and acting violently. It could have been a jealous ex lover. It could have been <strong>anything</strong> because we don&#39;t know yet. However the two leading ideas (based on whatever little evidence exists) are the WikiLeaks and robbery narratives. So STFU and stop trying to play &quot;got ya&quot; as that doesn&#39;t make you more credible. You just seem sad and petty at this point. You can&#39;t even admit you&#39;re perhaps wrong and don&#39;t have a true understanding of how investigators do their job. </p>

<p>Want a list of companies and government agencies I work with in the criminal justice world? Look you probably have a job in an industry that&#39;s different from mine. If I came on reddit and started talking like I was knowledgeable or an authority on whatever it is that you&#39;re very familiar with, then you&#39;d be annoyed by the armchair analyst who doesn&#39;t know shit and it&#39;d be obvious to you that I wasn&#39;t knowledgeable.</p>

<p>You have an idea of how police resources are &quot;used&quot; but it&#39;s clear to me that you don&#39;t understand the reality of how a modern police agency operates. You have a very Hollywood understanding of it, as I&#39;m guessing most of your exposure in your life to criminal justice has been through TV and Movies. For me, it&#39;s my day to day job. </p>

<p>Also I misunderstood why you originally referenced the pizzagate shooter. I thought you were trying to link it to Seth in some way. </p>

<p>What magical &quot;logic&quot; do you have here that I&#39;m not seeing? Your argument is based off your own ignorance of the very subject of police investigations and the teams that are around the investigators to support them. Do you really think you ought to be spreading your idea of how investigations work, when you honestly don&#39;t have a clue?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not hear to argue that citizen investigations are useful or not, but to take you down a peg and get you off your high horse of &quot;I know everything&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to give one side more or less credibility because the truth is <strong>I don&#39;t know</strong> the truth of what happened to Seth.

<p>I just want the truth of the case to come out so Seth can get the justice he deserves. If it&#39;s just a thief, then great, we caught the bastard. If it&#39;s a collusion or something bigger, then let&#39;s get to the bottom of it.</p>

<p>Lastly, I don&#39;t call everyone out on their bullshit because I&#39;m not an expert in everything to be able to call out the many &quot;dumb&quot; people I see here.

<p>I&#39;m not arguing it because we&#39;re going around in circles. Not because I don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m talking about. I can point to actual examples of what I&#39;m claiming:</p>

<p>The rampant allegations/speculations directly and negatively affected a real life investigation. An innocent person&#39;s life might not have been taken if it weren&#39;t for anonymous internet vigilante &quot;investigators&quot; making wild accusations.</p>

<p>You are trying to make me believe that they will definitely not negatively affect an investigation when there&#39;s examples of it happening before. I don&#39;t need your validation to understand that these people can negatively affect real world investigations. It doesn&#39;t matter where you work.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t ask you to call out &quot;everyone&quot;. You seem to have a knack for putting words in my mouth. I asked about PG/Seth Rich &quot;investigators&quot; specifically. There is <em>way</em> more bullshit coming out of their mouths than mine.</p>

<p>Your example proves that mob mentality can hurt an <strong>individual</strong>, but did nothing to prove that public speculation hurts <strong>investigations</strong>. </p>

<p>Also what would I call out the Seth Rich and PG investigators for? For &quot;bullshit&quot;? Read my comment again dimwit. I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t call them out because I don&#39;t have an authority or knowledge of the subject. I don&#39;t know more about PG and it&#39;s related subjects than the investigators who are involved. So why argue with them when I have less information and knowledge than they do? So I can be like you and publicly display my ignorance?</p>

<p>I could tell them I disagree with their analysis on something, but I don&#39;t have proof or anything that could straight up prove them wrong. The difference between us is you&#39;re full of yourself and think you know everything there is to know, and everyone else must be wrong. I have a realistic world view that says I don&#39;t know everything, but I sure as fuck know more than you about what is actually detrimental to a murder investigation and what isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Honest question, do you genuinely believe that your armchair analysis of how criminal investigations are carried is more truthful and knowledgeable than someone who works with law enforcement 5 days a week? Like do you honestly believe that you know more than anyone here about how this shit actually works?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, had the FBI kept their faces hidden, we would&#39;ve caught the bombers and had a successful investigation! Oh wait they caught them. </p>

<p>Simple terms. FBI likes to keep mass murderers faces hidden until their caught so as not to create sympathy for them. However, other individuals that weren&#39;t the bombers were being targeted by the public. To help those individuals from being harassed, or worse, they released the photos early. No where in your quote does it say the FBI had a more difficult time because they had to release the photos early.</p>

<p>Idk why we are arguing the Boston marathon bombing though. This argument is about Seth so let&#39;s jump back to there. </p>

<p>The Seth Rich case is different than the Boston case obviously, so the police response isn&#39;t going to be identical. </p>

<p>With Seth&#39;s case it&#39;s either a cold case at this point, or something else. If it&#39;s a cold case then this public speculation <strong>has no real effect on the case since the case isn&#39;t going anywhere anyways.</strong> If it isn&#39;t a cold case, then either the WikiLeaks and Seth Rich people are right, or the investigation is something else entirely and being kept hidden from all of us, in which point they would be ignoring any WikiLeaks related stuff anyways. </p>

<p>So which is it of those? Is it a cold case? Is it something else entirely that is so secret that the FBI and D.C. Police have said nothing, or is it the WikiLeaks thing? Idk which it is, I&#39;m not advocating for one over the other. I&#39;m simply saying that at this point, public speculation isn&#39;t going to hurt the case nor hinder investigators. Do you have something to back up your claim that this does impact the current investigation? Don&#39;t try and reference a different case, keep it about Seth because that&#39;s the debate and this is derailed enough as it is. </p>

<p>They released the pictures early. They wouldn&#39;t have because they didn&#39;t want the suspects to flee. They were trying to pinpoint their location. The fact that they released it early might have caused the resulting police chase, which resulted in an innocent person getting killed. The <strong>investigation</strong> isn&#39;t just to ID people. It&#39;s to find them. It&#39;s to avoid messy confrontations. It&#39;s more than just ID. You&#39;re just being obtuse because you tried to call me out on bullshit and you were wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol... I like how your argument has morphed from &quot;This can&#39;t possibly hurt an investigation&quot;, to &quot;It could only hurt people and not investigations&quot;,  to &quot;yes, it can hurt investigations, but prove that it&#39;s hurting this particular investigation&quot;.</p>

<p>Guess what? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s hurting this one (not yet at least), but I do know that it <em>can</em> hurt investigations, and you&#39;ve provided absolutely no evidence to prove that it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the original comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You would think they would be wanting to help solve his murder since Seth was one of their own</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I simply proposed that the reason people don&#39;t wildly speculate and accuse is because it can hurt investigations.</p>

<p>Do you or do you not agree with this statement?</p>

<p>You can say, &quot;Well <strong>IF</strong> it&#39;s a cold case, it&#39;s not hurting it&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t address the original post nor propose any evidence whatsoever that the case really is cold. You&#39;re merely being contrarian, and when I showed you a real life example of an investigation being affected, you move the goalpost.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just state this one more time in an attempt to get this through your thick skull:</p>

<h1>Just because we don&#39;t throw out wild accusations, doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t want the murder to be solved. In fact, throwing out wild accusations/speculations can HURT a real investigation. The exact opposite of what &quot;we&#39;re&quot; being accused of. Not throwing wild accusations/speculations does not make me a shill.</h1>

<p>If you disagree with this, then we&#39;ve reached an impasse. If you agree, then what&#39;s the fucking problem?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I conceded on the Boston argument, not as a way for you to say &quot;See I&#39;m right!&quot; but as a way to get you back on topic. I thought my thick sarcasm would&#39;ve been obvious in that post.</p>

<p>My argument has been about the Seth Rich investigation; you&#39;re the one who is trying to talk about other cases as if they are relevant. My argument is still the same; I don&#39;t think public speculation into a possible Seth Rich and Wikileaks connection hurts the current &quot;official&quot; investigation going on.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go back here. I called you out because of your lack of knowledge regarding how investigators handle high profile cases. According to you, this would distract from the investigation and then cause issues because now it&#39;s a distraction and hindering the investigation. I was arguing that given the circumstances and complete lack of any recent news in the investigation, that it wouldn&#39;t cause harm.</p>

<p>Before you say I&#39;ve provided no evidence... on the contrary, I&#39;ve told you some of what an investigation is like for high profile cases. I can&#39;t provide a nice typed up document by the lead investigator saying it doesn&#39;t hurt, but what I can say is from my previous experience on how detectives I have <strong>worked with</strong> have no issue with people speculating about cold cases. In fact, public speculation is what keeps cold cases active a good chunk of the time.</p>

<p>Also the burden of proof is on you dude. If you&#39;re so worried about this hurting the investigation that you try to shut down any talk about it, then show us the evidence you have that is making you so anxious. If you have no evidence that speculating about Seth and WL is hurting the investigation, then why are you claiming it does?</p>

<p><strong>Because you&#39;re an armchair criminal justice lawyer apparently</strong>. You&#39;re trying to say that a different type of public speculation is the same as a mob witch hunt. (note, the Boston &quot;mob hunt&quot; for an active terrorist is different than a popular online theory that SR leaked emails to WL and was killed for it) </p>

<h1>I was correcting you in the beginning, and arguing with your dumbass, that this type of speculation has no bearing or effect on a case that hasn&#39;t had any official progress in a long time; given my experience in criminal justice and having had worked with detectives and case files. Also, you can&#39;t compare two cases and two different types of public interaction and call it a tie. Different cases, different police force, different crimes, different victims, different public reaction, and a significant difference in the public involvement. This is why I&#39;m calling you a casual viewer of the criminal justice world. You think you understand, but you really are lacking the understanding of the differences of the two you&#39;re trying to compare. It&#39;s apples and oranges.</h1>

<p>Let&#39;s keep yelling! /s</p>

<p>I never once called you a shill and don&#39;t believe that you are one. I just think you think too highly of yourself and believe that you know a lot more than you do.</p>

<p>Finally, read my comments again you illiterate fuck face. I never was making a <strong>blanket statement</strong> that the public being involved in an investigation could hinder it. My argument is purely the Seth Rich murder case and has nothing to do with any other cases. Read my comments again if you really think I&#39;m trying to apply this general argument to every single nuanced case in the world. I didn&#39;t change my argument, you just lack basic comprehension.</p>

The police want no one watching what they do because they do not want to be accountable. This is not a political game where they are going to pay back the favor of being hired by the democratic mayor or democratic police chief. This time they are going to have to the public and sunlight is the best disinfectant of corruption!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry my point wasn&#39;t that the public <strong>should</strong> be confused or left in the dark. I was stating that an investigator doing his or her job doesn&#39;t rely on  public knowledge and sentiment. The public can have no clue as to what is going on, and be confused, but that doesn&#39;t change the day to day job of an investigator. That was simply my point. That it doesn&#39;t matter if the Seth Rich and possible WikiLeaks connection confuses people or the public. Either way the job of the investigator is the same. </p>

<p>Ideally the public is aware and knowledgeable about most, if not all, things regarding corruption, investigations, and our law enforcement. And ideally we find the truth of all this craziness going on on D.C.  </p>

<p>All you can do for a cold case is collect evidence and give it to the police department. You have to convince them that the case isn&#39;t cold, and if you&#39;re lucky they will actually listen and set up a new detective to rework the case. Most of the time they will tell you it is pointless and that there is nothing they can do, kinda like what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>I wonder if you ever ask this about the people pushing the Seth Rich/leaker narrative. Fake news sites need views, just like the MSM.

Is it not possible that there are &quot;shills&quot; <em>pushing</em> the narrative? Why do you only accuse the people who disagree with you as being shills?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some more speculation. I honestly think there are Russian ties to Trump&#39;s team.

<p>Getting hacked by Russia, with whom Trump has ties, is a much better story than having your internal collusion dumped on the web by a disgruntled staffer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plus it is an unwritten understanding here that any narrative the msm pushes, relentlessly, without evidence is certainly not to be trusted.  So, by analyzing behavior response.  If CNN, wapo, etc demonize a working theory of investigation that has tons of circumstantial evidence (rich, pizza, etc) while simultaneously pushing the Russian hack narrative without any evidence... Its almost a given this community will embrace the former over the latter.  Thusly, anyone defending the opinions of CNN over anything else is is suspicious right out of the gate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And fairly, I don&#39;t believe that anyone here defending mainstream opinion is necessarily a &quot;shill,&quot; they are just here defending what they believe, and using their evidence to support it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are shills, but there are also people who find it amusing that they are called shills just for posting and defending what they believe is &quot;popular opinion,&quot; and that drives them to keep posting.</p>

<p>And anyone coming in here with a bias that the majority of folks who regularly post here in support of conspiracy are &quot;crazy&quot; are going to leave further inspired in their own belief, because confirmation bias is tough nugget to crack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is exactly why I said 4 months ago to stop pushing and shilling the whole pizza pedo thing. The &#39;evidence&#39; was shaky at best and though there were a lot of odd coincidences and circumstantial factors; it was never serious. This sub and others totally discredited themselves by pushing a literally half baked theory and now when there is actual evidence they can say here they go again... good job guys! (whether or not pedo thing is true is one thing but has not even been close to being proven so the fact that it was pushed so hard is ridiculous. I said at the time i thought it was a total shill operation to make free thinkers look crazy. )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The great thing about these dirrea posts is that the volume and fragmentary style makes them impossible to respond to, even though each individual element evaporates under critical analysis. In your haste to create a flood, you don&#39;t even bother to differentiate between the different people you are accusing.</p>

<p>Ask any pizzagater what they believe to be the 3 most convincing pieces of evidence. Most don&#39;t bother to respond, because on an intuitive level they understand that no individual data point holds up under analysis. (Caveat: the handkerchief with pizza related map email is certainly suspicious, but drugs/hookers is a much more parsimonious read. The pedo code thing from 4chan is ridiculous to anyone who thinks on it for a second.)</p>

The only way to ignore the fact that Podesta and Alefantis are elite pedophiles is to ON PURPOSE ignore the totality of what was revealed.

    <div class="md"><p>Look one of two realities exist. Either Seth Rich died of a robbery gone wrong, or it&#39;s something else. </p>

<p>As of now the official story is that it was a robbery gone wrong. If that reality is the truth, then this truly is a cold case and it&#39;ll likely never ever be solved. No amount of public opinion on the matter would solve that case regardless.</p>

<p>And yes I do believe that wild speculations aren&#39;t hindering any investigation of Seth Rich. Police and Federal agencies have publicity folks, those who handle the tip lines, and others so they can receive public sentiment and evidence, without hindering the actual investigators. Yes I know how this work. The main investigator(s) doesn&#39;t take every single call personally from the press or public. In fact, chances are they don&#39;t take any calls, and instead rely on the <strong>team</strong> that is built for handling popular cases like this.</p>

<p>If it was the something else, then we still haven&#39;t discovered exactly what it was. Though most people are speculating it was the WikiLeaks connection based on surround evidence. Nothing concrete but some speculation of surroundings could lead someone to that conclusion. </p>

<p>If the WikiLeaks reality is the truth, then all this speculation is <strong>helping</strong>. </p>

<p>And who gives a fuck if a conspiracy theory <em>&quot;confuses&quot;</em> the public. That&#39;s not muddying the waters but trying to have a discussion about possibilities. The public doesn&#39;t need to be highly informed like an investigator does, so it doesn&#39;t matter if this is confusing for some people. </p>

<p>Also, just to cover my bases. The pizzagate shooter in no way, shape, or form, hinders the Seth Rich investigation. Field officers (not investigators) and dispatch would be the ones who respond to something like that. Those resources are meant to be used in that manner so it&#39;s not a waste to have a field officer come and arrest someone. </p>

<p>Again, I hate when people talk like they know a subject, and then inject their own bias and opinions and lack of situational knowledge, into said subject. It&#39;s obvious you have a civilian&#39;s understanding of the criminal justice world and aren&#39;t actually involved in it day to day. Seriously, stop talking like you&#39;re an authority on the subject of how investigations get handled. It&#39;s obvious you aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>They released the pictures early. They wouldn&#39;t have because they didn&#39;t want the suspects to flee. They were trying to pinpoint their location. The fact that they released it early might have caused the resulting police chase, which resulted in an innocent person getting killed. The <strong>investigation</strong> isn&#39;t just to ID people.
