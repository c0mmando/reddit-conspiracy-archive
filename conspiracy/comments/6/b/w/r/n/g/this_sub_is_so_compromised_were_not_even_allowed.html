        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EDIT: Post is now more than one hour old, 171 views, 40% upvoted, still sitting at 0 up or downvotes. It&#39;s not even fluctuating up and down, it&#39;s been steady zero this whole time. As intended, this thread slowly sinks into obscurity while the forum front page is dominated by counter narrative distraction bullshit. If you are upvoting or downvoting the thread, it&#39;s not registering on Reddit&#39;s system. You are being censored right now. I&#39;d also like to point out that 98% of replies in this thread are telling me to shut up and get out, and refusing to engage on the Ailes topic. Kinda proves my point. END EDIT</p>

<p>So Roger Ailes is dead, and the PTB on this sub won&#39;t allow us to discuss it. </p>

<p>The implications of his death are staggering- if anyone knows where the bodies are buried in the conservative political landscape it was him. His convenient death removes him from the potential pool of witnesses as the conservative&#39;s corrupt house of cards begins to crumble. And yet, somehow, all we care about is poor Seth Rich and the endlessly discredited Clinton kill list? The saboteurs in our midst could not be more obvious.</p>

<p>This forum has never been more necessary for discussing deep evidence and historical connections. There&#39;s a lot of long term knowledge here- no wonder we have been so meticulously and expertly muted. I think we&#39;re more powerful than we realize, because as we whisper conjecture to each other we forget the world is listening in- including tremendously powerful people. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories have previously been subverted by making them a laughable crazy-fringe thing. In the world of Reddit that&#39;s no longer possible because we have the power to speak for ourselves. The internet has leveled the playing field of mass communication. This is a very dangerous situation for those who have reason to repress discussion about conspiracy. Their new tactic? Drown us out. Blunt and effective. We are witnessing cyber warfare in our midst, and we are the target. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to echo every authentic poster on this sub- we have been compromised and silenced. I think it may be time to abandon this sub for greener pastures where we can talk freely. If anyone has any knowledge about that I hope you&#39;ll PM me a link privately. DON&#39;T post it publicly, or we&#39;ll lose that one too. If you&#39;re suspicious of my motives (I would be) take a look at my post history- I think it speaks for itself.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t support your claim that it&#39;s not allowed to be discussed, there is no official opinion on the subject from the adminstration of this subreddit, nor is there any prohibition on posting ANY subject including Roger Ailes.</p>

<p>How many of those thread were posted by you?  And why is the lack of traction on this particular theory a condemnation of this subreddit?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>just like this thread. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would argue that this thread is unpopular because of your condemnation of the subreddit as a whole.  Perhaps if you put the amount of effort into making a compelling case for Roger Ailes murder as you put emotion into the condemnation of the subreddit then people would want to discuss it.</p>

<p>I came to this subreddit right after finding out about Ailes&#39; death expecting to find multiple hot threads concerning it. The absence of those expected, normal threads was conspicuous to say the least. I created this thread partly as a test of the system, and it is failing that test with flying colors. As of right now, this thread has 156 views, 39% upvotes (can&#39;t imagine why you guys aren&#39;t posting), 58 comments and ZERO up OR downvotes to the thread as a whole- where it&#39;s been sitting with no fluctuation since I first posted. We are being censored.</p>

<p>I&#39;m far from the only poster saying this sub has been taken over. Those messages get pushed into the background and drowned out in a sea of manufactured bullshit, but they are there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for taking a light hand with the censorship, and the censorship I&#39;m discussing is not on your end. It&#39;s the general trend of noise being generated along one party line to drown out any dissenting opinion. When I say &quot;not allowed to discuss&quot; I mean it in terms of how this thread is awash in posts shutting me down, and none at all trying to actually discuss the implications of Ailes&#39; death. </p>

<p>Can you account for why I&#39;m not seeing any fluctuation of the vote count on the thread on my end? I&#39;m still sitting at 0 up or downvotes despite having a 39% upvote percentage. I&#39;m also not seeing any up or down fluctuation in the vote at all- steady 0 this whole time. It doesn&#39;t seem organic. Can you explain that?</p>

<p>Also: Ailes was old-ish, very fat, and probably devastated by his recent public humiliation, followed by a likewise treatment of his golden boy Bill O&#39;Reilly. </p>

<p>Ailes also was a piece of shit, human being wise, and I say that from the perspective of knowing people who&#39;ve known him, worked with him and covered him since the days he worked for Nixon.</p>

<p>So maybe he was knocked off and maybe it was a bad thing and we certainly should talk about it. But Roger Ailes as victim and martyr is laughable. </p>

<p>It would be good to know, however....could he have been working on launching a new News Channel, perchance? Maybe Trump was planning to resign and create his own media empire with Ailes at the helm? Seems crazy to speculate, but crazier things have been happening. </p>

A lot of the nefarious shit that has gone down in the last 30 years either came from him or passed through his hands at some point.

<p>OK. That&#39;s a viable point. But who would tell that story? CNN? Vanity Fair? Someone from the left? Would he WANT to align himself with the Left after a lifetime of being a warrior for the Right? Even that would cause stressful mental consideration. </p>

<p>Scalia was old, too. Let&#39;s see if we get an Ailes autopsy or if he&#39;s immediately sent to the crematorium. Then you&#39;ll get me suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came here looking for Roger ailed discussion and am also amazed this has so little coverage. </p>

<p>Someone very powerful suddenly dies when they become useless while directly related history is unfolding!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the truth is, but that this isn&#39;t being discussed more is surprising. </p>

<p>My second reaction was &quot;def conspiracy has corrupted Reddit!&quot; Thinking thru it tho, I think sincere disillusioned T_Ds have taken over this forum etc </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Difference is, I didn&#39;t make a post about a conservative distraction agenda.  If you think political party really matters you&#39;ve never experienced politics.

Meanwhile, we&#39;re all arguing over which bathroom someone should use as they continue to concentrate power.  Republicans and Democrats are both vile at the upper levels.  It doesn&#39;t just cut one-way...</p>
