       EDIT: Post is now more than one hour old, 171 views, 40% upvoted, still sitting at 0 up or downvotes. It's not even fluctuating up and down, it's been steady zero this whole time. As intended, this thread slowly sinks into obscurity while the forum front page is dominated by counter narrative distraction bullshit. If you are upvoting or downvoting the thread, it's not registering on Reddit's system. You are being censored right now. I'd also like to point out that 98% of replies in this thread are telling me to shut up and get out, and refusing to engage on the Ailes topic. Kinda proves my point. END EDIT
      </p>
      <p>
       So Roger Ailes is dead, and the PTB on this sub won't allow us to discuss it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The implications of his death are staggering- if anyone knows where the bodies are buried in the conservative political landscape it was him. His convenient death removes him from the potential pool of witnesses as the conservative's corrupt house of cards begins to crumble. And yet, somehow, all we care about is poor Seth Rich and the endlessly discredited Clinton kill list? The saboteurs in our midst could not be more obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       This forum has never been more necessary for discussing deep evidence and historical connections. There's a lot of long term knowledge here- no wonder we have been so meticulously and expertly muted. I think we're more powerful than we realize, because as we whisper conjecture to each other we forget the world is listening in- including tremendously powerful people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories have previously been subverted by making them a laughable crazy-fringe thing. In the world of Reddit that's no longer possible because we have the power to speak for ourselves. The internet has leveled the playing field of mass communication. This is a very dangerous situation for those who have reason to repress discussion about conspiracy. Their new tactic? Drown us out. Blunt and effective. We are witnessing cyber warfare in our midst, and we are the target.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to echo every authentic poster on this sub- we have been compromised and silenced. I think it may be time to abandon this sub for greener pastures where we can talk freely. If anyone has any knowledge about that I hope you'll PM me a link privately. DON'T post it publicly, or we'll lose that one too. If you're suspicious of my motives (I would be) take a look at my post history- I think it speaks for itself.

       The only one of those threads that even suggests Ailes might have been murdered has nothing but posters shutting it down, just like this thread. Officially Ailes' death is open to discussion, but in reality there is clearly some hard work being done behind the scenes to keep this topic from gaining traction in the sub.

       That doesn't support your claim that it's not allowed to be discussed, there is no official opinion on the subject from the adminstration of this subreddit, nor is there any prohibition on posting ANY subject including Roger Ailes.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many of those thread were posted by you?  And why is the lack of traction on this particular theory a condemnation of this subreddit?

       I would argue that this thread is unpopular because of your condemnation of the subreddit as a whole.  Perhaps if you put the amount of effort into making a compelling case for Roger Ailes murder as you put emotion into the condemnation of the subreddit then people would want to discuss it.

       I'm actually an honest person so this is the only thread I've started, or needed to start- it's pretty caliente in here. Obviously I can't prove that, but whatever.

       I came to this subreddit right after finding out about Ailes' death expecting to find multiple hot threads concerning it. The absence of those expected, normal threads was conspicuous to say the least. I created this thread partly as a test of the system, and it is failing that test with flying colors. As of right now, this thread has 156 views, 39% upvotes (can't imagine why you guys aren't posting), 58 comments and ZERO up OR downvotes to the thread as a whole- where it's been sitting with no fluctuation since I first posted. We are being censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm far from the only poster saying this sub has been taken over. Those messages get pushed into the background and drowned out in a sea of manufactured bullshit, but they are there.

       Text tone miscommunication... I'm suggesting that you SHOULD post about if you want to discuss it, instead of posting that you aren't allowed to discuss it when that accusation is objectively untrue.

       But the thread itself is not getting downvotes, which is pretty damning. People who hate what I have to say should be downvoting the thread if they have any intellectual honesty. They're not because that would cause it to pop up on "controversial" where it mightr gain some traction. The post vote count sitting at 0 is pretty much proof of the repression I'm claiming.

       As a mod here I downvoted it because of your bullshit claim in the title that you aren't allowed to discuss it here in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're allowed to discuss anything you want, you're not guaranteed to be popular for it.  I should know this better than anyone since there are frequently organized witch hunts against me because I won't censor shit people don't like.

       Thank you for taking a light hand with the censorship, and the censorship I'm discussing is not on your end. It's the general trend of noise being generated along one party line to drown out any dissenting opinion. When I say "not allowed to discuss" I mean it in terms of how this thread is awash in posts shutting me down, and none at all trying to actually discuss the implications of Ailes' death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you account for why I'm not seeing any fluctuation of the vote count on the thread on my end? I'm still sitting at 0 up or downvotes despite having a 39% upvote percentage. I'm also not seeing any up or down fluctuation in the vote at all- steady 0 this whole time. It doesn't seem organic. Can you explain that?

       Also: Ailes was old-ish, very fat, and probably devastated by his recent public humiliation, followed by a likewise treatment of his golden boy Bill O'Reilly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ailes also was a piece of shit, human being wise, and I say that from the perspective of knowing people who've known him, worked with him and covered him since the days he worked for Nixon.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe he was knocked off and maybe it was a bad thing and we certainly should talk about it. But Roger Ailes as victim and martyr is laughable.

       You don't know what his consciousness was like. He just went from one of the most powerful men in the country to a national public disgrace. That's a hard fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be good to know, however....could he have been working on launching a new News Channel, perchance? Maybe Trump was planning to resign and create his own media empire with Ailes at the helm? Seems crazy to speculate, but crazier things have been happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we do see, though, is an increasingly alignment of all the 24/7 "news" networks, when it comes to lockstep messaging. That will be super-important for them when they attempt/pull off whatever's the "new 9/11" coming down the pike.

       Ailes has been fucking with us since the Nixon administration. He was a key player in the conservative movement, a strategist. A lot of the nefarious shit that has gone down in the last 30 years either came from him or passed through his hands at some point. He was also recently tossed out and betrayed by his friends (as I'm sure he saw it) and so had a motive to speak up.

       OK. That's a viable point. But who would tell that story? CNN? Vanity Fair? Someone from the left? Would he WANT to align himself with the Left after a lifetime of being a warrior for the Right? Even that would cause stressful mental consideration.

       Scalia was old, too. Let's see if we get an Ailes autopsy or if he's immediately sent to the crematorium. Then you'll get me suspicious.

       I think it's totally possible Scalia was killed. As for turning on his former allies- betrayed people do very destructive things to get revenge. And if Ailes was looking at immunity for testimony or death in prison, that changes the dynamic significantly. If I were an investigator looking to flip a witness Ailes would be first on my "approach" list.

       Why would the MSM roll with the seth rich story if it was at all damaging to the establishment?  Thats my only inquiry.

       In my opinion, they would rather discuss anything bad, as long as they aren't discussing anything good, such as orbital ring space elevators.

       I see no evidence of MSM reporting the Seth Rich story in any way, except to mention that his parents are aghast at this turn of events. I'm sure you can throw a bunch of carefully culled links at me, but to say this manufactured "scandal" has any traction in MSM is a stretch at best.

       No it's not, because the pizzagate types are drowning out any conversation that contradicts their narrative. And yes, we are divided into those of us who wonder why we're letting the biggest conspiracy the US has seen go by unremarked on and those who are distracted by the shiny objects the PTB hang in front of their eyes. And what you call division I call dissent- not a bad thing in my book.

       The fact that you made this a political argument of conservative vs. liberal discredits your entire post.  That is idiotic myopic thinking undeserving of this board.  This is someone who was politically and occupationally silenced before this happened.  If you don't think that this death was a mere continuation of that trend, then you need to find another sub.  Seth Rich is a major story.  The Clinton kill list has not been discredited.  Ailes will get his due once more facts emerge, but to suggest that the folks over here in search of the truth are brigading based on political motives is ridiculous.  That would be you, sir.

       Umm, no.  The left was the party of slavery.  The party of Jim Crow.  The party that currently supports the stifling of free speech at universities, the militancy of BLM, the adoption of safe spaces and cultural genocide and much more.  They are the party of hypocrisy.  The party that screams for women's and gay rights out of one side of their mouth and then gives Islam a pass for systematically targeting these groups.  The party that doesn't support the death penalty for murders, but supports the systematic killing of innocent babies for convenience.  The party that would rather hear nice things than realize actual results.  The party that believes you need to be in a database for owning a gun, but don't need ID to vote.  The party that fixes their own primaries against the people and then argues in court that they have the right to do so.  The party that manipulates unions to suppress the people they represent.  The party that abhors the use of surveillance on the citizenry, yet expands its application.  The party that screams about freedom of the press only to spy on journalists.  I could go on and on.  I've worked for both republican and democratic administrations on the actual issues that you're pontificating about, ma'am.  So don't try to lecture me on smokescreen and distraction.  I've seen it first hand.  I don't need your bullshit reddit post to confirm anything.  I've lived it.  So when you have an explanation for any one of the above hypocrisies please let me know, otherwise continue to push bullshit on people for a shitty shareblue paycheck.

       Liberals aren't bad guys, leftists are.  If you're on the left I quite frankly don't give a shit.  I used to be as well.  Much of my family is.  Many of my friends are.  What bothers me is your inability to reconcile your own party problems.  Republicans are often disgusting people.  Guess what, so are liberals.  Anyone can subscribe to, and subsequently corrupt, an ideology.  When we abdicate accountability for this behavior and blindly follow the echo chamber, we end up with the political situation we're in.  I don't have any problem with your political views, I have a problem with your inability to understand them.

       Difference is, I didn't make a post about a conservative distraction agenda.  If you think political party really matters you've never experienced politics.  They are designed to divide the people around meaningless social arguments so that economic realities go unnoticed.  Career public servants on both sides of the aisle are worth tens of millions of dollars...How does that happen?  Al Gore is worth 100M, explain that.  Meanwhile, we're all arguing over which bathroom someone should use as they continue to concentrate power.  Republicans and Democrats are both vile at the upper levels.  It doesn't just cut one-way...

       Please look up the Reddit post on the "reverse cargo cult" idea, if you haven't read it already. It's eye opening, and I think you may see yourself in it.

       I came here looking for Roger ailed discussion and am also amazed this has so little coverage.

       Someone very powerful suddenly dies when they become useless while directly related history is unfolding!

       I don't know what the truth is, but that this isn't being discussed more is surprising.

       My second reaction was "def conspiracy has corrupted Reddit!" Thinking thru it tho, I think sincere disillusioned T_Ds have taken over this forum etc
