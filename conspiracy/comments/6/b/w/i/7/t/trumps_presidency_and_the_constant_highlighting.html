       It is no secret that since the turn of the millennia the world (in particular the United States) has fallen in love with reality tv. We love the
       <em>
        drama
       </em>
       and of course the chaos. But the chaos is always controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who better to be leader of the free world than Donald Trump the reality tv star billionaire. Every move he makes every word he says is covered. All to draw the eyes away from the bigger picture that is all around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like moths to a flame millions are drawn to their tv to see what crazy thing happens next and never looking to see the man behind the curtain.

       Maybe you're younger but Reagan was the most obvious. Bush had him shot to keep him in line; after that the whole term was an obvious farce. They've done a better job since at getting the president to toe the company line.

       There is no difference between trump and Obama. What you are experiencing is localized confirmation bias. There is a reason that the presidency is passed between the parties. Now it is your turn to scrutinize the presidency. Look; in red parts of the country obama WAS scrutinized like this. Those regions spent 8 years pissed off. Now those areas are enjoying the fact that the blue areas are all pissed off and doing the scrutinizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is all a false dialectic. Red vs blue are tied while our corporate masters keep on winning.

       You know I see constant blame on the media, well they have blame naturally but the media is doing what their viewers like to watch/read. There's blame on the people too. The people seem to love sensationalist articles and misleading titles. Alot of people seem to love the daily life of celebrities. And some celebrities like to make a show of their life... Like Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you voted for trump... a person who cries for media attention his whole life and being in the spotlight. It should be expected for it to continue, no? From his statementsn, especially on twitter, does it not seem he wants all the attention he can get? Dont think there's ever been a president such a him... and it gives the media ratings.

       You are correct. It is a distraction to keep the sheep in line. The entire system of power has been corrupted by psychopathic corporatist fascists since at least the 80s (i would argue 63). We need a constitutional convention, not elections.

       Dog and pony show while they do whatever they want at a faster rate than ever before due to a better distraction than ever before.

       We need to pay serious attention to everything they don't want us to at this point in history.  The ramping up of drama is such an obvious sign that they are fabricating more confusion.  Nothing is getting accomplished anywhere except more confusion.
