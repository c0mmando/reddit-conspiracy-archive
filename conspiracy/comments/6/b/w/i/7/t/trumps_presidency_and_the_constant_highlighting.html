<p>Who better to be leader of the free world than Donald Trump the reality tv star billionaire. Every move he makes every word he says is covered. All to draw the eyes away from the bigger picture that is all around you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no difference between trump and Obama. What you are experiencing is localized confirmation bias. There is a reason that the presidency is passed between the parties. Now it is your turn to scrutinize the presidency. Look; in red parts of the country obama WAS scrutinized like this. Those regions spent 8 years pissed off. Now those areas are enjoying the fact that the blue areas are all pissed off and doing the scrutinizing.</p>

<p>It is all a false dialectic. Red vs blue are tied while our corporate masters keep on winning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know I see constant blame on the media, well they have blame naturally but the media is doing what their viewers like to watch/read. There&#39;s blame on the people too. The people seem to love sensationalist articles and misleading titles. Alot of people seem to love the daily life of celebrities. And some celebrities like to make a show of their life... Like Trump.</p>

<p>When you voted for trump... a person who cries for media attention his whole life and being in the spotlight. It should be expected for it to continue, no? From his statementsn, especially on twitter, does it not seem he wants all the attention he can get? Dont think there&#39;s ever been a president such a him... and it gives the media ratings.</p>

<p>We need to pay serious attention to everything they don&#39;t want us to at this point in history.  The ramping up of drama is such an obvious sign that they are fabricating more confusion.  Nothing is getting accomplished anywhere except more confusion. </p>

<p>A lot of noise to keep you looking one way while the public enemies converge on common goals behind the scenes.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to think he was Plan A.</p>

<p>In the past decade, reality TV has become a juggernaut in the TV industry and continues to keep people occupied with mindless drivel. What do the TPTB want? An unaware and compliant citizenry. How do you keep the couch potatoes in place then? You get one of the most controversial reality TV stars (&quot;businessman&quot;) to become president so that people are glued to the TV watching this kabuki theater day in and day out. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the MIC and friends are still murdering people all across the planet with impunity- but look over here! Trump is eating KFC with a knife and fork what a fucking travesty!</p>
