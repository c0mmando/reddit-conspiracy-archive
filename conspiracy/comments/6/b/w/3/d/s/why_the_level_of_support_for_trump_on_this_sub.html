    <div class="md"><p>Because</p>

<p>A) Clinton is very easy to target with accusations of nefarious dealings.  So the thought is (or was) Trump is much better than Clinton.  Seth Rich is a very convenient focal point, because his murder seems like a cover-up</p>

<p>B) Trump was anointed as an anti-globalist savior by Alex Jones, which seems like a giant leap.</p>

<p>C) There is a crossover of the users in this sub and the users in <a href="/r/T_D">/r/T_D</a></p>

<p>D) There&#39;s more but I&#39;m still drinking my coffee and can&#39;t think totally clearly yet</p>

<p>It would be great if all the &quot;free-thinkers&quot; here would be as skeptical of Trump as they are of anyone else in power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that is your assessment, I would argue you&#39;re not watching closely enough or don&#39;t look past the first degree. The 5D chess metaphor their subreddit like to use isn&#39;t that far off in the sense that you gotta analyse what Trump says, and what Trump does, individually. There&#39;s a lot of perspectives to be explored to try and form the reality. Right now he&#39;s working against the deep state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m always open to discuss, I&#39;ve been following Trump and US politics since august, from Canada</p>

<p>I&#39;ll address the following concerns in this paragraph and answer to the best of my perception of everything I&#39;ve read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hope people show for Trump on this sub confuses me - surely the vast majority of people on here realise that: (a) traditional party politics are of no consequence to the real power structures within Western global late-capitalist societies, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are absolutely right here, however everything from my pov points to Trump being backed by the white hat factions within the government</p>

<p>(b) Trump was born rich, has been a member of the elite all of his life, and demonstrates regularly many Illuminati/Luciferian tendencies (eg trying to fuck his own children, shadowy meetings with shady people, family empire building, unexplained cash flows and shady business deals, even doesnt look like a real human being and probably isn&#39;t etc etc)
I&#39;m not too sure about all those allegations, some of them are quite out there and some were pushed heavily by the media when in reality were non-issues. He&#39;s rich yeah, doesn&#39;t make him a bad person defacto though. That&#39;s buying in the class paradigm. Every paradigm needs to be dropped; Race, Class, Gender, etc. Every single one of us has problems and people just don&#39;t realize it I guess.</p>

<p>(c) anyone whos allowed to become POTUS is definitely NOT on the side of the people (stand up Bernie S)</p>

<p>I liked Burnie&#39;s ideas and politics (mostly). However, he would never have had the balls to take the deep state head on</p>

<p>, and (d) Since he&#39;s been in power things have only got worse...</p>

<p>Or so they seem, it could have been much worse. Under HRC, we were heading straight towards a full on war with Russia. Instead we have a stealth World War 3. The deep state monster spans across many countries and spheres of influence right? Well what we&#39;re seeing is 2 factions going at it at the moment. The whole Trump prevented a 2nd false flag from Israel might be true, however I don&#39;t think it&#39;s verifiable.</p>

<p>Alright so I&#39;ll stop for now and wait for follow up questions haha</p>

<p>This is where I think you could be on to something I&#39;m not seeing, have you got any links or anything?

<p>Offkey relationship with Ivanka:
<a href="http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/279091/donald-trump-ivanka-trump-photo-gross/">http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/279091/donald-trump-ivanka-trump-photo-gross/</a>

<p>Agreed, not all rich people are bad and yes we must move beyond these paradigms. But his family seem to have a history of <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/02/meet-freidrich-pimp-profiteer-and-patriarch-of-the-trump-line">less than scrupulous empire-building tactics</a> and Trump <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/156234/exposing_how_donald_trump_really_made_his_fortune%3A_inheritance_from_dad_and_the_government%27s_protection_mostly_did_the_trick">isn&#39;t exactly a self-made man and patriot</a> </p>

<p>I just feel like someone who has grown up as he did and lived a whole life mixing in the upper echelons of the elite is not looking to bring that system down any time soon.The following fits more with my line of thinking regarding if he&#39;s working for the people against the deep state or is just another deep-plutocratic-state actor:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I read a lot of rumors on Ivanka, people are questioning her relationship with Kushner who people suspect to be linked with Israel/Mossad, so Ivanka might be a bad actor in this scenario. </p>

<p>As for his empire-building and his origins, they can probably be debated and might be true, I&#39;m not too familiar with them. However what we can say is that it&#39;s things of the past, and with the actions he pulls I&#39;m thinking if he was with them before, he jumped ship.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes white hats in this sense would be the light forces. In this story I guess you can put &quot;The cabal/Deep state&quot; on one side and &quot;Earth Alliance&quot; on the other. As for links, depends on which subject. Let&#39;s start with Syria gas attacks. You&#39;re probably well aware of what the media has said on this. If you researched a bit and are a bit of a theorist, the evidence on the ground and all data pointed to an obvious false flag op, either because it was carried out by other people than Assad than blaming it on him, or fabricating it from the ground up or a mix of the 2. MIT researcher even made a paper on it. However, even tho it was an apparent false flag, within the day Trump launches 59 tomahawk missiles, which a lot of his supporters are against, people want out of useless wars. Alex Jones, Milo, Paul Joseph Watson and many others were riling him on it. And that&#39;s pretty much where the story ends if we look no further. People at that point are either A) angry at trump for implicating himself in syria or B) happy because he striked the &quot;evil&quot; Assad.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what people don&#39;t know or don&#39;t take into consideration. </p>

<p>The US claims to have shot 59 missiles, 57 of which hit their targets, at a very high cost as stated by the media.</p>

<p>Russia confirmed 23 hits on the Syrian airbase (which was running the very next day).</p>

<p>We&#39;re missing 36 missiles that DID HIT their targets. What were those targets? Anyone know? My best guess would be ISIS.</p>

<p>And then we could take the MOABs case he launched in afghan. What did he do there? Destroyed ISIS tunnels that were made by the CIA in the 70s (wikileaks tweeted about it) which were most likely used to run the heroin from the poppy fields.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s stuff like that when I say, watch what he says (read between the lines) and then see what he actually does</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the Clinton DNC Deep State conspiracies came first and are way juicier and its clear all the stuff after (Trump and Russia) are a made up response by the conspirators. As such most people here see people like you as complicit or part of the conspiracy by trying to convince them to buy into the Russian narrative. So it&#39;s not really about Trump support. It&#39;s about the same deep state that assassinated JFK is now politically assassinating Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple. A like long history of not trusting the mainstream media, combined with a sudden effort to destroy a previously popular public figure who most people have been aware of for over 40 years.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even have to like the guy to find that suspicious, but then add both political parties (who have been the establishment power since the civil war) align themselves to try and destroy him, in spite of being in the direct conflict of one of the parties immediate interests. Then move to the global stage, and it is all the establishment globalists that have run the world for generations who oppose him.</p>

<p>You genuinely don&#39;t even need to like the guy (i will admit he is a total asshole) but he has all the right enemies, and at best a limited window of influence (4-8 years in office). It is a long shot, but he might fuck all these horrible people over simply out of spite, and for that reason alone, I am enjoying the show. TPTB will never allow this to happen again. Next time they rig elections, they will not leave thing up to a combination of change and their influence over the media.</p>

There&#39;s plenty to criticize, but why does the corporate media focus on Russia? Because the corporate media is a massive public relations firm for the most powerful industrial capitalists in the world. They don&#39;t want us actually organizing a worker&#39;s movement or an environmental movement. Trump is a threat to their carefully balanced political paradigm that keeps us confused and divided against each other.<br/>
The ridiculously wrong-headed Trump presents a huge opportunity to build a political counter movement that cannot be co-opted by the corporate masters.<br/>

<p>There has been a lot of coverage of trump&#39;s policy failings and appointment issues...</p>

<p>Maybe the focus is what it is now because no legislation is moving and a special counsel has been appointed?</p>

<p>Trump firing Comey, Sessions recusal, Flynn grand jury, congressional investigations - these are all news. Covering them isn&#39;t indicative of a conspiracy of media outlets. At least not to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the government shills come from both sides, not only CTR/Shar3blue/DNC but also Alt-Right/Mossad/CIA/NSA/KGB. Together, they form a very powerful barrier against spreading the truth as criticism of both sides is impossible without attacks against the person who criticized them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people misinterpret a deep distrust of the MSM and establishment politicians, and the narrative they&quot;re shoving down everyone&#39;s throats as support for Trump. They don&#39;t get people who don&#39;t &quot;pick a side.&quot; Questioning the mainstream narrative gets you accused of being a &quot;Donny worshipper.&quot; And most of those people are shills. You need to stop taking what users like that accuse people of at face value and see what most users here are actually saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it appears to be Trump vs the Deep State.  Most here love anything that takes on the Deep State. Personally I don&#39;t care for Trumps policies,  but it seems obvious that MSM and Intel and Dems will stop at nothing to get rid of him and that makes me ask, why? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>(a) traditional party politics are of no consequence to the real power &gt;structures within Western global late-capitalist societies.
Are these parties so powerful that they could never be infiltrated by forces of good?
(b) Trump was born rich, has been a member of the elite all of his &gt;life, and demonstrates regularly many Illuminati/Luciferian &gt;tendencies (eg trying to fuck his own children, shadowy meetings &gt;with shady people, family empire building, unexplained cash flows &gt;and shady business deals, even doesnt look like a real human &gt;being and probably isn&#39;t etc etc) 
All rich people are not evil. Trump jokes a lot. What&#39;s wrong with building a family empire? You don&#39;t have to become like one of the illuminati bloodlines. Trump does a lot of business so he has been involved with his fair share of shady deals. 
(c) anyone whos allowed to become POTUS is definitely NOT on &gt;the side of the people (stand up Bernie S)
This is a point where I would disagree with many conspiracy theorists. I think giving too much credit to the degenerates known as TPTB should be avoided. Maybe there are more forces than we&#39;re aware of working for the good of man. You&#39;re here right. Looks like there&#39;s a lot of us. Maybe it&#39;s not going so well for the TPTSB.
(d) Since he&#39;s been in power things have only got worse
Conspiracies are now a daily part of public discussion. The Deep State is openly discussed in it&#39;s attempt to overthrow the sitting president. Good times if you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My biggest question. Is Trump part of a religious conspiracy to use the knowledge held by the Deep State to destroy all involved and annoint themselves the saviours of man? He&#39;s said he wants to be the most pro Israel candidate in history. Will they be part of the &#39;heroes&#39; outing the &#39;Dark&#39; religions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. I share your confusion.</p>

<p>Seems like people think he&#39;s taking on the &#39;deep state&#39;...... which is questionable but, even if he were, I&#39;m surprised that anyone (apart from his rich cronies) would assume he were doing it on their behalf.</p>
