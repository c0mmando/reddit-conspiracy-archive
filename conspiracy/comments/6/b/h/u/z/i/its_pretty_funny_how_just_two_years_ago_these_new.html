       Why do you people criticize the Donald for being a safe space when it's LITERALLY the only place Reddit you're allowed to have an opinion on our president that isn't "he's an evil Nazi dictator."

       You do understand that people have other opinions right? And reddit is a place where you DISCUSS with others. Just because you don´t agree with the opinion of someone does´t mean you are right or they are wrong...

       You're correct. People are allowed to have other opinions. But when those opinions are almost always exactly parroting whatever CNN or WaPo is saying, and it's always after they say it, then yeah I'm going to dismiss whatever the sheep are telling me.

       Again you just assume that because someone things Trump is bad that is because of the media... How about him being a racist, self centered, impulsive, rhetorically weak, pathological lying old man he was his whole life. But the difference is: his actions now affect the whole world. If this doesn't scare you then you are seriously out of touch with the world

       Are you kidding me? Trump was an ashole his whole life. He ruined countless lives and nobody took him serious. The guy is a joke and a fucking TV personality. I saw him on a fucking WWF show... and this is your president? Wake up dude

       And to answer your question: Your comments make me assume you are a fan of our great leader. You knew that people would react to the TD mentioning this way but you choose to pick such a title on purpose. Now you are deleting your first comment and accuse me of being a shill. You know who does shit like this? Shills. Or idiots. Sometimes people are both. So have a good one... i´m done here

        Why do you people criticize the Donald for being a safe space when it's LITERALLY the only place Reddit you're allowed to have an opinion on our president that isn't "he's an evil Nazi dictator."

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wat, are you serious? They ban anyone that says anything negative about Trump, that is the definition of a safe space. And you are not looking hard my friend, I don't think there are many, if any subs that will ban you and not allow you to make positive statements about our president.

       the_donald is a fuckhole regardless of how you feel about the president. You're not even allowed to hold a negative opinion of Israel or you're banned. That is probably one of the reasons why it's referred to as a "safe space" and I really hate those words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I don't think he's an evil Nazi dictator but he's definitely a par for the course status quo president. He's about as establishment as establishment gets. He's making himself look guilty on purpose to hide the fact that he's shooting us straight into banker's WWIII and it's blatantly obvious to anyone that looks past the fake Russia veil.
