<p>Wat, are you serious? They ban anyone that says anything negative about Trump, that is the definition of a safe space. And you are not looking hard my friend, I don&#39;t think there are many, if any subs that will ban you and not allow you to make positive statements about our president.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s an evil Nazi dictator but he&#39;s definitely a par for the course status quo president. He&#39;s about as establishment as establishment gets. He&#39;s making himself look guilty on purpose to hide the fact that he&#39;s shooting us straight into banker&#39;s WWIII and it&#39;s blatantly obvious to anyone that looks past the fake Russia veil. <a href="https://youtu.be/qL7-eDxw700">StormCloudsGathering</a> sums it up nicely in 6 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you kidding me? Trump was an ashole his whole life. He ruined countless lives and nobody took him serious. The guy is a joke and a fucking TV personality. I saw him on a fucking WWF show... and this is your president? Wake up dude</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And to answer your question: Your comments make me assume you are a fan of our great leader. You knew that people would react to the TD mentioning this way but you choose to pick such a title on purpose. Now you are deleting your first comment and accuse me of being a shill. You know who does shit like this? Shills. Or idiots. Sometimes people are both. So have a good one... i´m done here </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plus plenty of other places you can make pro Trump posts and comments, but they&#39;ll get heavily downvoted rather than deleted.</p>

<p>Trump supporters tend to shitpost and call people cucks then complain they got banned for supporting Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still salty I got banned from the_donald despite never posting there. It was right before his AMA. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny when someone posts a lie in that sub and the mods figure it out. All of the comments from long time subs calling out the lie get removed. They are terrified of dissent. </p>
