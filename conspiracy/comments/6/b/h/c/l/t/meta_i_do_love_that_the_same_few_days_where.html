       The President can declassify information legally, yes, but sharing that information with foreign countries, against national intelligence advice is not legally or morally legit.
      </p>

       Notice he does this shit when the pressure is on for the investigation and firing of Comey. He's not an idiot, but he is ignorant of the laws and structure of the government. I doubt he could pass the immigration naturalization exam.

       It is actually perfectly legal. That is the ENTIRE point of him having that authority. The morality of it is meaningless because everyone who was a principal player in the meeting said that the source and methods were protected.

       This whole Russian narrative reminds me of something, my grandparents on both sides, and my parents are both religious.   When my generation was born, at first we went to church with them when we were forced to, but when we started questioning things, it got wonky. We didn't blindly believe what we were told, and I am now not religious at all (I went from believing to not believing), because without faith the whole religion thing falls apart due to evidence, it's a story.
       <br/>
       Time has passed from when I was a kid, and now I am married, working to support myself and my family, and I try to learn as much as possible with evidence that is supported by stuff, and change my views along with it.
       <br/>
       Meanwhile, my grandparents and family are still chugging right along on the train tracks, saying prayers at dinner, going to church all the time, following the T.V. narrative and believing what they are told.
       <br/>
       I think the world is a place where change is a constant, everything is constantly changing all around us all the time.
       <br/>
       Can the U.S. not be allies with Russia? I know they are a world superpower like we are.
       <br/>
       But I just can't help but think people like my grandparents are running the show and are in control. Trying to cling onto a very old narrative that has worked for so many in the past, but this time we have the internet to fact check any data.
       <br/>
       Is change in the world structure, working together with one another, really a bad idea?
       <br/>
       Imagine if the divide and conquer stopped.  What would TPTB do then for control?  War, and propaganda are their weapons of choice, what if we could stop that from happening?  I imagine this dying system would finally collapse, and hopefully something better will come after it. Something worth uniting for.
       <br/>
       My thoughts, sorry. Have a good one.

       Explain to me how the murder of Seth Rich has no merit.
       <br/>
       We know documents from the DNC were leaked.
We know a prominent member of the DNC was murdered.
We now know through private investigation there's substantial evidence he contacted wikileaks before his death.
Contacts within the DC police are hush hush on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there hasn't been a shred of evidence of Russia collusion. Just opinions from DNC controlled outlets.
America has interfered with worldy democratic process for well over 50 years. So when they're so quick to play the Russian card immediately after they lose the election.... well it's a pretty clear indicator it's an opposing parties false narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you'll have better luck over at r/politics. Or work on your script a little more.

       Apart from, of course, multiple members of the Trump campaign having proven contacts with Russian operatives, Trump cabinet members being fired/recusing themselves left and right and Trump admitting to sharing classified information with Russian officials in a meeting where no american press, but only Russian press was allowed.

       Yep, nothing to see here tovarish. God-emperor Trump is love and life. Russia story is nothing but mainstream media attacking glorious Putin and Trump, comrade.
