       like on the real though, actual conspiracy theorists dont buy into the two-party dichotomous nonsense. If you really want to know who runs the show, its multi-national corporations and financial institutions. Thats how we can deduce the shills, if youre pushing the political narrative - you know its coming from a horses mouth thats feeding you shit. horseshit.

       Obligatory link to the censored RT sponsored 3rd party presidential debates in 2012 hosted by Larry King... you didnt hear about it because of the media blackout? It was probably some russian propoganda anyway /s..:

       Does hating Hillary Clinton for what she does, hating the DNC for what they do, and hating Obama for doing what he did mean I'm playing politics? Sometimes I wonder if I'm biased because those are all admittedly democrats and their organization, but they just seem to be the most blatantly evil over and over and over, so if you collect blatantly evil things, it seems like you collect things that somehow involve the democratic party a lot of the time.

       How old are you? I'm guessing you must be pretty young if you don't know the recent history of the Republican party in this country. Reagan, Nixon, George Bush Sr., Bush Jr., Cheney, Rumsfeld, Dennis Hastert...I could go on, but there's a good starting list of people for you to look into.

       haha I'm 29. I remember all the shady shit, and now that you mention it it was mostly repubs back then. I guess it was just that I became aware of the fucked up parts of the world while a democrat presided over it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still though, there's not been anything so blatantly fucked up as how the DNC/media/
       <em>
        our own president
       </em>
       handled this last election, right? I mean that's directly attributable to the republican party, not just stuff that was done by republicans or concurrent to when we had a republican president. I guess maybe that's where the feeling comes from. That and I really hate their PC "white men are the devil" rhetoric.

       Since you're asking about it, my own personal experience with the Republican party started in 2008 when I started doing volunteer work for the Ron Paul campaign. I followed that campaign very closely, and was in contact with other members of the campaign around the country. Everyone I knew who was part of the Paul campaign talked about how horribly they were being treated by the Republican establishment in general within their states. Just go watch those early debates where Ron Paul faces off against people like Giuliani on stage. The party HATED Ron Paul. It was very similar to the way we saw the DNC treat Sanders this last election. Honestly, I thought the Republicans treated Paul even worse than the DNC treated Sanders.

       I highly recommend a documentary by Adam Curtis called The Power of Nightmares if you want to learn about the rise of the neoconservatives in the US and the damage they've caused. And if you want a good critique of both parties in recent US history, check out Oliver Stone's Untold History of the United States series.

       The Power of Nightmares is brilliant. I'm sure it's available on YouTube - anyone who's in this sub who hasn't seen it should do themselves a favor and watch it immediately. (And also possible all the other stuff Adam Curtis has done.)

       The biggest problem is that while the real issues to tackle are not partisan, there is no option to actually ELECT somebody not playing that game. The other issue is that on the left, there is a complete regression from actual liberal ideologies. The left has regressed into this bizarre marxist-communist social and moral relativist institution of cultural subversion, while the right is devolving into disparate groups of everything from literal nazis to people who just don't deny basic biology and don't embrace every tenet of complete moral relativism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the bottom line is its difficult to move past republican vs democrat when they are the only two options. Not that either will screw you any less.

       The solution is education, but it's not easy and it's not quick.  There are more people who don't vote than who vote for any one candidate, and there are a shit ton of people who only voted for one party or the other because they felt they had no other choice.

       The idea of massive, powerful government controlling every aspect of life is absurd.  These morons can't even pass legislation regularly and pretty much everything in the US is falling apart.  They have power over small groups and that's it, and the reason they have that power is because the American people are lazy and apathetic.

       I know you're being sarcastic, but its worth noting that trump is not an outsider, he's a new money elite meaning his ties to the corporations and bankers are not as historic but just as real. He is also an idiot whose beliefs fluctuate with whomever he talked to last, and his lack of understanding and blatant anti-intellectualism could be disastrous for things like the environment and economic stability.

       I work in academia in a very liberal area, maybe I just see the worst of the distilled left, but I've been a lifelong supporter of what I always considered liberal politics. There is a cancerous ideology among college culture that currently dominates the landscape. Here is a video outlining many of the key tenets of this ideology.

       The Iraq War. But the Establishment does not know party lines. I think the biggest point of contention right now is with Trump and where his allegiances are, though. Some people see him as genuinely fighting the Establishment for the American people, and others see him as simply another member of the Establishment who has fooled his supporters.

       what party is selling your internet data, dismantling the epa, and pushing forward a revised health plan that is cheaper on the elite and offers worst healthcare to everybody else? maybe you should look into possible partisanship. the democrats arent amazing, or even good, but if you think the republicans are the good guys you probably need to take a second look at your influences

       Or you could just label yourself as a non-partisan and still come to the conclusion that both parties are equally corrupt, and also realize that all parties are susceptible to corruption, and call it a day.

       Many of us here are rather impartial in regards to influences. You can criticize and refuse to support the Democratic Party and still despise and refuse to support the Republican Party. There's really no place for partisanship these days.

       You're on a conspiracy subreddit. You say you're not partisan. Why not give this whole thing a fair shake and let's get to the bottom of pedogate, seth rich, and the rest of the heinous crap that's been happenig. We're fighting dem apologists on one side, and republican snakes on the other. Get over the "this one is worse than the other" and realize that this is the one chance that the people will have to take back their country and government. This stuff is a lot more insidious than healthcare, climate change, or any of these other issues. And the more that people march about inconsequential bull, or whine about the Russia narrative, the mire time we're wasting not investigating the corruption in washington or properly vetting the legislation that is getting pushed through. Everyone is exhausted because spoiled children can't get over the election. This is all a lot bigger than that.

       there doesnt seem to be much to pizzagate. it involves an anonymous 4chan code, reading emails out of contextand interpreting them solely through the worst possible lens. Seth Rich I am open to wrong doing, but I dont think the PI is saying anything new and the timing + the fact that it is being carpet bombed here and on t_d makes me VERY suspicious of somebody/some groups motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact I am suspicious that so far louise menschs grand theory (which only seems to be getting hotter) involves only repubs. Usually corruption doesnt work that way, the money crosses the aisle.

       As far as Im concerned, anyone who wants to denounce the russia theory is dishonest. Theyd have to start from this point for me: did russia try to influence our election and the french election? if the response is I dont know or there is no proof then we dont have a lot in common. Disregarding the intelligence agencies and what we can see and interact with ourselves on twitter, here, and fb just reeks of dishonesty and ulterior motives.

       If you hate the DNC for what was revealed in those emails, I can't even begin to imagine how you would feel with an actual political scandal. That was the most boring, vanilla, scandal free bullshit in those emails that it was frankly a total letdown.

       There was no substantial evidence for 'russiagate' and it appeared from the ether only shortly after major revelations via Wikileaks. The media echoed off itself to bolster its position against trump/russia while simultaneously discrediting 'conspiracist' and self investigation. Showergate was especially ludicrous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've already stated I'm not pro trump; being a business tycoon I'm sure he's dirty to some degree. As dirty as the rest of them? We'll see, they seem to mingle in separate circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia has little to gain from rigging our elections and the initial 'russian hack' (if there was one; i believe the whole hacking was retroactively fabricated) was actually the CIA who have interfered with plenty of elections so it's not far fetched they could meddle in our especially this being an oligarchy and all that

       I'm not sure I agree with you that because Russiagate appeared after Wikileaks that it is therefore false. I don't see how that discredits the Wikileaks revelations, more explains them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia has an immense amount to gain by implementing Trump, from reducing economic sanctions on Russia, to having a pro-isolationist President in the White House Russia has more space to move into on the global political scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mentioned it elsewhere today but read through this:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, when you go back a few months regarding Russia's role in the election it was not liberal media and the DNC that accused Russia but a large amount of intelligence agencies:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#U.S._intelligence_analysis">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#U.S._intelligence_analysis
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA, GCHQ, Department of Homeland Security, FBI etc, all said there was evidence there. This, if I'm honest, is more conspiracy worthy than any narrative regarding the role the media players. Either the intelligence agencies worked against the President and faked evidence of highly sensitive hacking from a long standing enemy nation, or the President was helped into office by a long standing enemy nation. Either is terrifying.

      <p>
       Then they bitch is the MSM is covering something or not covering it. "Well, the MSM is talking about russia, must be fake!" and then "The MSM isn't talking about seth rich enough, so must be real!" but when they do talk about it and don't pimp your spin....well, fuck, I dunno, it just gets complicated when you will only accept what you want to hear. That isn't investigating.

       <p>
        A "national underground network" of pink pistol-packing lesbians is terrorizing America. "All across the country," they are raping young girls, attacking heterosexual males at random, and forcibly indoctrinating children as young as 10 into the lesbian lifestyle, according to a shocking June 21 segment on the popular Fox News Channel program, "The O'Reilly Factor."

       But the problem is you could say that about ANY message. You could call someone a shill for supporting Clinton and that shills are paid to support Clinton. You could call someone a shill for supporting the Green Party (which I do support, full disclosure), because the Koch brothers helped finance them in certain states to pull votes from Democrats. You could call someone a shill for supporting Trump. You can be a pro-Russian or anti-Russian shill, as both of those exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling someone a shill is just noise. If you have actual evidence that someone is a shill (like them forgetting the switch accounts or something), then you've got something to go on.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I first joined Reddit on my last account, this sub was much less dismissive of people and opinions (it was also way more focused, at least it seemed to me, on the shadowy activities of corporations -- but this is anecdotal on my part so it's mostly worthless). There is literally a post on the front page that is a screenshot of a 4chan post. I think that because the mainstream is actively looking into conspiracy related to Trump, this sub, as a pseudo-counterculture/fringe (I don't mean that as a negative) group, goes full contrarian. "The mainstream is considering Trump conspiracies, which means the REAL conspiracies involve Trump's enemies" - is basically the way this sub feels sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The South Korean leader is meeting with Trump and nobody on this sub has talked about or mentioned the way that, for example, his insistence on them pursuing nuclear weapons coincides with his business relationships to companies that would get those government contracts. But that's not sexy and has no infographs and requires a little bit of digging, so nobody cares.

       Nah man, you
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       say that about any message, but it wouldn't be true unless shills fought for it, too. It would just be a lot of hot air.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should know, though: There aren't very many confirmed shill organizations. There are a few for the left, a very large concerted nation-wide effort going on in Israel, and that's pretty much all we know definitively.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just going to be a thing that people who are sensitive to patterns are going to recognize when there are inorganic messages being attempted to be passed off as organic ones, and they're going to call you a shill if you fall for it when everyone else doesn't. Maybe it's too tough of a learning curve for some, but it's the way it has to be until we get some sort of legislation in the works to allow us to fight back against them. I'm working on a few ideas...

       I know that Russia has state sponsored shill activity which was proven by leaked documents from 2011/2012. Would you be able to give me a source on the ones from the left / Israel? Any searching for Israel brings up some blatantly unsourced crackpot stuff with anti-semetic undertones and the left one is a little too vague.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, would right wing brigading from 4chan constitute shilling to you? Because it is pretty clear that that has been a phenomenon of the past year or so, but without profit being a part of it.

       Well stated and accurate.

       I usually find that people yelling shill at you are probably just protecting and because they just sit around and shill they believe everyone else does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many/most people come to their own conclusions on things but according to these people every human on reddit/elsewhere is being paid to post their opinion. It's a cop-out and an attempt to weasel out of admitting other people don't believe their BS.

       But that's not true. I've researched it and there are a few "leftist" shill organizations, but there aren't any for repubs. They just do the whole targeted ads based on metadata thing.

       We could get into it, if you really want to.. There are really only a handful of shill organizations that really push narratives en masse. There are a ton of "influence marketers" who push products, and there is a shit ton of vote manipulation going on these days, not to mention the protection-racket that is online review sites these days, but dedicated shilling teams? Only a few.

       Confirmation bias. The Trump supporters want this to be true so they ridicule anyone who is waiting for the evidence before believing it. Those same Trump supporters would be claiming "fake news" if the roles were reversed and an anonymous source was providing info damaging to Trump in any way.

       It's not about Trump. I was responding to someone who was talking about those who are reserving judgment until we have some solid evidence. I was pointing out the double standard a lot of users here seem to have, depending on which side of the political aisle they lean towards. Too many people have confirmation bias towards things they want to believe are true, but then put on their skeptic hats all of a sudden when they see something they want to be false.

       I believe that Seth Rich was murdered by a Russian operative who in fact was part of the Lizard Illuminati. They live in in the South Pole where the secret nazi gold base is, and they are actively projecting a round earth to fool the people into thinking the earth is round. They work for the deep state and have a gay frog sex ring.

       If he was shot in the back and they took nothing, that would point more to someone not worried about potential evidence falling into the hands of investigators - if this was a "Clinton hit" I highly doubt they would have walked away without his laptop, wallet etc. The people that do this stuff are
       <strong>
        <em>
         professionals
        </em>

       , and only an amateur would leave anything to doubt as why the man was shot.

       And why would they use an amateur? The way
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       talks Hillary has connections to the CIA and Private Military industry as well as other intelligence services and can afford a professional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logically they have no reason to use anyone that would leave evidence at the scene and yet all this is predicated on evidence left at the scene; A professional would also make sure that anything of value was gone so investigators would assume robbery gone wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was found at 4:19 in the morning apparently after refusing a ride from the bar where he was drinking and was found by officers on patrol who reported hearing gunshots - thus it is unlikely he would have his laptop but his wallet and cell phone, as well as his watch and keys, were still on the body. Whoever shot rich had plenty of time to search his body and relieve him of his valuables as well as evidence, and a professional would have taken those things, as he would need the keys to secure Rich's laptop from his home, as well as further lead investigators to believe robbery gone wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all very problematic, as rich people don't need to hire amateur hour weekend warriors from the back of soldier of fortune - they hire professionals that cover their tracks, And this seems like someone who wasn't worried about evidence or investigative doubt.

       Why leave evidence that would point back to them and aid investigators, unless some other party had Rich Shot and have no interest other than muddying the waters and introducing doubt? 
Maybe someone in the DNC did it, but not for the reasons espoused, ( like a personal vendetta ) or it was another party altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's increasing hard to imagine the Clinton foundation employing amateurs when they are already under the microscope especially considering their wealth and reach, while I imagine the DNC would have the Clinton foundation's resources at their disposal and would likely leave them to choose who to employ.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, it's more likely that if either group is guilty, the decision was taken and executed by a compartmentalized group within the organization that might have the implicit support of whoever is in charge ( they would be an invisible part of that organization ) but operates outside their purview to contain the possible collateral damage and fallout.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how a group like that would operate within any of the letter agencies and those agencies would be the most likely sources of those groups personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that is the case, any investigation would see these people charged with the crime, as Hillary or whoever would have plausible deniability. Whoever is in charge might not even know Themselves if it was someone within their organization as they would never be part of the decision process or even have personally met the people involved.

       Do you even know who Rod Wheeler is? He worked for the mainstream media. He promoted conspiracies he had to apologize for in the past.

       This could be a deep state plan to discredit anything about Seth Rich by tying his name to it. Seth's family has already condemned the people promoting the story.

       Nothing wrong with making money per se, but when you make money and don't give a shit about anyone below you, and you scam people by creating sub prime loans that you know will be defaulted on and your workers are just faceless numbers that are expendable and your company makes the feel that way and makes them work in fear of being let go and you meet with all your friends in secret meeting to plan wars so that you can sell weapons and make billions off the death of people in other countries.

       I dont have a problem with 1% who made their money and aren't part of the wars and manipulating that go on in the stock market, banks, options, etc. But that's fairly rare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you make a certain amount it's only right you give back to the community. 1 person really doesn't need more than a billion anyway. Once you have your mansions, car collection, whores, businesses, drugs, and restaurants after a while you get older, wiser, evolve and realize it's good to give back.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past the 1%ers always gave back in big ways and while our capitalist system has gotten us and the world to where it is today, it is no longer suitable because it doesn't give a shit about ethics, morals, values, and people. It creates this atmosphere where the most important thing is the bottom line to the stock owners no matter the costs, the pollution, deaths, ethics, oil spills, etc. It's profit at all cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just watched a brilliant documentary I'll see if I can link it here. It was about how Western capitalism created a movement in Japan of workers putting their jobs, bosses, company first and working God awful 19-20 your days leading to the deaths and health decline in many workers due to exhaustion. This is what capitalism does, or rather it's dark side is that it doesn't give a shit about the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       No we are seeing efficient collectives rise up like uber/lyft, decentralization of news via citizen reporters and currency like cryptocurrencies. Some grocery store and other chains are being made to be employee owned. Things are rapidly changing and the old capitalism is on the way out to be replaced by something new much more efficient, inclusive of more people, ethics, values, etc. Also A.I. robotics will absolutely upend the system

       I'm so tired of the shills here. Every time we get a decently upvoted post in our sub, it gets flooded with shills that have either never been here before or have no idea that we don't trust
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       we're told. I'm highly suspicious that they're an army of low-wage Washington Post employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       They then flood the comments and yap at each other on and on about Russia or whatever and call anyone that doesn't have the Washington Post logo tattooed on their eyelids a Trump supporter. Their MSM rhetoric gets a ton of suspicious upvotes real fast and then the original conversation is buried and turned into another r/politics talking point festival.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Stargate posts were fun because the shills have no interest in anything fun and we can talk about interesting things without having to deal with their robotic script bullshit.

       What's worse is the mods are cool with them being here. I just wish I could sit down with someone who agrees with shilling and talk with them, just ask them questions and have them be honest with me about why they're doing it/why they think it's ok to do. No one ever even wants to admit that shills exist, much less being one, much less saying their reasoning for being one.. It's so sucky..

       Well it isn't the mods' job to filter out people who take The Washington Post as gospel. It's our job to downvote them into obscurity. But there's obviously more of them than there are of us, and we're the ones that get buried while their pre-scripted messages rise to the top. I don't have a solution, but goddamn I'm tired of it.

       We could make a law requiring shills to identify themselves when asked. Even if Reddit made it a permaban offense to ask, the law would still apply, and I know a lot of people would spam IPs to fight the system once they'd been given a weapon with which to do so.

       Double-edged sword. I don't think you should be allowed to literally shill for a corporation on the internet without disclosing yourself, but there are also people that exist that truly believe in the MSM and think they tell the truth. When you truly
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       something, it's very difficult to unbelieve. You can go to r/politics on any given day and find people that just seep adoration and applause for the CIA Washington Post and have literally no idea that they're being mass manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally in this sub we benefit from not having to worry about MSM programmed robots.. until a big story drops. When that happens, everything goes right out the fucking window and the resident Washington Post retards flood the place and there's nothing we can do about it.

       That's why you have a law that they have to identify themselves when asked. You would be respectful about it, just a quick "hey are you a shill by chance?", then if they aren't, they could just say nah, and if they didn't respond, you could take them to court once you had proof that they were a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could make it to where any corporation that employs them must keep a record of all the usernames associated with them in a public database, also.
      </p>
      <p>
       With those two laws, if a shill didn't answer you and they were a shill, you could take them to court, and if they did answer you and they weren't a registered shill, you could take them to court. Also of course there would be hefty fines that the corporation would be subject to, as well.

       It's not too complicated. A shill is an individual who is paid to manipulate public opinion by assuming the role of an average and ostensibly sincere user on any number of platforms, whether online or in the media. It's what is known in the advertising world as "influence marketing", and it has been especially prevalent in all forms of online social media in particular since the election. Welcome to 2017, friend! :D

       I've been accused of being a shill on this sub simply because I hate Trump.  This is the problem - when that word is used, that is typically what it's for.  There is no evidence of any paid shills on this sub.

       <em>
        rarely

       ever see anyone use the word now that it's all thought-crime status. It does suck, though, that shills can have that effect; that they might sometimes be advocating the right information, but the way they do it automatically invalidates it. They should have seen that coming, in our defense.

       I bitched to the mods about their lack of effort in regards to certain agenda pushing posts happening last week. They tried not to reply. I msgd again and got an "ehhh its not a big deal reply" so I pushed back again and got muted for 72 hours from messaging the mods. Such great leadership by our website janitors

       That's to buy it off based on the previous valuation I am guessing? Doubt the owners would sell for any less than 2.5x the current valuation. And we all know Silicon Valley loves to artificially hype the values of their entities...

       It's classic projection. They are shills and/or bot accounts. Since they know their side is doing it, they accuse the other side. You see this all the time in politics. Now that our sub has been compromised by t_d bots, we're seeing it here too from these 50 day old accounts.

       One time one of the mods of the_dipshit was caught signing into different accounts to argue with himself, in order to push a narrative. Do you have evidence, because there was direct evidence of that. So what's your point? Either you're making a baseless claim, or both sides do it and you should get over it and learn to think for yourself and not worry about "shills" as some boogeyman trying to destroy your precious beliefs.

       THANK YOU! I will always try and find the truth, with all evidence and information presented. r/conspiracy is the most scrupulous bunch of people i have ever met, and yet when anything involving politics is presented on r/conspiracy the name calling is intensified by 300 fold!!! The regulars here know what is going on, but the vote bots and comment bots outnumber the real people actually in here. So then it goes back to personal verification of all info presented and coming to your educated decisions.

       main consensus is that we (truth seekers) would like to see justice for seth rich; and that consensus is being convoluted with the narrative that 'oh youre just a trump shill pushing this narrative to obfuscate the russian thingy'

       The Rich family spokesman said: "It's sad but unsurprising that a group of media outlets who have repeatedly lied to the American people would try and manipulate the legacy of a murder victim in order to forward their own political agenda.  I think there is a special place in hell for people like that."
      </p>
      <p>
       Family statement: "Even if tomorrow an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered, and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so."
      </p>
      <p>
       "We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family."

       It only looks weird if you think the DNC murdered Seth Rich. In a reality where he got shot to death at 4 am in a neighborhood where there had been a bunch of other armed robberies, it makes total sense that the family of a DNC staffer would be represented by a Democratic PR firm.

       Have you considered that Bauman isn't privy to the details of the investigation? Wheeler, the person who is actually investigating, said that there was some degree of email exchange between Rich and Wikileaks. So its the investigator's word against that of the "family spokesman" who happens to run a progressive think tank.

       So? Wheeler is a frequent fox news contributer and paid for by a third party to investigate "on the families behalf". Who cares if the spokesman works for a progressive think tank. Progressivism isn't suspicious, Seth Rich was obviously a liberal Democrat himself.

       I'm not full-on believing anything at this point. All I know is that I'm far more inclined to believe an actual investigator, even if he tends to have right-wing views, over a DNC operative. And if you read closely, you will see that Bauman didn't actually negate the claims made by Wheeler, he just cast doubt on his conclusions. As a lawyer I recognize that sort of language immediately.

       I don't know what you are talking about. This sub is called r/conspiracy, we are discussing conspiracies. That doesn't mean we wholeheartedly believe them, not to mention that this sub is full of different people with different beliefs. It is fine to discuss anonymously sourced information, and especially so if it is coming from someone who is actually involved in an investigation. That doesn't at all mean that they should be completely trusted, not even close.

       as long as those conspiracy theories are about Seth Rich or DNC rigging. If you mention something like Russia then you it's a completely different set of rules where you need signed affidavits, a priest, three HD 1080p recordings, the sun, the moon, and the all the other planets in the solar system must be perfectly aligned, no clouds visible in the western hemisphere, AND THEN a discussion is permitted to be had about Trump-Russia ties.

       Playing partisan politics while pretending to care about a dead man is one of the most disgusting things I can imagine. Happens so much lately, where people pretend they're about "justice" for some cause, when it turns out to just be an excuse to go on a witch hunt against people they don't like/agree with, with little to no evidence.

       Also democrats did the same thing to Trump with Ryan Owens death.

       Everyone should be concerned with Seth Rich's death. How could they say he was robbed when he had his wallet on him. That is clear cut corruption on the part of the DC police.

       Of course wanting justice for Seth doesn't make you a trump shill but all the people saying that if this story is true then the russia story is fake. This not true at all both could be true. That makes them either shills or dumb.

       There were multiple leaks/hacks. The media tried to convolute the story and make us believe it was a singular leak by the Russians. I think Podesta might have been Russia, DNC was probably Rich.

       Gee, seems awfully convenient, doesn't it ? Almost as if someone (who has admitted that they are not neutral on the matter) is trying to manufacture an orgy of evidence. Why would Rich, if indeed he was sending emails to Wikileaks,
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       send those? And if that's what he sent, then what happens to the story that he was Wikileaks' source for the whole thing?

       Yes, because he's a paragon of neutrality. Certainly not the opportunistic sort. He can't have it both ways, trying to make Rich look like the source for the whole thing and now trying to make it look like Rich sent just those emails.

       The sort of logic that annoys the piss out of those of us who are far-left, non-partisan, progressives who are also critical thinkers - that's who. I can hate Trump and still not buy the Russian-Hacking-Narrative or Trump-Russia-Narrative that the DNC is selling. Contrary to popular belief.

       The kind of logic, where a distinct line is drawn. You're either for the DNC and TPTB, or you're not. No middle ground here. It's how the D's operated during the primary/general. They deal in absolutes. They keep this up and 2018 will be a bad year for them, even with a president polling as bad as Trump.

       Just because someone posts on both r/the_donald and r/conspiracy doesn't mean anything. There's overlap of topics that aren't discussed elsewhere on reddit due to censorship or lack of interest. For example, I hate Trump, but I've spent plenty of time in r/the_donald, especially last fall when there was a new batch of emails released by Wikileaks every day. Lately, not as much ever since I was banned for saying I agreed with Trump about how great universal healthcare was, but I've been checking out the Seth Rich threads there. Because I have an interest in seeing this mysterious unsolved murder victim get justice. Trump is a scumbag criminal and I hate that he's the president, but that has no bearing at all on how I feel about if murder victims deserve justice. Jesus.

       This is hilarious.  You say "family spokesman" who contradicted the "private investigator".
      </p>
      <p>
       The "private investigator" is a professional Fox News pundit.  He is even fraudulently representing himself as a PI in DC and lying about being hired by the Rich family.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have two paid shills, from either side, swooping down on this poor family.  Literally coming out of the woodwork just to make noise in the system with nothing of substance to add to the story.

       So, what's happening on this subreddit right now is a perfect, glaring example of controlled propaganda. The MOMENT damaging evidence comes out pointing to a massive, legit, bonafide conspiracy inside the White House, a discarded, discredited and forgotten footnote from the presidential campaign gets brought up out of the blue and dominates all discussion here. I've never seen such a rapid shift in discourse on any reddit community that isn't non-organic manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess you can want justice for Seth all you want, and that's cool and all, but why all of a sudden? Is there any new evidence? Any new bombshell hard evidence (or hard evidence at all for that matter)? Why is this being dug up after not reaching the front page for months?

       There is new evidence, yes. The push back on this forum against the Russian narrative is because it's the same Us v Them bullshit they've been shoveling down our throats and using to control us forever. But it isn't​ working anymore.

       Because the family even came out and said this latest surge in interest on Rich's death is nothing more than a push from the right-wing media to distract people from Trump's latest breach and further selling out of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is getting his money's worth in effort, but the truth came out in less than 24 hours - you shills can't suppress facts, no matter how much money Trump throws at you.

      <p>
       Also, I can't wait until he refuses to pay you when he realizes you can't pull off what he paid you to do. I bet then you all pull his dick out from your mouths and start spitting some truth... after you you clear your throats of his old man cock smegma.

       It's the logic of throwing sand into the gears of reasonable discourse with inane arguments. It's the logic of making us question our own sanity by drowning us in a sea of illogical arguments. It's the logic of getting us to waste time on the topic of shills instead of advancing ideas. It doesn't have to make sense or win a debate competition to be effective.

       I was following you unti intelligence talk. I have no clue if Trump really did share anything but if he did it was a biiiig mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       a) the ally who shared has an extensive network of personnel deep in ISIS
      </p>
      <p>
       b) they told the US not to share
      </p>
      <p>
       Consequences
      </p>
      <p>
       a) allies intelligence network is destroyed because ISIS has/will destroy it
      </p>
      <p>
       b) allies will not share the most top secret information
      </p>
      <p>
       c) agent who got the certain piece of intel is probably in an ISIS torture chamber
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump could've shared the information with Russia low key instead of making a spectacle of it but he did and now he done fucked up. I don't think anyone is even saying giving out the info was illegal that is not even the argument of anyone, the whole point is that it was a dumbass move.

       This phony baloney "why can't we be angry at trump AND investigate Seth rich" nonsense needs to stop. Anyone with two eyes can see there is a massive push to cover any trump news with Seth rich details, some of them this forum has talked about ad nausiem. Funny enough I do find Seth's death highly suspicious and I believe the clues point to a government hit. But this conspiracy and murder are being used as propaganda to hide trumps issues right now which highly point to a conspiracy. I don't think most of the Seth rich posters actually give a shit. Hes a means to an end for them - locking up Hillary / Deflecting from Trump.
