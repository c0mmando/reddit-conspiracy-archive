       You linked me his tweet in your strange writing fashion, but nothing in it says classified information.  If you think delegates from Russia and the USA meeting in the WH are just going to trade jokes and sip some vodka rather than exchange information via dialogue then you aren't thinking clearly. There is no mention of classified information being shared.

       That is because what he disclosed was classified until he exposed it to the Russians.

       Do they trade information that other countries expected us to not to rely to Russia on? With that being said, trying to get closer to Russia is the last thing that our country should be worrying about, imo.

       So he still shared confidential material? The fact we may possibly know what events they are relating to doesn't declassify them. We know we are at war with ISIS, that doesn't make it okay to leak confidential material relating to it.
