       For the Russia narrative we have to rely on IC community for information and WH, Anonymous and Media sources we don't know whether to trust.   The Seth Rich story has an actual dead body.

       Also, trump is a trainwreck- not sure if he's smart and savvy enough to pull off some elaborate collusion cover up. possibly though.  The DNC and Clinton forces seem to me very politically savvy.

       I prefer to be an enigma to people, especially to people who always rely on diving into someone's posting history instead of just answering and addressing the question or issue at hand. I like taking people like you out of your comfort zone.

       He's not the source, though. He's a Fox News contributor who claims to have spoken to an anonymous FBI source. That's like saying the authors of the WaPo article were the sources. No, they claim to have spoken with their sources.

       The Seth Rich story points to a

        major

       conspiracy being true: a DNC insider leaking information to WikiLeaks being murdered to silence and cover up a massive web of corruption.

      <p>
       The Trump story is a drop in the bucket of many claims that have been made over the past few months by an anonymous source. Not to mention, even if Trump did pass on this info to the Russians, it wouldn't be criminal.

       I don't know is if this is true, but I'd believe it, and there's a LOT of really stupid sleepy people on this sub who wrongly believe themselves to be awake. Talk about how there open minded, unless it involves trump, them they're authoritarian as can be, clinging to the word of the state. On r/conspiracy.

       I believe there are secret dealings and fiscal stuff with Russian sources, yes.

       Look, whenever an important conspiracy story breaks, the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is littered with reposts.
      </p>

       I've removed several Seth Rich posts already. This isn't a big deal, it happens
       <em>
        all the time
       </em>
       . Things will die down in 24-48 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       The surprising thing is seeing long-time
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       users confused by this...this is par for the course on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       .

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why is there not 1 submission about Trump revealing secrets to Russia?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are several posts about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       is
       <em>
        not

       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       When the top
       <em>
        five
       </em>
       posts on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       are
       <em>
        literally the same story and link
       </em>
       , do you honestly think
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is going to parrot that?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to discuss what the MSM is telling us to discuss, go to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , it's as simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to discuss the fringe, the unconfirmed, and the esoteric, come to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But DON'T complain (or act surprised) when
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       doesn't follow whatever happens to be trending on the front page of reddit.

       Someone claiming to be a PI working for his family went on Fox and, one, implied that Rich was the source of the DNC emails and, two, said that the DC police and FBI were in possession of a laptop showing Rich's communications with wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that this sub has long suspected Rich's murder was political, not a botcher robbery, this kind of allegation exploded.  I of course don't know if that accounts to "warranted" in your opinion, but it is what happened.

       You know how the US has been banning laptops on certain flights from Europe?  The reason is we think ISIS or Al Queda has been plotting to figure out how to smuggle a bomb on a plane in a laptop.  Trump discussed the threat with Lavrov.  The laptop ban and bomb threat are all public information.  The allegation is that Trump somehow revealed the source of the intelligence.  Specifics are not to be found anywhere, just the accusation.

       It's their last hope though, so they're REALLY pushing it. Twisting words and taking things out of context. Even outright lying.

       We're in an an information war, people, who ever gets control of the narrative first has the upper hand, no matter if its true or not. Eventually though, the truth will come out.

       Read a single article with disinformation and deflection in the comments and they will get downvoted like crazy, likely some truth will rise to the surface. Have 18 Seth Rich posts, people will give up to disinformation after glancing at like 3 of them, where the 4th might have a gem of a comment that opens their eyes.

       Agreed, while interesting,  all ive seen/heard says that while its inappropriate for him to share such detail, it wasnt illegal. on too of THAT, we still dont know what was said. more and more shady, sure, but still he flies just under the radar of law-breaking-wrongdoing via water-muddying. enough to question the administrations competence but nothing solid just yet.

       This is what I know. The CIA asked the washington post to withhold one piece of info related to this story about what Trump told the russian ambassador, and that was the city that the information was sourced from. That is the closest to a source or method that could have been revealed. A city is a pretty big haystack to find a needle in, let alone because of this high profile story, the asset will probably leave now if they were even still there.

       This is my take on the situation. The "ally" who gave us this info was Mossad, and they are incensed about Trump sharing information that they may have wanted to weaponize it against Russia (or their allies like Assad) at a later point (or currently). The fact that is came from Washington Post tips us off that this info was passed on through the CIA. This media hit is specifically Mossad punishing Trump for not pledging fealty to them.

       I'm with you on half of what you said, every one of those posts is saying the same thing. He was murdered and contacting Wikileaks. A big revelation but maybe create a megathread or something? Do we really need the other 20 threads? I know you guys probably have a tough time deleting threads because we inevitably get a new thread "OMG mods deleting Seth Rich threads, the Shills are back!!!!" It just gets annoying sometime on here.

       Most of these comments are spot on.  Seth Rich being the leaker pretty much ends the Russian narrative. I'd also like to point out the president decides what's classified and what isn't, so it's pretty much impossible for the president to reveal classified information.  And as a general rule of thumb, r/conspiracy is best viewed by sorting through new, not hot anyway.

       I think it seems more like the sub is being spammed with Seth Rich posts today in order to drown out any and all discussion and speculation about just what kinds of secrets did Trump reveal to The Russians. Did he secretly share UFO, or Antarctica information, Did he expose the lie behind our fake democracy to Russia, the Banking and Finance sector corruption of our government? The disproportional amount of dual Israel/US citizens  that populate the upper echelons of our government and have for quite some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find it odd that I am not seeing any of that discussion here. What  was the Top Secret stuff Trump gave to the Russians?

       Makes sense, whats hard is parsing through truth and lies. May I ask how you "know" these things? No sarcasm there, but there is a difference between knowing and deducing info. Again, no sarcasm intended, but its like saying that you know aliens exist because the universe is so enormous that is impossible for there to NOT be. it makes sense, but deduction reasoning doesnt prove anything. It can lead to truth, of course, but Id need a smoking gun. Share what you got, Im all ears. :)
