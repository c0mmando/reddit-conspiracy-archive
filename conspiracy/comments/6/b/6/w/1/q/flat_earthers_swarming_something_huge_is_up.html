It is not growing because of paid shills, or because the government wants to discredit conspiracy theorists. It is because there are too many lies surrounding everything having to do with NASA and the Flat Earthers have raised some incredible, valid points. So, sit back and enjoy the ride. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It says they <em>theorized</em>; that&#39;s the key word there. And when it says they determined it, it doesn&#39;t say how AT ALL. It just says they took some measurements in 2 places and <em>BAM</em> we know the shape of the earth (which isn&#39;t a globe, <em>which</em> is exactly what i was fucking saying dumbass. I never said the earth was flat, but i did say i didn&#39;t think it was a globe. Hmmmmmm lol). That was a terrible source man, it doesn&#39;t go into detail at all or explain how they measured it, or why they chose to measure those 2 places in the first place.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you serious? <em>That</em> is your argument? &quot;This random citizen who believes in flat earth made a map and it doesn&#39;t seem legit, flat earth is fake&quot;. The globe earth map is largely disproportionate as well, sooo does that mean the globe earth is fake? And who is &quot;we&quot;? NASA? It&#39;s funny how most people on this sub knows how corrupt and full of lies nasa and the elite are, yet when arguing against this, they use the shit NASA says. You can&#39;t successfully refute an argument when that argument is shit. Again, I&#39;m not a believer of flat earth but if you&#39;re gonna actually argue against them, use arguments that will work. Maybe this is why that flat earth shit is growing, because a lot of people give shit arguments against it. It&#39;s comparable to when atheists waaay back when religion was &quot;100% true&quot; tried disproving it. The religion followers would use the religion that the atheists are trying to disprove to argue on their religions behalf. </p>

<p>No, it is not. Flat projections of it, by necessity, are visually distorted - but latitude and longitude lines are accurately drawn to plainly show where disproportions are so they can still be used for navigation. And it is not just NASA that uses these globe maps, it is essentially all travel and commerce on Earth over the last 500 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should not be comparing two disparate points of view side by side. It&#39;s too complicated because the number of factors increase and you have to filter out some of the noise e.g. How much should we be talking about NASA, does it even matter?

<p>So I say cut the crap out. Go straight to what we are told about the round earth. If science text books are saying a ship disappears over the horizon because of curvature - and we can prove that is false, that&#39;s a big scandal. So it does no good to advance the flat earth idea. </p>

For all you know, you&#39;re a brain in a bucket hooked up to electrical wiring that sends those signals to the brain to make you perceive the 5 senses. If you think that&#39;s impossible than you are fucking dumb and naive/ignorant. Maybe you&#39;re in the matrix. What is life? You don&#39;t know, so get off your high horse. You may think I&#39;m crazy but you&#39;re the crazy one for not acknowledging these facts. Open your damn mind. No one understands what the consciousness is or where it&#39;s produced. Sure there are theories but that&#39;s all they are; theories.

    <div class="md"><p>Shit. Haven&#39;t gotten that far in the queue yet (we usually work most recent to oldest), I&#39;ll be removing it, and I&#39;m sure facing a pretty huge backlash. Thanks for the heads up (though I&#39;m not sure if you intended that.)</p>

<p>I personally think there might be something to this, but as a mod of this sub, we&#39;re on thin ice with the admins, and until we can get a straight answer out of them, we have to take this more cautious route. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should not be comparing two disparate points of view side by side. It&#39;s too complicated because the number of factors increase and you have to filter out some of the noise e.g. How much should we be talking about NASA, does it even matter? So we have convoluted discussions about how if NASA is fake, is that evidence the earth is flat.</p>

<p>So I say cut the crap out. Go straight to what we are told about the round earth. If science text books are saying a ship disappears over the horizon because of curvature - and we can prove that is false, that&#39;s a big scandal. So it does no good to advance the flat earth idea. </p>
