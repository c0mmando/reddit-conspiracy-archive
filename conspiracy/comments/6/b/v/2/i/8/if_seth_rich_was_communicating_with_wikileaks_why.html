       They absolutely could.

       It would even prove that there's a conspiracy to silence the source of the leaks.

       Especially they could do so going forward if they ask the leaker if they want their identity released in the case they're killed.

       Let's say you're an "elite" in power. A leaker dies. You might have done it, maybe you didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks comes out and reveals who the leaker was. You now know they leaked your data.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would I do in that situation? Kill their family. Now any future leakers will know that even after their death, we'll still go after their families and anyone they care about. Might discourage them.

       I dunno, that's just how I see it.

       Retaliation of family members or friends... if the dead leaker is revealed, they may decide to also ransack his family/friends for details if he left anything behind they missed. Of course, if the conspiracy is true that he was killed by at least someone from the DNC that ordered the hit on him, then it can easily be assumed they know who he is, thus they would already know his friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Wikileaks probably has to look at the big picture and stick to the idea that they never reveal sources, even post-death, lest the risk of future leakers withholding info in the future. Long term they probably have no choice but to stay quiet on a source since wikileaks wants to be relevant for decades to come.3

       They're happy to show an interest in the Rich case so they clearly enjoy the attention of suggesting he's the leaker.

       Haven't seen any evidence that it was Seth Rich, as far as i can see neither has anyone else.

       People just throw out being critical because the source tells them what they want to hear? Do you believe those documents? I am not saying they are false, but if those docs didn't fit your narrative would you suddenly be critical of them or not?

       The documents wiki leaks receive and publish are authentic. No one has ever seen a published doc and proved it's a forgery. Not one  9/11 pager was wrong. The collateral murder movie wasn't wrong.

       If wiki leaks had documented evidence your mom was a reptilian shape shifter, I'd believe them. So yes, I'd believe them if they showed trump was a bad guy. Unforrinately, it would appear that fucking over investors is the worst he's done.

       They said they had received 2 pages about Trump but the information was already public.

       If you want them to release info on Trump just send them Trump leaks yourself. Simple.

       Ah, the deep state crap.

      <p>
       It is there to protect trump. If he is attacked it is because he is awesome and the deep state hates him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, maybe he and others use that to attack the US and the government here by russia's deep state.

       Did you ever stop to think that trump just uses people for his own personal gain (as hillary tried to do - her ego is the only reason she wanted to be president)?

       Ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       My favorites are 9/11, Obama and Yemen back in 2009 (Yemen admitted to covering up our airstrikes and claiming them as their own), JFK (see my uncle on that), The ACA over Single payer, and currently Trump and his cohorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that doesn't even get into UFO's (Roswell, Hangar 18, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, I will disparage things like 4chan and voat. You don't agree? Well then tell me why people disparage other sources (and then apply the same to them).
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out things like "The Unseen Hand" as a start or any religion and it's use of myth to control people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and I get that there is a LOT of media controlled by the wealthy, including the right (iHeart/fox/etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       See, the difference between me and others is that I go where the evidence leads me, not where I want it to go.

       So we both agree 9/11 was an inside job. And I'm not a big fan of Obama either, real wolf in sheeps clothing especially concerning privacy. Healthcare I won't get into but they're both really bad. And Trump I'm still on the fence about but he's made a lot of bad choices and some very interesting ones. What I take issue with is that you're willing to admit to 9/11, obama/trump conspiracies as well as admit media is controlled but STILL deny the possibility of deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the shade you cast on either site is misguided: neither 4chan or voat are news sites; they're discussion hubs, like here. Layman think tanks. Naturally you can't post a bs wordpress source and get away with it: there you'll likely be even more chewed out thanks to the psuedoanonymity which also lends itself to better discussions.

       I cast that shade because they get upvoted here and they have no real integrity. How often do we see them on the front page? If it is about democrats it is taken as gospel...come to think of it when have those sources been used here against republicans/trump?

       And clearly you would never see a 4chan link on the front because half of Reddit is afraid of the place but also because their threads 404 pretty quickly (aside from the fact that the front is heavily curated.) It's the mark of a learned mind to be able to entertain ideas without accepting them hence why a lot of people read the larp threads that come out there especially on conspiracy and weigh them for themselves. Once again 4chan is not a source but individuals have used it to dump information and even leak.

       Things are complicated right now :) Chained to the computer for coding/analysis/etc (I would say I have been analyzing things from a satellite but flat earthers here don't believe they exist so no point).

      <p>
       My point with 4chan is that they make the front here, which is just silly. The people that promote them here as a 'source' bitch and moan about any source that isn't them. I don't get that shit.

       They went along with it, and Hillary at least is a huge part of it. Now I know you weren't paying attention. How can your love of Hillary be based on blindness? Don't you feel embarrassed knowing nothing about her life and crimes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama toppling Libya on Hillary's lead, causing the current European migrant crisis, Obama flooding the Middle East black market with heavy weaponry to topple the Syrian government (Timber Sycamore) for the Saudi-US petrodollar. There's a reason Trump called Obama and Hillary the founders of ISIS. If you think these things are accidental and were failures you are more naive than I thought.

       You don't know what's going on and you don't care, and you're getting mad at me for paying attention and caring. Try addressing my points instead of me as a person.

       You are obviously here to degrade the level of discourse on topics of importance. Why are you bothering?

       Are you getting paid to muddy the waters?

       What I care about is following the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth? BS. Trump being pure? BS. Hillary and podesta torturing kids and eating them on a cheese pizza? BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is in power right now and using it for their own purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not Obama and not stupid hillary. Where is the coverup today? With trump and his crew.
      </p>
      <p>
       How hard is that to understand? Hell, when he won I was all "Ok, give the guy a chance, he won the election, he is our president, every 4 years we go through this" but damn, he is a freaking mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I heard for 8 years how Obama was satan and was bad, the same people saying that shit are nowhere to be found now. My god, the benghazi investigation was longer than 9/11 - but now with trump? Where are these people who had such morals and values?
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't about being partisan. It is about today and real issues we  should address - people have no problem bringing up hillary and such but talking about trump is now taboo?
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened to not trusting these people in power?

       If you cared about following the evidence you wouldn't be so quick to believe fake news, you would actually look into the facts.

        Dude says to Wikileaks:
       </strong>
       I still haven't found any Podesta emails released by Wikileaks that are dated after March 21, 2016
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wikileaks:
       </strong>
       Well spotted. Something to look forward to.
      </p>
      <p>
       October 21st this happened. The very same day Podesta visited London. (The date after which Wikileaks started going weird.)

       They said they had received 2 pages about Trump but the information was already public.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want them to release info on Trump just send them Trump leaks yourself. Simple.

       So we both agree 9/11 was an inside job. And I'm not a big fan of Obama either, real wolf in sheeps clothing especially concerning privacy. Healthcare I won't get into but they're both really bad. And Trump I'm still on the fence about but he's made a lot of bad choices and some very interesting ones. What I take issue with is that you're willing to admit to 9/11, obama/trump conspiracies as well as admit media is controlled but STILL deny the possibility of deep state.

       And the shade you cast on either site is misguided: neither 4chan or voat are news sites; they're discussion hubs, like here. Layman think tanks. Naturally you can't post a bs wordpress source and get away with it: there you'll likely be even more chewed out thanks to the psuedoanonymity which also lends itself to better discussions.
