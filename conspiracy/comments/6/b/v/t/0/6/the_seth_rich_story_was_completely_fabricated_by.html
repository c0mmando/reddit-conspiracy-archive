       Just out of curiosity, but what do people think we're Trumps motives for communicating with Russia if the allegations turn out to be true? Is it to make money? To gain more power? Because what I've observed is an inate hostility towards not just Putin but Russia as a whole and I find it baffling why the American people seem so opposed to improving relations with the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy that it's a matter of morality, there are plenty of other countries who carry out unspeakable acts and have questionable moral values that we consider allies and trade openly with, so why is Russia this defacto "bad guy" and every little communication with them is considered treasonous?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I don't understand why communication between trump and put in is considered bad in the first place. Do we consider his communications with every other nation through the same lenses?

       The American

        people

       aren't opposed to improving relations with Russia. The Deep State/Military Industrial Intelligence Complex is opposed to peace because that would entail the withering away of its budgets. They've put 70 years into this operation and they aren't ready to quit just because Trump won't crayon within the lines.

       But the American people are very much opposed to good relations with Russia, and I use "Russia" not "Putin" because as of lately everyone seems to generalize the country as a whole. Every time I turn on a news organization that isn't Fox they are discussing how bad it is that Trump is conversing with "the Russians". Its like a an 80s action film where the villian is some nondescript foreigner referred to by their nationality. At this point, simply being Russian is enough to incriminate you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to sound like I'm opposing you, I agree that the military complex is on a mission for never ending war and peace does not fit that mo, but everyday people are now adopting the idea that Russia = bad just because, and this whole narrative is the cause of it.

       Russia isn't the de facto bad guy, but our past conflict doesn't make us bffs. Putin is ex-KGB. He invaded Ukraine and has been running a fairly sophisticated propaganda campaign here in the US and Europe. His general goals appear to be destabilize Western democracy and elect officials who are sympathetic to Russia. The recent Senate Intel
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av_IRnDlxKQ">
        hearing
       </a>
       on the subject can tell you more about how they did it. TLD;W, Russian hacking teams selectively released hacked info to harm Hillary Clinton's candidacy, without doing the same to the GOP/Trump. They also created a 'fake news' system targeting right and left to make those emails seem more criminal than they actually are.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question, then, is whether or not Trump and his associates were aware of this campaign directly, or if they even struck some kind of deal for Russia's help. The big points are Flynn's hiring, Comey's firing, Manafort's past in Ukraine, Page's flirtations as a Russian asset, and Trump's own strange habit of making a lot of money in real estate deals with Russian billionaires, who are known to launder their money through real estate. Here's a nice

       discussing it in some depth.

       Like I said, this info is all widely available. Why haven't you been curious before now?

       I love how you leave out the fact that Soros and State-department funded NGOs armed, trained, and assisted uprisings in Ukraine. Soros funneled $4 billion for this purpose. The US was essentially funding a coup to put in place a puppet government that was friendly. Crimea is a very important location for Russia, so they can't exactly just leave that unanswered. Russia is no angel but to suggest that they invaded Ukraine unprovoked tells me you've been sipping that western propoganda koolaid for way too long now.

       Except there's no fucking proof of this. CrowdStrike redacted significant portions of their initial hacking assessment after being repeatedly called out for their bullshit. They were also been caught fabricated Russian hacking in Ukraine. CrowdStrike's founder has deep ties with the Clintons as well. The entire basis of this Russia hysteria is literally based on a falsified report given by a biased third party. Let that sink in.

       Could Trump be in shady business deals to enrich himself? Sure, he's been pretty sleazy during his lifetime, so I wouldn't count that out. But there is no proof that the Russians helped him in

       Seth Rich was murdered at 4 in the morning in a nice neighborhood and nothing of value was taken, not a watch, not a laptop, not a cell phone or wallet.  Nothing.  The DC police kept his laptop, ruled it a botched mugging/robbery, and currently have no leads or suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seth Rich died under suspicious circumstances amidst rumors of leaks within the DNC at a time when highly damaging and 100% true information about the DNC were being released.  An email released by WikiLeaks reveals John Podesta planning to make an example of a suspected leaker whether he is guilty or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wheeler comes out and says he is still investigating the death on a contract signed by Seth Rich's father and funded by a private 3rd party.  The family spokesman who says that the family believes this is fake news is a PR consultant for a firm that does damage control for the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get your head out of your asshole.  This warrants an investigation.  And honestly, I don't give a fuck what his family wants.  If this man was murdered for revealing corruption he deserves justice.  If our representatives killed someone to cover up their crimes, we deserve to know and they deserve to face prosecution.

        Seth Rich's parents
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These are people who realize they are a part of something much bigger, but are almost completely powerless to do anything. Most likely gagged by the DNC to speak for themselves. There is a reason they hired Rod Wheeler separately.
      </p>
      <p>

        Rich Family blasts Rod Wheeler for making assertions
       </a>
       . Now this is weird, why would the family who hired a private investigator later blast that same investigator for making unfounded claims. Well let's look a little deeper into the article.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But a spokesman for Rich's family on Tuesday said Wheeler was not authorized to speak for the family and called assertions Seth Rich sent emails to WikiLeaks "unsubstantiated." Brad Bauman said even if purported emails were to surface, it would not necessarily mean Rich had helped WikiLeaks.
"Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so," Bauman said. "We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Notice that the statement doesn't come from the Rich family, but rather Brad Bauman. Also, tell me how an email is not a high enough bar of evidence "even if tomorrow, and an email is found." Plenty of peasants go to jail over implicating emails. Who is
       <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/763852003093217280">
        Brad Bauman
       </a>
       ? Notice how he is the spokesman who makes all the statements for the Rich family, that's strange. The media loves blasting that headline as "Rich family says", when in reality it's Brad Bauman has said. A lot of people here have come to the conclusion that the Rich family has been gagged and the DNC is calling all the shots in their place.
      </p>
      <p>
       So who hired Rod Wheeler?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Although Bauman said Wheeler was paid by a third party, the family is named as clients of Wheeler's Capitol Investigations on a contract signed by Rich's father, Joel Rich.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Either someone has committed fraud in Joel Rich's name or Seth's father has decided to hire a PI to get to the bottom of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll leave with a question, what would you do as an average every day citizen if you had a family member murdered by your own government?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we don't know who killed Seth Rich yet. It could be the worst robber ever or this could be an orchestrated hit. Something doesn't add up in all this mainly because of the mystery behind it, the timing, and the context of who Seth Rich is and what was going on
      </p>
      <p>
       You are pushing your own narrative by denying all existence of these oddities. That's a moot point to even sit there and say some bs such as that, because there is a narrative wherever you go with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, something doesn't smell right.

       The whole Trump-Russia thing is all based on the idea that Russia "hacked the election" by releasing the DNC leaks. That's so retarded. Like they acknowledge that the information in the leaks damaged their chances in the election, but rather than owning that and being like "yeah we fucked up you guys, but here's Podesta's head and we're sending Hillary to prison", they go "well it may all be true, but, but, but... RUSSIA!! Eh? Eh? Anyone? Ol' Commie bastards? Little Red Scare this generation?"
