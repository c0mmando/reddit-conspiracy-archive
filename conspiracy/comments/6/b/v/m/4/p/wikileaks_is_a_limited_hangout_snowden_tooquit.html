       It pisses me off that wikileaks never says anything about the covert harassment of individuals worldwide and advanced covert technologies. Although they made a big thing about CIA's hacking abilities...how about saying something about their body hacking abilities for fuck sake -_-

       Yup, I have similar suspicions and have been hit hard in comments because of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cryptome founder tried working with them, came away weirded out.  Thought they were suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't remember or find the story ATM. It's also weird that Assange comes out of a creepy pedophile cult with CIA links... The Family. Same cult a number of movie stars came from, like Joaquin Phoenix and Rose McGowan, I think Winona Ryder too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Assange is hanging out with spirit-cooking Lafy GaGa. The 9/11 denial is very telling.

       I've had my suspicions about WL since he disappeared and there were people on the ground reporting the embassy was raided. There was the case with the local airport being shut down then that extraordinary rendition aircraft leaving the airport soon after. He's never authenticated with PGP since and not been seen at the window His Twitter account changed and so did their "style" shall we say of social media. I'm very interested to learn more about the Cryptome founder and the CIA links with Assange's family. The CIA has tentacles everywhere and a budget so big you can't even comprehend it. It's almost fucking stupid to believe he's holed up in an embassy out of reach allowed to continue leaking "sensitive" information. As for Snowden, I can safely say that he's a limited hangout without a doubt in mind. What actually came of the NSA leaks? Only benefits for the NSA, people now self-censor and fear them. Fuck this system we live in.

       Notice he still bleaches his hair as the cult forced every child of theirs to do.

       Why worry about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think you're going to win them away from bigotry by brow beating them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is what Nietzsche was talking about when he said people who fight monsters need be careful that they don't become monsters themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you gaze into the abyss too long right? It will gaze back into you.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point being that from the bigots perspective you are manifesting into reality what previously was nothing more than an imaginary adversary.  For example here you seemed to force into the conversation your own imaginary new hater which doesn't exist anywhere on this page except within your own imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bigotry happens on its own, and no we aren't a safe space that is going to attempt to moderate it out of existence, but when it doesn't happen on its own why on Earth would you summon it yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there not enough bigotry here for your taste today?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did we need to invent our own monster to fight today?

       Like I said, I downvote and move on. My comment was more to do with the self importance and self delusion that accompanies thinking that anything and everything posted here is a "psyop" designed to make the place look bad.

       Oh so you're just implying that I'm delusional because I remember the "everything is a limited hangout" campaign that happened a few years ago.

       That may be so, but that doesn't give you an excuse to break the rules. Here's what I was typing in response to the comment you deleted:

       I think UN13 got your for the post, I just got you for this comment.

       I wish you would repost this, as it's a pretty important thesis that needs to be discussed, whether it turns out true or not. I think you're going to have a hard time getting it above zero, though. The Trump people aren't too fond of the thesis, and even many non-Trumpers seem more interested in painting WL as a Russian operation. With the current makeup of this sub, that doesn't leave a whole lot of people who are going to upvote this.

       Maybe if you center the title around Corbett, it might fair a bit better. He still has massive cred here, more than probably anyone else.

       Don't forget about Pam Anderson - she went to London to 'have lunch with him' in the embassy on several occasions. These meetings also seemed to closely precede all the funny business, such as the embassy's internet being cut, that led to many believing JA had been compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having Pamela go out to the embassy to meet him should raise eyebrows in itself. Seeing pics of Pamela attending the spirit cooking celebrity dinners should really force you to step back and think about what could be going on with JA and Wikileaks.
