        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A few years ago you would be branded the worst kind of tinfoiled madman for suggesting the presidential election was meaningless and that the real government was run by unelected bureaucrats. Now it&#39;s not only confirmed, but praised by the &quot;fourth estate&quot; supposed to uncover such corruption. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t even get reddit to talk about this when it&#39;s all that matters. Trump is just a fly in the ointment even if you still support him. It&#39;s not even a right versus left issue - these fucks are unaccountable. It&#39;s the same think Eisenhower warned you about, but given decades to infiltrate every part of the government.</p>

<p>Yeah, it really is that crazy. But the same has happened in relation to every &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. The Bilderberg meetings were denied for decades. Now everyone just accepts that top politicians and business leaders meet in secret to rule the world. This world has become a weird Brave-new-world, 1984-type twilight zone.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence for this assertion whatsoever?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen anything close to a smoking gun to indicate that Trump is on the Russian payroll or anything like that. The basic assumption that a multi-billionaire would take kickbacks from a foreign power to undermine his own country seems patently absurd, but I&#39;m always willing to consider anything with some facts behind it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES! So much this! I have such a difficult time with this... HOW is it not completely obvious to the lot of you?!</p>

<p>On a similar note: muricans are <em>constantly</em> referring to, say, for example, Middle Eastern countries and their practices as &quot;barbaric&quot;, &quot;cruel&quot;, &quot;twisted&quot;, &quot;inhumane&quot;, etc., etc., yet they have no problem whatsoever with calling for the adoption of VERY similar practices within their own country.... comments like &quot;hang him!&quot;, &quot;execute him!&quot;, &quot;medicate and/or jail someone I disagree with!&quot;... again, just examples... it&#39;s insaaaaane! </p>

<p>I really, honestly do think that MSM, social media, hell, media in general play a big, big part in this: most folks are now at the point where they <em>need</em> to be told exactly what to believe in; they cannot think for themselves. If &quot;it&quot; is not a witty slogan, a meme, a Facebook page, Youtube channel or, at VERY LEAST, a Wikipedia page then it is completely ignored. </p>

<p>Although, I think there would be a lot more suicides if that happened. The only thing keeping American society function at all right now is the fact that most people lie to themselves about society and who they actually are. Lying to yourself is much easier than exposing all the wounds.</p>

Manafort suggests a strategy for influencing politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and former Soviet republics to benefit Putin’s government.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oct. 15, 2007</strong>: In an interview with Larry King, Trump says: “Look at Putin — what he’s doing with Russia — I mean, you know, what’s going on over there. I mean this guy has done — whether you like him or don’t like him — he’s doing a great job.”</p></li>
<li><p>November 2007: Paul Manafort’s firm receives a $455,000 wire transfer from Ukraine Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych’s Party of Regions. Manafort had been hired to improve the image of Putin-backed Yanukovych, who was portraying himself falsely as an anti-corruption reformer seeking to move Ukraine closer to the West. “The West has not been willing to move beyond the Cold War mentality and to see this man and the outreach that he has extended,” Manafort says about Yanukovych at the time. Ukraine’s richest man — a billionaire industrialist — had introduced Manafort to Yanukovych. </p></li>

<p>He&#39;s not coming out in aid of Trump.  He&#39;s speaking out against the subversion of democracy by the deep state.</p>

<p>Interestingly- right wing conspiracy theorists (the alex jones folks who somehow were drawn into the Donald honeypot) were listening to Steve Piescenik prior to the election and PRAISING the idea of a deep state &quot;coup&quot; which would dethrone hillary clinton as the presumptive nominee.  A lot of people here fell for that bait hook line and sinker.</p>

<p>This is a very dangerous concept- annointing a &quot;savior&quot; and handing over democracy to an unelected intelligence apparatus with no face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the deep state exists. I believe it was a combination of them and obstructionist Republicans that prevented Obama from fulfilling many of his promises. What I don&#39;t believe is that they set Trump up with Russia. </p>

<p>Trump had deep ties to Russia long before his campaign started. Trumped picked people who put winning above country. He surrounded himself with sellouts. With Traitors. </p>

<p>Deep State did not force Trump to pick:
* Flynn, who lied about his close ties to Sergey Kislyak
*  Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chair, who we already knew worked as a political consultant on behalf of Russian interests</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser who reportedly told Trump to fire Comey, and celebrated the news with a cigar</p></li>
<li><p>Carter Page, another former Trump adviser who found the Comey dismissal “encouraging”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Trump is incompetent at best and a traitor at worst. As a regular T_D poster, I&#39;m sorry if you voted for him and find this hard to accept. But it&#39;s intellectually dishonest to blame this on the &quot;Deep State&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly haven&#39;t looked at my post history then because more than half have nothing to do with politics champ. Besides the fact that I&#39;m a Libertarian Ron Paul supporter that happens to believe Trump was by far the least of two evils when compared to Hillary. He has done plenty of stuff I disagree with and is worthy of critisicm.</p>

<p>I am even happy to accept that Trump is an &quot;agent of the Kremlin&quot;, whatever that means, if you can show me any real evidence of collusion, which you can&#39;t because if it existed it&#39;d have been leaked like everything else we&#39;d never  and we&#39;d never hear the end of it. The democrats have literally started claiming everyone that disagrees with their agenda is carrying water for Putin, including Rand Paul, Jason Chaffetz, Tucker Carlson, etc etc. It&#39;s like watching a 6 year old throw a tantrum.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Use real source and logic to disprove people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The burden of proof is on the ones making accusations, not the other way around. Clapper, Comey, Feinstein, Schiff and all the other people with a motive to pin Trump to Russia, with access to classified information, have come out and said they&#39;ve found ZERO evidence of collusion. Even the hacking reports have been pretty much debunked for being nothing more than scaremongering about RT and apparent &quot;Russian Trolls&quot; that were somehow convincing people to cast their votes for Trump. Have you considered that maybe you just ran a deeply unlikeable and corrupt candidate that generated zero excitement and ran a horrible campaign? </p>

<p>So yeah you&#39;re gonna have to do better than some weak shit like OMG HE SOLD A PROPERTY TO A RUSSIAN to prove that Vladimir Putin is somehow this omnipotent god controlling everyone and everything in Washington D.C. that you disagree with.</p>

<p>Which all the others I linked, and you keep ignoring, were forced to deny any evidence of because they&#39;ve found nothing despite the House, the Congress, FBI, etc all investigating for months. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s even assume for a moment that, despite zero evidence to back the claim, Russia and Trump colluded to &quot;influence people&#39;s opinions&quot; in the election. How so? By showing the vast corruption within the DNC and Hillary campaign​? </p>

<p>You are lying. You are misrepresenting the words he spoke. Why? is the question. Why is it so important to you to distort reality to protect Trump?</p>

<p>Do you believe &quot;Trump had biggest inaugural crowd ever?&quot; Do you believe &quot;Electoral College Win Was Not the Biggest Since Reagan&quot;? These little lies may not matter, but his lies will kill Americans if people don&#39;t stand up. He promised health care for everyone. Instead he tried to take away heath care from 24 million Americans. He said he’d &quot;release his tax returns, eventually.&quot; He lied. He said he’d surround himself with all the best and smartest people. You bought it. Then he put in pay-to-pay Betsy DeVo and poison our air and water, Scott Pruitt. Obama put in Ph Ds. Trump puts in lobbyists and big rich donors. </p>

<p>You have been conned. Someday a family member will die in one of his Wars to distact us from his failings. Or someone close will die because they don&#39;t have heath care.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually news agencies do need funding, whether from advertisements or from the government. WaPo didn&#39;t directly get funding from the CIA, but is has from government funding. Jeff Bezos, owner of WaPo and CEO of amazon agreed to a $600,000,000 dollar contract for privately cloud sourcing data on Amazon users buyers. I wouldn&#39;t be shocked if a decent amount of that 600 mill went into an offshore bank account for Bezos.

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely useful; thank you for the link. Added to my subscriptions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this is all a massive witch-hunt or anything; there is plenty of &quot;there&quot; there. I reviewed a lot of the document (not all - its extensive), and its basically circumstantial evidence for a preconceived conclusion. Its tiny bits and pieces which point in the general direction of an accepted assumption; nothing definitive in the least, that I can see.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not at all certain that there wasn&#39;t collusion with Russian officials, or that there doesn&#39;t continue to be some quid-pro-quo between Trump and his allies and Putin and his allies. I just haven&#39;t seen any evidence. Some people seem to be certain beyond the shadow of a doubt that Trump is bought and paid for by the Russians and any assertion to the contrary is absurd. I just don&#39;t understand that line of thinking, based on what is currently known.</p>

<p>In a vacuum, this theory claims that an international businessman worth billions of dollars would actively subvert the interests of his country, risking completely tarnishing his reputation (which he clearly cares a lot about), and potentially being forever disgraced and imprisoned for.... <em>some more money</em>? It just seems counter-intuitive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the pieces of circumstantial evidence is the cover-up itself.  This initially wasn&#39;t an investigation into collusion at all - it was an investigation into Russia interfering with our election.  Which doesn&#39;t require collusion (and isn&#39;t that surprising).  But it keeps getting worse as Trump affiliates lie over and over.  </p>

<p>The additional issue is that we do not know what Trump&#39;s finances actually look like.  His claims have not been verified.  Why someone who is clearly as skeptical as yourself, and someone who wants evidence to support claims, would jump on the &quot;Trump is so rich he doesn&#39;t need money&quot; bandwagon without evidence is one of the problems here.  We know he is leveraged, we know he always runs with a TON of debt, it is very likely that some of that debt could belong to Russia sources.  Trump has shown a willingness to use his position and power and influence to aid his business ventures - he&#39;s not above it. </p>

<p>This is how he does business.  He has just never done it on this high profile a stage before.  If the Presidency was just another Casino he could declare bankruptcy, pull out, leave his investors holding the bag, and make off with his personal profits.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>We actually do. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2838696-Trump-2016-Financial-Disclosure.html">He has filed detailed financial disclosure forms</a>, which is required of all presidential candidates. These forms have much more financial detail than individual income tax returns. While Trump has regularly exaggerated his net worth, any reliable independent net valuation I have seen has been in the multi-billion dollar range.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know he is leveraged, we know he always runs with a TON of debt, it is very likely that some of that debt could belong to Russia sources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being leveraged and having debts is standard business practice; many of the wealthiest individuals in the world have massive amounts of debts. &quot;Net Worth&quot; is the value of your assets, less your liabilities. When people talk about Trump&#39;s multi billion dollar net worth, it means the value of his assets exceed his debts by billions of dollars. </p>

<p>This also doesn&#39;t really wash with regard to the claim that he may &quot;owe money to Russian banks&quot;, and thus is compromised. How (if it is even true) exactly does this compromise him, anymore than a loan from Bank of America, or Deutsche Bank would compromise him? While some major Russian banks have shareholders and executives that are tied to the state apparatus, what point of leverage can they actually exercise upon him? As long as he (or more likely, his business interests) are complying with the terms of any potential loans, they don&#39;t really hold any sway over him. This specific point is where I find the media to be extremely dishonest. There is no form, schedule, or statement on your personal tax return that shows to whom and how much money you owe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he could declare bankruptcy, pull out, leave his investors holding the bag, and make off with his personal profits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not how bankruptcy reorganization works. If he really was focused on maximizing every penny he could make he would sell off his businesses and just invest the money. He&#39;d also never run for President; losing The Apprentice cost him tens of millions in income.</p>

<p>He&#39;s more concerned with having his name in big letters on Trump Tower, than how much actual income it produces. He&#39;s an egoist/narcissist. As such, I just don&#39;t see the disgrace of being exposed and impeached being less of a risk to him than the benefit of his shares mildly increasing in value or getting a loan at a slightly better rate or whatever marginal benefit Russia or Russian agents could possibly provide to him. It requires you to make so many illogical assumptions to get to that point, when the most likely scenario is that Trump is just kind of a doofus and isn&#39;t really good at optics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would certainly agree that he wouldn&#39;t suffer impeachment/disgrace for cash money.  But that assume a high level of competence in matters that are completely new to him.  He has talked about how difficult being President is. </p>

<p>The loans from Russian sources, would be more about business ties, rather than literal blackmail of Trump personally.  He is a man who heaps praise upon his perceived allies and scorn upon his perceived enemies.  If he is heavily &#39;in bed&#39; with Russia, it simply means he will view them as &#39;good&#39; - at least that&#39;s how his behavior looks to me.  </p>

<p>The issue with the tax returns is that he has refused to disclose them for a reason.  It&#39;s not some moral stand against doing it.  He specifically said he would disclose them if he ever ran for president and then decided not to.  So we KNOW that there&#39;s SOMETHING there.  </p>

<p>Now, that something could just be a near zero tax rate - which would highlight the fact that the Republican position that the rich in this country are taxed too much is a complete fiction (just like Romney&#39;s 15%ish tax rate really hurt him, because it undercut an entire platform of his party).  This seems likely.</p>

<p>But we know for a fact that the tax returns have information the financial disclosure forms do not.  We know this because of the refusal to turn them over.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about what tax forms for someone like Trump would show (presumably they are vastly more complicated than my taxes).  But my taxes include information about interest payments for loans, and income sources (such as new loans, property sales, shared business interests).  </p>

<p>I understand what you&#39;re saying about net worth.  And yes, independent sources think he&#39;s worth billions.  But you would honestly say that if he owed, say, a billion dollars in loans to Russian banks that that wouldn&#39;t be news? It would just be nothing? What if the entire reason he owes it to them is because other banks would not loan it to him?  What if those banks were letting payments slide? The reality is that someone like Trump is going to face significant liquidity issues from time to time, regardless of his net worth. </p>

<p>And my bankruptcy comment was just a jab at how he does business.  Normally when he is involved in something that goes belly up, he has the capacity to get out with minimal personal harm.  He can&#39;t do that with the Presidency. </p>

<p>I think the real answer to this is that running for President was going to prove to be VERY profitable for Trump.  He was set up to start a new media empire.  Winning the Presidency has proved to be the issue.</p>

It&#39;s funny how often we invade countries or arm opposition groups in an attempt to &quot;liberate&quot; the people from oppressive regimes.

<blockquote>
<p>These allegations are supported by an annex to the first part of Senate Intelligence Committee&#39;s Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq published in July 2004. The review, which was highly critical of the CIA&#39;s Iraq intelligence generally but found its judgments were right on the lack of an Iraq-al Qaeda relationship, suggests that the OSP, if connected to an &quot;Iraqi intelligence cell&quot; also headed by Douglas Feith which is described in the annex, sought to discredit and cast doubt on CIA analysis in an effort to establish a connection between Saddam Hussein and terrorism. In one instance, in response to a cautious CIA report, &quot;Iraq and al-Qa&#39;eda: A Murky Relationship&quot;, the annex relates that &quot;one of the individuals working for the [intelligence cell led by Feith] stated that the June [2002] report, &#39;...should be read for content only – and CIA&#39;s interpretation ought to be ignored.&#39;&quot;[5]</p>

<p>Douglas Feith called the office&#39;s report a much-needed critique of the CIA&#39;s intelligence. &quot;It&#39;s healthy to criticize the CIA&#39;s intelligence&quot;, Feith said. &quot;What the people in the Pentagon were doing was right. It was good government.&quot;</p>

<p>In another instance, an &quot;Iraqi intelligence cell&quot; briefing to Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz in August 2002 condemned the CIA&#39;s intelligence assessment techniques and denounced the CIA&#39;s &quot;consistent underestimation&quot; of matters dealing with the alleged Iraq-al-Qaeda co-operation. In September 2002, two days before the CIA&#39;s final assessment of the Iraq-al Qaeda relationship, Feith briefed senior advisers to Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice, undercutting the CIA&#39;s credibility and alleging &quot;fundamental problems&quot; with CIA intelligence-gathering. </p>

<p>The report found that these actions were &quot;inappropriate&quot; though not &quot;illegal.&quot; Senator Carl Levin, Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated that &quot;The bottom line is that intelligence relating to the Iraq-al-Qaeda relationship was manipulated by high-ranking officials in the Department of Defense to support the administration&#39;s decision to invade Iraq. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what the government lying to you looks like. This is what conspiracy theorists should have lost their shit over and this is why Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney, and Douglas Feith should be locked up. &quot;Deep state&quot; didn&#39;t fabricate evidence to get the US into war to steal oil. The republicans did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump shared intel with Russia. It&#39;s his call whether he does that or not. It could blow up in his face - somewhere down the road, an ally might cite this as the point where they lost faith in Trump and stopped sharing intel w the US. Regardless, it&#39;s his call. </p>

<p>But this got leaked internally - somebody in the IC decided that Trump served at <em>their</em> pleasure rather than the other way around. That&#39;s usurping power. If this is allowed to continue, the President becomes no more than a figurehead who can&#39;t risk displeasing the people that are supposed to be serving him. </p>

<p>As much as I&#39;d be fine with Trump as a figurehead, an odious precedent has been set. And the MSM is applauding it. Their allegiance is to the Deep State. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, minor correction, BOTH serve at the <em>pleasure</em> of the American people. And these leaks are being exposed to their bosses. How effective would these leaks be if Trump was doing great stuff?? &quot;Bombshell leak today: Turns out he makes <em>great deals</em>! Everybody has respect for him- he meets with our allies and they&#39;re <em>extremely</em> impressed! Nobody knows why these wonders are being leaked but Trump&#39;s popularity is <em>soaring</em>!&quot; </p>

<p>No, of course not. Every. Single. Leak. Is somethig deeply deeply troubling. Obstruction of justice of an investigation into him and his administration- giving away extremely sensitive material to an autocratic regime that he&#39;s being investigated for colliding with. He commands <strong>zero</strong> respect. </p>

<p>Also, please don&#39;t pretend that there&#39;s any grey area in him giving away this material. &quot;Oh jeesh, maybe somewhere down the road this could hurt,  hmmm maybe it&#39;ll payoff&quot;. Our closest ally in the Middle East is PISSED. There&#39;s no chance theyre not tightening their intel as we speak.  He endangered the life of an operative embedded in ISIS, which, if compromised would be extremely difficult to recover from. And for what? &quot;lol omg you guys I&#39;ve got the best intel!&quot; </p>

<p>Donald Trump is a fucking idiot. It doesn&#39;t matter if, just based on the fashion in which we run intel, it&#39;s technically not illegal for him to give these secrets away, it&#39;s <strong>disastrous</strong>. Trump could <em>legally</em> have told the Russians who all our spies names are and where every nuke is and on Tues. June 3rd they&#39;ll all be offline for a couple. Who gives a shit??? </p>

<p>The only video I&#39;ve seen, is a reporter, saying that a private conversation had taken place between Ryan and others, where these politicians suspected that Trump was taking money from the Russians.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that conversation wasn&#39;t suspicious, but damn it would be nice to actually hear a recording, or to have someone who actually had the conversation come forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no evidence of &quot;Pedogate&quot; and the fact that they were forced to rebrand it from Pizzagate to Pedogate to try to piggyback off actual child sex abuse scandals is the best evidence of that. </p>

<p>The real conspiracy theory is how Pizzagate and the Seth Rich murder happened to come up at a time when people wanted to divide Democrats and distract from the real conspiracies involved the Trump campaign and Russia.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a theory tied together with the wikileaks release of an FBI investigation into a pedophilia ring that showed they use very specific and distinct symbols to recognize eachother in the world. Coins were stamped with these symbols so on and so forth. Turns out the Pizza Shop owned by people with ties to power in Washington is proudly displaying this symbol as their Logo. So prior to pizzagate theories, a pedophile in the know could stroll by that pizza shop, recognize that symbol and think hey my kind of people! </p>

<p>Shortly after this became public Besta Pizza changed their logo.</p>

<p>Please provide me a reason to shirk this circumstantial evidence as nothing but coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much wrong here.</p>

<p>Besta Pizza has no ties to anyone in power. Their previous logo resembled a &quot;pedophile logo&quot; inasmuch as it contained a triangle spiral. Triangle spirals are not uncommon design motifs. They changed their logo when public discussion began comparing it to a pedophilia symbol. I see that as a pretty good reason to change a logo.</p>

<p>The pizza place down the block does have an owner with political connections. They did not have a &quot;pedophile symbol&quot; as their logo. In fact, the only attempt to tie them to pedophile symbols are fairly weak comparisons between a butterfly and an image of crossed ping pong paddles.</p>

And the source for the Russian blame is shaddy and shotty with Democrat and/or HRC bias. The establishment says that there is no evidence for Russian interference either. John Brennan, CIA director under Obama, has publicly dated that there is no evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I&#39;m maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It&#39;s not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There&#39;s no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as &quot;fake news&quot; that it&#39;s only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I&#39;m hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.</p>

<p>Pizzagate has not been proven or disproven. There has been no formal investigations. There is circumstancial evidence. People get investigated for on circumstancial evidence all the time, even with less circumstancial evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;Prove it, and prove that any of those connections are illegal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;lol ok it takes like 10 seconds to pull up hundreds of articles on it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So why can&#39;t you link some sources every time you claim this line? Like, bookmark a few, and include them each time you post about it. Also, are you suggesting that the same source of the &quot;hundreds of articles&quot; is infact the mainstream media that has openly been trying to derail Trump since before the election, and that has been caught lying so many times about almost everything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;lol whatever Trumpkin, keep playing 9th dimensional chess in your head&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would it take to change your mind? </p>

<p>Firing a campaign manager for literally taking checks from Russia while running Trump&#39;s campaign isn&#39;t enough.</p>

<p>Multiple campaign/administration officials lying about Russia contacts (Flynn, Sessions, Kushner) isn&#39;t enough. </p>

<p>Telling the FBI Director to drop the Flynn investigation (after asking others to leave the room) isn&#39;t enough. </p>

<p>Meeting with a Russian ambassador at a time when it would look TERRIBLE politically, but doing it anyway (arguably because Russia wanted the meeting) isn&#39;t enough.  BONUS: not allowing US Media in the meeting, but also not vetting the Russia photographer properly to determine he was Russian media. </p>

<p>This all on top of not releasing financial information or tax returns to dispel claims that Trump has significant Russian loans.  Or to confirm net worth and the claims that he can&#39;t be bought because he doesn&#39;t need money. </p>

<p>This all on top of repeated praise for Putin - ignoring that he is a ruthless dictator who assassinates domestic opponents. </p>

<p>So if all of that equals ZERO.  What would it take? </p>

<p>Would you need a literal video of Putin telling Trump which executive orders to sign? Revealing classified information to the Russians didn&#39;t do it... so we&#39;d need video of Trump giving Russia more classified information? How much would it take for the narrative to have SOME basis in reality? A briefcase of classified documents personally delivered? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The source of the classified information may think again before acting as that source.  If they were put in danger or if that information leaking gave the enemy the ability to find their leak, this hurts our fight against ISIL.</p>

<p>This extends to uninvolved sources of information.</p>

<p>Information like this should be handled in a certain way, experts should be vetting this information and ensuring that this information would better America by the Russians knowing about it.</p>

<p>He might have killed people too.</p>

<p>If he didn&#39;t do something wrong, why did his White House deny he did it at all?</p>

<p>I like how we&#39;re the morons for questioning the leader, whereas you come to r/conspiracy and tell people what to think.  This isn&#39;t your Trump echo chamber where you can talk about (((conspiracies))).  Open your mind for a second.

He is the Executive, above even the intelligence agencies. If he see&#39;s fit to clue the Russians in to that info in order to help fight ISIS, more power to him.</p>

<p>Now compare this to Hillary divulging our nuclear response time. That is clearly a bad thing to divulge, whereas what Trump divulged he did so constructively.

    <div class="md"><p>Again, the source of that information is going to think twice before providing it to America and it&#39;s allies.  That hurts us.  If Russia should have known this information, it should have been done properly, not because Trump liked the guy.  He can arguably do this, but the argument is less about legality (perhaps) and more about propriety.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/10/clinton-and-nuclear-launch-times/">http://www.factcheck.org/2016/10/clinton-and-nuclear-launch-times/</a> - it&#39;s common knowledge.</p>

<p>I&#39;m clearly not working with an open mind?  You ignore the fact that our allies will be less inclined to provide us information.  You ignore the fact that there&#39;s the right way to give classified information, and there&#39;s telling it to an ambassador during a photoshoot, with the camera man standing there.  There&#39;s betraying our allies and giving information they did not want handed to the Russians.  You ignore all of this because TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP and I need to open my mind?</p>

<p>...the FBI and in extension our government has never independently verified the DNC hack because the DNC refused to let the FBI have access.</p>

<p>...that Mike Flynn&#39;s ties to Russia and his firm&#39;s business dealings with a Dutch consulting firm owned by a Turkish businessman were in the news <strong>before the election</strong> and inauguration.</p>

<p>...the FBI interviewed Mike Flynn on January 24th, before Sally Yates spoke to White House counsel, and he passed all questions asked of him and it was concluded he wasn&#39;t being deceptive about his discussions in December with the Russian ambassador.</p>

<p>...that James Clapper, former <strong>Director of National Intelligence</strong> under the Obama administration, was labeled in the media as Mike Flynn&#39;s number one bureaucratic enemy before the Trump administration took office. Clapper was the one who fired Flynn in 2014. Fast forward and Clapper puts in his resignation the exact same day Mike Flynn is chosen to be the upcoming National Security Advisor. Then Flynn&#39;s phone conversation with the Russian ambassador is illegally leaked to the Washington Post by someone in the Obama administration. </p>

<p>...that Sally Yates sole reasoning for being concerned about Mike Flynn was because he could seemingly be blackmailed by the Russian government solely because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about having spoken about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Somehow, this decorated general who has been in the upper echelons of government for decades could be blackmailed because he told Pence a fib. Yeah ... logically, it makes zero sense.</p>

<p>...that Sally Yates heard about the conversation between Flynn and the ambassador because someone illegally leaked it to Washington Post journalist David Ignatius who then publicized it on January 13th in an article. This leak of classified information occurred while the Obama administration was still in office.</p>

<p>...that proof of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government can only mean one or more of these three things: Emails, tapped phones calls or an individual on the Trump campaign flipping and admitting the collusion happened. There has to be actual tangible proof, not heresay and innuendo. Verbal or a paper trail. </p>

<p>...that Trump could be impeached even if there wasn&#39;t conclusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. He has a tendency to run off at the mouth and under a spotlight and given his newness to Washington he could very well do himself in.</p>

<p>...that you can dislike Trump and most of his policies yet also believe that the Russia-Trump collusion story is fake. If thinking that the Russia-Trump story is fake meant you were automatically a Republican and/or Trump supporter then The Young Turks are Trump supporters, right? 😉</p>

<p>Why did Trump&#39;s team fire Flynn if it was all no big deal? Because Flynn lied to Pence and Pence repeated the lie, which made Pence look bad and hurt his credibility. With the leaks, investigation and media storm Flynn became a political liability that Trump couldn&#39;t afford to have just a mere 3 weeks in office.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t Flynn fully disclose to Pence in the first place? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to reports Flynn was interviewed by the FBI on January 24th and passed and was asked about his conversations in December with the Russian ambassador. It was found he wasn&#39;t attempting to be deceitful and that he didn&#39;t explicitly say to the ambassador one way or another whether sanctions would be lifted or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/grand-jury-fbi-russia/index.html">interviewed</a> Flynn about the December calls with Kislyak and determined that he wasn’t intentionally trying to be deceptive about the nature of what was discussed, according to US officials briefed on the investigation. But investigators have been investigating Flynn’s business ties after he left the government and before he joined the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Officials said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html">this week</a> that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynn’s communications with Kislyak. Several officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration. </p>

<p>U.S. officials said that seeking to build such a case against Flynn would be daunting. The law against U.S. citizens interfering in foreign diplomacy, known as the Logan Act, stems from a 1799 statute that has never been prosecuted. As a result, there is no case history to help guide authorities on when to proceed or how to secure a conviction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tensions have been increasing since Putin&#39;s first terms as President.</p>

<p>They reached an early high level over US plans to build a missile defense system in Eastern Europe around 2007.</p>

<p>There was an attempted reconciliation in the early part of Obama&#39;s presidency, called a &quot;reset&quot;. By 2011 though, Russia was accusing the US of some responsibility for protests in Russia. By the next year, Russia was practicing targeting US sites militarily and the two countries were creating legislation widely seen as punitive.</p>

<p>Cut to the annexation of Crimea, oppositional positions on the Syrian conflict, a great number of accusations of treaty violations and Russian planes with Nuclear weapons curcling US territory. Sanctions, murder of Putin&#39;s political opponents, and most relevantly covert tampering with the US election.</p>

<p>Even if we ignore the broader arc of history, Russia has been in serious tension with the US for at least as long as Putin has been in power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump shared intel with Russia. It&#39;s his call whether he does that or not. It could blow up in his face - somewhere down the road, an ally might cite this as the point where they lost faith in Trump and stopped sharing intel w the US. Regardless, it&#39;s his call. </p>

<p>But this got leaked internally - somebody in the IC decided that Trump served at <em>their</em> pleasure rather than the other way around. That&#39;s usurping power. If this is allowed to continue, the President becomes no more than a figurehead who can&#39;t risk displeasing the people that are supposed to be serving him. </p>

<p>As much as I&#39;d be fine with Trump as a figurehead, an odious precedent has been set. And the MSM is applauding it. Their allegiance is to the Deep State. </p>
