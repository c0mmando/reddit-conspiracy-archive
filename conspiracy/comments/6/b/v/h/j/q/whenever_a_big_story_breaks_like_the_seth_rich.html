        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How much more evidence do you guys need? </p>

<p>Whenever something big breaks like the recent Seth Rich information, or when the sub gets a surge of new traffic, the shills always find away to politicize it to the outsiders and lurkers on our sub. They do this to manipulate who they want visiting this sub. <strong>No liberals allowed</strong> .Infact they want they make us look &quot;anti left&quot;. They want conspiracy theorists to be &quot;fringe&quot; right.</p>

<p>The truth is we welcome people from all sides of the spectrum to what we have to say!</p>

<p><strong>We represent a rejection of the left right paradigm, we are a retreat from the two party system. The system wants to stop that.</strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s proof that government used paid trolls to infiltrate discussion forums like this </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/jhlsegIE9a4">https://youtu.be/jhlsegIE9a4</a></p>

<p>Alex jones is assisting in this &quot;merge&quot; of conspiracy theorists with conservatism and Trumpism. We saw it happen leaning up to the election. Before, he had always rejected the two party system. That&#39;s when I started to Ask, &quot;what is the big picture here?&quot;.</p>

<p>I believe this is part of TPTB&#39;s plan to derail the resistance/awakening. </p>

<p>This is all being orchestrated and implemented by design. They want to make this place look like a circus to outsiders. If they can effectively merge the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; with conservative ideals and unwavering Trump support, then they can control the audience that we can reach. Since we somewhat <em>lean</em> that direction to begin with, as we embrace conservative values, skepticism of government power. <strong>However, I like to think we ultimately reject the two party system altogether.</strong> </p>

<p>Like I said, this place is a retreat from the left right paradigm to people, and TPTB do not want lurkers taking this sub seriously. <strong>We are essentially a non partisan news aggregation site, a lot of people come here to get their news</strong>, and the elite do not like that, they don&#39;t like free discussion ether.</p>

<p>Keep fighting lads. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright dude you&#39;re being pretty transparent but I&#39;ll humor you for this post.</p>

<p>Seth rich is prime conspiracy material with an extremely strong case as well as the lynchpin on Pandora&#39;s box of political fuckery. Suspicion surrounds his death, officially a botched robbery; being shot twice the robber left his wallet and nice watch. Oh also the police took his laptop and devices as evidence. Coincidentally right after Wikileaks got quite a large sum of emails; contained in those emails is even an interesting quote about &#39;making an example of a suspected leaker&#39; that fits the timeframe. This may be conspiratorial thinking or perhaps maybe a sound deduction given the facts but I would encourage anyone to do their own investigation: but you should probably leave MSM out of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awh shit great post! I agree.</p>

<p>I feel the shills have switched tactics recently so that rather than trying to rule the narrative they just want to ruin the sub. infighting, left vs right, &quot;that source isn&#39;t good enough!!1!&quot; and generally disagreeing with what we already deem known. </p>

<p>I feel if they can&#39;t control us for their narrative we&#39;ll eventually be targeted as a hate Reddit.</p>
