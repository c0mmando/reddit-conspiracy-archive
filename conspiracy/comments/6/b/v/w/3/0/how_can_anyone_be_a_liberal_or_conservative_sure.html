<p>I see the value in self classification in relation to a particular topic: not so much to an ideology as a whole.</p>

<p>Seems a very limiting way of making sense of the world. Far better to assess a talking point, on their inherent merits and failings, as opposed to via the subject lens of subjective experience. Definitely not through the even more skewed lens of a political ideology.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say the way democracy has been subverted by mass manipulation of consciousness, is one of the biggest conspiracies out there.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the concept behind the post, meets the criteria of a Conspiracy:</p>

<p><em>Secret &amp; underhand planning &amp;!execution?</em> Check.
<em>Multiple actors involved?</em> Check.
<em>Nefarious intent?</em> Check.</p>

<p>Seems like we have ourselves a Conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. At least not in a proportional representation system.</p>

<p>Let imagine a government made up of 100 seats, with 5 parties vying for them. To become the &quot;government&quot; you need 51 seats.</p>

<p>In a &quot;first past the post&quot; system each of those 100 seats is filled with a direct election, the person with the highest amount of votes getting the seat. So for one seat one candidate could receive 24% of the vote while the rest got 19%. The person who won the seat would actually have received less than a quarter of the votes.</p>

<p>If that person was a member of a party that won 51 seats this way, they could technically become the government with less than 24% of the popular vote.</p>

<p>In a fully proportional system, all 100 seats would be decided by the percentage of the popular vote. If one party received 24% of the vote, while the other parties only received 19%, that party would get 24 seats and the rest would get 19 each.</p>

<p>To form a government, at least three parties would have to agree to form a coalition government, which would mean the government would actually be composed of parties that received more than 51% of the popular vote.</p>

<p>There are variations on this, but a proportional system is far and away the most democratic way of forming a government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/">https://www.politicalcompass.org/</a></p>

<p>This site expands &quot;left and right&quot; into four - &quot;authoritarian left, libertarian left, authoritarian right, libertarian right&quot; - the idea being that people&#39;s views fall within these boundaries, but that there are distinct differences between leftists or rightists that means they shouldn&#39;t be lumped together under one label.</p>

<p>For example, I come out as a Libertarian Leftist (more left and liberal than Ghandi). On a pure left/right scale I rank about the same as Stalin. But on an authoritarian/liberal scale Stalin and I are on opposite ends of the spectrum - lumping us together would require ignorning the glaring differences between our beliefs.</p>
