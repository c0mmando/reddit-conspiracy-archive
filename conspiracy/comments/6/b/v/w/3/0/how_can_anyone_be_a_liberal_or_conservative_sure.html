       I consider myself to be conservative, but I disagree with some aspects of traditional "conservatism".  The labels themselves aren't the problem.  It allows for people with similar views to discuss ideas and grow.  The problem is how it has become liberal v. Conservative.  Tptb use it as a way to divide, and inevitably conquer.

       I see the value in self classification in relation to a particular topic: not so much to an ideology as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems a very limiting way of making sense of the world. Far better to assess a talking point, on their inherent merits and failings, as opposed to via the subject lens of subjective experience. Definitely not through the even more skewed lens of a political ideology.

       It is pretty much the antithesis of your post and definitely food for thought.

       I'd say the way democracy has been subverted by mass manipulation of consciousness, is one of the biggest conspiracies out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the concept behind the post, meets the criteria of a Conspiracy:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Secret &amp; underhand planning &amp;!execution?
       </em>
       Check.
       <em>
        Multiple actors involved?
       </em>
       Check.
       <em>
        Nefarious intent?
       </em>
       Check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like we have ourselves a Conspiracy.

       Well the two party system was created on purpose to avoid the situation like Germany or Iraq, with multitudes of parties competeing for the same seat
A party could  then get say, %10 of the vote and still win.

       The 2 party system was never "created". The democrat and republican party's are private 3rd party companies and are not part of nor controlled or regulated by the constitutional law.

       Not true. At least not in a proportional representation system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let imagine a government made up of 100 seats, with 5 parties vying for them. To become the "government" you need 51 seats.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a "first past the post" system each of those 100 seats is filled with a direct election, the person with the highest amount of votes getting the seat. So for one seat one candidate could receive 24% of the vote while the rest got 19%. The person who won the seat would actually have received less than a quarter of the votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that person was a member of a party that won 51 seats this way, they could technically become the government with less than 24% of the popular vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a fully proportional system, all 100 seats would be decided by the percentage of the popular vote. If one party received 24% of the vote, while the other parties only received 19%, that party would get 24 seats and the rest would get 19 each.
      </p>
      <p>
       To form a government, at least three parties would have to agree to form a coalition government, which would mean the government would actually be composed of parties that received more than 51% of the popular vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are variations on this, but a proportional system is far and away the most democratic way of forming a government.

       Labels like liberal and conservative are scams that too many people buy into. All they do is divide people and make them think that the other side is an enemy while the people that actually have power sit back and laugh at them both.

       No; the people quite deliberately choose sides on these matters and those matters are more important to them that us - we are the fringe group and everyone is not a complete, abject moron.
       <br/>
       Pretending that people are sheep and are led and ignorantly choose between two false choices is self-fluffing victimization.

       True.

       This site expands "left and right" into four - "authoritarian left, libertarian left, authoritarian right, libertarian right" - the idea being that people's views fall within these boundaries, but that there are distinct differences between leftists or rightists that means they shouldn't be lumped together under one label.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I come out as a Libertarian Leftist (more left and liberal than Ghandi). On a pure left/right scale I rank about the same as Stalin. But on an authoritarian/liberal scale Stalin and I are on opposite ends of the spectrum - lumping us together would require ignorning the glaring differences between our beliefs.

       The labels aren't about anything but specifying what team someone chose, and what ideology they decided to adhere to.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not good because if you say 'I'm a liberal' or 'I'm a conservative' it boxes you into that ideology in the minds of your audience, and very likely your own mind, and you lose your freedom of speech and your freedom of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think like 'I'm a person and this is what I believe,' and I'm open to the ideas of others who think that way.
