    <div class="md"><p>Exactly this.  It&#39;s the reason why if I tell my friends they are being spied on by the government, they laugh and think I&#39;m a paranoid fool.  But then it&#39;s reported months later by &#39;mainstream news media&#39; they think are respectable, they&#39;ll consider it true.</p>

<p>Most people are conditioned at this stage to blinded agree.  Money talks.<br/>

Many people don&#39;t realise that anything you sell after your finished with it, or do a job for a mate for a little money; needs to be declared as an income. I simply ask people if they declare all their little cash incomes, because if they don&#39;t they are breaking the law and need to pay the extra tax. I&#39;ll happily tell the state for them coz they have nothing to hide, right? They always answer with, &quot;oh, never thought about that&quot;. </p>

<p>When you are born you are given a name and identifier, all well and dandy. But as you continue your jeorney through life there are bills, chargers and fees to be paid to be in the system. Not talking entitlement here, just to be able to travel you have to have a passport, pay fees for using the roads, pay licencing fees to be allowed to use the personal item such as a car(and it is justified for personal safety of all users of the road), you pay reg. Fees for your personal property, schooling, work, taxes. You are not born free, you are born into a system, where everything has a cost. If you dont want to be a part of such system there isnt much you can do, as everything relies on that system, true freedom means there is allowence for more than one system, but alas that isnt thw world we live in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a digital nomad (an international gypsy who works online) I see this everyday, in order to travel, by plane or to purchase a car, get insurance which you need to legally drive the cars, etc it is nigh on impossible not to keep punching in your slave&#39;s timecard because no matter how free you think you can be it is virtually impossible to move about without showing your slave papers. You can&#39;t do it undocumented, you can&#39;t do it without constantly being tracked by some organisation or the other. 
Thanks to bureaucracy (I never thought I would say that) that can&#39;t completely lock the people down or control everything they do because bureaucracy = inefficiency but it will come once cashless society, AI &amp; biometric IDing are in full swing, there will be no more fleeting escapes. The stupid thing is that the dumb fucks who want all this power don&#39;t even realise that it will probably be the AI who become our masters in the end and they too will become slaves as well!</p>

Why else would it protect and import Afghanistan&#39;s heroin to fuel its drug war, or enact laws despised by the majority of the population and beat peaceful protesters to disturb the &quot;domestic tranquility?&quot; The government functions because of these things, not as a protection against them.</p>

<p>This video titled &quot;Don&#39;t talk to the police&quot; was what motivated me, many years ago, to give up this type of thought. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty long but the part that was so interesting to me is how he goes through all the situations where a person speaks to the police, and no matter how carefully he/she speaks, it can be used against them. It&#39;s amazing.</p>

<p>Now imagine that everything that you&#39;ve ever said is in a database somewhere. Whoever has access to that database could paint whatever picture of your life that you want. Remember that time you told your best friend, &quot;I&#39;ll kill you&quot;? Imagine a lawyer posts those words on a projector at your trial citing this as an indication of your character as a murderer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t blame others for falling prey to a form of psychological conditioning that began almost from the moment they were born and whose main priority was to get them to respect and obey any recognised form of authority quite literally without question. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a system that was designed by the very people who were intent on establishing and maintaining their own authority over others and enjoying all the perks and privileges that come with it.</p>

<p>There is no school for anyone still under the sway of that to unlearn that obedience  as adults and all of their previous experience has shown them that the penalties and punishment for failing to comply or daring to disagree were always more extreme than the offense ever warranted so there is a distinct disincentive to even consider questioning let alone not going along with any recognised authority&#39;s stance, opinion, or dictates. </p>

<p>Those individuals are either too afraid to risk thinking for themselves or else don&#39;t actually believe they are intelligent enough to do so. </p>

<p>So they&#39;re not and never have actually been &quot;free&quot; in any real way when it comes to that. They not only don&#39;t understand or appreciate the sense of individuality that leads others to question or challenge the ruling authorities they mistrust and are fearful of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a false mentality.  The fact is that at any moment while driving.  I could have a corrupt police officer pull me over, plant drugs on my car.  If in Louisiana, I get arrested and placed in a trial but there is no public defender to use and how that defender is paid greatly benefits the prisons and hurts the tax payer.  With no public defender, I either plead guilty due to threats or I attempt to defend myself which they will argue against.  Then due to this and them trying to make an example out of me, they would give the maximum sentence to threaten people against defending themselves.  If I resist an unlawful and corrupt arrest, more time is extended.  Then I get out, and no one would hire me and I am forced to actually traffic drugs due to the connections that I gained from jail.  There is a problem in the current justice system as it can really mess someone up if they do not have the resources to fight it.  </p>

<p>There is a lot of tiny problems that add up to one major problem.  It needs to be fixed as people&#39;s rights are being violated and their lives are being destroyed.  This is why I criticize the system because of how easy it would be for someone&#39;s life to be ruined through no fault of their own.</p>
