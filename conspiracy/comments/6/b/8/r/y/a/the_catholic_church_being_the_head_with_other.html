        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know many people here do believe there are strange and powerful occult like groups who have some motive. 
Many people believe its related to globalism and the NWO or a one world government.
Also some believe its related to the Georgia guidestones and a variety of other groups.</p>

<p>But i am here to throw out a speculation that does have some tiny bits to give it some merit. That many of these groups may also work with the catholic church <strong>or</strong> powerful people in the catholic church who want to use the catholic church for gain.</p>

<p>Many people also believe the globalists will be successful in thier current battle against this rise of nationalism we see. What is going to come out of this victory will be globolism centered in europe as we can see this movement starting already. (This is what some believe will be &quot;the beast power&quot;) The beast in the bible is said to be rode by a woman. A woman in scripture is symbolic for a &quot;church&quot; all through the scriptures. What church could possibly fit this role? </p>

<p>If any of these ideas resonate with you id like you to check out </p>

<h2><a href="/r/originalchristianity">/r/originalchristianity</a></h2>

<p>The beliefs you find taught there will make a lot more sense to you than what you have heard from catholocism/protestantism. Those teachings are not new. There have always been groups through history who taught elements of it going all the way back to the apostles. There are books and videos about that exact topic as well.</p>

<p>All those different groups and churches do not get involved with conspiracy, but what they teach may resonate with you. In fact scripture tells us to not even worry about conspiracys.</p>

<p>Isaiah 8 12</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not say, ‘A conspiracy,’
Concerning all that this people call a conspiracy,
Nor be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scripture tells us not to even worry about it. (God is in control)
Though there is nothing wrong with investigating what you hear.</p>

<p>the main teachings of those who try to follow the most original form of christianity are and will be called heretical by the catholic church. In fact the catholic church nearly exterminated one group who existed atleast as far back as 1100s and into the 1600s. They were called the waldensians. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldensians">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldensians</a>
They still go by the same name today. But the persecution worked and they no longer teach what they used to.</p>

<p>Anyways, check it out if you like. It will definitely contain a lot of info you likely have never heard before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. Well some things they say in there  may or may not be true. Its really hard to say.</p>

<p>Id still say check out <a href="/r/originalchristianity">/r/originalchristianity</a>.   It is a worldwide movement with apostolic succession, been around for a long time. Estimated to have 140,000 to 300,000 members... Its really hard to say.  The subreddit is new and rarely advetized but the information it will link you to extensive scholarly sources able to answer just about any question you have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is an overwhelming amount of evidence showing that God does not openly reveal itself to all of us &quot;whithin&quot;. 
I think you may have disdain for the bible as you may have been hearing a false gospel / false teachings that do not make sense. What i believe which comes from the original languages of the bible and the original teachings is likely nothing you have evet heard before.</p>

<p>How would you describe your overal beliefs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve often thought about Catholicism being the root of all evil and what a perfect front it is. Some people would naturally feel uncomfortable or guilty questioning the popular Christian religion or making any crazy accusations against it. </p>

<p>The spotlight has already shined on some of the disgusting &amp; lustful corruption that exists. You already know I&#39;m referring to the sexual abuse and rape by priests/popes. </p>

<p>Or what about the church castrating the young boys in choir to cease the growth of their vocal cords in order to profit from it? -Which essentially ended up killing hundreds of young boys. I know that was a heavy practice done way back when, but according to an article I read the practice was still orchestrated until the 20th century. Honestly, I don&#39;t doubt some things considering I know corruption runs deep and can be hidden well. </p>

<p>My uncle who is a conspiracy-guru had told me that in order for some priests/popes to move up the chain of command -or whatever lol- they&#39;d have to first carry out specific tasks, one being the molestation of a child. Whether or not that&#39;s actually true is beyond me, I&#39;ve tried digging throughout the web for factual evidence but have come empty-handed every time. Then again, it&#39;s not easy finding too much dirt on the Catholic church. </p>

<p>Something else I have found interesting was the unique design of the Paul IV Audience Hall. I learned as many others have that in Genesis, the Snake depicted Lucifer. Well, if you look up images of the Audience Hall you&#39;ll see the well constructed building creates a illusion of a face of a snake. The windows being the eyes with the diamond slit pupils, the pillars being the fangs and the roof &amp; walls designed to look similar to scales. Right smack-dab in the middle of the mouth sits the Pope. It sounds a little far fetched but I mean c&#39;mon now, some evidence is hidden in plain sight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i saw a video about that before as well. Yeah why choose the shape of a serpent when satan is called in the bible &quot;that serpent of old&quot;. And Jesus called evil people serpents or vipers as well.</p>

<p>There are other things they have done that is wierd. Such as trying to exterminate another group of christians who held to original beliefs. </p>

<p>ttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldensians</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1487, Pope Innocent VIII issued a bull for the extermination of the Vaudois</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A catholic general oversaw this event.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Little children were torn from the arms of their mothers, clasped by their tiny feet, and their heads dashed against the rocks; or were held between two soldiers and their quivering limbs torn up by main force. Their mangled bodies were then thrown on the highways or fields, to be devoured by beasts. The sick and the aged were burned alive in their dwellings. Some had their hands and arms and legs lopped off, and fire applied to the severed parts to staunch the bleeding and prolong their suffering. Some were flayed alive, some were roasted alive, some disemboweled; or tied to trees in their own orchards, and their hearts cut out. Some were horribly mutilated, and of others the brains were boiled and eaten by these cannibals. Some were fastened down into the furrows of their own fields, and ploughed into the soil as men plough manure into it. Others were buried alive. Fathers were marched to death with the heads of their sons suspended round their necks. Parents were compelled to look on while their children were first outraged [raped], then massacred, before being themselves permitted to die</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can read about all that in the wikipedia.
Some say we cant judge a church theology by its past actions.</p>

<p>But Christ himself said</p>

<p>Matthew 7:15-20New King James Version (NKJV)</p>

<p>You Will Know Them by Their Fruits
15 “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 16 You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? 17 Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 Therefore by their fruits you will know them.</p>

<p>You are to judge any group who has propheies by thier actions to determine whether they are true or not. The catholic church has many prophecies. They have the fruits of murder in their past, killing bible believing christians with a horrible death</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m Catholic so of course I&#39;m very biased, but I think you&#39;re giving way too much credit to the current Church. It&#39;s not the same Church that helped the Nazis lol. I don&#39;t think their power is anything like it was maybe 100 years ago?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well you and I will have a very different view of prophecy then as well.
My prophetic beliefs would be considered heretical to your church, since i believe these verses to mean what they say:</p>

<p>AV Re 20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and [I saw] the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received [his] mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AV Re 20:5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This [is] the first resurrection.</p>

<p>AV Re 20:6 Blessed and holy [is] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could find a video explaining all this. </p>

<p>As a deeply converted christian i try to have a good attitude and care towards everyone as best as i can. So me asking this is not out of hostility, but what are the reasons you are a catholic? Grew up in it? The history they teach? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what the verses from Revelations has to do with any of this stuff. All those say is that some will reign with Jesus during the 1000 year war after the rapture? <em>I</em> don&#39;t think you&#39;re a heretic for believing that but that book isn&#39;t one that I&#39;ve covered while studying with others in the Church so I&#39;m not sure how most Catholics view Revelations. </p>

<p>And no offense taken, if I was afraid to talk about my faith I wouldn&#39;t be very good at it right? I grew up Episcopal (Catholic Light) but converted to Catholicism in the last few years. When I was younger my parents dragged me all over the world and the places that always drew me in and really inspired me were Catholic Churches. So I wouldn&#39;t say the history that <em>they</em> teach per se, but the history of the church in general. </p>

<p>Anymore questions? I&#39;d be happy to give you my views on whatever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that is a new one for me! I&#39;ll have to look farther into it because that little summary wasn&#39;t really much. And I was also under the impression that the 1000 year reign came <em>after</em> the Judgement/Rapture. But like I said before, Revelations isn&#39;t a book I&#39;ve discussed in a Catholic group before so I&#39;m ignorant on this stuff. But <em>I</em> still don&#39;t think you&#39;re a heretic my resourceful friend. This Catholic doesn&#39;t care what a website says.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a deeply converted Christian. And a Catholic.</p>

<p>The Protestants churches have been taught a <em>lot</em> of fundamental errors about the Catholic Church.  *“There are not one hundred people in the United States who hate The Catholic Church, but there are millions who hate what they wrongly perceive the Catholic Church to be.” *</p>

<p>If the church taught what you say it taught, I wouldn&#39;t be Catholic either.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t teach the awful things you think it does!  It&#39;s catechism is 100% defensible with Scripture.  It&#39;s teachings are 100% authentic to Christ&#39;s life and words.  More research is necessary on your part, please.</p>

<p>On the topic of interpretation of the Book of Revelation, here is Catholic author Taylor Marshall on the traditional biblical Catholic interpretation of the passages about the woman and the beats in Revelation. <a href="http://taylormarshall.com/2013/05/the-two-beasts-in-revelation-what-do.html">http://taylormarshall.com/2013/05/the-two-beasts-in-revelation-what-do.html</a>  </p>

<p>(The two beasts are historical interpreted as <em>pagan</em> Jerusalem and <em>pagan</em> Rome.  Not Christian Jerusalem or Christian Rome.)  </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying the Catholic Church is perfect.  But at her core, she is fundamentally Christian and is the Church founded by Our Lord Jesus Christ.  </p>

<p>(in fact I just posted somewhere else about the communist infiltration of the Church; like there was Judas next to Jesus, there is paganism infiltrated into the bosom of Christianity)</p>
