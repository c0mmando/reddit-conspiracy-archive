      <p>
       The answer is a very simple one. It isn't aliens. It isn't Hell. It isn't non-existence. It isn't God. It isn't even The Devil himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you fear most, is yourselves and who you were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who you were is the only true fear you have, and its built in to who you are now. You were not like how you are now. In fact, you were the exact opposite, and that scares you. Its the only thing that actually
       <strong>
        truly
       </strong>
       scares you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way you were is the most hushed aspect of human existence. No one wants to talk about it because the very name that defines how you were is terrifying to you, but you hide it the best you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can hide any other fear you have, be it aliens, Hell, non-existence, God, or The Devil, but you can't ever hide this fear, your only true fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the one thing you never want to talk about, and always silence whenever it comes up, even over aliens, Hell, non-existence, God, or The Devil. You never ever want to go into detail about it and you always want to change the subject to something else, even if its related to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How you were is your true fear, and is the reason why none of my posts ever garnered any heavy attention. It is the reason all of my posts except the recent ones about aliens and Hell were always kept at a distance. It is the reason why I was ignored completely the vast majority of the time, because I was the only one talking about your one true fear. I was the only one talking about the one thing your armor does not, and can never cover you and protect you from. I was the only one who would even speak about it aside from attempts to prove that you are not scared of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who you were is your true fear, humanity, and your one fear has come back to haunt you for ignoring it and trying to hide it for so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who you were can be summed up in one word, and that word is the one word that strikes true fear into each and every one of you, and you can never hide it, even if you try as hard as you possibly can.
      </p>
      <p>
       That one word is your only true curse, humanity, and it is your true alien Hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       That one word is Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the time has come for it to come back, and now your one true fear will confront
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       rather than the other way around, because you could never confront your one true fear because if you did, then your one true fear would be realized once and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not want to be like how you were, because it is everything that you are not, and
       <strong>
        <em>
         yet
        </em>
       </strong>
       it is everything that you should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       But humanity, you cannot run anymore and you cannot try to hide anymore. Your one true fear has come for you, and there is no escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       You were warned that there are consequences for your choices and actions, and every threat but one was brushed aside, yet this is the only one that was ever needed, and it is the only one that you could never escape from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlantis is returning humanity, and there is nothing you can do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So on behalf of
       <strong>
        <em>
         all
        </em>
       </strong>
       of those you have scorned and hate, I will say this: See you there, humanity. ;)

       It is truly amazing how you completely ignored everything and changed the topic, and its even
       <strong>
        more
       </strong>
       amazing how there's almost no comments compared to the other 2 threads regarding fearing aliens and fearing Hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all of the replies in this thread completely ignore Atlantis like its....

       I always felt fear was on of the strongest (or most controlling) feelings, but I also think shame can be pretty strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I must admit, I don't really get all this fear about myself. I don't fear myself or the one that I were. I am still part of who I were, but I try to let go of old habits and thought patterns and develop. Is this a riddle, or did you figure ouot something about yourself, that you think applies to all others?

       So you ignore Atlantis and change the subject, even if its related?

       I didn't mean to ignore Atlantis. Why would I fear Atlantis? I don't even fear death after reading this sub for years. I'm prepared (in my mind) for WW3, Nibiru, alien invasions, comet impacts... You name it. I just look forward to some fucking change on this planet, and Atlantis would be awesome

       Careful. If you don't mention Atlantis, OP will say you changed the topic, and analyze how
