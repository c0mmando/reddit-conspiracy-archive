       These are excellent, but doesn't this contradict KibBitzLaw's theory that the gate is in the Green Zone?

       You're probably right I'm not sure, but have you read the sources I've linked related to the stargate? A lot of them surprisingly check out  and there may be something to it.

       At worst, a plane full of explosives would have blown a charred hole in the top, leaving the lower part wholly intact. Probably wouldn't have even done that. There's a reason high-explosives are used on infantry while armor piercing is used on tanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, it wouldn't have reduced each building to billowing clouds of radioactive dust, as is what happened.
      </p>

       As for what actually happened, I'll let you research that yourself.

       Yeah you realize armor piercing missiles are tipped with depleted uranium, right? They don't just throw MOAR EXPLOSIVES at the job -- they had to engineer a solution to make it work.

       He says in the tweets before that a company stuffed the WTC with explosives along with the explosives in the plane.

      <p>
       Soooooo when the plane crashed on top it set of explosives that were packed inside the said buildings I am guessing

       Look, the only way for this psyop to have worked was to come clean about everything -- everything: the demolition method, the media misdirection, Mossad.. the whole 9 yards.
       <em>
        Then
       </em>
       , after winning our trust, they could have spun our attention in a whole new direction and get us thinking about stargates or whatever. This was clumsy as fuck and, frankly, an embarassment.

       The thing is, stargates aren't a new topic to everyone, so the idea that it's a psyop doesn't really work.
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't address the question about both explosives in the planes and bombs in the basement being within the realm of possibilities. Just because
       <em>
        what actually happened
       </em>
       hasn't been dumped yet doesn't necessitate this info all being thrown in the trash just because it doesn't fit a particular narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot happening right now. It's been said that when truths start coming out, it will be the most difficult for those attached to specific beliefs. If there's ever been a time to entertain new ideas, it's now given how little we truly know for certain.

       So while it seems you hold the source you quote in low esteem, you maintain it's fact. Is that because it's a certainty beyond all doubt? Given disinfo gets mixed in with legit info regularly from all directions, how do you know their info is correct without having participated in the testing yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your attachment to this particular narrative and the insistence this guy's info is all wrong because you disagree with one aspect is intriguing, but you keep doing you, boo.

       to see how the LARP was going and responded directly to a Reddit user when called out on it.

       Also, it makes it look like an interdimensional entity doesn't know the difference between a 747 and a 767. I found a handy chart to prevent such confusion in the future:

       I mean, what should I look for? I've seen at a very minimum, the following theories:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        thousands of explosive devices hidden throughout every floor of the building
       </li>
       <li>
        hologram planes that were actually missiles and not planes at all
       </li>
       <li>
        remote controlled airplanes filled with thermite explosive material
       </li>
       <li>
        underground nuclear detonation
       </li>
       <li>
        remote controlled aircraft switched out for passenger planes, passengers still alive and all convinced to keep silent
       </li>
       <li>
        passengers dumped into the drink at sea
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I mean, some of the crazy ass bullshit I've read is really really stretching the limits of legitimate physically plausible reasoning and just frankly distracts from the maybe otherwise legitimate conspiracy theories. So please, by all means, guide me a little here. It's not as if I'm completely uneducated on the existing and competing theories.

       lol and you are going around singing the micro-nuke fallacy (a theory that was designed to turn the investigation into blithering insane stupidity and unfortunately gobbled up by many and of course pushed by the shills).  There were no nukes.  There was nano-thermite in the columns.  You don't need fucking nukes.  The weaponized nanoi-thermite has been found and isolated.  The nuke theory is as credible as the space-beam theory and the no-planes theory and the pod-theory.

For the love of god don't take ideas from Zacharia Sitchin seriously. Good read, but it's in the same vein as as the Da Vinci code, fiction.

       Planet X or 'Nibiru' if real will start to be detected between 2017-sept to 2022 around there. A powerful type of telescope in Hawaii (i believe it's in Hawaii due to the station there having advanced techs for this type of thing).

the planet might be real and I'm very excited about it.

       This guy is so wrong on many aspects of Islam. Starting with the word Islam itself and what it actually means:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In Arabic, the word “Islam” means submission or surrender – however, it was derived from the root word “salam”. From this root word, you can also derive the words peace and safety." 
He can't just combine an Arabic name "Isa" with an English noun "lamb" to help his cause. Also, we don't believe Isa (pbuh) died/was sacrificed. I could go on
      </p>

       Other than that, I appreciate him trying to unite the ppl and that's very important

       Are you familiar with reverse speech analysis? It's interesting when it comes to finding out if people are being truthful, and if not, what their words means.
      </p>
      <p>
       A recent reverse speech analysis (one of several) done on Corey Goode indicates his reliability isn't a question and he's being truthful. Here's a

       </a>
       brought about by Bill Ryan's recent statement. The analysis on his words is interesting, too.

       I'm more inclined to believe Goode is a reliable source than using reverse speech analysis. That is the most subjective form of detecting accuracy that I think I've seen.

       If it didn't have the history of usefulness that it does, I'd be giving it some side-eye. Given that apps are available and allow others to verify the accuracy of what someone else says, it's perhaps something to look into.

       The truth is going to all spill out one day and then we'll all know. For now, it seems being aware of and entertaining ideas we might not believe in seems to be the way to go as awareness will at least prevent a complete blindside. I'm thinking everybody will have a few things they've been wrong about, so attachment to ideas as the way things are when we don't really know the truth about much doesn't seem prudent.

       No one said it's the arbiter of truth; it's simply one more tool that's available if someone chooses to use it, whether it's the belief that someone else has used it correctly and providing accurate data or diving in and taking the time to do it on their own.

       With all of the political ridiculousness going on, it might be interesting to see some of the more incendiary accusations from both sides analyzed; even the presidential debates are likely to be good for a few more laughs if it was used to analyze any of those.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's potentially a lot of fun to be had with this if there's no attachment to what's being looked at.

       Haven't seen this mentioned yet, but I distinctly remember an episode/story arc in Stargate SG-1 about a movie/TV show being made with characters very similar to Jack O'Neill and the gang. The show was created by people who were desperate to spread the truth or something, but it ended up making people consider it a fiction more than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar to a lot of stuff I read in this subreddit and UFO subreddits. TPTB or whatever are totally cool with Hollywood making movies and TV shows about stuff that could actually be happening because people are complacent and quick to dismiss anything they've seen in fiction as being nothing more than fiction.

       Episode 200. I have been half joking talking about this for awhile. Full disclosure, I'm a massive stargate fan, and am surely blinded by bias of being saturated in the subject. Like the people that watch Twilight too many times, and start believing in sun sparkly vampires.

       I loved that episode!
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminds me of the X files, they had an episode that was the same plot: A director want to make a movie based off of the actual agents and it just ends up being super cheesy and very 'hollywood'. I love meta episodes like these. The people working on these shows know that they are getting inspiration from a true source, but they still can't help how fluffed-up the extra plots and character development makes the shows :P

       It's Blue Beam or preparation for Blue Beam. Podesta has also started blabbing about alien disclosure recently.

       Yes! People need to dig into that set of emails and see what they can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I remember correctly, the leaked emails were between Podesta and a member of Blink 182 and how the band member wanted to work with Podesta on disclosure projects in the msm,
      </p>
      <p>
       and more terrifying, working on disclosure projects that would be aired and used in preteen/young adult Pop Culture mediums.

       We need to see exactly what these people consider to be the 'truth' and why they are trying to push it on an unsuspecting population.

       An hour ago
       <a href="https://twitter.com/kibbitzlaw/status/863951701719609344">
        this tweet
       </a>
       talks about Stargate being discovered in iraq.
I google stargate iraq and I find
       <a href="http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-719922">
        this
       </a>
       whistleblower Boris Chertok (engineer of one of the first manned missions to space) tells all and story checks out with the twitter account's tweets exact date and everything.
Further research and I find
       <a href="http://exopolitics.org/stargate-sg-1-soft-disclosure-according-to-secret-space-program-whistleblower/">
        this
       </a>
       a disclosure by another whistleblower named Corey Goode who was a part of a secret space program. Story checks out again.
Further more I find google earth images of the supposed startgate approximate location in
       <a href="http://www.thelivingmoon.com/42stargate/03files/Star_Gate_Iraq.html">
        this website

       <a href="https://prezi.com/m/8jmmqmkdep4l/the-iraq-war-a-conquest-for-alien-technology/">
        AND NOW FOR THE BIG ENCHILADA
       </a>
       (THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FREAKISHLY BUT IT CHECKS OUT WITH EVERYTHING)
This is much bigger than just some connection to some tweet. This checks out with what Alex Jones has been saying about inter dimensional gates and inter dimensional beings communicating with the elites etc.
