       Example: are u inclined to believe, lets say a social worker, who tells you that you an illness? or would you be more comfortable being told that by a doctor? one is trained in the field of medicine, one is not. Not to say you were wrong in those examples, ive faced the exact same thing with friends/family so i know what youre talking about. Youre not a journalist, politician, or advisor of any kind (i assume), so theres little for those you talk to to believe. Youd have more credibility being in a profession that covers that material. But the more often you are proven right the credibility youd have. thats the stage im at now. i was "crazy" before, now im asked what i think about some new theory.

       i should have expanded on my thought there. i agree with you. those professions have been compromised, no doubt. but this culture is trained to believe them, hence the lack of credibility for those NOT in those fields. A few hundred years ago, you could claim a profession simply because you study the material and know a lot about that particular subject. That is clearly not the case these days.
