       Twitter, reddit, youtube bots from DNC : concrete stuff, proof in action on youtube, source codes, etc ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Either it's a legit leak or it's a really impressive LARP (autistic level I would say).

       What do you think about it ? And the fact that the sub is almost silent about it ?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT :
      </p>
      <p>
       Since no one seems to want to talk about the subject whereas there is a lot to discuss about, i'll present an analysis of the differents possible opinion on this.
At the time of the edit, only one new post on this sub about this :
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6bkhul/the_tools_of_the_shill_anon_on_4chan_releases_a/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6bkhul/the_tools_of_the_shill_anon_on_4chan_releases_a/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He listed the links of the source codes leak, you can check them on his thread (thanks for the list !).
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary : A random guy claim on /pol/ being a DNC insider and wanting to leak the source code of DNC bots targeting twitter, reddit and youtube. He posted screenshots and pastebin extracts of what seems to be source code for bots targeting those cited. He also made a demonstration of a possible youtube bot able to create several user spamming the same fake news videos pretty quickly (see youtube link above). Those are the facts, now let's try to find the truth out of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take the different possibilities of this situation and try to weight the credibility of each one by raising the questions they are implying and try to answer them. There are two main hypothesis :
      </p>
      <p>
       --&gt; The leak is real
      </p>
      <p>
       --&gt; It's a LARP
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the questions we should ask ourselves :
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the few source code leaks seems legits ? 
Even if this seems to be a legit extract of a bot, is it linked to DNC ?
What are the implications if this is a legit leak ?
If it's legit, why not just give everything away ? Maybe he has already leaked it to wikileaks or reporters and just want to warn people ? After all, wouldn't be a bit chaos on those platforms if those bots were given to the public ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the youtube fake news bot demonstration credible ? Could it not be a bot ? If it's not a bot, can one person do this alone (a lot of differents fake news videos, little repost interval and several accounts), or is it the work of a team ?
If it's a LARP, who did it ? A random lunatic wanting to make noise on the web ? An group of people doing a social operation for politic or money interest ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably a lot more questions issued by one hypothesis or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main point here is that, if we exclude the 'random lunatic guy' hypothesis, the implications raises serious questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we need more digging before labeling it 'legit' or 'larp', and even in the latter case, we must now forgot the questions 'who ?' and 'why ?'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's done for me tonight gotta sleep (I'm from Europe).
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope some of you find a bit of truth out of this chaotic world.

       Loving when I open a discussion about either spreading a legit leak or exposing a potential LAARP (of an impressive quality if it is one) and I get downvoted without any justifications in comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway ...
      </p>
      <p>
       The leak started 3 hours ago on pol and the only other post since then on this sub is this one (0 points, almost no comments) :
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6bjpoy/x_post_dnc_source_code/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6bjpoy/x_post_dnc_source_code/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I must ask ... why the hell nobody is talking about it ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either it's a legit leak that deserve to be spread, either someone is going through a lot of efforts (including coding impressive news, youtube bots, putting them in action to prove it and leaking the code) to try to discredit the DNC !
      </p>
      <p>
       So in both cases, don't tell me that this deserve no discussion ...

       I believe there's real Anon's posting not LARPs around the internet, and when TPTB see it they use a network of disinformers to flood the internet with lots of false info &amp; LARPs. It could also be used by a real Anon as a way to play it safe and not draw too much attention by diluting a true &amp; significant leak with lots of inaccurate or straight up BS leaks.

       I'm guessing there was a typo, did you mean to say he "wrote about the FBI and they raided his house"?
Not trying to be a grammar nazi here I'm just genuinely interested and trying to understand.

       I'm not very familiar with him but have seen his name around quite a bit. So he wrote some things that were critical of them/ hinted at a conspiracy/coverup and they raided his house?

       But the code really isn't much more than boilerplate code. It doesn't reveal anything specific to media matter/ctr/shariablue. I'm pretty sure there's multiple libraries that already do reddit/yt logging/post. A lot of the code could be tidied up by using libraries, such as newtonsoft Json.net and an SQL ORM. The code is literally showing nothing insightful and in fact lacks what I expect to be there -- namely, how do they create bot accounts (captcha breaking neural nets aren't that trivial to make), how do they handle signing in from different/multiple IP (oops, it's mysteriously missing), where's the upvotes code, etc. I'm not saying it's larp, but as far as the code goes it's about as unspecific as it could possibly be, as if it's not revealing anything from their internal architecture.
