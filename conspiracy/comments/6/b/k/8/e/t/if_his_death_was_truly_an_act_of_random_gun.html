       How hard would it actually be to run a campaign on anti-gun violence with this guy? There's pictures of him wearing American flag clothing all over the place on the internet. He was like Mr. America and a gun took his life, it's a real missed opportunity.

       This narrative makes no fucking sense. Why would the Dems kill someone that already leaked info? What purpose would that serve? If we're putting together a narrative that relates to him leaking into it makes more sense whoever put him up to stealing the info would kill him to cover their tracks, so someone like GOP or Russians. Dems killing him masses ZERO sense.

       What exactly is this "nothing"? They either acknowledge his death or they don't. Acknowledging his death results results in them being deemed dirty. They don't and that is proof enough to some.

       You don't bring it up. Stop momentum in its tracks. Law of attraction-style. That's the way you do it if you have sense about you. Of course, these people don't so they believe the "correct" thing to do is to make it a gun control issue and Seth the new poster boy. It's twisted.

       Yeah this is an extremely​ good claim. They love gun control and so does Hillary so if he was killed while on DNC she would have praised gun control.

       Why would they though?  Gun regulation is a very hot topic issue as we're all aware.  It is not something most campaigns are run on because it can cause a huge amount of backlash.  I think it is fairly well known that Clinton would have been for some sort of gun regulation law, but coming out and saying that over and over would seriously harm her campaign more than it already was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being.  If she was truly wanting something to use in her campaign to push gun regulation as one of her policies she could have used past mass shootings, or any number of gun murders during her campaign to push for gun regulation.  Yet she stayed fairly quiet about gun regulation throughout her entire campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just isn't something campaign on.  Maybe if she was elected she might have started talking about it more, but before she won it would have been political suicide for her.

He was just 27 years old," she said. "Surely we can agree that weapons of war have no place on the streets of America.

       Yeah, I'm no Clinton supporter, but I do remember that she mentioned it once or twice. Typically the Democrats like to highlight events like this because they are pro gun control but they only mentioned this incident in public a few times. It was mentioned though, so the claim that they completely ignored it is obviously false

       It wasn't brought up multiple times as a 'poster boy' as the OP stated. You're kinda being hyper-critical here... They definitely haven't used it to great effect. Completely ignoring it would be very suspicious. I think there is a point there.

       The campaign likely didn't want to face accusations of using him as a poster boy. If you guys have thought about it, they did too, and they'd recognize the potential backlash. Could be that simple, no?

       That's what I was thinking. Using his death to push any agenda would have come off as callous. Idk a lot about Seth, but if he happened to be personally opposed to gun control legislation, using him as a poster boy for it would be have been downright contemptible.

       Doesn't stop them for playing victims of gun violence for political gain when the victim is black. That's callous as well. Doesn't stop them in that scenario. Just sayin.

       I mean that's a little different because in a case like that one they're able to rest their laurels atop the blessing of the deceased's grieving family, while hiding behind the idealistic farce that they only seek to give a voice to the voiceless. It's really the families of the deceased who are the one's requesting the treatment, politicians oblige because it makes them look good (some might some might sincerely care. i really dont knowanymore) You couldn't really point out the ulterior motive or sleaziness of the politician directly,

       Mentioning something once or twice is not the same as being a poster boy. Look what happened in the UK with Jo Cox. THAT is poster boy (or in this case, girl) recognition.

       Why isn't he a poser boy for gun control? Because DC has a

        shit ton of gun violence.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the kid that got shot on my block in DC should be the poster child? No, not the recent one, the one before that. This year.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that area where Rich got shot is in the area between establish hipster gentrification and "pioneer" hipster gentrification. I know someone that lived about 5 blocks east of there. Had people get shot on his block, got robbed on his way back from the train.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want a conspiracy theory? Rich was at last call at a late bar and walked home through a known rough-ish part of town where drunk people get rolled. No taxi, no Uber. Parents seem to not to want that much attention about his death. My guess? Enough coke to show up in a test.

       Yea but whats the point of shooting someone and not robbing them. He didn't get rolled like you said. He had all his valuables. Even if it was for drugs as you say, why not take the money as well.  But I guess there are people that go around shooting random folks for fun. But that is hardly as common a crime as you are trying to imply.

       Not shot for drugs, I'm just saying that a toxicology screening would have detected what I imagine is at least the background radiation level of coke in your system if you are a young hip kid in DC. Parents get really sensitive about their child's memory sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, Go look at the DC crime map. No joke, I was trying to find this homicide and picked a place I thought was close at 110 Todd Pl NE. There was one homicide on Rhode Island Ave NE. So I google homicides on Rhode Island Ave and get....
       <a href="http://www.popville.com/2016/07/dc-crime/">
        another homicide. This one on V St. NE
       </a>
       , same area. And none of these are your man here. Occam's razor, a late night walk home resulting in getting shot is common in DC. In a 1500 foot radius, there's 1 homicide, 15 robberies with a gun, and 9 assaults with a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how common is someone getting shot at for fun? Well,
       <a href="http://wtop.com/dc/2017/05/man-sentenced-randomly-shooting-cars-people-petworth/">
        here's a guy that was randomly shooting stuff around one neighborhood
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm sure this is fake news to you because it's on the internet. As for me, a random shooting happened literally across the street from my house in 2015. Kids doing a drive by, shooting at other kids. One of my neighbor's cars had a flat tire and bullet holes while they sorted out the insurance. But that's small time. A couple years before that we used to have "Shotgun guy" who would just show up and rob people in your own yard. But sometimes it didn't work out. One of the early gentrification pioneers was in their hot tub on their porch when Shotgun Guy shows up and tries to rob them. Before he can get them into the house, someone starts walking down the alley and Shotgun guy runs off. If it's a crime of opportunity, sometimes the opportunity is over before you finish the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the time I found 6 or 7 .22 rounds, like live rounds, on the ground outside a liquor store. Or the time I saw two kids breaking into a car, so I chased them on my bike and they threw the bag they had in an alley before they could go through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's cute that you think you know all about crime in DC and how random shootings are so strange, but DC's crime problem is well-renowned, including gun violence.

       Again I don't see how DC being full of crime means someone who is shot and declared to be robbed has all his valuables and nothing was stolen. Why not just say it's a random killing, or even that he was killed in stray gang violence or theorize he was killed over a mistaken identity. I totally agree with you though that DC is full of crime and never called it fake news? I really don't understand your point. But it is total fucking bullshit someone can shoot at people randomly in public and only get
       <strong>
        10
       </strong>
       years, while drug dealers get fucking life sentences for the smallest bits of crack or heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea he probably gets high, a lot of people do. But what does that have to do with the circumstances of his death? Are you implying he did a deal and maybe got shot over a drug deal gone wrong? That is definitely possible it does happen all the time in cities. Hell it happens in my city every couple of days.
      </p>
      <p>
       No parent is going to forget about finding justice for their kids murder just because they don't want his drug use being public. For christ's sake he's dead. If anything it could be a potential clue to the public. Maybe he did a deal with someone right before getting shot. Your theory makes no sense in that regard.

       First, no, your sarcasm didn't track. I can't ever tell in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       And second, you're still not getting what I'm saying as my conspiracy theory. Dude was a young DC staffer out as late as you can be. In some groups that means you're not just out having beers, you're out late because something is helping you stay up late. Whatever, as long as he's not causing harm to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       So dude is flying a little high and - very stupidly - walking home at 4:00am. By himself. Bad call, dude. But here you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude hits the transition zone between good neighborhood and not-good neighborhood. That's when someone shows up with a gun. Standard issue robbery starts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude is flying too high, freaks out, turns to run. Gun guy thinks "fuck this guy." Gun guy shoots Dude in the back. Gun guy knows he won't get caught if he leaves now, but everyone know about Shot Spotter. Kids drop firecrackers for fun to summon police. Gun guy is a half mile away by the time the cops show up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cops show up and guess what, it's a shooting in a transition zone where hipsters get robbed a lot. At an hour when only drunks, people up to no good, and Uber drivers with severe gambling debt are out. Cops call it a robbery because it probably was to start with. DC cops have seen some shit and a lot of things that you, untrained person, don't think would sound right, sound right to them. Are they right 100% of the time? No. But they wouldn't have hesitated to call it something else if it wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       So parents of Dude get called. Dude was out late. Routine autopsy stuff says he was flying high, a little drunk, and ran like a girl. Suck. Suspects? Anyone living in NE DC. So...no suspects, huh? Why? Because this shit happens a lot. Until the gun gets re-used on another murder that connects someone to this case, Dude and parents are out of luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media asks Dude's parents to talk about it. A lot. Screw them - what's there to talk about? Talk about how our son was out late? What was in his system? Media has nothing to talk about except that he was drunk and high. Are they going to talk about the suspect? Are they going to talk about a lack of suspect? Well now you're edging close to accusing all the black people in DC of the crime. You want to do that? Of course not. Memory is super painful for parents, with literally nothing to gain from talking about it. So why talk about it? Don't talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       ....and now here we are filling in the gaps for fun.

       Physically tried to? No. But, if you do a quick google search, you'll find many many quotes from Democratic leaders calling for out right bans. For example, here's a quote from Diane Feinstein (who is also a gun owner herself):
      </p>
      <p>
       "If I could have banned them all - 'Mr. and Mrs. America turn in your guns' - I would have!"

       What I learned from this past election is that people can say whatever they want without actually have to follow through, and in some cases doing a complete 180.
       <br/>
       Republicans will never hold Trump accountable for the things he says, so I see no reason to impose the same standards on the other party.
       <br/>
       Regarding a gun ban specifically though I agree with Feinstein to a degree because I think their unchecked prevalence is a significant contributor to the homicide problem that America has. The homicide rate here is 8-9 times higher than the next most populous country, which happens to be mostly poor and the largest Muslim country in the world.

       Hillary Clinton invokes name of slain DNC aide Seth Rich in calling for gun control
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/true-crime/wp/2016/07/12/hillary-clinton-invokes-name-of-slain-dnc-aide-seth-rich-in-calling-for-gun-control/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, invoked Rich’s name to advocate for change of her own – pushing to limit the proliferation of guns. She listed mass killings and the shooting of Rich a block from his home in the Bloomingdale neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       “From Sandy Hook to Orlando to Dallas, and so many other places, these tragedies tear at our soul,” Clinton said in Portsmouth, N.H. “And so do the incidents that don’t even dominate the headlines. Just this past Sunday, a young man, Seth Rich, who worked for the Democratic National Committee to expand voting rights, was shot and killed in his neighborhood in Washington. He was just 27 years old.”

       Or, Russia hacked the servers, killed Seth and then used their shills (Right-wing media, T_D and now this sub) to force the idea that Hillary murdered him.

       And in the two weeks following Rich's death, there were two dozen mass shootings around the country. A party arguing for increased gun control would point to that constant string of gun violence as evidence of a need to hänge the laws.

       Yeah this is an extremely​ good claim. They love gun control and so does Hillary so if he was killed while on DNC she would have praised gun control.
