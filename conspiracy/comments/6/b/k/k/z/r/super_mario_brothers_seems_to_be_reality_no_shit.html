      <p>
       So yesterday I tried to make a post regarding Super Mario brothers :
      </p>
      <p>
       Start with this:
       <a href="https://twitter.com/KibBitzLaw/status/863951030052151296">
        https://twitter.com/KibBitzLaw/status/863951030052151296
       </a>
       This twitter user will explain bowser and the princess aka the Dracos.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will explain what fungus/mushrooms do for us and how they truly effect our lives.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j88BcgzzcTc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j88BcgzzcTc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This video explains what Morgelons are.  Morgelons are a fungus or yeast that floats around in the air infecting humans and kind of helping most of us stay in proper resonation with the universe. It attempts to help remove higher frequency metals from our body if it can ( at leas that is some of my understanding of them ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientifically speaking our primordial state is a fungus.  Everything had to of come from an algae/fungus if we reverse engineer everything properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have felt most of my life that mushrooms/fungus was a method of communication between us and 'the creator' / 'god'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many things have revealed themselves to me that have helped me back up my intuition of this.  I can explain later if people want to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to the main topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Super Mario Brothers the movie is a movie about "de-evolved" humans that are now dinosaurs that are trying to merge their mushroom dimension with our planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you watch the super mario brothers movie it makes a bit more sense. Too many colors and flashy things in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a link to the full movie;
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjsAk2y9ZQ">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjsAk2y9ZQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At 1:30:40  you will see the twin towers get vaporized and crumbled in a way from the dimension shift.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quote directly after that happens a guy says "Those guys will do anything for publicity".
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since I started reading into the countries past I have felt like hollywood was trying to tell us all some of the story in one way or another. Or they were just not creative enough to come up with something other than the reality they were living in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno. Why do you think they never came out with a second movie?
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire movie ends up turning into one phrase "Trust the fungus". If that phrase became more popular than our entire world as we know it could be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       My little sisters boyfriend was born in 1990 and had never heard of the movie at all. I am a HUGE fan of mycelium and psilocybin.  I want to eat them always...
      </p>
      <p>
       There is quite a bit more tie in's etc. but i need to go disassemble johnny 5 in my garage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Toodles!
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. I Love you all :)
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: went ahead and marked it as a spoiler for shits and giggles.

       If the fungus is truly apart of us and in all of us.. the fungus helped the story be told. Essentially, the fungus would be "god".

       I agree with some of what you said, about fungus assisting in communication to higher planes, it is a tool for sure. Like marijuana.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is God on a high enough level, and all living things have consciousness, but I don't believe we are 'of' the fungus in other ways.

       Morgellons help us from holding on to "heavy" metals. And I feel may actually be what everyone claims the pineal gland does.

       has some interesting information on morgellon's and 'black goo'. I've never heard anything positive about it, but there's always more to learn.

       The pineal gland is a chakra/energy conduit which receives higher dimensional sensory information. Literally a 'third eye'.

       ok i'm following... Could be a connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the soul level, evolution begins at simple plant life and evolves to more complex animal forms. 2nd 'density' to 3rd 'density'... this also happened to the physical form, but the paths of evolution were somewhat different. And physically was interrupted by non-terrestrial intervention/engineering... There could be some form of dna memory mapped into the physical or energy bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm seeing some people making some really cool intuitive connections lately. I do really dig your post.

       Is there any visual/pattern/growth similarities between fungus and our neural network? I've always imagined they grow /expand quite similarly? I'll look into it later, on mobile now.

       It grows very similarly to how I believe the neural network looks. Also very similar to how a trees roots and branches grow out and spread. Also similar to how lightning archs through the sky.

       They have used mycelium to clean oil spills out of a forest to save a village!
       <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-plan-to-mop-up-the-worlds-largest-oil-spill-with-fungus">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have wanted to pursue research and study into this but I have never had enough courage to push myself to do so. But I believe the entire planet at one point was /may even still be populated with mycelium. Mycelium has so many positive and helpful traits for everything it touches. If one tree in the forest gains a disease and that tree is a part of the neural network of the mycelium; the mycelium will send distress signals to all the surrounding plant life to have them boost their immune systems to fight against the current invader of the ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am positive that the world used to be covered in this. I am fairly positive that this was the primordial webbing that everything may have been woven from; well.. once we made it to land.  Algae is the fungus of the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to be a mycologist and study the spiritual/universal positives that can come from mycelia and its babies. But i also believe many of mans current creations would be out of purpose, or so they may feel, until they take mushrooms and truly understand that life is about love. not money.. or coming out on "top".. or impressing everyone but yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may have been too drunk to type this out.. apologies if so. &lt;3

       I always thought the mushrooms were too true to be a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're also red with white dots which is the Amanita muscaria mushroom... the msot prevalent is spiritual history. Check out this video on Santa/Christmas for a real trip....

       Does that seem a little cannibalistic to you?

       I'd have to disagree. It is where we got Daisy in the story line, and they also did the best they could with not being a video game.

       It was a pretty bad movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       My disappointment was tangible when I saw how bizarrely they styled the universe and that John Leguizamo was a part of it.  It felt like some stupid movie exec, who was completely detached from society, hired some equally stupid people to write and make the film and the end result was a pile of overproduced Hollywood garbage that not a single person who was involved in making it had ever even played Mario Bros.  You had to really struggle to feel that it was a Mario Bros. entity, as it was so far removed from anything else in the franchise.
