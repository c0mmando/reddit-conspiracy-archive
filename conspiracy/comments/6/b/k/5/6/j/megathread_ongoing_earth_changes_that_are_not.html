       Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
       I have removed the bible quote, for the meek were having trouble coming to terms with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who mock the use of a quote from one of the most read pieces of discourse in history, regardless of how you view it, is not thinking clearly.

       What does this mean? Is this the sign of a shift in global consciousness, or the low thrum of Nibiru exciting our planet. Are we finally waking up. My heart tells me so, but my mind remains skeptical of everything that is going on.. and so should yours.

       - Does anybody know what possible location those attacks that north of Antarctica are coming from? Is there a base down there? Is this a forward outpost of some breakaway civilization that's setup down in Antarctica.. pulling strings. Could be a base I am unwares of but there seems to be fuck all on a map in that location.
      </p>
      <p>
       The map of the UN is..interesting -

      <p>
       It is an equidistant azimuthal projection. Which is a highly accurate map and one that I believe an accurate geometrical map.  One of Mercators early maps supposedly copied from older geometric maps is beautiful and extremely accurate.. -

       Watch this if you haven't,
 rare Richard E Byrd footage discussing Antarctica -

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdkhc1gdPr4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I value interviews with people who have "lived it," and take heed to what, and how they say things. I believe Mr.Byrd is being sincere in his talk of "land beyond the South Pole, larger than North America." This is one of the ultimate truths, what lies beyond the South Pole.. what land is he referencing here? What is "beyond" the South Pole. If you look at the Mercator Map above, I think it make it makes a compelling case for a hollow or inner earth setup. What do the numbers mean that trail off in a specific sequence? Calling on any math related folk.. I think its sacred geometry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch THIS if you have never seen it. Not Antarctica related but geometry related..

       This surmises to me.. and i'm sure you too that we know VERY LITTLE publically in regards to sacred geometry, what it means and how interpretations of it could completely alter our "reality."
      </p>
      <p>
       What we believe to be true..

       Why did they have Cryptographic Aides?..
      </p>
      <p>
       "The interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, and read in part as follows:
 ‘“Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The Admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking – recalled the Admiral – is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety.”

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The year is 1947. What planes that are hostile.. would be from polar regions? How could they fly over "one, or both poles."
      </p>
      <p>
       So.. how far is pole to pole in our current Earth Model? 12,430 miles. Max range of any WWII-era plane that we know of would barely be over 1,000 miles. What cohesive force in 1947 had access to both poles? with hostile planes that sent a massive operation PACKING..

EARTH HAPPENINGS -
      </p>
      <p>
       I have taken out a vast chunk and I refer you to older threads, or simply going to watchers.news or any other site that documents earth happenings. The pace is quickening folks and I don't know how to put it any other way than by relaying information. For people who say that "this  has happened to the earth thousands of times,"
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. No shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       What i'm trying to say is that it is HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. 1.2 MILLION people have been displaced in Peru.

       First.. read this -

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;
      </p>
      <p>
       "But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It was a surprise to us," said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO."
      </p>
      <p>
       Was "Gotham Shield," related to Space Weather? hmm..

      </p>
      <p>
       Was the United States of America the victim of a coup many moons again that installed a pseudo government in power via Washington? There are 2 United States, one formed in 1787, the collection of the several sovereign states of the union, and another separate and different one formed in 1871, which only controls the District of Columbia and it’s territories.

      <p>
       People have challenged why this is relevant. If the Economy was to sink due to The Federal Reserve, which is attached to U.S. Inc.. the debt could be eradicated and D.C. could be broken up based on the original U.S.A legislation. Notice Trump tweets #U.S.A. often. Though.. the narrative is becoming muddled and it's difficult to see if he's compromised.. or something is about to happen.

       Schumann Resonance -
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the Schumann Resonance? Why is it increasing?
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       "On January 31, 2017, for the first time in recorded history, the Schumann resonance reached frequencies of 36+ Hz. It was considered an anomaly when in 2014 this frequency rose from its usual 7.83 Hz to somewhere in the 15-25 Hz levels—so a jump from 7.83 Hz to 36+ Hz is a big deal. That’s more than a five-fold increase in resonant frequency levels. What does this mean to us as inhabitants of Mother Earth? According to neuroscience, frequency recordings of 36+ Hz in the human brain are more associated with a stressed nervous system than a relaxed and healthy one."

       IT WAS 112HZ THIS WEEK!!

       We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. The Earth Wobbling is natural my only correlation in this is that where the graph gets more extreme is where I feel the world has started to respond at a similar pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this happening? I don't know. So many different things at once, so many theories and facts to digest and dispute.. so much fake information, shit sources!

       I feels at one point you use the UN maps for the flat earth stuff (I could be wrong, I'm at work and skimmed it) and later you claim the pole shift and axis wobble.

       I'm entertaining the thought of everything. I don't know what shape the Earth is, there is data everywhere such as the magnetic pole wandering etc. I entertain the thought of a hollow earth, which could still take place on a shaped earth, not essentially a globe. I don't believe the Earth is flat.. just that every piece of information we have been told about it may not necessarily be true.

       Have you been tracking animal activity at all.  That might be worth looking at.  I've noticed some unusual stuff in that area recently (giant squid washing up where they wouldn't normally etc).

       Then why don't you post details about what a G1 or G2 are.  You deliberately leave it out so as to make those who don't know worry.

       A lot of the items you post have been going on for millions of years and you make them seam like they are new.  You honestly are hyping up sand from Africa being detected in the air, which isn't exactly new.
