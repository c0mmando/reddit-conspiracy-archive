I&#39;m guilty of allowing my own confirmation bias to sometimes creep in and affect how I view things, and I think we all are to some extent because it&#39;s human nature but this sub is one of the few places where real, informative debates happen and where productive civil discourse can be seen almost daily. Don&#39;t allow the partisan politics to take over the discussions, and don&#39;t feed into the negativity by responding to shills/shitposters exactly how they want/expect you to with more negativity. </p>

<p>I want to talk about the Russia-Trump connections, but I want to do so in an effective manner and not by pointing fingers at people who disagree with me while giving no substantive base for my arguments, like what I&#39;m seeing in the comments now. We can&#39;t allow this sub to be divided like every other sub and media platform because it&#39;s one of the few places where all sides are considered, questioned and debated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I too would like to discuss Seth Rich, yet it seems as though liberals dismiss it immediately while Trump supporters refuse to acknowledge Russian ties should be talked about. I&#39;m glad you said that, sometimes I feel like I&#39;m taking crazy pills when the front page of conspiracy is identical to the front page of the donald. </p>
