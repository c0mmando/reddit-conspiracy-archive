       The bigger our population the more of an ecological impact we have on the environment. Obviously we can feed everyone, so we have not surpassed our ecological capacity ie overpopulation. However it's hard to deny that we aren't irreversibly fucking up the environment.

Uh, okay, here's a bunch, conducted in different countries by different organizations with different methodologies.

         : "At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR ['cortisol awakening response', a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P &lt; 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P &lt; 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples."

         studied 55 trans teens from the onset of treatment in their early teenage years through a follow-up an average of 7 years later. They found no negative outcomes, no regrets, and in fact their group was slightly mentally healthier than non-trans controls.

         studies FTM transitioners: "Results of the study indicate that female-to-male transsexuals who receive testosterone have lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, and higher levels of social support and health related quality of life. Testosterone use was not related to problems with drugs, alcohol, or suicidality. Overall findings provide clear evidence that HRT is associated with improved mental health outcomes in female-to-male transsexuals."

         surveyed post-op trans folk: "Participants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy with their SRS results and that SRS had greatly improved the quality of their lives. None reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional regret." The regrets that
         <em>
          were

         present were primarily due to poor results, not due to having been "wrong" about wanting surgery.

          A broad UK survey
         </a>
         that provides some corroboration of the above results. In particular, we have: (Page 15): "Stage of transition had a substantial impact upon life satisfaction within the sample. 70% of the participants stated that they were more satisfied with their lives since transition, compared to 2% who were less satisfied (N=671)" (Page 50): " Most participants who had transitioned felt that their mental health was better after doing so (74%), compared to only 5% who felt it was worse (N=353)." (Page 55): "For participants who had transitioned, this had led to changes in their self-harming. 63% felt that they harmed themselves more before they transitioned, with only 3% harming themselves more after transition (N=206)." (Page 59): "Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition. 7% found that this increased during transition, which has implications for the support provided to those undergoing these processes (N=316)."

          Canadian survey
         </a>
         finds recent suicide attempts heavily based on family acceptance: only 3% of those with 'very supportive' parents had attempted suicide in the last year, compared to more than half (!) of those without. Note that this one is all trans-identified youth, not post-transition, so it doesn't directly speak to transition's effectiveness.

       So you're saying that once their bodies looked the way their minds thought that should, that were happier, basically... How is this different from period with body dysmorphia disorder? When you think about it, it's something going wrong in the person's brain that tells them their body is not what it should be. We all have these kinds of feelings, to an extent, want to have a fitter body or whatnot, but is the extreme nature of these feelings that makes these things fit into a mental disorder.

       Because that

       </em>
       true for body dysmorphic disorder. If someone with BDD is, say, fixated on a mole that they believe makes them hideously ugly, and you amputate the mole, they just re-fixate on something else.

       You've got a correlation/causation issue there brosefarian.  I'm not sure it's clear that gender reassignment surgery itself is the leading contributor to that higher suicide rate.  It is possible those people could have been suicidal independent of surgery, even if their suicidal tendencies were caused by or related to personal gender/sex issues.

       That's the issue. They were already suicidal because they weren't happy with themselves. Then they do reassignment, and they're still not happy with themselves. Hence, in their minds, they've exhausted all other options to be happy. So boom boom.

       Face it. If you're a girl and think you're a man trapped inside of a girl's body, you have a mental disorder. Physically removing body parts, and acting like a man does not make you a man.

       That is an oversimplified explanation. It's not people sitting down and going "okay, let's talk about linguistics for half an hour", it's "hey, this is a quick way of communicating how trans people feel so you can sorta get it".

       The claim "I am a man", as used by a trans person, does not include the claim "I have X body part". Nothing we're claiming is contrary to material fact.

       Ah yes, so when a guy who's opposed every single LGBT-rights-related advance for decades gets rid of it, it's a reasoned and neutral scientific principle. But when they bring it back because of overwhelming scientific evidence and the consensus of every major medical organization on the planet, that's 'radical SJWs and the mentally ill overpowering facts, science, biology, and psychology'.

        Ah yes, so when a guy who's opposed every single LGBT-rights-related advance for decades gets rid of it, it's a reasoned and neutral scientific principle. But when they bring it back because of overwhelming scientific evidence and the consensus of every major medical organization on the planet, that's 'radical SJWs and the mentally ill overpowering facts, science, biology, and psychology'.

       While I do believe that some people really do have a psychological/physiological predisposition to want to be the opposite sex. I can't help but feel that it is being pushed upon people and almost encouraged nowadays. I think most people who are truly transgender want to identify as the opposite sex and not some grey area in between with made up pronouns.

       In nearly half a decade in the trans community, I think I've met exactly one person - ever - who used any pronoun but "he", "she", or "they". Like yes, somewhere in the world, there is probably someone snowflaking for attention. But for every person doing that, there are dozens of
       <em>

       It's hard to deny that transgenderism is being pushed upon us when 10 years ago the term transgender was barely ever used, and now I hear it almost daily. Relevant:

       It's not that I dislike transgender individuals, however I think people are highjacking the cause as a cry for attention. There are people who want to identify as the opposite sex, and their are people who want the special treatment that comes along with being a "transgender".

       I mean, aside from the fact that
       <em>

       , sure, they'll "face no barriers".
      </p>
      <p>
       The earliest medical treatment currently applied is puberty-delaying medication, usually around 10-12. They're reversible and taken for a few years before starting proper HRT. But even
       <em>
        those
       </em>
       require (a) a kid to articulate what's wrong, (b) parents willing to accept it, (c) extensive psychological evaluation, and (d) a doctor willing to deal with a fairly new brand of medicine. That's not "no barriers" at all, that's "you only hear about the very few who do end up transitioning that early".

        It's not that I dislike transgender individuals, however I think people are highjacking the cause as a cry for attention. There are people who want to identify as the opposite sex, and there are people who want special treatment.

       And the overwhelming majority of people claiming to be trans are the former. It's as simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But perhaps more to the point, how does this in any way fit into the theory you advanced in the OP. Is it a global population-control conspiracy, or is it a bunch of people looking for attention?

       Emotion and intuition are completely different mental faculties.

      <p>
       Social trends are hugely influenced by the media.

      <p>
       With one google I found an article of a four year old getting a sex change.
       <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/09/child-4-worlds-youngest-ever-sex-change-patient/">

      <p>
       My point here was that there should be a legal barrier to undergo a sex change. The reason that we have a drinking age is because drinking at a young age has adverse effects. Getting a gender reassignment surgery has adverse effects too. Not to mention although it is a medical procedure it's not something that you need to live healthily, a transgender person can be perfectly healthy without an operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hard to make that argument without a citation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, the narrative being pushed by MSM is acceptance of what is mainly a mental disorder. An unfortunate side effect is that some people see this as a way to get attention. I don't have a problem with transgender individuals as I have stated numerous times, what I have a problem with is how it is increasing much faster proportionately to our population growth which makes me question the legitimacy of the movement.

       Ten years ago, I wouldn't have transitioned, because it would have been a complete death sentence for my professional life. You see more people transitioning because it's possible to do so without wrecking the remainder of your life, and because they're exposed to the fact that it's a thing you even
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       do. I stumbled onto it almost by accident.

       In a diagnostic sense? There isn't one - but there's also not any objective diagnostic test for whether or not someone's in pain, either, and as a general rule if someone says "fuck, shit, ow, that hurts!" we don't go "prove it".

       On a philosophical level, maybe, and if you want to get into the philosophical backing I'm willing to do that. But medicine is about what works as of our best current knowledge, not what might or might not work in the distant future.

      <p>
       For example, I had a perfectly standard surgery last year to remove a dysfunctional organ (nothing related to being trans). It's the most common surgery performed in the US, and no one really objects to it being the gold standard for treating the condition I had just because maybe at some point in the future we might be able to fix that organ instead of removing it.

       Supposing this is true, you're comparing apples and oranges.  Pain is a fundamental sensation (sense of touch), whereas gender identity is a matter of perception.  There's no question as to whether you see, feel, hear, smell, or taste something; it's either something you're currently experiencing or not.  There is question as to whether what you're experiencing is one thing or another (i.e. perception is questionable).

       Yes, but when what works best produces poor results, it calls into question the efficacy of the treatment and the entire theory that it rests on (transitioning and transgenderism respectively).
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally question any treatment that instead of encouraging someone to embrace who they are, it tells them to try to change something that's unchangeable and expect everyone to go along with it.  No matter how many hormone injections, surgeries, or lifestyle changes someone makes, a trans woman will never be a woman beyond a nominal respect; they'll still have Y chromosomes and will never be capable of child birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I suspect is part of the reason why the process is unsuccessful; it's because people know that only superficially are they changing themselves, and they aren't actually becoming the opposite gender.

       I'm not sure how you justify the distinction. The distress I felt at a low level my whole life, and the absolute bliss I felt when I finally figured out what'd been bothering me all those years, is (at least to me) on the same level of sensation as discomfort, embarrassment, or anger.

       Satisfaction rates in the high 90s, a 75% drop in depression (also known as 'better than a lot of straight up antidepressants'), extremely rare regrets, and physiological stress markers normalizing is "poor results"? Just because you can't get a group that has been massively targeted for a trait they can't escape down to 100% as healthy as the general public doesn't mean you got 'poor' results, it just means you didn't get perfect ones.

       "For people who feel a certain way"... I'm just wondering... If I felt that I was born a tiger and needed to somehow get surgery to make myself look more like a tiger, tail, tattoos of stripes all over my body, etc., would that be seen as a mental disorder, or just what makes me feel good?

       We have a reasonably good developmental model for how a human brain develops as masculine or feminine, and even a reasonably good set of theories for how this development might not end up matching that human's sex chromosomes or development of external sex-linked characteristics.

      <p>
       What's your theory for how a human brain could develop as a tiger?

       It's all in their heads, like the people who think that deep down they are supposed to be a cat or whatever, it doesnt matter if it's every going to happen or not, its the same premise, they want to be something that they shouldn't be. A male brain born into a female body? Do you really think it's so separate that they can get switched up like that? Could you show me the theories that you speak of? I get that you don't see how someone could think they would actually turn into a tiger because we are humans, but isn't it just as weird for a man to think he's really a woman deep down? If the body is fine, then it's a disorder of the brain that makes them think these things, both are abnormal and are caused by something going wrong in the developing fetus.

      </p>
      <p>
       If a person develops a brain that's more comfortable exposed to estrogen and in a body that has feminine physical characteristics, why is it your business if they expose themselves to estrogen and develop feminine physical characteristics?

       There are, in my mind, three distinctions that sort of headline it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One is that it's both plausible and to some extent demonstrated that gender identity is the result of the physical differentiation of particular parts of the brain. There is no reasonable mechanism for "species identity" to occur in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two, trans people are generally not trying to carve an entirely new niche in society, simply asking to be treated as you already do treat millions of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       And three, and probably most importantly, there's a difference between "feels good right now" and "supports long-term emotional well-being". It is, at this point, well-demonstrated that gender transition is the latter, not just the former (in fact in the short term transition can be extraordinarily stressful). Comparable evidence does not exist for your hypothetical tiger-man.

       I think there's definitely an agenda with this movement. I think part of it, is that the people suffering with this mental disorder (as it is still a mental disorder in the DSMV, currently) are being given this by our environment, our bodies endocrine systems are being messed with to the point that we don't know whether or not we're a boy or girl and which gender we should mate with. This whole thing about the LGTBQ community is that it has always been in humanity, just not to this extent. The fact that we are being told and demanded to accept these people and their lifestyles is what has me questioning the whole thing. I think that TPTB are trying in every way to destabilize the American family and our values. I mean, look at a handful of families and check out how little time they spend together, for one. I feel that by continuing to change what a family looks like will in the end, be our downfall. I just don't see how we can be a strong country if we are so pulled apart by TPTB trying to get us to fight and accept everyone, it just doesnt work, un-organicly. We're being pushed into these things, and that just will make people push back, and end in in-fighting. Eh, that's some of my muddled thoughts, thanks for bringing the topic up!

       You are going in circles because you really don't have a valid point. There is distress before the transition, that is the mental disorder, not after they have the transition, duh. We're not trying to hate on trans people, ok, we're just trying to say that it's not a normal thing to feel that you are in the wrong gender's body, it's a mental disorder which makes the person feel negatively. I think its something that should be dealt with in a different manner, rather than completely mutilate their genitals and get crazy hormones and get plastic surgery, that's frickin nuts to a normal person, completely crazy, which it is, it's the person's brain not acting normally, we shouldn't go along with someone who is experiencing this disorder and let them carve themselves a new physical identity when they know they will never actually be a woman or a man. I've been very interested in this topic for a big portion of my life, and have been mostly supportive of the changes trans people wish to make, but recently I've had to re-evaluate what is really going on in our society, why it seems so much more prevalent and why our govt is making the rest of us HAVE to be ok with their choices, that's what has me scratching my head. Why are we allowing/supporting people who are suffering with this mental disorder to take drastic measures such as to mangle their bodies?

       No one is making you 'have to be okay' with anything. Judging by your posting history, you seem to live in the US, where it is currently legal in exactly 100% of jurisdictions not just to think what you want of trans people, but also to stand up and say as much. In fact, a party that explicitly opposes trans rights in all forms is currently in unified control of the US government. So...yeah.

       I bet I could find research that says to the contrary, because it's so varied among individuals, which I'll check into, but you are also very biased, being a trans person, so you are very defensive of people who talk about this subject, I get it. But try to take a view from the outside and see how it might seem, at least, yes in America, where it does seem like the govt and Hollywood and advertising are trying to swing us to view the trans person's condition as normal and a large part of humanity, which it isn't, but it is growing. I personally feel that we are being given hormone interfering chemicals through food, air, medications, etc. that might be producing this effect more than previously. I really want to research this, as I said it interests me to figure out what's going on in the brain.

       Having a stake is not the same thing as presenting a biased case. I do have a stake, to be sure, but the facts I present are accurate as best I understand them. I didn't transition until I was confident of that case, so if anything my transition is just putting my lifestyle choices where my mouth is.

       "Given" implies intent, which it doesn't seem like you have anything to really support. But "exposed to incidentally", sure - there's actually a fair amount of research on this, and it is plausible that it's involved to some extent. But I suspect that most of the rise is from increasing acceptance, given that it so sharply correlates with where people are or are not accepted for being trans.

       No, you think because you're a trans person, you know everything about it, and so you're just going to sit on your pedestal and tell everyone they're wrong for their beliefs and feelings. The fact is, that ya'll got some fucked up shit going on in your heads telling you to slice your penis open and flare it out to be a fucking vagina, that's fucking crazy, period!!!

       Did I don't have the time to go find fucking articles proving my points or else I would. You don't provide any either, just your word, so why don't you enlighten me, eh? Show me ALL your data so I may educate my ignorant mind. I have a masters in MFT, background in psych, so lets hear it! I also have my own personal beliefs and opinions that may not gel with current research, and as research is fluid and always evolving, whose to say. I don't know man, I'm not mad at ya'll, I think if you ask any person who has this affliction, if they'd rather be without it, I think they'd say yes. So with that said, I think we're being given this disorder, and doesn't that make you mad? I feel the same about other mental disorders as well as physical illnesses such as Autism spectrum, ADHD, and other hormone disrupting disorders. I have my opinions on why and stuff, it's rabbit hole stuff, so I'll just try to do more research on the whole thing, never said I was done learning.

       Ran across this Bill Nye video which says a lot for how the re-programming is going here in America...Make a childhood science-trusted guy come back and try to drop some "new" knowledge on us to spread to everyone else, younger and older. I have no words for what I see in this video, I cannot believe that I'm supposed to show this to kids! How very un-scientific of him to present info this way! I have absolutely zero respect for this guy anymore, for more than just this though.

       The thing is, being really stupid, trashy, or over the top doesn't make you wrong. I can think that social liberals sometimes take stupid paths to promoting a viewpoint without thinking the viewpoint itself is incorrect, because my opinion of a statement isn't based on whether or not I like the people saying it.

       I feel ya, but the fact is that it's out there being done, ya know? Do you get where I'm coming from, like really? I'm not hating on the community or the individuals, I'm upset with the system I believe is sabotaging our bodies and minds, through various methods, not just sexuality based. Think of how many people are getting depressed/anxious and have to take meds that are creating side effects that are damaging our minds and bodies. Think of the GMOs and Round Up that's being sprayed on our foods and injected at the cellular level , that is most definitely having an impact on our minds and bodies, as well as other animals such as bees, amphibians, and other small fauna. I think this kind of in-fighing is what tptb want, they don't want us to come together DESPITE our differences, they want us to hate each other for them, not realizing they are the ones creating the fights. It's deep, for me, it goes deep, so I'll keep trying to find truths and keep the dialogue open, you do the same ;)

       It's going from a few fractions of a percent of the population to a slightly larger fraction of a percent of the population. The change in birth rates caused by this is insignificant compared to the change caused by economic conditions.

       I agree, but until the trend reaches 10 percent of population, it won't really affect population numbers.

       Reminds me of a conversation between doc and jingleballicks in sweet Thursday by john Steinbeck. One of them brings up homosexuality as a possible evolutionary method to pop control and the other brings up lemmings. I don't know myself it's interesting tho

       We have a reasonably good developmental model for how a human brain develops as masculine or feminine, and even a reasonably good set of theories for how this development might not end up matching that human's sex chromosomes or development of external sex-linked characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's your theory for how a human brain could develop as a tiger?

       There are, in my mind, three distinctions that sort of headline it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One is that it's both plausible and to some extent demonstrated that gender identity is the result of the physical differentiation of particular parts of the brain. There is no reasonable mechanism for "species identity" to occur in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two, trans people are generally not trying to carve an entirely new niche in society, simply asking to be treated as you already do treat millions of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       And three, and probably most importantly, there's a difference between "feels good right now" and "supports long-term emotional well-being". It is, at this point, well-demonstrated that gender transition is the latter, not just the former (in fact in the short term transition can be extraordinarily stressful). Comparable evidence does not exist for your hypothetical tiger-man.
