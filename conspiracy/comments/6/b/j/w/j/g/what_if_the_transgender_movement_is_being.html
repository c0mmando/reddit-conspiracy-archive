<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract">Colizzi et al., 2013</a>: &quot;At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR [&#39;cortisol awakening response&#39;, a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P &lt; 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P &lt; 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168">Gomez-Gil et al., 2012</a>: &quot;SADS, HAD-A, and HAD-Depression (HAD-D) mean scores [these are tests of depression and anxiety] were significantly higher among patients who had not begun cross-sex hormonal treatment compared with patients in hormonal treatment (F=4.362, p=.038; F=14.589, p=.001; F=9.523, p=.002 respectively). Similarly, current symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in a significantly higher percentage of untreated patients than in treated patients (61% vs. 33% and 31% vs. 8% respectively).&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract">de Vries, et al., 2014</a> studied 55 trans teens from the onset of treatment in their early teenage years through a follow-up an average of 7 years later. They found no negative outcomes, no regrets, and in fact their group was slightly mentally healthier than non-trans controls.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19359705.2011.581195#.Vb1Tkvmsj0E">Meier, et al. 2011</a> studies FTM transitioners: &quot;Results of the study indicate that female-to-male transsexuals who receive testosterone have lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, and higher levels of social support and health related quality of life. Testosterone use was not related to problems with drugs, alcohol, or suicidality. Overall findings provide clear evidence that HRT is associated with improved mental health outcomes in female-to-male transsexuals.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364">Lawrence, 2003</a> surveyed post-op trans folk: &quot;Participants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy with their SRS results and that SRS had greatly improved the quality of their lives. None reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional regret.&quot; The regrets that <em>were</em> present were primarily due to poor results, not due to having been &quot;wrong&quot; about wanting surgery.</p></li>

<p>Non-journal studies - less rigorous but often get some good sample sizes to corroborate:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf">A broad UK survey</a> that provides some corroboration of the above results. In particular, we have: (Page 15): &quot;Stage of transition had a substantial impact upon life satisfaction within the sample. 70% of the participants stated that they were more satisfied with their lives since transition, compared to 2% who were less satisfied (N=671)&quot; (Page 50): &quot; Most participants who had transitioned felt that their mental health was better after doing so (74%), compared to only 5% who felt it was worse (N=353).&quot; (Page 55): &quot;For participants who had transitioned, this had led to changes in their self-harming. 63% felt that they harmed themselves more before they transitioned, with only 3% harming themselves more after transition (N=206).&quot; (Page 59): &quot;Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition. 7% found that this increased during transition, which has implications for the support provided to those undergoing these processes (N=316).&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://transpulseproject.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Impacts-of-Strong-Parental-Support-for-Trans-Youth-vFINAL.pdf">Canadian survey</a> finds recent suicide attempts heavily based on family acceptance: only 3% of those with &#39;very supportive&#39; parents had attempted suicide in the last year, compared to more than half (!) of those without. Note that this one is all trans-identified youth, not post-transition, so it doesn&#39;t directly speak to transition&#39;s effectiveness.</p></li>

<p>Because that <em>isn&#39;t</em> true for body dysmorphic disorder. If someone with BDD is, say, fixated on a mole that they believe makes them hideously ugly, and you amputate the mole, they just re-fixate on something else. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/">See this paper</a> for details.</p>

<p>Perhaps more to the point, you&#39;re deflecting from your original claim that transition doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;re a girl and think you&#39;re a man trapped inside of a girl&#39;s body, you have a mental disorder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is an oversimplified explanation. It&#39;s not people sitting down and going &quot;okay, let&#39;s talk about linguistics for half an hour&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;hey, this is a quick way of communicating how trans people feel so you can sorta get it&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Physically removing body parts, and acting like a man does not make you a man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we&#39;re generally not claiming that it does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know it&#39;s hard to accept, and I know you&#39;ve admitted you suffer from this, but facts are facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The claim &quot;I am a man&quot;, as used by a trans person, does not include the claim &quot;I have X body part&quot;. Nothing we&#39;re claiming is contrary to material fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re a girl acting like a man. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moreso that I was for the first, oh, about 22 years of my life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be no different than allowing a schizophrenic to cut himself up because the demon he sees says it&#39;s the right thing to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it <em>is</em> different from that, for several reasons - most notably, because it produces the best medical and psychiatric outcomes for the person involved.</p>

<p>And aside from not liking one of those groups, do you have any actual data to back that up?</p>

<p>&quot;A social trend exists&quot; does not equal &quot;a social trend only exists because it&#39;s pushed upon us by the Illuminati&quot;. Like, look at the search trend for, say, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=sriracha&amp;amp;hl=en-US&amp;amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5&amp;amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5">&quot;sriracha&quot;</a>, which looks almost identical.

<p>Like, yes, people talk about and search for issues that are in the public eye. That&#39;s not evidence of a conspiracy, that&#39;s evidence of people reading about shit they&#39;re interested in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By encouraged I mean that if a 7 year old who hasn&#39;t even gone through puberty wants to become the opposite sex they will face very few barriers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, aside from the fact that <em>literally no one, anywhere, gives medical transition to a seven year old</em>, sure, they&#39;ll &quot;face no barriers&quot;.</p>

<p>The earliest medical treatment currently applied is puberty-delaying medication, usually around 10-12. They&#39;re reversible and taken for a few years before starting proper HRT. But even <em>those</em> require (a) a kid to articulate what&#39;s wrong, (b) parents willing to accept it, (c) extensive psychological evaluation, and (d) a doctor willing to deal with a fairly new brand of medicine. That&#39;s not &quot;no barriers&quot; at all, that&#39;s &quot;you only hear about the very few who do end up transitioning that early&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile I have to wait until I am 21 just to drink alcohol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because recreational substance use is <em>totally equivalent</em> to effective medical care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not that I dislike transgender individuals, however I think people are highjacking the cause as a cry for attention. There are people who want to identify as the opposite sex, and there are people who want special treatment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the overwhelming majority of people claiming to be trans are the former. It&#39;s as simple as that.</p>

<p>But perhaps more to the point, how does this in any way fit into the theory you advanced in the OP. Is it a global population-control conspiracy, or is it a bunch of people looking for attention?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Emotion and intuition are completely different mental faculties.</p>

<p>Social trends are hugely influenced by the media.</p>

<p>With one google I found an article of a four year old getting a sex change. <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/09/child-4-worlds-youngest-ever-sex-change-patient/">http://www.wnd.com/2016/09/child-4-worlds-youngest-ever-sex-change-patient/</a></p>

<p>My point here was that there should be a legal barrier to undergo a sex change. The reason that we have a drinking age is because drinking at a young age has adverse effects. Getting a gender reassignment surgery has adverse effects too. Not to mention although it is a medical procedure it&#39;s not something that you need to live healthily, a transgender person can be perfectly healthy without an operation.</p>

<p>Hard to make that argument without a citation.</p>

<p>Lastly, the narrative being pushed by MSM is acceptance of what is mainly a mental disorder. An unfortunate side effect is that some people see this as a way to get attention. I don&#39;t have a problem with transgender individuals as I have stated numerous times, what I have a problem with is how it is increasing much faster proportionately to our population growth which makes me question the legitimacy of the movement.</p>

<p>With one google I found an article of a four year old getting a sex change. <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/09/child-4-worlds-youngest-ever-sex-change-patient/">http://www.wnd.com/2016/09/child-4-worlds-youngest-ever-sex-change-patient/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re not getting medical treatment, just changing how they dress and what name they go by.</p>

<p>Also, <em>wow</em>, that article. </p>

<p>It&#39;s...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On a website advertising two books within the text of the article entitled &quot;Outlasting the Gay Revolution&quot; and  “Be Thou Prepared: Equipping the Church for Persecution and Times of Trouble”...</p></li>
<li><p>...cites an article in <em>The New Atlantis</em> (which is published by a conservative advocacy group)...</p></li>
<li><p>...written by Paul McHugh (who is citing a study to claim a conclusion that it explicitly notes cannot be drawn within the text of the study itself, and who is the sort of guy to see pedophilia in the church as <a href="http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/adopting_chaos/">&quot;homosexual predation&quot;</a> and not, y&#39;know, an issue with the church)...</p></li>
<li><p>...who is a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics">American College of Pediatricians</a>, which is a fringe conservative group not associated not associated with the American College of <em>Pediatrics</em>, which is the actual major medical organization. </p></li>
<li><p>...which the article does not note, since they actually mix them up themselves and claim that the American College of Pediatrics (the real one) said what the American College of Pediatricians (the fringe group using an intentionally confusing name) <a href="https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/gender-dysphoria-in-children">said instead</a> (they cite it correctly later in the article).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So basically, their grand &quot;checkmate, atheists&quot; article is citing two guys, both of whom have a long-time axe to grind with the LGBT community, published in a &quot;journal&quot; that exists specifically to advocate social conservatism. Do...you guys know what bias is, exactly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My point here was that there should be a legal barrier to undergo a sex change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh...there is. Surgery generally requires evaluations by multiple mental health professionals and at least a year of living full-time as one&#39;s identified gender. That&#39;s a pretty significant barrier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention although it is a medical procedure it&#39;s not something that you need to live healthily, a transgender person can be perfectly healthy without an operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the sense that their heart will keep beating or the like, sure. But that&#39;s like saying we shouldn&#39;t treat, say, someone in agonizing chronic pain because they <em>could</em>, in principle, live without it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with transgender individuals as I have stated numerous times, what I have a problem with is how it is increasing much faster proportionately to our population growth which makes me question the legitimacy of the movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ten years ago, I wouldn&#39;t have transitioned, because it would have been a complete death sentence for my professional life. You see more people transitioning because it&#39;s possible to do so without wrecking the remainder of your life, and because they&#39;re exposed to the fact that it&#39;s a thing you even <em>can</em> do. I stumbled onto it almost by accident.</p>

<p>It is one part of transition, but not all of it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In a diagnostic sense? There isn&#39;t one - but there&#39;s also not any objective diagnostic test for whether or not someone&#39;s in pain, either, and as a general rule if someone says &quot;fuck, shit, ow, that hurts!&quot; we don&#39;t go &quot;prove it&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the basis we have, and it produces good results. If we find a better one in the future, great, but it&#39;s what we have right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a philosophical level, maybe, and if you want to get into the philosophical backing I&#39;m willing to do that. But medicine is about what works as of our best current knowledge, not what might or might not work in the distant future.</p>

<p>For example, I had a perfectly standard surgery last year to remove a dysfunctional organ (nothing related to being trans). It&#39;s the most common surgery performed in the US, and no one really objects to it being the gold standard for treating the condition I had just because maybe at some point in the future we might be able to fix that organ instead of removing it.</p>

<p>Supposing this is true, you&#39;re comparing apples and oranges.  Pain is a fundamental sensation (sense of touch), whereas gender identity is a matter of perception.  There&#39;s no question as to whether you see, feel, hear, smell, or taste something; it&#39;s either something you&#39;re currently experiencing or not.  There is question as to whether what you&#39;re experiencing is one thing or another (i.e. perception is questionable).  </p>

<p>Okay, then until we can go off more than just feelings, I will remain skeptical.  It&#39;s a shaky basis, and the quality of the results is dubious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>medicine is about what works as of our best current knowledge, not what might or might not work in the distant future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but when what works best produces poor results, it calls into question the efficacy of the treatment and the entire theory that it rests on (transitioning and transgenderism respectively).  </p>

<p>I personally question any treatment that instead of encouraging someone to embrace who they are, it tells them to try to change something that&#39;s unchangeable and expect everyone to go along with it.  No matter how many hormone injections, surgeries, or lifestyle changes someone makes, a trans woman will never be a woman beyond a nominal respect; they&#39;ll still have Y chromosomes and will never be capable of child birth.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I suspect is part of the reason why the process is unsuccessful; it&#39;s because people know that only superficially are they changing themselves, and they aren&#39;t actually becoming the opposite gender.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you justify the distinction. The distress I felt at a low level my whole life, and the absolute bliss I felt when I finally figured out what&#39;d been bothering me all those years, is (at least to me) on the same level of sensation as discomfort, embarrassment, or anger.</p>

<p>I might, on a philosophical level, be wrong about <em>why</em> I feel what I do (though obviously I don&#39;t think that I am). I don&#39;t think I can be wrong about the sensations I experience in and of themselves, and even if I could be, I think you&#39;d need extreme evidence to claim that I am.</p>

<p>The quality of the results is not at <em>all</em> dubious.</p>

<p>Yes, but when what works best produces poor results</p>

<p>Satisfaction rates in the high 90s, a 75% drop in depression (also known as &#39;better than a lot of straight up antidepressants&#39;), extremely rare regrets, and physiological stress markers normalizing is &quot;poor results&quot;? Just because you can&#39;t get a group that has been massively targeted for a trait they can&#39;t escape down to 100% as healthy as the general public doesn&#39;t mean you got &#39;poor&#39; results, it just means you didn&#39;t get perfect ones.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Trans people <em>are</em> embracing who they are. It&#39;s you who&#39;s trying to tell them that they can&#39;t be that because their body doesn&#39;t look a particular way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it tells them to try to change something that&#39;s unchangeable</p>

<p>Sex is, to a fair extent, changeable. Gender doesn&#39;t need to be.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_androgen_insensitivity_syndrome">Women who have Y chromosomes who aren&#39;t capable of childbirth and who no one seriously objects to calling women</a> might want a word about that.</p>

<p>Ah yes, the old &quot;they secretly know I&#39;m right and just won&#39;t admit it!&quot; approach.</p>

<p>I know that I can&#39;t fully change every aspect of my sex. And yes, that sucks! I&#39;d really like to be able to carry a child. But the changes I <em>could</em> make have been literally the best decision I have ever made. I smile nearly every single morning when I see myself in the mirror because I see <em>me</em> there, not a mask I can&#39;t take off.</p>

<p>We have a reasonably good developmental model for how a human brain develops as masculine or feminine, and even a reasonably good set of theories for how this development might not end up matching that human&#39;s sex chromosomes or development of external sex-linked characteristics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are, in my mind, three distinctions that sort of headline it. </p>

<p>One is that it&#39;s both plausible and to some extent demonstrated that gender identity is the result of the physical differentiation of particular parts of the brain. There is no reasonable mechanism for &quot;species identity&quot; to occur in the same way.</p>

<p>Two, trans people are generally not trying to carve an entirely new niche in society, simply asking to be treated as you already do treat millions of others.</p>

<p>And three, and probably most importantly, there&#39;s a difference between &quot;feels good right now&quot; and &quot;supports long-term emotional well-being&quot;. It is, at this point, well-demonstrated that gender transition is the latter, not just the former (in fact in the short term transition can be extraordinarily stressful).

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s definitely an agenda with this movement. I think part of it, is that the people suffering with this mental disorder (as it is still a mental disorder in the DSMV, currently) are being given this by our environment, our bodies endocrine systems are being messed with to the point that we don&#39;t know whether or not we&#39;re a boy or girl and which gender we should mate with. This whole thing about the LGTBQ community is that it has always been in humanity, just not to this extent. The fact that we are being told and demanded to accept these people and their lifestyles is what has me questioning the whole thing. I think that TPTB are trying in every way to destabilize the American family and our values. I mean, look at a handful of families and check out how little time they spend together, for one. I feel that by continuing to change what a family looks like will in the end, be our downfall. I just don&#39;t see how we can be a strong country if we are so pulled apart by TPTB trying to get us to fight and accept everyone, it just doesnt work, un-organicly. We&#39;re being pushed into these things, and that just will make people push back, and end in in-fighting. Eh, that&#39;s some of my muddled thoughts, thanks for bringing the topic up!</p>

There is distress before the transition, that is the mental disorder, not after they have the transition, duh. We&#39;re not trying to hate on trans people, ok, we&#39;re just trying to say that it&#39;s not a normal thing to feel that you are in the wrong gender&#39;s body, it&#39;s a mental disorder which makes the person feel negatively. I think its something that should be dealt with in a different manner, rather than completely mutilate their genitals and get crazy hormones and get plastic surgery, that&#39;s frickin nuts to a normal person, completely crazy, which it is, it&#39;s the person&#39;s brain not acting normally, we shouldn&#39;t go along with someone who is experiencing this disorder and let them carve themselves a new physical identity when they know they will never actually be a woman or a man. I&#39;ve been very interested in this topic for a big portion of my life, and have been mostly supportive of the changes trans people wish to make, but recently I&#39;ve had to re-evaluate what is really going on in our society, why it seems so much more prevalent and why our govt is making the rest of us HAVE to be ok with their choices, that&#39;s what has me scratching my head. Why are we allowing/supporting people who are suffering with this mental disorder to take drastic measures such as to mangle their bodies?</p>

<p>And you base this on what, aside from a knee-jerk &#39;that sounds crazy&#39; response? Again, where is your evidence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rather than completely mutilate their genitals and get crazy hormones and get plastic surgery</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only one of those I&#39;ve done is &#39;get crazy hormones&#39;, by which you mean &#39;take HRT that is already given to post-menopausal women&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we shouldn&#39;t go along with someone who is experiencing this disorder and let them carve themselves a new physical identity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then why does every major medical organization say otherwise, along with the overwhelming majority of the many trans people who have transitioned and been satisfied with it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when they know they will never actually be a woman or a man</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s that &quot;oh, they secretly know I&#39;m right, they just won&#39;t admit it!&quot; approach again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve been very interested in this topic for a big portion of my life</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet, you have a remarkable lack of any supporting evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but recently I&#39;ve had to re-evaluate what is really going on in our society, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, and here&#39;s the &quot;oh no, I don&#39;t have a problem with X, it&#39;s just that X is part of a conspiracy to destroy society&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why it seems so much more prevalent and why our govt is making the rest of us HAVE to be ok with their choices, that&#39;s what has me scratching my head. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one is making you &#39;have to be okay&#39; with anything. Judging by your posting history, you seem to live in the US, where it is currently legal in exactly 100% of jurisdictions not just to think what you want of trans people, but also to stand up and say as much. In fact, a party that explicitly opposes trans rights in all forms is currently in unified control of the US government. So...yeah.</p>

But try to take a view from the outside and see how it might seem, at least, yes in America, where it does seem like the govt and Hollywood and advertising are trying to swing us to view the trans person&#39;s condition as normal and a large part of humanity, which it isn&#39;t, but it is growing.

<p>Please continue, Governor.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Having a stake is not the same thing as presenting a biased case. I do have a stake, to be sure, but the facts I present are accurate as best I understand them. I didn&#39;t transition until I was confident of that case, so if anything my transition is just putting my lifestyle choices where my mouth is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But try to take a view from the outside</p>

<p>By which you mean &quot;ignore the data and assume all change must be conspiratorial decay by default&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where it does seem like the govt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...the government that just rolled back trans protections and is currently run by a party who quite clearly does not accept trans people as a group?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and Hollywood</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is very liberal, yes. No debate that your typical Hollywood type does indeed want you to accept trans people. I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s part of an evil scheme to stop people from breeding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and advertising</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on the ad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are trying to swing us to view the trans person&#39;s condition as normal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they&#39;re trying to get you to view trans <em>people</em> as generally normal <em>people</em> who should not be targeted simply because they are trans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and a large part of humanity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what you&#39;re aiming for on that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally feel that we are being given hormone interfering chemicals through food, air, medications, etc. that might be producing this effect more than previously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Given&quot; implies intent, which it doesn&#39;t seem like you have anything to really support. But &quot;exposed to incidentally&quot;, sure - there&#39;s actually a fair amount of research on this, and it is plausible that it&#39;s involved to some extent. But I suspect that most of the rise is from increasing acceptance, given that it so sharply correlates with where people are or are not accepted for being trans.</p>

<p>Not at all. I think I know a lot about it because I&#39;ve been having these discussions more or less every day for about half a decade now, and because I can back up my claims with dozens of studies.</p>

<p>and so you&#39;re just going to sit on your pedestal and tell everyone they&#39;re wrong for their beliefs and feelings</p>

<p>Because they are wrong in their beliefs. Feelings don&#39;t turn on a dime, I know that, but all I&#39;m asking is that people try to work on them.</p>

<p>The thing is, being really stupid, trashy, or over the top doesn&#39;t make you wrong.

Think of how many people are getting depressed/anxious and have to take meds that are creating side effects that are damaging our minds and bodies. Think of the GMOs and Round Up that&#39;s being sprayed on our foods and injected at the cellular level , that is most definitely having an impact on our minds and bodies, as well as other animals such as bees, amphibians, and other small fauna.

<p>&quot;For people who feel a certain way&quot;... I&#39;m just wondering... If I felt that I was born a tiger </p>

<p>We have a reasonably good developmental model for how a human brain develops as masculine or feminine, and even a reasonably good set of theories for how this development might not end up matching that human&#39;s sex chromosomes or development of external sex-linked characteristics. </p>

<p>What&#39;s your theory for how a human brain could develop as a tiger?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are, in my mind, three distinctions that sort of headline it. </p>

<p>One is that it&#39;s both plausible and to some extent demonstrated that gender identity is the result of the physical differentiation of particular parts of the brain. There is no reasonable mechanism for &quot;species identity&quot; to occur in the same way.</p>

<p>Two, trans people are generally not trying to carve an entirely new niche in society, simply asking to be treated as you already do treat millions of others.</p>

<p>And three, and probably most importantly, there&#39;s a difference between &quot;feels good right now&quot; and &quot;supports long-term emotional well-being&quot;. It is, at this point, well-demonstrated that gender transition is the latter, not just the former (in fact in the short term transition can be extraordinarily stressful). Comparable evidence does not exist for your hypothetical tiger-man.</p>
