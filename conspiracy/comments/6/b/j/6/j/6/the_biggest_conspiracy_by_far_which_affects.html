    <div class="md"><p>I know a little bit about marketing, over the 50+ years since I finished high school.  You don&#39;t try to sell to everyone.  You qualify.  You pick the low hanging fruit.  You devote 90% of your time to the 10% of the targets who have already decided to buy your product but only need someone to ask them if they are ready to buy.  Hey, but what do I know?  I had to work til I was 31 before I was able to retire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really enforced, nor is it realistic to assume the average caller is going to check the DNC list before calling (We called people out of books, so the only way someone&#39;s name got taken off was if they themselves asked). There are also a good bit of loop holes. Anything involving PACs, non-profits, surveys, past business, etc is exempt. It basically takes a massive class action lawsuit to hit the company with any sort of punishment, which means small companies like mine was aren&#39;t likely to get in trouble, and the financial benefit to doing it anyway surpasses the potential fines of getting taken to court over it for large corporations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beginning 08/01/16, the fine can be up to $40,000 for each violation.  Telemarketers actually pay a fee to obtain the DNC list, which has about 225 million numbers on it.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah other forms of marketing are leading the way now. Most of the call rooms are based overseas to cut overhead costs. You&#39;re probably better off just answering the phone with &quot;May I ask who&#39;s calling and what it&#39;s regarding&quot; and if you don&#39;t like the answer, hanging up. The more effort you put into avoiding cold calls, the more personal information you are putting out there for these companies to profit off of, because everything you say can and will be recorded, logged, and used to swindle/sell you something tomorrow. </p>
