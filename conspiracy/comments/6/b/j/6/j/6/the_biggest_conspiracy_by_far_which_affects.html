       Of all of the things in my life that I wish that the US Government would protect us from it is unsolicited phone calls that tops my list. I am on the 'Do Not Call List'. These calls greatly disturb me and my wife several times each day, and I cannot understand why it is that the US Government does not use its virtually unlimited power to put an end to this scourge.  I am surely speaking for all Americans who suffer the distress, several times each day, of this unlawful subversion of our telephones.

       If you were at the age my wife and I are, nearly 70, you would perhaps begin to develop the kind of anger that I have toward this unlawful disturbance.  I report every call I get to the
       <a href="https://complaints.donotcall.gov/complaint/complaintcheck.aspx">
        FCC
       </a>
       .  Once you've typed the information into each field on all successive calls you can enter the information into each field by just clicking with the mouse two times.  It only takes a few seconds to do this and I encourage everyone to put this link in their bookmarks and report the callers.

       I get upset when, several times a day, companies which are violating the law, call me and try to sell me something I don't want, or try to trick me into giving them access to my computer.

       I know a little bit about marketing, over the 50+ years since I finished high school.  You don't try to sell to everyone.  You qualify.  You pick the low hanging fruit.  You devote 90% of your time to the 10% of the targets who have already decided to buy your product but only need someone to ask them if they are ready to buy.  Hey, but what do I know?  I had to work til I was 31 before I was able to retire.

       The "do not call" list:
      </p>
      <p>
       A list of people who answer the phone when random strangers call. From the perspective of the telemarketers, I would most likely only call these people. The hardest thing about telemarketing, is getting someone on the phone.

       It's not really enforced, nor is it realistic to assume the average caller is going to check the DNC list before calling (We called people out of books, so the only way someone's name got taken off was if they themselves asked). There are also a good bit of loop holes. Anything involving PACs, non-profits, surveys, past business, etc is exempt. It basically takes a massive class action lawsuit to hit the company with any sort of punishment, which means small companies like mine was aren't likely to get in trouble, and the financial benefit to doing it anyway surpasses the potential fines of getting taken to court over it for large corporations.

       Beginning 08/01/16, the fine can be up to $40,000 for each violation.  Telemarketers actually pay a fee to obtain the DNC list, which has about 225 million numbers on it.  If nobody reports you then you're OK.  I report every call I get - it only takes about 20 seconds.

       Yeah other forms of marketing are leading the way now. Most of the call rooms are based overseas to cut overhead costs. You're probably better off just answering the phone with "May I ask who's calling and what it's regarding" and if you don't like the answer, hanging up. The more effort you put into avoiding cold calls, the more personal information you are putting out there for these companies to profit off of, because everything you say can and will be recorded, logged, and used to swindle/sell you something tomorrow.

       Also I saw below that you run your own business from home, so you actually aren't protected by the DNC list, so long as it's on a phone that you use to do business.

       Definitely look into it. That's why I only use my work phone for calling others or answering calls from people I actually know.

       I invested in caller ID and if I don't know who the caller is I don't answer.  If it is important there will be a message. You will also soon recognize some of the numbers and can receive then end the call without speaking at all.
