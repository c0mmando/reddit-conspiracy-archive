       Yes it can, if you believe in made up shit you can't see reality. If you buy into some conspiracy with literally no proof besides wikileaks retweeting it then you will never be satisfied when the truth comes out.

       I don't think insulting all the sub participants is very helpful, and no, your apples and oranges argument doesn't really make sense in this case. The accusation that the Russians hacked the DNC and gave the material to wiki leaks very much falls apart if it turns out that the documents were leaked by a DNC operative. How can it be both? It's either one or the other.

       It is very possible for both to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia can hack the DNC, and then Seth can leak a copy of the emails to verify their legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if Seth was killed to stop him being a witness to voter fraud in Ohio then why was he killed as punishment for leaking to Wikileaks?

       you could be a better moderator. i amended my comment to use the full username. the percentage of my post with caps was less than 40. you are overly sensitive or have ulterior motives. it is a shame such people should have authority in this sub.

       you could seriously take your condescension over to thedonald or something. if you have a bone to pick then speak up. don't just be a dick and arbitrarily swing your power about because you can. if you would like to alienate people from the sub you moderate than keep it up, but nitpicking about someone's actual username and then nitpicking a legitimate complaint doesn't help anyone.

"An FBI forensic report of Rich's computer -- generated within 96 hours after Rich's murder -- showed he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time "

       The main difference here is that the man making the claims to the media is also claiming to have hard evidence.  That's a claim the "Russian Collusion" crowd has never even attempted to make.  In fact almost all reporting on the Russia story makes a point to say "There is no evidence at this time...."
      </p>
      <p>
       At least in this case they are pointing to specific, eventually verifiable, pieces of evidence.  Whether this so-called evidence sees the light of day or turns out to be true, remains to be seen.

       No one outside of Trump, his accountant, and attorneys have seen them.  Everything else is wishful thinking.  Like, "This Russia thing will finally make sense once we see those tax returns!"  It is 100% speculation.
      </p>

       This assertions in the Seth Rich case as they have been presented imply the investigator has actually seen evidence.

       Let me get this straight. The DNC set up Flynn, Manafort and the lot. They also gave classified info to the Ruskies, then said they didn't only to have Trump say he had a right to? Then they took their time machine back to get Trump Millions from Russia?

       Just look at all the countless "NEW" users that are obviously trying (and failing) to derail the Seth rich topic.  They try to cry to mods about unfair reposts and unfair political sides- but they don't get their way because this isn't r/politics-   The Seth rich story was a big deal back then and it's a big deal now.  He could single handedly kill the Russia msm narrative and I think they know that.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion- but when you try to stifle others discussions, youre a problem. With that said,  r/conspiracy keep on keeping on!! 👍🏻  Downvote these "new" accounts and keep it moving.

       Anonymous sources = fake news. A conspiracy guy in r/news told me this yesterday. Did you not get the memo? Or do anonymous sources only mean fake news if they're exposing trump's corruption?

       I truly think they're going to get Trump out of office very soon. All they have to do is pass around one of the petitions on one of those sites owned by Soros, come up with some legalities and technicalities that make it ok, boom, he's out.  Can Mike Pence be compromised?
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is all true, I just can't envision how power and order can remain under control if they keep Trump in office. He's a part of the story where everything becomes confusing, once he's out, the majority are happy and no more questions about Russia are relevant. Every time they push a Russia story they take a risk (if this is all true) and with this new info, that risk becomes exponentially increased.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only time will tell! But if he gets impeached, that is a massive red flag to me.

       Did u read this ? "An FBI forensic report of Rich's computer -- generated within 96 hours after Rich's murder -- showed he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time "

       If it was a small failed robbery why does the fbi even have his computer

       The existence of this report is based, like the rest of the article, on the anonymous source. Sorry to burst your bubble but anonymous sources aren't considered evidence around here.
