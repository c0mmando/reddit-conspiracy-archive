    <div class="md"><p>How?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think many people dispute that a group that seems to be connected to Russia hacked the DNC well before Seth Rich was murdered (2015 even, iirc?). </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fallacy to assume that just because a specific hacker group known to hack far and wide was found to have also hacked the DNC, that therefore anything leaked must have come from them. In fact, I always wondered why the reported timelines of the detected hack and the published emails don&#39;t line up fully. Where&#39;s the rest? And why did the July DNC leaks come from only seven email addresses if this hacker group had managed to infiltrate into their servers for such a long time? </p>

<p>The DNC had absolutely terrible cybersecurity. If they were only compromised by one or two Russian groups and nobody else, I&#39;d be surprised.</p>

<p>The whole point here is that maybe it was an inside job, even though intel-gathering hacking occurred, because the latter is a constant; the leak was the novelty this time.</p>
