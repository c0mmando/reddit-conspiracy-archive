       The Paul Ryan chat that was just leaked confirmed DNC was hacked by Russia. The conversation was confirmed to be real by multiple people that were present  for it. The conversation also happened nearly a month before Seth was murdered. That's quite the blow to the Seth Rich theory.

       Not sure why that matters when McMullin already confirmed the conversation took place, and McCarthy claimed it didn't take place, but then backtracked and said it was a joke once WaPo said they have tapes. These are both people who were present at the conversation.

       How?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think many people dispute that a group that seems to be connected to Russia hacked the DNC well before Seth Rich was murdered (2015 even, iirc?).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a fallacy to assume that just because a specific hacker group known to hack far and wide was found to have also hacked the DNC, that therefore anything leaked must have come from them. In fact, I always wondered why the reported timelines of the detected hack and the published emails don't line up fully. Where's the rest? And why did the July DNC leaks come from only seven email addresses if this hacker group had managed to infiltrate into their servers for such a long time?
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC had absolutely terrible cybersecurity. If they were only compromised by one or two Russian groups and nobody else, I'd be surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point here is that maybe it was an inside job, even though intel-gathering hacking occurred, because the latter is a constant; the leak was the novelty this time.
