       Yep. People claim you can't trust the NYT because they have made mistakes in the past (and published retractions) but trump? Holy shit, that man is jesus and never lies! He is rich, white, and in power - nothing to see here (t_d 2.0)

       So you're saying the standard here is:
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't trust anyone but 4chan. If some dude says something there it is totally true!
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't you follow and investigate conspiracies and use newspapers and such?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ohhhhh! Shit. I forgot. The only liar some people trust is trump. One mistake from a msm source and forever label them, a million from trump and bow down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Damned sad how he has dragged people away from actual investigations by getting them to worship him as an infallible god.

       I applaud your logic here, truly I'm clapping. NYT is a fucking Joke. I trust them just as much as I trust a bunch of anons stewing in their theories on 4chan.

       As I said elsewhere, people here said the same thing about the WaPo article the other day. Turns out it was right.

       Do they have a bias (like one could say of any media)? Sure. But that doesn't mean every word is lie. Do they lie on the weather too?

       Please, try to discuss the issues if you can. I am betting you can't.

       If anything their tactics have only gotten better and easier to conceal. They were experimenting with MK-Ultra mind control at the same time they were running Operation Mockingbird. If they had mind control in the 50's, imagine what they can do in 2017.

       The DNC created the term Alt-Right during the campaign because Pepe memes kept making them look bad.  Poor frog.

       The alt-right doesn't care one bit, not one, about conspiracies. They care only for hillary.

       If they actually cared they would look at what is going on now - but they are owned, totally owned, by one old man. Slaves to him for some reason. Must suck to be owned and loyal to a master like him (rich man who doesn't give a shit about you).

       If by uprising you mean anti-semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-anyone but straight white people, well, sure. There are a lot of hateful bigoted people in the US who want us to be all white and led by someone like putin.

       I am getting tired of the shareblue type shills on this board. Yesterday on /pol I witnessed shilling attacks by the left like I had not seen since the most heated days of the elections. This place as well is being flooded. There are definitely shills on the right as well. Places like T_D and others, but right now the neoliberal shills are overwhelmingly the biggest shills flooding this board at the moment.

       Well if a sub spends a bit of time on the DNC leaks and corruption it's fairly likely that people from that 'side' are going to have to try and create the illusion that it's only motivated by a love of Trump rather than a desire to see justice and a repaired system.

       "Watch out for shills" says the guy with a 2 year old account with less than 200 total karma.   It might be better for you to have a momet of introspection, to see if you are doing whats called 'projection' aka assigning your sims to others.

       I think the DNC leaks are legit, and I'm not a huge fan of Donny. OP feels like a shill really. I hate how partisan this community has become. Your blatant hate of Donald is just as one sided as their reeeeeee support.

       This sub is a battleground...
      </p>
      <p>
       The two clashing armies of posters and commentors, trolls and shills, came running down the hills into these formerly peaceful valley of paranoia...
       <br/>
       But unlike real armies, they are not wearing uniforms or helmets to distinguish them for us aboriginal inhabitants.

      <p>
       We can either choose a side, and concede the territory to them after the dust settles, or fight on two fronts for the freedom of our minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the war is upon us. May &lt;insert-preferred-deity-or-icon-of-choice&gt; have mercy on our posts.
