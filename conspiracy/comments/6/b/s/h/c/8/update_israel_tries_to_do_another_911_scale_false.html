<p>BOOM: HERE IT IS - THE REASON THEY ARE TRYING TO BUTCHER TRUMP RIGHT NOW, AND THE CULPRIT IS ISRAEL</p>

<p>Just in case Israel does this anyway, this was posted on May 17 at 7 AM cst.
I believe this leak is highly credible.</p>

<p>Israel hatched another new 911 terror plot, and Trump shut it down. Here is how the story line was supposed to go
Terrorists were going to board a U.S. bound plane from Europe, with laptops. They were going to hack the plane with their laptops, and do a second 911. When Trump mentioned terrorists with laptops to Russia, and to get them off of planes, and then Trump banned laptops on flights to the U.S., he shut down the Israeli terror plot.</p>

<p>The plot was obviously as fabricated as 911. I do not know who leaked it to Trump, but Kushner is close enough to all of it to do it. And even if Trump did not know it was Israel (highly probable he did not know) even if Trump thought it really was an independent terror plot, the end result was that him telling Russia to get laptops off their planes, shut it down.</p>

<p>SO THAT is the HUGE &quot;Trump Russia intelligence leak&quot; and Israel is PISSED AS HELL ABOUT IT, because they had a whole new plan, and now it will not go forward.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This is why everyone&#39;s on Trump. He basically stopped a false flag and alerted the Russians about the weaponized laptops. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just saying that seems like a goal that a police state or NWO or whatever you want to call them would be trying to implement. Like to me it seems more likely that banning laptops to &quot;save people from terror&quot; is just a semi-clever way to ban the laptops which was what you had intended to do in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question, which I don&#39;t know exactly. Seems kind of like the TSA increased security since 9/11, totally unnecessary and probably not saved a single life since its implementation but is just a way of systematically degrading people&#39;s freedom every time they fly. </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s laptops, next it could be phones, next you have to change into a jumpsuit to fly, who knows where this is going. </p>

<p>In the past decade, reality TV has become a juggernaut in the TV industry and continues to keep people occupied with mindless drivel. What do the TPTB want? An unaware and compliant citizenry. How do you keep the couch potatoes in place then? You get one of the most controversial reality TV stars (&quot;businessman&quot;) to become president so that people are glued to the TV watching this kabuki theater day in and day out. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the MIC and friends are still murdering people all across the planet with impunity- but look over here! Trump is eating KFC with a knife and fork what a fucking travesty!</p>

<p>Trump and Hillary are two sides of the same coin. They both serve only 1 master and that&#39;s Israel. </p>

<p>Arguing who is better is basically like 2 puppets controlled by 1 puppetmaster arguing whose master treats them better.</p>

<p>So you think Kushner leaked this plot to Trump? After all of the researcher I&#39;ve read on here about Kushner, I&#39;d assume he&#39;d be the last person to leak a plot of this magnitude to Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you should have known before the election that this was going to happen. Both trump and clinton gushed over israel at the aipac convention. It was only sanders who said anything that wasn&#39;t unrelenting praise for the terrorist state. Meanwhile dem politicians betray their voters by biting their tongue and they do that because they know they won&#39;t get the support of the media if they go after israel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat land huge ass buildings? Clear day could see for miles flying a plane is really not rocket science I have flown flight simulators and taken some lessons. once you know how to plane you just kinda go. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easy I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s not so difficult as you are making it out to be. The one that blows my mind is the pendragon. That was some expert level stunt flying skills that guy had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>want something else to ponder? Flight 93 was flying northwest when shot down not southeast towards D.C. As reported. Here&#39;s the dots to connect. Check out the debris field and reports of the playing flying over lake Indian Marina. How did people report hearing a giant boom followed by hearing the plane fly over them if they were southeast of the crash site?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just saying that seems like a goal that a police state or NWO or whatever you want to call them would be trying to implement. Like to me it seems more likely that banning laptops to &quot;save people from terror&quot; is just a semi-clever way to ban the laptops which was what you had intended to do in the first place. </p>
