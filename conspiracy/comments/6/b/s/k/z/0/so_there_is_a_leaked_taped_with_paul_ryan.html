       Here you go buddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       (UI: Unidentified individual)
      </p>
      <p>
       UI: Kevin had the Ukrainian prime minister this morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: Oh, so did I. I just left him in the health care… [unintelligible].
      </p>
      <p>
       UI: Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: This guy’s a good guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Crosstalk]
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: This guy’s a pretty good guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: Is this the guy who’s been there a while?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: No, he’s new. He was the speaker of the [unintelligible].
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: Their other prime minister got kicked out, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: Right. This guy’s like the anti-corruption guy. This guy’s there because he’s the anticorruption guy. He was the speaker…
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: And he’s the one who was working on the amendments to the constitution
[unintelligible]…independent judiciary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: They got that in now…[unintelligible]…and he’s passing…and he’s passing all these
anticorruption laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: How are things going in Ukraine?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: What’s that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: How are things going in Ukraine?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: Well, the Russians are bombing them 30-40…um, um…shells a day and the people.
Crimea is gone. And, they’re trying to clean up their government to show that they want to be
western. So they’re trying to prove to the western world that they want to be western, or
westernizing, so they can get support to get their country back. They’re [unintelligible].
Everybody talks a good game on what they’re doing, but he’s passed all these anti-corruption
laws. The question is are they, like, executing…[unintelligible]…I think by the summer they’ll
have it all done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: Did he talk about their economy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: Yeah, this is about getting actual growth and not graft growth, so...no, it’s not good, but…
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: I went there a year ago. It was like wow. These people are living…they’re on the front
lines. They’re fighting for their freedom…it’s, uh…their independence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: He basically…He has this really interesting riff about… people have said that they have
Ukraine fatigue, and it’s really Russian fatigue because what Russia is doing is doing to us,
financing our populists, financing people in our governments to undo our governments, you
know, messing with our oil and gas energy, all the things Russia does to basically blow up our
country, they’re just going to roll right through us and go to the Baltics and everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: Yes!
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: So we should not have Ukraine fatigue, we should have Russian fatigue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: Yes! The propaganda…my big takeaway from that trip was just how sophisticated the
propaganda…
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: It’s very sophisticated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers:…coming out of Russia and Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: Very sophisticated.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Crosstalk]
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: Not just in Ukraine. They were once funding the NGOs in Europe. They attacked
fracking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: Correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: Russia TV. I was not…you know…I hadn’t tuned into Russia TV until that trip. It’s,
it’s frightening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: So he’s saying they’re doing this throughout Europe. So, uh…
      </p>
      <p>
       [Unintelligible]
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: This is, this isn’t just about Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: So, yeah, it is a, um…[unintelligible]…a way...it’s really a messaging…you
know…they are…it’s a propaganda war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: Russia is trying to turn Ukraine against itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: Yes. And that’s…it’s sophisticated and it’s, uh…
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: Maniacal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: And guess…guess who’s the only one taking a strong stand up against it? We are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodgers: We’re not…we’re not…but, we’re not…
      </p>
      <p>
       McCarthy: [unintelligible]…I’ll GUARANTEE you that’s what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Unintelligible]
      </p>
      <p>
       McCarthy: The Russians hacked the DNC and got the opp research that they had on Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       McCarthy: laughs
      </p>
      <p>
       [Crosstalk]
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: The Russian’s hacked the DNC…

      <p>
       McHenry: …to get oppo…

      <p>
       Ryan: …on Trump and like delivered it to…to who?
      </p>
      <p>
       [Unintelligible]
      </p>
      <p>
       McCarthy: There’s…there’s two people, I think, Putin pays: Rohrabacher and
Trump…[laughter]…swear to God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: This is an off the record…[laughter]…NO LEAKS…[laughter]…alright?!
      </p>
      <p>
       [Laughter]
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan: This is how we know we’re a real family here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scalise: That’s how you know that we’re tight.
      </p>

       This "transcript" shows all the tell signs.  The heavy use of eliptical points being most prominent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let us see what information can be gained from this. We have 5 individuals talking.  An unknown individual states a Kevin talk to a Ukrainian.  The Ukrainian guy is a government agent that they approve of.  He feeds them Russia propaganda line which they approve. Then we have this gem from Rogers and Ryan:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Rodgers: Not just in Ukraine. They were once funding the NGOs in Europe. They attacked fracking.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ryan: Correct.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rodgers: Russia TV. I was not…you know…I hadn’t tuned into Russia TV until that trip. It’s, it’s frightening.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ryan: So he’s saying they’re doing this throughout Europe. So, uh…
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We have the ODNI report being echoed here about the 'fracking' line.  Oh noes they run anti-fracking stories!!! They refer to it as Russia TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they talking about RT?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As in Russia Today?  They don't even know the name of the network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us continue to the meat of the claim. We have a 'McCarthy' stating:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Russians hacked the DNC and got the opp research that they had on Trump.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Obviously referencing the Guccifer 2.0 leaks, which turned out to be not done by the Russians. Here is an analysis of Guccifer 2.0
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://g-2.space/">
        http://g-2.space/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that it is Guccifer 2.0 being referenced is here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/dnc-hacker-leaks-trump-oppo-report-647293">
        http://thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/dnc-hacker-leaks-trump-oppo-report-647293
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have Ryan repeating McCarthy
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Russian’s hacked the DNC…
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Notice the ellipses, indicating either a pause or incompleteness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most likely a question seeing how the next line ends in a question.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ryan: …on Trump and like delivered it to…to who?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is disingenuously used to indicate Ryan 'knew' about some kind of 'collusion'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Folks, save this transcript.  If a tape is ever released we will have some more evidence of Washington Posts bullshit.
