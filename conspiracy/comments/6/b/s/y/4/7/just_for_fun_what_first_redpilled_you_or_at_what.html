    <div class="md"><p>I went to high school that didn&#39;t sugarcoat history, so when 9/11 happened we all KNEW what was going to happen next. We were absolutely ignored when we expressed that concern to the teachers. (&quot;Hey teach, didn&#39;t X, Y, and Z happen before in the past? Isn&#39;t this just a repeat of these other things you forced us to learn about?&quot;)</p>

<p>Every single teacher said &quot;They hate us for our freedom&quot; and that &quot;No the US isn&#39;t going to go to war. This is a terrorist group, not a country, don&#39;t worry. The rest of the world is on our side.&quot;</p>

I had read the Ambassador died of smoke inhalation in a fire, I then saw pictures of him beaten black and blue being dragged through the streets. I then found out not only was he beaten but raped.

    <div class="md"><p>Always been into conspiracy. I did a lot of research into the murder of all those SEALs that were shot down in Afghanistan 3 months of Osama was &quot;killed&quot; and seeing just how fucking carless and corrupt they were with the investigation was sick.

<p>I think after researching a conspiracy theory that wasn&#39;t that well known and coming to my own conclusions from the evidence was what redpilled me. </p>

<p>Plus, I recently found out that my Step-Grandfather&#39;s family were a bunch of Nazi supporting, Illuminati wretches. So all that got proven to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always, since I can remember thought things were weird. I even wrote a letter to President Reagan when I was 8 about the bombing on one of our military bases(that I&#39;m embarrassed to say I can&#39;t think of the name at the moment..in the 80&#39;s lots of our military were killed)  He wrote back to me too explaining how sad he was about it! Of course, after reading it, I had to be a jerk and scoff at his signature being a stamp and not real lol</p>

<p>I questioned anything that in my gut felt off. However, I was brow beat into believing that the Government wouldn&#39;t lie, anything that looked liked a bunch of coincidences was exactly that. </p>

<p>Sure there&#39;s always a chance that a story wasn&#39;t the real story, but where&#39;s the proof? Gut feelings don&#39;t mean anything...yadda yadda.</p>

<p>I still read up on things, researched everything I could. Trying to find something. No matter what info was found, people shot it down as faked, misunderstood etc. etc.</p>

<p>9/11 I watched the whole thing live. I didn&#39;t question anything I was so freaked. I JUST had my 1st kid, so I was soooo mad that I had a new born and figures, the world was gonna end.  Then I watched the news on Flight 93. There was NO WAY it crashed. That thing was shot down. That&#39;s protocol. They know planes are being used as weapons. How can the news and everyone around me not see that?! In the days, and months after, if you questioned anything about it, people would flip the fuck out. WHY DO YOU HATE AMERICA?!?! </p>

<p>That&#39;s when I kept ALL my thoughts on things to myself. from then on. </p>

<p>Message boards really messed me up over the years because almost every time a conspiracy was mentioned, you were either called a fucking idiot, or someone would go through each detail and explain why it meant nothing. I didn&#39;t know people actually did that on purpose. To discredit, misinform, etc. </p>

<p>Fast forward to last October 17th. I&#39;m looking at Reddit and see a post about some fuckery happening around the dude who ran Wikileaks. Well, it was interesting. Oh look! Hillary Emails? Who the Fuck is Podesta? Things are hazy after that. </p>

<p>After reading for hours and hours those emails, I was just shocked. You hear about those types doing shitty things, but hear I am reading their thoughts and plans about the shitty things they did! It was eye-opening. </p>

<p>Then the bombshell head explode. FBI Vaults released Vince Fosters revised FBI files. There was A LOT there. That was a story I knew about. I knew the official story, and I read the theories on it. That was one that seemed wrong, but theories are just that. </p>

<p>That file read like a damn thriller Novel. It was really really long, but so freakin worth the time to read it. After I read it all, everything is in it. So you know what really happened. that to this day fucks with me. but it proved to me once and for all that there really are shady horrible people out there, and there really is mystery agencies that cover bad peoples shit up and lie right to your face about it.</p>

<p>Sorry so long! I don&#39;t talk about this type of stuff anywhere except here, and I hardly do that. So thanks for reading/skimming lol </p>

<p>This is what I miss about this board. :) </p>

<p>I was eight months pregnant with my first on 9/11. Just wanted to say that I had a similar reaction. Like, this is the world I&#39;ve chosen to bring a child into? You&#39;ve got to be kidding me!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To expand on an earlier post I made:  </p>

<p>For me it began with the Nevada democratic primary.    I was a big Bernie guy back then.  A part of me still is...  Anyway it ended with a wall of cops in front of a ton of tired Bernie delegates who were completely fucked over.  </p>

<p>One guy picked up a chair. The people around him quickly made him put it down and gave him a hug. </p>

<p>The next day, NPR is reporting violence!  Didn&#39;t they do an ounce of fact checking?  There was TONS of love video!!  Why would they report something so completely untrue?</p>

<p>Questions that point to a single answer.  THE answer.</p>

What has been extra baffling to me is this number synchronisation that keeps popping up after I have been red-pilled. This repeating sequence of 1111, 2222, 3333 so on, so forth.  Any of you guys experiencing this too? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it was <a href="https://youtu.be/6LHizyCtakw">The Battle of the Beanfield</a> in 1985. The Miners Strike had finished at the start of March and Margaret Thatcher had already stated that she was going to break &#39;The Love Convoy&#39; and did so with a savage attack on &#39;New Age&#39; or &#39;Krusty&#39; travellers. It was quite close to where I lived and the impact was dramatic. I went on to become a &#39;krusty&#39; and lived on the road - it was a physically demanding, hard life. </p>

<p>The Battle of the Beanfield was the moment that I began to question the legitimacy of the press and government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a youngster, about 11 or 12, at the height if the cold war, the Rooskies were going to nuke us at any time.  The Rooskies were the evil empire..until there was a &#39;Police Exchange&#39; sponsored by Coca Cola, where some American Cops would go to the Soviet Union and some Commie Cops came here to learn.  The even got what I thought to be alot of coverage at the time, and it always struck me as weird, that our two nations were a knife edge away from nuking the shit out of each other, yet the mantra of &#39;cops are cops the world over&#39; was being repeated, along with the Soda Sponsorship.  If we are almost at war, yet cops, who hae bosses are cops all over...it made me think all the bosses are the same.</p>
