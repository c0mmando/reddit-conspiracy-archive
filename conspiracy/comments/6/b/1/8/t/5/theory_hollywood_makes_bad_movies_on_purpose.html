       Basically, Hollywood's goal is to make a revenue stream.  If they make too many good movies people will get desensitized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, they make occasional good movies to create a sense of magic, so that any movie might be that really good one.  Then they stick to formula.
      </p>
      <p>
       The formula is designed to draw fans inspired by the good movie back to the theatre time and again until they are burnt out.  Hollywood doesn't use good movies to do this but little demographic appeals and focus group tested stunts (certain demographics that could spend money likely on tickets love car crashes, for example).
      </p>
      <p>
       But movies themselves tend to suck because the goal is to get you to the theatre enough to squeeze money out of you.

       They Do. but not for the reasons you think they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big movie producers have TONs of very fine grain data on pretty much all movies. Budgets, Revenue, Dates, Genre , etc. Tons of Data of all kinds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty much through data correlation and economic statistics, they have discovered with high accuracy (ie smart math) to find magic numbers with what is essentially a guarentee profit overall. (Mostly... some outliers still exist). So to hedge bets, mostly B rated scripts, get B rated budgets. The math says it won't get more than B returns, even if you give it A or S rated budgets. So fuck it, minimum. These movies are released anyway because even if they aren't A movies, they still make enough money to be worth doing.

       So, the next question is.... but why? Why make 5 "bad" movies and 2 "good" movies when 3 "good" movies makes a little more profit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gambling is why. The "Good" movies are a higher chance of being good and higher profit, the "Bad" the reversue with one exception. buy in cost. you can make 5 "bad" for 1 "good". 'Bads" have a chance to be "good" and earn much more than expected. movies starting out in the "good" category can only become "bad" and make it a massive net loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the studios bet on an even number of both cost wise to hedge their bets for stable steady profits the most.

       Hollywoods main aim is propaganda, if it makes money as well then that's a bonus. 
I have recently been reading the following guys extensive archive and he goes into a few film criiques, here is his top 100 films.

       This is just my hunch based on reading a bunch of his stuff and some digging, but Mathis himself seems like some kind of limited hangout / psyop type of deal.  He delivers the goods most of the time, I'm just saying — be careful.

       Don't have anything on-hand, sorry, but I have seen discussions both here and in other forums where people have voiced their suspicions. If he's exactly who he claims to be he is kind of outlandishly prolific, isn't he?  And reading too much of his work at once kind of leaves one feeling hopelessly betrayed by basically every public figure ever, and that every single event one sees in the news is staged.  Which, sure, we're all paranoid here to some degree, but I find it hard to believe that EVERYTHING is a hoax or psyop and only Miles has figured them all out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will be controversial but TBH the final straw for me was when he shrugged off pizzagate as an "obvious psyop" or something like that.  (His actual argument is a bit more complex, you can find it at the end of this entry:
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/block.pdf">

       </a>
       He says all the wikileaks are staged leaks and that all the evidence was planted from the ground up.  He claims the media wants conspiracy theorists to "waste their time" studying this instead of "the trillionaires."  I am with him in the sense that Podesta and friends are small potatoes compared to some fuckers in this world, but the scope of the psyop he is suggesting here seems ludicrous, and all evidence points to the Podesta emails being genuine.  I'm sure Wikileaks has agendas beyond "the greater good" but I don't accept that they are manufacturing insanely huge amounts of emails as part of the role they (and Podesta and... everyone else) play in the grand scripted farce that Mathis sees everywhere.  I am sure there are psyops tied up with Pizzagate, but where there's smoke there's fire.  Mathis wants you to just see smoke everywhere and throw your hands up in despair.

       It's not working on me. I haven't been to the cinema in ten years. I'd rather avoid all the annoyancess and watch good TV instead. Some of the shows they've made in the past 15-20 years have been so good. Much better than the movies.

       for responding!  Never noticed reddit screwing with me like this before.  I guess I hadn't been posting sufficiently dangerous thoughtcrimes.

       I haven't got far enough into it but Allan C. Weisbecker seems to raise some good points. Thanks for opening up some new avenues to explore. Feel free to message me further if you like.

       My pleasure!  And likewise. To be honest I just discovered him myself when I googled "miles mathis pizzagate" to find some sources to back up what I was saying.  I have only read his four or so most recent posts so far but I feel Mr. Weisbecker would be a huge hit with the "regulars" here.

       That cluesforum place seems a ltd hangout I recognised the name of one of the admins from somewhere else, shut down insult and ban everyone who doesnt agree with them. Just as dogmatic as the msm.
I need a break will get into this later.

       Yeah, I had cluesforum in my mental "LH/psyop/bullshit" folder as well already.  "Truth" movement is absolutely shot through with controlled opposition and the like;  I already knew it, but if this fellow's correct, it's actually even worse than I had thought.
