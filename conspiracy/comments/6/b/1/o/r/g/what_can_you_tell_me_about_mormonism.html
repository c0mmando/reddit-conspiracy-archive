    <div class="md"><p>My experience with the LDS church is that, though they use the same terminology as average Christians, they mean very different things. They have some... unconventional...beliefs. The D&amp;C and Pearl of Wisdom, both available on the LDS website, will provide you with unbiased insight into their beliefs. They are also very high pressure when it comes to getting you to join their church. It won&#39;t be until after you&#39;re baptized that they&#39;ll start being open with you- &quot;milk before meat.&quot; I agreed once to let them in &amp; hear their pitch if I could ask about some of their beliefs. Here I am, two years later, <em>still</em> being lovebombed and having teams of missionaries knocking on my door. So, just a heads up...</p>

<p>I&#39;d look into the old temple marriages and stuff- there are some symbolic gestures that are apparently taken from Freemasonry. There&#39;s a lot about it online, but to be honest I was never really interested in that aspect so I am not well-versed in any of it. </p>

<p>The ex-mormon sub s would be a good place to post your questions :)</p>

<p>5 Condemning the righteous because of their righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished because of their money; and moreover to be held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their wills, that they might get gain and glory of the world, and, moreover, that they might the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to their own wills—</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been on this sub for a long time. And i would say there is a common mistrust of religion. However I think the book of Mormon gives so much context to the conspiracies that are often overlooked or misunderstood. Helaman 6:26-27 identifies that its Satan who seeks to make everyone miserable like unto himself. The first conspiracy was him getting Cain to kill Able. You should listen to Ezra Bensen talk on conspiracies from general conference Aril 1972. He says they are facts not theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Smith was a conman, but America prides itself on religious freedom. Thinking this exists in America is a joke when examining the history of Mormonism in America. As stupid as the religion is, the treatment mormons have endured is real bad. It&#39;s clear that women had much more power in Mormon communities at the end of the 19th century and this threatened the pre-suffrage status quo of the establishment at that time and polygamy was made illegal. It might seem counter intuitive to our 21st c minds, but polygamy in the end of the 19th century gave women much more power within the family and community structures than permitted by typical existing structures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grew up Mormon. Most of my family &amp; friends are still very active. While Mormonism might seem weird to some, I firmly believe religion is largely influenced by where you grew up and what your family did in regards to religion. Had I been born in Ragnar Lothbrook&#39;s day, I&#39;d likely have prayed to Odin. Likewise, if my mom were born in the south, she&#39;d have been a great Baptist. </p>

<p>Most Mormons are very well-meaning. The internet has made it much easier for Mormons to quietly research things they&#39;ve heard about the origins of Mormonism that are never discussed in Sunday school. A LOT of members are afraid to look at the history of the church from any source that is not approved by the church, choosing instead to believe the sterilized, white-washed version they were taught since they were children. This was my experience until well into my 40&#39;s. There is currently an exodus of life-long members leaving due to the discovery of truths found on the internet, not unlike many other religions. </p>

<p>Oddly enough, Mormons are very well educated on subjects other than the origins of their own religion. They tend to be very patriotic, conservative, family focused and self-reliant. I always disliked Mormon culture; there is more focus on good works and being anxiously engaged in a good cause than there is Grace. Self-imposed strides for daily perfection cause Utah to have a large part of its population on anti depressants.</p>

<p>As for what I believe, I just don&#39;t know anymore. If going to church makes anyone feel better about life, I say go for it. That&#39;s all I hope for: that people work to find peace in any way they can and try to be kind to everyone they interact with. </p>

<p>Happy to answer any questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks for the excellent response! I really appreciate it. I thought these girls were very nice, and I really enjoyed talking to them, they weren&#39;t pushy at all. I agree with you that our religion is largely influenced by our environment and who we grow up with. I grew up without any connection to a religious group or community that I could call my own, so in my early adult life Ive had to try and figure out where I fit into the world, and try and find a community that I can be apart of. I really wish I had been apart of one at an earlier age, because quite frankly now I feel like it is so hard, and everyone is so busy with work and school. Anyhow, this has forced my too ask many questions and try and figure most things about the world out on my own and come to my own conclusions. I don&#39;t really know anything for certain but I do feel like there is evil in the world that preys upon the good, and it makes me sad and angry, and Im sure Im not the only one. I hope that one day we can all overcome this together and set aside our differences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was raised Mormon. Uncovering its lies is what made me realize the rest of the world isn&#39;t as it seems. They&#39;ll say the nice stuff first, but they don&#39;t tell you their beliefs until you&#39;re too far in to think it&#39;s crazy. The temple rituals are the strangest thing to me, there&#39;s a youtuber <em>NewNameNoah</em> which shows some of the more mild ones. Joseph smith was a horny charlatan, and nothing more. Do some research for yourself, and you&#39;ll be surprised how deep the rabbit hole goes with Mormonism. I&#39;m open to any questions, but I&#39;ll probably answer them tomorrow. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t the most extreme religion out there. As far as I can tell we are all spirit beings put on earth to test our metal. If you become a Mormon you get to be a god.
