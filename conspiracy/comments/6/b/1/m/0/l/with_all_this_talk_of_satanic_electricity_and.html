    <div class="md"><p>I like that. But I feel like the intention of the Trinity was to express the harmony that&#39;s in all natural laws (including electricity). </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve seen it was trying to match the Zodiac/astrology, Platonism, geometry, and Jesus&amp;co&#39;s actual experiences with what they thought was God (i.e. probably due to the initial confusion with internal dialogue and hallucinations that occurred during the emergence of consciousness). All of these things would be imprinted by God, if the designer is intelligent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As to the internal dialogue theory read <em>The Origin of Consciousness and The Breakdown of The Bicameral Mind</em> by Julian Jaynes. Basically humans evolved to have a sense of self as the mind became more complex but at the beginning there was more of an executive branch which made the subjective appear real and even induced hallucinations when the function of the human required it. </p>

<p>Like you know you&#39;re hungry because an empty stomach creates pangs in your mind, it used to be that humans also needed to be commanded by their minds for most things because they had little ability to think, especially in a creative sense. And they called this voice God and made art that allowed them to better understand and communicate with it.</p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t really understand yourself in reference to other beings your internal dialogue can&#39;t really be under &#39;your&#39; control but is instead governed by automations affected by impressions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I know enough yet to explain these other concepts so I would encourage you to look into it but thinking of Jesus as the &quot;<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-16.htm">Morning star</a>&quot; or the &quot;<a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm">Sun of Righteousness</a>,&quot; allows a greater understanding of its relation to other philosophies.</p>

<p>Jesus and the 12 disciple system is later used by other people named Jesus in the the following centuries (and apparently there&#39;s other mary magdeline&#39;s too? I can&#39;t figure it out) and then you also have the Knight&#39;s Templar with the round table that follows the model of the Last Supper (sun at the center) of the 12, divided into 4 quadrants (zodiac system of houses) with the 1 sun in the center).</p>

<p>video reference:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-wSzD_jWFI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-wSzD_jWFI</a></p>

<p>A lot of people think Jesus is intended to represent a sun God in some aspects. (Look into what Bill Cooper has to say about this in his mystery babylon series (episode 2) </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a lot of geometry and astrology influenced by Plato and Pythagoras and their Egyptian teachers, but I need to read about it more. Obviously Platonic ethics and Plato&#39;s tripartite system is sort of an attempt at a practical model of Christian thought.</p>

<p>It definitely seems the entire New Testament was a direct response to the ways of the Mystery Schools. Jesus wants you to be born (reborn spiritually) without the process of insemination (promotes independent thinking)</p>

<p>And the more you look into it you see lots of eye of horus symbolism and relations to dionysus and Roman/Egyptian mythology.</p>

I became aware
of a hum in the room
an electrical hum in the room
It went mmmmmm
I followed it from
corner to corner
I pressed my ears
against the walls
I crossed diagonals
and put my hands on the floor
It went mmmmmm</p>

<p>Sometimes it was
a murmur
Sometimes it was
a pulse
Sometimes it seemed
to disappear
But then with a quarter-turn
of the head
it would roll around the sofa
A nimbus humming cloud
mmmmmm
Maybe it&#39;s the hum
of a calm refrigerator
cooling on a big night
Maybe it&#39;s the hum
of my parents&#39; voices
long ago in a soft light
mmmmmm
Maybe it&#39;s the hum
of changing opinion
or a foreign language
in prayer
Maybe it&#39;s the mantra
of the walls and wiring
Deep breathing
in soft air
mmmmmm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an original theory of mine:</p>

<p>The upper crust has always controlled the idiot masses for centuries by convincing them that religion is real.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s people had the benefit of the exchange of idea that the internet allowed and they realized that religion was a tool used to control people. </p>

<p>The upper crust realized that people were using their brains for a change and understanding that religion is hokey bullshit so they stepped their game up and pushed the idea of an emerging &quot;satanic elite&quot; to scare the younger generation back into thinking the old way.</p>

<p>We, the people who caught on early, were actually starting to see a positive change. Thank you for fucking this up for us by going back to your Gods and your Jesus&#39; and your Allah and your Buddhas and whatever else that the elite use to control us. We have seen what holy wars do to societies in our lifetimes and we were okay with that shit being over. You want to bring it back?</p>

<p>Your post was pushing religion by saying &quot;Christ Jesus&quot;.</p>

<p>You use poor grammar.</p>

<p>I will give you credit for original thought though. Please elaborate on this theory. (I&#39;m not being sarcastic...I accept that a lot of the knowledge that the ancients used to describe are metaphors for things they had to hide. You might be on to something.

<p>I know I shouldn&#39;t, but I have to ask...</p>

<p>What is this great &quot;achievement&quot; you&#39;ve made tonight, that I&#39;m so &quot;angry&quot; at?</p>

<p>&quot;Dayoftherope; May 14.  2017</p>

<p>Today is the day.  I finally did it.</p>

<p>I managed to post random, superficial god thoughts on a conspiracy forum.</p>

<p>I will cherish this achievement as long as I live.&quot;</p>
