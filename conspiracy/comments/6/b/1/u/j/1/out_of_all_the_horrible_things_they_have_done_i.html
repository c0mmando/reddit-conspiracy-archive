But out of all the crazy shit they&#39;ve designed, I&#39;ve never seen something as dangerous and terrifying as PC culture. At first it doesn&#39;t seem like the big deal just something people use to try to avoid hurt other&#39;s feelings, but holy shit beyond the mask there is something much more disturbing, It&#39;s a very radical way of mind control <a href="https://genius.com/Unabomber-the-danger-of-leftism-annotated">https://genius.com/Unabomber-the-danger-of-leftism-annotated</a> not just that, It&#39;s also in a way cultural and political death. If you have any idea that isn&#39;t part of PC culture then it gives people the perfect excuse to ridicule you. It also makes people not think outside the box which leads to moral degeneracy. Since they control almost all banks they can also buy all politicians. So we are stuck with a mayority of people who are corrupt beyond any measure and follow PC as a way to get power over others and other part of the mayority who, while following PC out of honesty see people who think outside the box as scum either way. There&#39;s very few people who can see who is the real enemy.</p>

<p>I am really concerned about the upcoming generation.</p>

<p>It is SO creepy to me how politically correct my students are...</p>

<p>I also got extremely frustrated the other day, when I was told people cannot be racist toward white people. I have experienced extreme racism where I live as a white person.</p>

<p>I definitely understand that it may not be on a level that minorities face, but it is still racism.</p>

<p>This generation is tied to tumblr beliefs.</p>

<p>Not going to waste my time arguing with another bigot obsessed with global cabals, just gonna say don&#39;t write posts like &quot;How do you deal with it?&quot; (referring to imaginary Jews controlling your education etc), when it&#39;s so obvious why no one listens to you.  You may find an echo-chamber that makes you feel like your views are mainstream, but they&#39;re not. </p>

<p>&quot;I know Jews aren&#39;t the only ones behind it, but they ARE the mastermind&quot;- Seriously how can you believe that then wonder why you find yourself isolated. &quot;How do you deal knowing the truth&quot;--hate to break it to you but the truth is the vast majority don&#39;t share your knuckle-dragging delusions.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s the cowardly mainstream that gets my goat. It&#39;s people who make logical fallacies e.g. &quot;You&#39;re rascist so I can automatically discount anything you say about the Jews.&quot; <em>ad hominem</em>. It really doesn&#39;t matter how noble you think your actions might be.</p>

<p>Probably I could pile a laundry list of fallacies on your defense of Jews. Juadism is a religion not a race - false equivalence. Anti-semitism is a blatantly exceptionalist and probably a racist term. It doesn&#39;t even make sense considering who Semitic people actually are. These are things that make me salty. </p>

<p>Hidden agendas make me salty. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Are you seriously saying that only white people can be anti-semitic? That&#39;s just as retarded as saying black people can&#39;t be racist. Also you need to calm the fuck down, you are actually the epitome of PC culture. You froth at the mouth and resort to ad hominems when OP says anything you perceive to be unfavorable to your worldview. PC doesn&#39;t have to be mandated by law, it is the systematic overhaul through public brainwashing of how people think and react to opinions they disagree with. It&#39;s the precise reason why when people like Jordan Peterson get so fed up that they have to rant about how important free speech is to society on a college campus that others swarm around him and shriek &quot;You are perpetuating hate speech!&quot; simply because he has a history of opinions they disagree with. That is PC culture and that is why it is so scary because it isn&#39;t mandated by law and can be obfuscated by simply saying, &quot;You have free speech and so do I.&quot; But it isn&#39;t free when one side gangs up on the other to suppress theirs and refuses to listen and have civil discussion. It could also be called &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;, which is what our Founding Fathers feared.</p>

No I was saying the opposite if anything- &quot;You&#39;re not white but half your posts are about Jewish conspiracies&quot;; of course anyone of any race can hold whatever opinions they want. </p>

<p>&quot;You froth at the mouth and resort to ad hominems when OP says anything you perceive to be unfavorable to your worldview&quot;
Sorry but that&#39;s just not the case, everyone has different worldviews so we should focus on what we agree on not what we disagree. But when I read this (about Jewish people): &quot;It&#39;s such a shame Hitler was so close to humiliating them and making the world realize the parasites they truly are. &quot;It also makes you realize why they fear Nationalism so damn much, a healthy enough society would never tolerate them.&quot;- written recently by OP, you can&#39;t pretend that&#39;s just another opinion. I feel it&#39;s fair to vehemently disagree with supporting Hitler&#39;s agenda. Your response makes it sound like I was mad about an edgy joke or something.</p>

<p>IMO there&#39;s a fair discussion to be had about you call PC culture, but people who write that Jews are parasites, plotting against other races etc, are not contributing to the discussion. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not it at all. People form opinions of groups of other people based on life experiences. These experiences could be indirect, like how many parents think their kid will be molested by any unattractive man because this is enforced by the media.  If there is a group that commits a high amount of crime, it is perfectly logical to form a negative opinion of them.</p>

<p>Using the word &quot;racism&quot; to also cover logical behavior takes away from the meaning; just like &quot;raping with your eyes&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s not logical at all. You&#39;re saying if black people commit crimes at a higher rate, it&#39;s okay to be generally racist towards them.  You&#39;d probably expect to be judged as an individual, but can&#39;t be bothered to extend that to other humans. Maybe it&#39;s more that poor people tend to commit more crime, and people of color tend to be poorer because, you know, they used to be property and not allowed to have money? </p>

<p>By &#39;logic&#39; I think you just mean trying to think of ways to justify your outdated and oblivious ignorance</p>

<p>See, that&#39;s where I get frustrated with people that hold the opinion that you&#39;re espousing.  It&#39;s such a simple thing, but even you&#39;re not doing what any logic minded person should do when given that bit of information.  Basically, why don&#39;t you ask &quot;<strong>why?</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>Why do you just stop at &quot;Blacks commit more crime.&quot;?  Once you ask why, you start learning about economic status being the main indicator of someone being a criminal and the effects that Jim Crow had on the population and how their population feels the effects today, for example.  Just saying &quot;Blacks commit more crime&quot; and stopping there basically shows you have a child-like understanding of this subject.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an incredibly dense subject and I suggest you take the time to learn.  When I get home, I&#39;ll try and find some material if you&#39;re interested.  </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t too long ago that blacks and whites dating was considered degeneracy (or communism). I do, however, remember knowing all the lyrics to Sir Mix-a-lot&#39;s &quot;Baby Got Back&quot; when it came out in the 80s when I was attending Catholic grade school.</p>

<p>You&#39;re upset that I told you your religion and beliefs are idiotic and ass backwards... And now you&#39;re so butthurt you&#39;re pulling 4chan comments I made in a desperate attempt to ignore the fact that you are feeding your kids anti gay ideologiesâ. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t even stomach that literally every comment you posted has negative karma and that you&#39;re finally realizing you&#39;re in the minority. </p>

<p>Keep trying to pull from my comment history I have plenty more of fucked up 4chan comments, if you had the brain power to go to the sub and read for maybe more than 3 minutes then maybe you&#39;d understand the sub. </p>

<p>The fact that you are a parent really worries me :( poor kids</p>

That fact that you have to pull from my history to insult me (on r/4chan of all things) is pretty sad considering you&#39;re probably in your 30&#39;s with 2 kids.

<p>on a separate note, I think America is great. My dad, a white male, was able to start a company and live the American dream. My dad-in-law came from India, started a company and lives the American dream. I love talking to my immigrant in-law family. They all love America as much as I do and love how strong America is and love how she gave them all opportunities to start companies.</p>

<p>So my point being is that you think America is weakening and ruining and I think America is strong and vibrant and I don&#39;t think we&#39;re gunna get past that. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, here&#39;s why the waters are muddied.  Very often, people who discuss social issues should be saying &quot;institutional racism&quot; instead of &quot;racism&quot;.  White people can absolutely experience racism, but they&#39;re basically saying that white people can&#39;t experience institutional racism.</p>

<p>I think that an argument could be made that by passing laws to help other races get ahead, whites could inadvertently experience institutional racism.  That&#39;s certainly something that I&#39;d be wary of.  For the most part, however, I don&#39;t think that whites deal with institutional racism.</p>

Why is it uncalled for to bring up your kids (as if we know or care who they are) You have a problem with people you call degenetates. What if your  daughters turn out to be degenerates? Did you choose to be heterosexual and if so, why? Or were you born that way? Your daughters could be gay. Or is that something they can choose? Do you realize that is totally possible? How old are they? Do you have any gay friends? What if they aren&#39;t gay but end up liking black guys? Or are they never going to grow up because you&#39;re an unrealistic father. Does your wife know you spend all day and night on reddit? Why aren&#39;t you with your daughters right now? I honestly don&#39;t think you are in your moms basement. I would ask the same thing to your face if you are accusing me if not stating my views in public. I always tease new dads I meet and ask them if there&#39;s any sign if them being gay yet.

<p>True liberalism is saying that nobody should be ridiculed for a well reasoned opinion. Political correctness, the cancer on the nutsack of actual liberalism, say that any idea that the collective and engineered &#39;we&#39; doesn&#39;t agree with should be ridiculed.</p>

Yet when a black person calls his friend &#39;my nigger&#39; he&#39;s using it as term of endearment or he may just use the word as a neutral term for a guy. No-one would accuse him of racism. So why is it that I am breaking a PC taboo to even talk about the word? False equivalence. Because hostility is an attitude, a certain body language, an emotional state and it doesn&#39;t dissappear just because some word or other was not uttered.</p>

<p>So to equivocally label a word as offensive cannot be supported with logic. Cuz logic is <em>the shit</em> don&#39;t you know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False equivalence is because that an instance of one thing is similar to an instance of another, when notable differences are present, that the same conclusion should apply to both. Your use of false equivalence is not only incorrect, it inadvertently relies on the fallacy of false equivalence by claiming race of the speaker had no bearing on the connotative use of a racially charged word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes false equivalence.  You&#39;re claiming that a word is the same as the emotion behind the word.  You&#39;re claiming the instance of the word as the emotion.  I just proved it to you I E context is everything.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re  being racist.  You&#39;re saying that the color of my skin determines what words I&#39;m allowed to say. </p>

<p>There&#39;s really nothing more to say to you, you&#39;re just biased person who hates white people.  And I have twice proven that you&#39;re wrong,  you&#39;ve lost I&#39;m sorry goodbye go away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol I tried to engage respectfully and this is the response. Really sad, I thought I had an intelligent respectful opponent for once. My mistake.</p>

<p>But since you seem to be taking this so personally let me continue to see  if you just can&#39;t help yourself and continue thrashing around:</p>

<p>-- I don&#39;t know the color of your skin. I didn&#39;t claim to. I really don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t know why you think I care so much, but you sure sound sensitive about it.</p>

<p>-- I didn&#39;t claim you weren&#39;t allowed to say anything, you carried that baggage to the party all on your own. You can choose to be offensive all you want as far as I&#39;m concerned. But as happens in life, I can&#39;t promise it won&#39;t be noticed. Sound unfair? I&#39;m sorry. Sounds rough man.</p>

<p>-- I never claimed that the hostility behind a word and the word itself are the same thing. I did claim that a racially charged connotation can be magnified by the person who says it in the minds of others depending on who says it. </p>

<p>Alright. Pissing contest over. Your blood pumping? Sorry, think of it as wrestling maybe, that&#39;s what I do. Here&#39;s some anecdotal stuff I just feel like sharing. If you want to continue respectfully feel free. If not, and still wanna keep punching and thrashing back, i can&#39;t stop you but I probably won&#39;t reply.</p>

<p>Begin non-combative anecdotal discussion if you&#39;re in the mood:</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Jew. When I say &quot;I&#39;m a Jew&quot; that has no negative connotations because historically Jews call each other Jews positively. If my dad calls me a Jew I&#39;m not offended. Same for my Jewish friends. But if a non Jew tells me &quot;You&#39;re a Jew&quot; that won&#39;t necessarily offend me, but it will give me pause. What did he mean? Non Jews have been known to use the term Jew itself in a derogatory way, something I&#39;ve personally experienced. Am I crazy for this line of thinking? Wouldn&#39;t it be crazy not to ask the question, particularly if I don&#39;t know the person very well and have heard the term used aggressively before towards me and know the same has been done to my ancestors?</p>

<p>The historical use of word is tied to not only definition but also connotation. </p>

<p>In the case of the word Jew the connotation is undeniably dependent on who uses it, just not to a tremendous degree because in recent memory the primary historically negative use of the word was mostly limited to one European countries during a particularly rough decade where it got a little confused and a lot aggro. Should Jews get over it? Should we just completely wipe the slate clean? Not completely, but over time we&#39;re getting there. Maybe in not to long everyone can call each other Jews casually and know it&#39;s being received admirably.</p>

<p>In the case of the N word, however were not talking some other country in Europe. We&#39;re also not talking about a decade or two. We&#39;re talking about 300 years in America. Generation after generation. I don&#39;t need to go on, you get my point. It&#39;s simply not reasonable to expect a group of people to forget something like that so fast.</p>

<p>Should Jews get over it? Should we just completely wipe the slate clean? Not completely, but over time we&#39;re getting there. Maybe in not to long everyone can call each other Jews casually and know it&#39;s being received admirably. Similarly, in time, maybe the N word will lose its meaning. But these things take not years but generations, centuries to heal. If that&#39;s too long for you and it&#39;s really a big bother I&#39;m not sure what to tell you other than... I&#39;m sorry you feel that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah well my grandparents fled Poland during the war. My grandfather is Jewish (or maybe <em>was</em>). </p>

<p>I&#39;m merely criticizing the logical basis for political correctness. It&#39;s not aimed at you per se. So it&#39;s a simple matter that if the foundations for your position are not solid, you&#39;re not going to have a desireable outcome. Banning language is nothing but a lite version of book burning in spirit and it&#39;s highly divisive.</p>

<p>I am not Jewish enough to identify that way but I definitely see something familiar in other Jewish people: a deep seated insecurity, covered over by hyper-intelectualism and a tendency to over-identify with one&#39;s perceived misfortune. In a certain perverse way, that you can probably understand, I celebrate all this.</p>

<p>The pain that you speak of is that I was once a progressive leftist but I now understand how accurate much of the criticism really is. As Morgan Freeman pointed out, if you want to heal racism then stop talking about it. Nobody is served by cultivating a victim mentality. It&#39;s tough to hear this when you assume the progressive agenda is right just because it is well meaning. I&#39;m much more of a cynical anarchist with odd libertarian leanings. I just can&#39;t see any future in any sort of interventionalism. There is a certain sadistic quality to radically uprooting your politics and realizing that your enemies actually do have a couple of very real points.</p>

<p>But really it works out better in the long run. People are too quick to join a variety of cults because they feel weak facing the world alone. However, embracing your own courage and doing things on your own terms is the only way to start identifying with humanity as it is, not as other. You are not really Jewish, you&#39;re really a human being (if that). You&#39;re not as exotic as some people, even other Jews would have you to believe. I&#39;m not suggesting to dishonor your ancestry, on the contrary. But it doesn&#39;t affect your humanity one way or another.</p>

<p>If this is going in a kind of spiritual direction that&#39;s entirely my intention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re just mischaracterizing my position. </p>

<p>I believe all drugs should be legal, all of them. I believe that good quality heroin should be available to the public as well as stigma free treatment and recovery. Do I believe people should do heroin? Absolutely not.</p>

<p>I believe in sexual acceptance but I do think sexual degeneracy exists and is a problem. Sexual degeneracy is a bigger problem today than bigotry. I don&#39;t believe in public displays of sexuality and lewdness. Promiscuity is a proveably bad idea but I don&#39;t believe in sexual repression.</p>

<p>This all probably far to subtle for ham fisted lug such as yourself, but I can tell by your username that your making an effort.</p>

<p>I would never just unleash heroin on a repressive moralistic society because that&#39;s an explosive combination. Likewise I would never promote sexual degeneracy on an uptight sexually repressive society. </p>

<p>Jesus christ the fearmongering is off the charts with you.

<p>So this whole thing has been you complaining about not being able to be an asshole to gay people in public.  That was the example you decided to use multiple times.

    <div class="md"><p>PC doesn&#39;t have to be mandated by law, it is the systematic overhaul through public brainwashing of how people think and react to opinions they disagree with. It&#39;s the precise reason why when people like Jordan Peterson get so fed up that they have to rant about how important free speech is to society on a college campus that others swarm around him and shriek &quot;You are perpetuating hate speech!&quot; simply because he has a history of opinions they disagree with. That is PC culture and that is why it is so scary because it isn&#39;t mandated by law and can be obfuscated by simply saying, &quot;You have free speech and so do I.&quot; But it isn&#39;t free when one side gangs up on the other to suppress theirs and refuses to listen and have civil discussion. It could also be called &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;, which is exactly what our Founding Fathers feared.</p>

If you recognize that we all have biases and you&#39;re able to recognize and correct cognitive dissonance, in an intellectually honest way, then you could work through being &quot;brainwashed&quot; if you really were.  All of us are prone to confirmation bias too, it&#39;s not something that Liberals or Conservatives exclusively experience, for example.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at is that through introspection and... just being honest with yourself and, most importantly, being consistent in your beliefs, then you can keep yourself in an intellectually honest place.  You won&#39;t always be successful immediately, but if you try to keep yourself honest then you&#39;ll eventually come around.  I believe that it&#39;s inevitable.</p>

<p>For example;  Wanting to use your free speech to openly criticize someone&#39;s lifestyle while complaining/disliking/(wanting others to be unable to critique) about the social backlash of others using their free speech to critique the original criticism shows an inconsistent/hypocritical belief in free speech. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the issue of using physical violence in response to someone exercising their right to free speech.  There are some who would enthusiastically agree with my first example yet they cheered &quot;bash the fascist (they also didn&#39;t recognize irony)&quot; as Richard Spencer (I think that was his name) was sucker punched and assaulted.  He holds some pretty disgusting ideas, but if you really believe in the idea of free speech then you should decry the act of violence perpetrated against him.</p>

<p>It seems like people just want to be assholes to other people who do something or espouse ideals that they disagree with.  I know that I&#39;m certainly guilty of this.  This turned into a bit of a jumbled mess as it&#39;s difficult for me to convey my thoughts about this.  It could be my lack of education in cognitive sciences, definitely.  I suppose I could&#39;ve been less verbose and just said &quot;remember the Golden Rule&quot;, but I hope it made a little sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s basically narcissism and sociopathy played out on a massive public scale. Read about how those personality disorders play out in romantic and familial relationships, there&#39;s the same dynamics. Sociopaths in movies are portrayed as Charles Manson or Patrick Batemen, but the more typical realistic picture is psychotic, abusive parents and boyfriends/girlfriends-from-hell. Manipulating and exploiting people through subtly indirect means: guilt, blame, and shame. Gas-lighting, disingenuous inconsistent hypocritical standards and reasoning.</p>

<p>Watch out, I can&#39;t give a source, but I&#39;ve heard Trump is feeding a backlash, he&#39;ll be used as an excuse to justify a wave of Soros-funded wave of &quot;feminist&quot; politicians that&#39;ll usher in more authoritarianism, that you won&#39;t be allowed to disagree with because &quot;my soggy knees&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like dealing with stereotypical in-laws, greek grandmothers, etc.: &quot;Eat everything I put on your plate or else you are ungrateful and bad!&quot; Note that this kind of narcissism is simply a shade of sociopathy, not much different.</p>

And in that case, the PC Police were used as pawns of the establishment to neutralize and disperse the activism from within.

<p>That&#39;s easy to do. But I would argue that American politics are unique and that there are many different cultural and technological influences on modern America so comparisons to 1940s political movements, while possible, is not useful. There&#39;s something greater at work here than can be covered by simply calling one part Nazis or the other party Communists. It&#39;s all smoke, friend. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to argue something like this for a while. The racists and antisemites love the anti-PC movement because it gives them reasonable arguments to support their racism. It&#39;s frustrating. When I try to call those people out for blatantly racist statements, they revert to calling their positions &quot;anti-PC&quot; or &quot;anti-identitarian&quot; or some other remarketed bullshit.</p>

<p>I will see people say shit like &quot;blacks are intellectually inferior to whites.&quot; When I say that&#39;s fucking racist, they call me a shill or a Communist or a PC Fascist or say I&#39;m indoctrinated. These people are so fucking dense. And I worry that this belligerent racist mindset is spreading widely and quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler&#39;s National Socialists, aka <em>Nationalsozialismus</em>, aka <em>Nazis</em>, labelled whole groups of people as &quot;sub-human&quot; based only on their ethnicity or their disability or their religion or their sexuality, proclaimed that those &quot;sub-human&quot; groups were &quot;holding humanity back&quot; from being a &quot;pure&quot; homogeneous race and were &quot;unworthy of life&quot;, and set out to destroy them. They slaughtered twelve million of people in pursuit of this perverse goal before they were stopped.</p>

<p>The idea that you can rank people in a hierarchy where some people are worth more than others is itself abhorrent. The Nazis took that idea to its worst possible conclusion. The reason the word &quot;Nazi&quot; is associated with absolute evil is because <em>they were</em>.</p>

<p>You know how actual National Socialism was different from the popular media depiction of it? Popular media tends to leave out the truly evil shit that was done by the Nazis. Makes it easier for the audiences to enjoy their movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Political Correctness&quot; is really of Communist origin. It was originally used extensively by the Soviet Union propaganda offices while enforced by the NKVD.</p>

<p>It basically means every speech that&#39;s outside the communist party-line&#39;s approved narrative is getting shut down, violently if necessary.</p>

<p>If you dissect the word &quot;Political&quot; and &quot;Correctness&quot; you will realize that &quot;Political&quot; refers to the current doctrine approved by the ruling party.</p>

<p>&quot;Correctness&quot; just means that it follows the directive by the ruling party, without <strong>any</strong> deviation.</p>

<p>The WW2 Nazi&#39;s used a term called &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;, not to be confused with the technical term &quot;phasing&quot;. It means that <strong>ALL</strong> media will only propagate one narrative approved by the Government.</p>

<p>You can see this happening in the USA today. All MSM is bascially the same voice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but global warming or anthropomorphic climate change, is very real. Come to the west if you don&#39;t&#39; believe it, there is plenty of evidence. </p>

<p>I could take you into a million acres of Ponderosa Pine, which have been destroyed in just the last 20 years from the Rocky Mountin Pine Bettle. I can show you retreating glaciers, and temperature spikes that have never been recorded, not to mention carbon dating which backs up these global temp anomalies. </p>

<p>Maybe your sis dove head first into the other side of weird college stuff, but it sounds like she educated herself on climate change, and I would suggest most skeptics (I used to be one) go visit the world that is being impacted daily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no such thing as &quot;settled science.&quot; That&#39;s just a term people  who have biases throw around to dismiss the scientific method. Gravity is still being studied... </p>

<p>First off, I used to be a skeptic myself, but I live, work, and play in the Rocky Mountains, and what&#39;s happening here is no joke.</p>

<p>Are you saying that global pollution isn&#39;t a problem? Because global pollution is exactly what climate change is about. It&#39;s a big problem if you live in a valley-city in the west, or if you live in the west in general. </p>

<p>Lost snowpack, leads to less water overall, and since the Rocky mountains supply most of the drinking water in the west, it&#39;s actually a huge deal out here. Lost snowpack is due to rising temps (now multiple record breaking years in a row). Not to mention drought conditions, which have been amplifying for decades in the west. Of course all of this is available to read and learn about, but you have to be willing to drop the bias.</p>

<p>Many, many people advocate for clean energey R&amp;D. My state leads the country in it. Doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s a solution, as fracking operations still dot the landscape, contributing to poisoned water, and degradation of public lands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said a lot and didn&#39;t answer the heart of my point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying climate is changing on local or macro levels. That happened throughout Earth&#39;s history before man existed, let alone the industrial revolution.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that I remain unconvinced of human causes, and the severity of that contribution.</p>

<p>What percentage of climate change is attributable to man-made causes?</p>

<p>If it&#39;s clear that we&#39;re the cause, is it prudent to spend money on further research and modeling, or would it be wiser to immediately redirect that funding to clean energy R&amp;D?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you find it suspicious that the biggest proponents of the climate change alarmism stand to make huge profits from continued research and proposed solutions (carbon tax schemes), while simultaneously it would be unprofitable for them if that money were redirected to energy research?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cause is very clear to 98% of the scientific community. It&#39;s also pretty basic in theory, that if you continue releasing toxins into the atmosphere, the planet will suffer. Same as a human suffers when inhaling carbon monoxide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Multiculturalism&#39; is a word that gets used multiple ways.  This is probably why there is so much confusion surrounding it. </p>

<p>It can mean &#39;appreciating other cultures besides your own&#39;.</p>

<p>But it can also mean &#39;tearing down any distinctives between cultures and pretending they don&#39;t exist.&#39; Or, &#39;homogenizing people into one monoculture.&#39;</p>

<p>I believe that was what the writer was objecting to was the second sense.  </p>

<p>Because most people accept people from other cultures.</p>

<p>What some don&#39;t accept is the idea that all cultures must be merged into some kind of &#39;monoculture&#39; whereby all cultural distinctives or uniqueness are washed away.</p>

I&#39;ve found, however, that people just want the right to say whatever they want, but they don&#39;t want to experience any adverse consequences such as social backlash.

    <div class="md"><p>Political correctness is the way to shut people with a different view on a topic off.</p>

<p>This works by making unsane claims against sane points and undermining every discussion by claming unjustice.
Even when it does not have anything to to with the original topic and sometimes their claims are not even remotely logical or rational.</p>

<p>This way it is easy to demonise other views becouse the oppsosites are shutting up becouse they are not able to swimm against all the bs. and they don&#39;t wan&#39;t a false &quot;stamp&quot;on them.</p>

<p>This way the opposition is crushed and reality goos out the door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think PC culture is unique to any particular ideology, it&#39;s just that liberal PC culture is perhaps more dominant in the media these days.  In the past the religious right were very much engaged in the practice of censoring media of words and thoughts that they deemed dangerous to society.  The religious right is why we have obscene words censored from television.  They continue to fight the normalization of LGBT people in the media.  For example Mark Dice when apeshit when Dove soap company dared to feature one trans couple in their ads. </p>

<p>They are also the reason many books have been banned and continue to be banned from public libraries and schools.  Harry Potter was recently the most banned book for like a decade because the religious right felt that it promoted Satanic values.  They frequently organize to ban books that discuss homosexuality.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can someone give me a definition and an example of what they believe to be political correctness?</p>

<p>I think the term gets confused and abused. Take black folks for example. It&#39;s not okay nor is it politically correct for white people to call a black people niggers. On the other hand, it is correct to call them African American, even though they are probably not actually from Africa. In this case, black seems a perfectly descriptive and neutral term.</p>

<p>Or take people with disabilities. The politically correct terms &quot;physically challenged&quot; or &quot;differently able&quot; are just absurd attempts to change the way nondisabled people think about disabled people. If I say that someone with crippled legs has a disability, I&#39;m not subjugating them and oppressing them, I&#39;m merely pointing out a fact. Because I use the world disabled does not mean I am going to beat and ridicule the person. I can tell the truth about their disability and still respect the person and treat them with dignity and kindness. There&#39;s no need to change the language I use to describe them.</p>

<p>Another example is post traumatic stress disorder. This is the politically correct term for someone who has had to see or do some fucked up shit. If a soldier in Afghanistan shoots 10 children under the orders of his commander and then develops problems reintegrating into civilian life, he isn&#39;t suffering from a disorder. He has done some terrible shit and can&#39;t reconcile that version of himself with the current civilian version. His mind and soul are fucked, but we have to say he has a &quot;stress disorder.&quot;</p>

<p>The solution I see to these examples of political correctness is to just unashamedly tell the truth. Say &quot;black people&quot; and &quot;disabled people,&quot; but treat those people with respect and dignity. Don&#39;t use the PC language, but still treat people the way the deserve to be treated.</p>

<p>What am I missing about political correctness that you all are arguing against here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the whole I agree with you. Whatever words you&#39;re using, treat people with respect and dignity. Treat them as your equal. Listen, engage, aide. At it&#39;s root, political correctness is supposed to be about that; talking about and treating your fellow like he is your fellow man. Some ridiculous extreme examples come out of it but the answer to that isn&#39;t to shut down the whole thing entirely.</p>

<p>The reason that OP <em>specifically</em> is railing against &quot;PC Culture&quot; is because he&#39;s a neo-Nazi who doesn&#39;t like that he can&#39;t spout hatred about Jewish people and self-fellate to Hitler&#39;s portrait in public, and unfortunately I suspect that a lot of the people coming to his defence either have the same views or are willing to look the other way if it means they can rail against their preferred minority target.</p>

<p>The only bone I have to pick with your comment is on the PTSD point. PTSD isn&#39;t just a disorder suffered by the armed forces, it&#39;s suffered by fire fighters and rape victims and others too. </p>

<p>You ever learn a new word, then start seeing that word everywhere? That&#39;s kind of how PTSD works. When you learn that new word the brain adapts it into your knowledge and will pick it out for you. With PTSD, the person goes through a traumatic event, their brain tries to adapt to recognise the danger to prevent it or react better to it next time. But because it was so traumatic the brain basically picks up anything similar to the original trauma and goes THAT&#39;S IT! THAT&#39;S IT! OVER THERE! SAME THING! PREPARE TO DEFEND! Their brain is now noticing all the things it used to discard because it learned this new trick. Normally that would be an okay thing but it interferes with the person&#39;s life so it gets classified as a disorder.</p>

<p>A soldier hears fireworks and their brain screams GUN FIRE GUN FIRE PREPARE FOR DEATH! A rape victim is grabbed without expecting it and their brain screams THEY&#39;RE GOING TO HOLD YOU DOWN PREPARE FOR RAPE! A fire fighter hears a baby crying and their brain screams THAT BABY IS DYING AND WILL BURN TO DEATH!</p>

<p>I understand why you have trouble feeling sympathy for a soldier who did a terrible thing &quot;under orders&quot;. But I hope you reconsider your view of PTSD as a disorder given that so many of the people who suffer it were the victims, not the perpetrators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comment about PTSD was referencing a George Carlin bit about political correctness. I did not mean to discount the seriousness of the conditions. I intended to criticize the language we use to describe the condition. Carlin says that PTSD used to be called &quot;shell shock,&quot; a term which more closely represents what and why the condition is. He says  that calling it PTSD instead is an attempt to dilute the seriousness and origins of the condition. </p>

We can&#39;t say there isn&#39;t opression, opression is very real and deadly to minorities, but leftists are more worried about making those minorities join their own movement and their own pursue of power instead of actually wanting to make a change because they truly care.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that here are three separate phenomenons intertwined together to create the current mess.</p>

<p>a) Communism- This has accelerated due to the orchestrated economic crash, rising student loans, lowering quality employment etc. The desire to have EVERYTHING as free will be high if EVERYTHING is hard to get. </p>

<p>b) Identity politics : This is a long term political tool for divide and conquer. Inherently people know that everything cannot be free, so they make groups among similar people to maintain better control for the resources. Politicians and the bankers who control them understand this. So they control the major portion of the resources while distributing little bits to various identity groups. </p>

<p>A special note here- Resource can be materialistic or psychological</p>

<p>c) Boredom:  I think boredom has a big role to play in the current ultra SJW culture we find ourselves in. If you go to any third world country, there are enough real problem that people have no time for the SJW BS. 
Even in US, UK, France there is a big difference between what the urban centers think of as &quot;social problems&quot; and what the other places think of as &quot;social problems&quot;. The SJW &quot;ideas&quot; usually emerge from the upper liberal class. This is a classical example of a &quot;First world problem&quot; becoming a nuisance. Some people need other people to be in some kind of difficulty or problem so that they can &quot;help&quot; them.  In the absence of real issues, they have to pull up issues from thin air.  It is an attention problem multiplied by instant gratification in social media, campuses etc. </p>

<p>Combine all this and we result in the hailstorm we are in.</p>

<p>So this whole thing has been you complaining about not being able to be an asshole to gay people in public.  That was the example you decided to use multiple times.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Political Correctness&quot; is really of Communist origin. It was originally used extensively by the Soviet Union propaganda offices while enforced by the NKVD.</p>

<p>It basically means every speech that&#39;s outside the communist party-line&#39;s approved narrative is getting shut down, violently if necessary.</p>

<p>If you dissect the word &quot;Political&quot; and &quot;Correctness&quot; you will realize that &quot;Political&quot; refers to the current doctrine approved by the ruling party.</p>

<p>&quot;Correctness&quot; just means that it follows the directive by the ruling party, without <strong>any</strong> deviation.</p>

<p>The WW2 Nazi&#39;s used a term called &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;, not to be confused with the technical term &quot;phasing&quot;. It means that <strong>ALL</strong> media will only propagate one narrative approved by the Government.</p>

<p>You can see this happening in the USA today. All MSM is bascially the same voice.</p>

<p>I believe in sexual acceptance but I do think sexual degeneracy exists and is a problem. Sexual degeneracy is a bigger problem today than bigotry.

<p>This all probably far to subtle for ham fisted lug such as yourself, but I can tell by your username that your making an effort.</p>

<p>I would never just unleash heroin on a repressive moralistic society because that&#39;s an explosive combination. Likewise I would never promote sexual degeneracy on an uptight sexually repressive society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... not really.  If you recognize that we all have biases and you&#39;re able to recognize and correct cognitive dissonance, in an intellectually honest way, then you could work through being &quot;brainwashed&quot; if you really were.  All of us are prone to confirmation bias too, it&#39;s not something that Liberals or Conservatives exclusively experience, for example.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at is that through introspection and... just being honest with yourself and, most importantly, being consistent in your beliefs, then you can keep yourself in an intellectually honest place.  You won&#39;t always be successful immediately, but if you try to keep yourself honest then you&#39;ll eventually come around.  I believe that it&#39;s inevitable.</p>

<p>For example;  Wanting to use your free speech to openly criticize someone&#39;s lifestyle while complaining/disliking/(wanting others to be unable to critique) about the social backlash of others using their free speech to critique the original criticism shows an inconsistent/hypocritical belief in free speech. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the issue of using physical violence in response to someone exercising their right to free speech.  There are some who would enthusiastically agree with my first example yet they cheered &quot;bash the fascist (they also didn&#39;t recognize irony)&quot; as Richard Spencer (I think that was his name) was sucker punched and assaulted.  He holds some pretty disgusting ideas, but if you really believe in the idea of free speech then you should decry the act of violence perpetrated against him.</p>

<p>It seems like people just want to be assholes to other people who do something or espouse ideals that they disagree with.  I know that I&#39;m certainly guilty of this.  This turned into a bit of a jumbled mess as it&#39;s difficult for me to convey my thoughts about this.  It could be my lack of education in cognitive sciences, definitely.  I suppose I could&#39;ve been less verbose and just said &quot;remember the Golden Rule&quot;, but I hope it made a little sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You get really worked up over the fact that some people get upset when people are being assholes around them. It&#39;s not that they can&#39;t take hearing certain words, they just think certain things are ignorant to say, and shouldn&#39;t be said. If you want to say them fine, don&#39;t be surprised if certain people will call you ignorant.</p>
