       I'm from Venezuela so I've seen all the horrors of Communism before my eyes which the average person never gets to see in their life. But out of all the crazy shit they've designed, I've never seen something as dangerous and terrifying as PC culture. At first it doesn't seem like the big deal just something people use to try to avoid hurt other's feelings, but holy shit beyond the mask there is something much more disturbing, It's a very radical way of mind control

       not just that, It's also in a way cultural and political death. If you have any idea that isn't part of PC culture then it gives people the perfect excuse to ridicule you. It also makes people not think outside the box which leads to moral degeneracy. Since they control almost all banks they can also buy all politicians. So we are stuck with a mayority of people who are corrupt beyond any measure and follow PC as a way to get power over others and other part of the mayority who, while following PC out of honesty see people who think outside the box as scum either way. There's very few people who can see who is the real enemy.

       It is SO creepy to me how politically correct my students are...

       I also got extremely frustrated the other day, when I was told people cannot be racist toward white people. I have experienced extreme racism where I live as a white person.

       I definitely understand that it may not be on a level that minorities face, but it is still racism.

       Yeah you're not white but half your posts are about Jewish conspiracies and complaining that anti-antisemitism is seen as a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not going to waste my time arguing with another bigot obsessed with global cabals, just gonna say don't write posts like "How do you deal with it?" (referring to imaginary Jews controlling your education etc), when it's so obvious why no one listens to you.  You may find an echo-chamber that makes you feel like your views are mainstream, but they're not.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I know Jews aren't the only ones behind it, but they ARE the mastermind"- Seriously how can you believe that then wonder why you find yourself isolated. "How do you deal knowing the truth"--hate to break it to you but the truth is the vast majority don't share your knuckle-dragging delusions.

       I guess everyone gets salty about a few things. I get salty about people calling Jews an inferior race- not exaggerating, look at OP's submissions/comments.  Also salty about owls- why does everyone think they're so wise??

       I don't get salty over foolish opinions. So SJWs and bigots don't phase me. Perhaps it's like they are broken clocks and they are right twice a day. But they show courage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the cowardly mainstream that gets my goat. It's people who make logical fallacies e.g. "You're rascist so I can automatically discount anything you say about the Jews."
       <em>
        ad hominem
       </em>
       . It really doesn't matter how noble you think your actions might be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably I could pile a laundry list of fallacies on your defense of Jews. Juadism is a religion not a race - false equivalence. Anti-semitism is a blatantly exceptionalist and probably a racist term. It doesn't even make sense considering who Semitic people actually are. These are things that make me salty.

      <p>
       Hidden agendas make me salty.

       Are you seriously saying that only white people can be anti-semitic? That's just as retarded as saying black people can't be racist. Also you need to calm the fuck down, you are actually the epitome of PC culture. You froth at the mouth and resort to ad hominems when OP says anything you perceive to be unfavorable to your worldview. PC doesn't have to be mandated by law, it is the systematic overhaul through public brainwashing of how people think and react to opinions they disagree with. It's the precise reason why when people like Jordan Peterson get so fed up that they have to rant about how important free speech is to society on a college campus that others swarm around him and shriek "You are perpetuating hate speech!" simply because he has a history of opinions they disagree with. That is PC culture and that is why it is so scary because it isn't mandated by law and can be obfuscated by simply saying, "You have free speech and so do I." But it isn't free when one side gangs up on the other to suppress theirs and refuses to listen and have civil discussion. It could also be called "tyranny of the majority", which is what our Founding Fathers feared.

       "Are you seriously saying that only white people can be anti-semitic?"
No I was saying the opposite if anything- "You're not white but half your posts are about Jewish conspiracies"; of course anyone of any race can hold whatever opinions they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You froth at the mouth and resort to ad hominems when OP says anything you perceive to be unfavorable to your worldview"
Sorry but that's just not the case, everyone has different worldviews so we should focus on what we agree on not what we disagree. But when I read this (about Jewish people): "It's such a shame Hitler was so close to humiliating them and making the world realize the parasites they truly are. "It also makes you realize why they fear Nationalism so damn much, a healthy enough society would never tolerate them."- written recently by OP, you can't pretend that's just another opinion. I feel it's fair to vehemently disagree with supporting Hitler's agenda. Your response makes it sound like I was mad about an edgy joke or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO there's a fair discussion to be had about you call PC culture, but people who write that Jews are parasites, plotting against other races etc, are not contributing to the discussion.

       Yeah, I made a long and rambling post about this.  They're completely inconsistent in how they apply free speech.  They want to be able to criticize lifestyle choices and ideals that others espouse while being immune to people criticizing their speech.  One of these days they'll recognize how hypocritical it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't have quality discourse when accusing others of shilling and digging through their post history in order to discredit them instead of addressing the content of a post.  It's actively encouraged here.  Maybe they'll recognize this too.

       Racism is inherently tied to the defensive reaction of human nature to change. "You are different and that causes me discomfort and fear." This can be applied to more than just physical looks, as is stated above in OP's post. Hell, cavemen used to kill people with different color hair because it scared them.

       That's not it at all. People form opinions of groups of other people based on life experiences. These experiences could be indirect, like how many parents think their kid will be molested by any unattractive man because this is enforced by the media.  If there is a group that commits a high amount of crime, it is perfectly logical to form a negative opinion of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the word "racism" to also cover logical behavior takes away from the meaning; just like "raping with your eyes".

       that's not logical at all. You're saying if black people commit crimes at a higher rate, it's okay to be generally racist towards them.  You'd probably expect to be judged as an individual, but can't be bothered to extend that to other humans. Maybe it's more that poor people tend to commit more crime, and people of color tend to be poorer because, you know, they used to be property and not allowed to have money?

       No I was saying the opposite. Statistics can be misleading, and you should keep in mind when looking at them that they're a collection of individuals. You shouldn't think of people a certain way because you saw a poll about a group they belong to, just as you would hope that people see you as an individual as well rather than making assumptions.

       See, that's where I get frustrated with people that hold the opinion that you're espousing.  It's such a simple thing, but even you're not doing what any logic minded person should do when given that bit of information.  Basically, why don't you ask "
       <strong>
        why?
       </strong>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you just stop at "Blacks commit more crime."?  Once you ask why, you start learning about economic status being the main indicator of someone being a criminal and the effects that Jim Crow had on the population and how their population feels the effects today, for example.  Just saying "Blacks commit more crime" and stopping there basically shows you have a child-like understanding of this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an incredibly dense subject and I suggest you take the time to learn.  When I get home, I'll try and find some material if you're interested.

       You must not know anything about me, but I still don't see how your faith has anything to do with what you consider degeneracy.

      <p>
       It wasn't too long ago that blacks and whites dating was considered degeneracy (or communism). I do, however, remember knowing all the lyrics to Sir Mix-a-lot's "Baby Got Back" when it came out in the 80s when I was attending Catholic grade school.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess kids today knowing the lyrics to a remake of a song that kids knew the lyrics of 25 years ago doesn't really seem all that different.

Why do a ton of famous people have to push their politics and narritive in everything? I don't wanna here how your life sucks because you're rich as fuck and happen to come out your mom's pussy black. She shouldn't have fucked a nigger.

       Dude I get it, you're like the definition of pathetic, and that's okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're upset that I told you your religion and beliefs are idiotic and ass backwards... And now you're so butthurt you're pulling 4chan comments I made in a desperate attempt to ignore the fact that you are feeding your kids anti gay ideologies​.

       You can't even stomach that literally every comment you posted has negative karma and that you're finally realizing you're in the minority.

       Keep trying to pull from my comment history I have plenty more of fucked up 4chan comments, if you had the brain power to go to the sub and read for maybe more than 3 minutes then maybe you'd understand the sub.

       Bruh you really just don't understand the r/4chan rhetoric lol it's not difficult. That fact that you have to pull from my history to insult me (on r/4chan of all things) is pretty sad considering you're probably in your 30's with 2 kids. If you truly believe I even have a sister or that I'm some super KKK grand wizard than boy is the internet gonna be rough for you.

       Good on you man. There is a without a doubt an attack on Christianity in the west. You're not even supposed to talk about God because it might offend the poor wittle degenerate atheist's feelings.

      <p>
       Meanwhile they'll stick up for backwards ass Islam all day.

       Well, degenerates like OP have no morals and genuinely see no problem with little girls twerking, smoking weed, looking up to famous sluts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all part of the plan. The elites want to destroy our society by debasing and demoralizing everyone. OP is a good little sheep.

      <p>
       Like I said, just the act of mentioning you believe in Christianity is considered offensive to some people now. It's okay to be any other faith though.

       I'm not perfect, but no I'm not like most people in the USA. I think degeneracy is weakening and ruining our once strong country and it makes me sick to my stomach. Especially considering it's all part of the elites plan and the sheep keep falling for it.

       on a separate note, I think America is great. My dad, a white male, was able to start a company and live the American dream. My dad-in-law came from India, started a company and lives the American dream. I love talking to my immigrant in-law family. They all love America as much as I do and love how strong America is and love how she gave them all opportunities to start companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my point being is that you think America is weakening and ruining and I think America is strong and vibrant and I don't think we're gunna get past that.

       Yeah, here's why the waters are muddied.  Very often, people who discuss social issues should be saying "institutional racism" instead of "racism".  White people can absolutely experience racism, but they're basically saying that white people can't experience institutional racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that an argument could be made that by passing laws to help other races get ahead, whites could inadvertently experience institutional racism.  That's certainly something that I'd be wary of.  For the most part, however, I don't think that whites deal with institutional racism.

       It's bullshit. As a white person, I can barely utter the words 'black person' in public without feeling more than a little conspicuous. Yet 'white person' is bandied with abandon it seems, and worse.

       Many of the comments here are showing just how bad it's gotten.  I would bet most of the pro PC comments are from young people who don't really understand the social engineering that's occurring. Divide and conquer is the plan, and although PC culture speaks about inclusiveness and tolerance, it's actually extremely divisive

       It's scary because for things like Islamophobia, why would you not feel some form of fear considering how it has effected the places it is, with human rights violations and stuff. To deny criticism of it or any idea that truly deserves to be criticized, is tyranny of thought.

       You can always tell because they can't entertain any idea outside their programming, because to them you have to accept ideas to entertain ideas. It's really binary thinking. Then they have to humilate and demean those who pontificate any musings they don't like.

       Isn't it? The guy wants to talk about his daughters then avoid it when we ask how he will deal with them if they turn out to be "degenerates". Truly pathetic. Unless you're reffering to your attempt at making a point. If you're talking about me, then try to use more words if you aren't a vegetable. Timmy!

       Well you told me to go to hell (as if that were an actual place) so I figured you're unhappy with what Im daying. Why is it uncalled for to bring up your kids (as if we know or care who they are) You have a problem with people you call degenetates. What if your  daughters turn out to be degenerates? Did you choose to be heterosexual and if so, why? Or were you born that way? Your daughters could be gay. Or is that something they can choose? Do you realize that is totally possible? How old are they? Do you have any gay friends? What if they aren't gay but end up liking black guys? Or are they never going to grow up because you're an unrealistic father. Does your wife know you spend all day and night on reddit? Why aren't you with your daughters right now? I honestly don't think you are in your moms basement. I would ask the same thing to your face if you are accusing me if not stating my views in public. I always tease new dads I meet and ask them if there's any sign if them being gay yet. Are you gay?

       No, the whole point of the term 'politically correct' rather than 'correct' is that its obfuscating the truth for what is deemed politically acceptable to say rather than what is true. PC culture is about suppressing any ideas that are not currently en vogue, strangely enough that is the same political, social, and moral stance that the mainstream media takes...
      </p>
      <p>
       True liberalism is saying that nobody should be ridiculed for a well reasoned opinion. Political correctness, the cancer on the nutsack of actual liberalism, say that any idea that the collective and engineered 'we' doesn't agree with should be ridiculed.

       Right, getting offended then asking a group of people to persecute someone over being outraged is not PC. She clearly was so into being equal rights for females that she is willing to ostracize a man in public and call him out and say he doesn't represent her "race", or to use her words, colored people. That he didn't represent the struggle

       Either that or a bunch of grown men and women have turned the concept of "don't be a fucking dick to people who are different than you" into some global communist conspiracy, lol. Yes, we don't want you using racial slurs or screaming 'cunt faggot' because we want to control your thoughts and enslave you. That must be it.

       I was ranting to my mom about how ridiculous cultural appropriation is the other night and she pointed out that it's an obvious manipulation to isolate white people and make them too afraid to explore other cultures. It makes perfect sense, accusing white people of privilege all the time and racism if they celebrate holidays from other countries, it's the perfect way to make sure we stay in our little white bubble.

       Safe spaces don't exist, you can be tortured remotely in your own home via satellite. I just understand that if you use FORCE against people who disagree with you, you better know the laws of Physics that apply to society too: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

       Antifa is driving reasonable people into the arms of the KKK. Muslim rapists and their apologists are creating a reactive force that will make Hitler look like a pussy.

       The right wing says it's against political correctness, but what they really want is the ability to say what they think without being ridiculed by other people. When people call you a fucking moron for using racial slurs, or fire you, or just don't want to to be friends with you... That's not an infringement of free speech, that's the literal definition of free speech.

       But you are allowed to say that transsexuality is a mental illness. Nobody is coming to arrest you see? You literally said it and that's fine. Now granted, I'm assuming you don't have the medical qualifications to make that diagnosis, so you are making it based on your "feelings". But still, you aren't arrested, and are allowed to have that opinion. See how you still haven't been arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you cannot expect though, is that people can't treat you differently because of these thoughts and feelings. They can hate you, think you are a wanker, idiot, fool, or even downvote you. You don't get protection from that.

       You just called transexuals mentally ill. no one is going to arrest or fine you. People at the very worst will call you a bigot, a moron or perhaps say
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are mentally ill, which seems fair enough. Don't dish out what you can't take.

       It's a fallacy to think that banning words and facts is a cure for hostility. It's a vast overreach. Being anti-PC doesn't make you a bigot or whatever. I cannot stress enough that this is a logical fallacy.

       Equivocating hostility with a word on the banned list. So let's take the word nigger since we apparently still have freedom speech. It's certainly one of the most taboo words we have today and is viewed as offensive and rascist. Yet when a black person calls his friend 'my nigger' he's using it as term of endearment or he may just use the word as a neutral term for a guy. No-one would accuse him of racism. So why is it that I am breaking a PC taboo to even talk about the word? False equivalence. Because hostility is an attitude, a certain body language, an emotional state and it doesn't dissappear just because some word or other was not uttered.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to equivocally label a word as offensive cannot be supported with logic. Cuz logic is
       <em>
        the shit
       </em>
       don't you know?

       False equivalence is because that an instance of one thing is similar to an instance of another, when notable differences are present, that the same conclusion should apply to both. Your use of false equivalence is not only incorrect, it inadvertently relies on the fallacy of false equivalence by claiming race of the speaker had no bearing on the connotative use of a racially charged word.

       lol I tried to engage respectfully and this is the response. Really sad, I thought I had an intelligent respectful opponent for once. My mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since you seem to be taking this so personally let me continue to see  if you just can't help yourself and continue thrashing around:
      </p>
      <p>
       -- I don't know the color of your skin. I didn't claim to. I really don't care. I don't know why you think I care so much, but you sure sound sensitive about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       -- I didn't claim you weren't allowed to say anything, you carried that baggage to the party all on your own. You can choose to be offensive all you want as far as I'm concerned. But as happens in life, I can't promise it won't be noticed. Sound unfair? I'm sorry. Sounds rough man.
      </p>
      <p>
       -- I never claimed that the hostility behind a word and the word itself are the same thing. I did claim that a racially charged connotation can be magnified by the person who says it in the minds of others depending on who says it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alright. Pissing contest over. Your blood pumping? Sorry, think of it as wrestling maybe, that's what I do. Here's some anecdotal stuff I just feel like sharing. If you want to continue respectfully feel free. If not, and still wanna keep punching and thrashing back, i can't stop you but I probably won't reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Begin non-combative anecdotal discussion if you're in the mood:
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a Jew. When I say "I'm a Jew" that has no negative connotations because historically Jews call each other Jews positively. If my dad calls me a Jew I'm not offended. Same for my Jewish friends. But if a non Jew tells me "You're a Jew" that won't necessarily offend me, but it will give me pause. What did he mean? Non Jews have been known to use the term Jew itself in a derogatory way, something I've personally experienced. Am I crazy for this line of thinking? Wouldn't it be crazy not to ask the question, particularly if I don't know the person very well and have heard the term used aggressively before towards me and know the same has been done to my ancestors?
      </p>
      <p>
       The historical use of word is tied to not only definition but also connotation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the word Jew the connotation is undeniably dependent on who uses it, just not to a tremendous degree because in recent memory the primary historically negative use of the word was mostly limited to one European countries during a particularly rough decade where it got a little confused and a lot aggro. Should Jews get over it? Should we just completely wipe the slate clean? Not completely, but over time we're getting there. Maybe in not to long everyone can call each other Jews casually and know it's being received admirably.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the N word, however were not talking some other country in Europe. We're also not talking about a decade or two. We're talking about 300 years in America. Generation after generation. I don't need to go on, you get my point. It's simply not reasonable to expect a group of people to forget something like that so fast.

       Should Jews get over it? Should we just completely wipe the slate clean? Not completely, but over time we're getting there. Maybe in not to long everyone can call each other Jews casually and know it's being received admirably. Similarly, in time, maybe the N word will lose its meaning. But these things take not years but generations, centuries to heal. If that's too long for you and it's really a big bother I'm not sure what to tell you other than... I'm sorry you feel that way.

       Ah well my grandparents fled Poland during the war. My grandfather is Jewish (or maybe
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       ).
      </p>

       I'm merely criticizing the logical basis for political correctness. It's not aimed at you per se. So it's a simple matter that if the foundations for your position are not solid, you're not going to have a desireable outcome. Banning language is nothing but a lite version of book burning in spirit and it's highly divisive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not Jewish enough to identify that way but I definitely see something familiar in other Jewish people: a deep seated insecurity, covered over by hyper-intelectualism and a tendency to over-identify with one's perceived misfortune. In a certain perverse way, that you can probably understand, I celebrate all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pain that you speak of is that I was once a progressive leftist but I now understand how accurate much of the criticism really is. As Morgan Freeman pointed out, if you want to heal racism then stop talking about it. Nobody is served by cultivating a victim mentality. It's tough to hear this when you assume the progressive agenda is right just because it is well meaning. I'm much more of a cynical anarchist with odd libertarian leanings. I just can't see any future in any sort of interventionalism. There is a certain sadistic quality to radically uprooting your politics and realizing that your enemies actually do have a couple of very real points.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really it works out better in the long run. People are too quick to join a variety of cults because they feel weak facing the world alone. However, embracing your own courage and doing things on your own terms is the only way to start identifying with humanity as it is, not as other. You are not really Jewish, you're really a human being (if that). You're not as exotic as some people, even other Jews would have you to believe. I'm not suggesting to dishonor your ancestry, on the contrary. But it doesn't affect your humanity one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is going in a kind of spiritual direction that's entirely my intention.

       Now there's the reply I was I hoping for. I think the thing you and I most agree on is the inherent decency with which we should treat each other. Ironically, how we extrapolate the means to that end is where we differ, as so often is the case.

       Conservative forums apply the principle that results from this complaint against PC culture, selective censorship of ideas they don't agree with. They want an imbalanced relationship with other groups. They want to feel safe and respected while they make others feel unsafe and disrespected.

       Stop distracting from the point while ignoring its actual meaning. The point is that it is a form of thought control to make people think and act within certain lines. If they are outside of that society will reject them or embarrass them into falling in line and people are even encouraged to do so. Someone not being PC isn't part of some movement to condition what others think they are allowed to do or think, they are just being themselves and acting how they see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about being offended by their "ridicule". It's about being alarmed that people are being pushed to only think a certain way through manufactured social construct. Thus there is no contradiction or hypocrisy.

       They want a social safe place, where they can feel comfortable speaking their minds without repercussions so they can condemn other groups, seeking to remove their safe places, where they can feel comfortable speaking their minds without repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't understand that they are getting what they ask for in balance. They can speak their minds already. They just get condemned and have their social safe places removed for seeking to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to call people detestable things and marginalize them, without being called detestable things and being marginalized. It's a new high water mark for hypocrisy. They think people will agree with them more if they speak, but people do hear them occasionally and agree with them even less because of their hypocrisy.

       I think he means that just being "un-pc" is grounds enough to be ridiculed rather than the actuall ideas or thoughts being ridiculed for their content.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: being called racist for not supporting one of Obama's policys. Rather than discussing/ debating why someone disagrees with the policy a person would pull the race card as a way to dismiss the idea entirely. Same with something that's not PC, it can just be dismissed/ ridiculed without actually being addressed.

       You mean for Christ.  What you really mean is you aren't a Christian, you're a bully who wants to act like he's got some moral superiority.  You're an embarrassment to all good Christians and you should really hope there isn't a Christian god because he's not going to be happy about all this bullshit you're trying to pull in his name.

       You're just mischaracterizing my position.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe all drugs should be legal, all of them. I believe that good quality heroin should be available to the public as well as stigma free treatment and recovery. Do I believe people should do heroin? Absolutely not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in sexual acceptance but I do think sexual degeneracy exists and is a problem. Sexual degeneracy is a bigger problem today than bigotry. I don't believe in public displays of sexuality and lewdness. Promiscuity is a proveably bad idea but I don't believe in sexual repression.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all probably far to subtle for ham fisted lug such as yourself, but I can tell by your username that your making an effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would never just unleash heroin on a repressive moralistic society because that's an explosive combination. Likewise I would never promote sexual degeneracy on an uptight sexually repressive society.

       You're complaining that you can't disagree with two people being gay.  Except no one is stopping you from disagreeing with two people being gay.  What are you even complaining about?  You just saw this as an opportunity to cry about gay people and decided you wanted in despite not understanding what this conversation was about in the first place.

       So clearly I was spot on in my last post, you refuse to even answer my question.  It's sad that homophobes are so bent out of shape about what other people are doing, despite it having no effect on them at all.  What a petty, authoritarian, small-minded way to live.  I suppose some people are just happy being tools in the effort to divide and control people, instead of just letting everyone live the only life they have in a way that makes them happy and doesn't hurt anyone.

       Are you going to go to jail for disagreeing with someone's decision to be gay?

       Jesus christ the fearmongering is off the charts with you.  I'm sure the president who made pc fearmongering a big part of his campaign can't wait to sign all those free-speech limiting laws passed by the republican held congress and upheld by the conservative leaning supreme court.  Get a fucking grip.

       no, thats not what I was complaining about. I was presenting a hypothetical.  I dont have a problem with gays, but I do with the gay agenda. I dont have a problem with other races, but I have issues with black lives matter, CAIR, the KKK, etc.  I dont like agenda pushing, especially when one doesnt seem to have the freedom to speak against it without being called, anti semitical, racist, or what hve you.

       So this whole thing has been you complaining about not being able to be an asshole to gay people in public.  That was the example you decided to use multiple times.  Maybe you wouldn't actually do that, but that's what you are arguing you should be allowed to do without any societal implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still haven't told me how many times you've been jailed for disagreeing with gay people.  Surely you're not just trying to fear-monger...

       PC doesn't have to be mandated by law, it is the systematic overhaul through public brainwashing of how people think and react to opinions they disagree with. It's the precise reason why when people like Jordan Peterson get so fed up that they have to rant about how important free speech is to society on a college campus that others swarm around him and shriek "You are perpetuating hate speech!" simply because he has a history of opinions they disagree with. That is PC culture and that is why it is so scary because it isn't mandated by law and can be obfuscated by simply saying, "You have free speech and so do I." But it isn't free when one side gangs up on the other to suppress theirs and refuses to listen and have civil discussion. It could also be called "tyranny of the majority", which is exactly what our Founding Fathers feared.

       Yes, but you'll be open to criticism too.. there is no morally incorrect thing to attribute to being gay. But "disagreeing with gay lifestyle" smacks of discrimination which is morally reprehensible. (I disagree with your gay lifestyle so I won't hire you/marry you/let you live across the street from my children...)
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I'm coveying the difference because it's one thing "anti pc" folks don't seem to get (about people scorning them for being essentially hateful.)

       it is not morally reprehensible to disagree with a homosexual lifestyle. your morals arent my morals. some will argue sex with 14-15 year olds would be morally ok, doesnt mean IM ok with it.

       Well... not really.  If you recognize that we all have biases and you're able to recognize and correct cognitive dissonance, in an intellectually honest way, then you could work through being "brainwashed" if you really were.  All of us are prone to confirmation bias too, it's not something that Liberals or Conservatives exclusively experience, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm getting at is that through introspection and... just being honest with yourself and, most importantly, being consistent in your beliefs, then you can keep yourself in an intellectually honest place.  You won't always be successful immediately, but if you try to keep yourself honest then you'll eventually come around.  I believe that it's inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example;  Wanting to use your free speech to openly criticize someone's lifestyle while complaining/disliking/(wanting others to be unable to critique) about the social backlash of others using their free speech to critique the original criticism shows an inconsistent/hypocritical belief in free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the issue of using physical violence in response to someone exercising their right to free speech.  There are some who would enthusiastically agree with my first example yet they cheered "bash the fascist (they also didn't recognize irony)" as Richard Spencer (I think that was his name) was sucker punched and assaulted.  He holds some pretty disgusting ideas, but if you really believe in the idea of free speech then you should decry the act of violence perpetrated against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like people just want to be assholes to other people who do something or espouse ideals that they disagree with.  I know that I'm certainly guilty of this.  This turned into a bit of a jumbled mess as it's difficult for me to convey my thoughts about this.  It could be my lack of education in cognitive sciences, definitely.  I suppose I could've been less verbose and just said "remember the Golden Rule", but I hope it made a little sense.

       It's basically narcissism and sociopathy played out on a massive public scale. Read about how those personality disorders play out in romantic and familial relationships, there's the same dynamics. Sociopaths in movies are portrayed as Charles Manson or Patrick Batemen, but the more typical realistic picture is psychotic, abusive parents and boyfriends/girlfriends-from-hell. Manipulating and exploiting people through subtly indirect means: guilt, blame, and shame. Gas-lighting, disingenuous inconsistent hypocritical standards and reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch out, I can't give a source, but I've heard Trump is feeding a backlash, he'll be used as an excuse to justify a wave of Soros-funded wave of "feminist" politicians that'll usher in more authoritarianism, that you won't be allowed to disagree with because "my soggy knees".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just like dealing with stereotypical in-laws, greek grandmothers, etc.: "Eat everything I put on your plate or else you are ungrateful and bad!" Note that this kind of narcissism is simply a shade of sociopathy, not much different.

       How fucking full of shit are you? We have an actual authoritarian in office firing the director of the FBI and ranting against the first amendment and you are more worried about a hypothetical authoritarian backlash against him? Jesus fucking christ you guys are brainwashed as fuck.

       The last time we had an uptick in Political Correctness, what else was going on at the same time? Occupy Wall Street. And in that case, the PC Police were used as pawns of the establishment to neutralize and disperse the activism from within. I think that Political Correctness is actually even more insidious than the OP thinks. They're infiltrators for the Bourgeois class who force their way into Radleft spaces and impose their consumerist, neoliberal/neocon nonsense on us.

       No, that doesn't excuse what Trump is doing, but I think I may actually prefer his brand of incompetent, bumbling, obvious evil to the actually rather competent, subtle evil of the Third Way democrats.

       Bannon read Kapital and Lenin biographies? I think not. I'll upload a picture of my library if you're interested. One of my favorite novels, or instruction book rather, is Che's Guerrilla Warfare. If you enjoy survival tactics it's a must read.

       I do not hide the fact that I'm a Leninist who accepts Republican points and other political ideologies such as native American tribalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       T_D allows Bernie Bros, communist, Hillary fans, and even north Korean sympathizers. I've seen them all, the only rule they must follow is accepting Republican opinions as being credible and trustworthy. Anyone who discredits a person's opinion based on their political party should be banned from a civil political discussion because neither person would have anything to gain or find inside into their perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no idea what you're talking about. T_D allows political disagreements as long as you stated that their point of view is valid. Which you refuse to do.

       There are millions of Trump voters who don't give a fuck about your supposed Leninist revisionist history, and who specifiaclly care about their manufacturing jobs, and healthcare. Of course, they were obviously misguided by Trump, and I feel bad for them.

       Of course. You missed my point that a desire to not have people shit on the floor of your temple doesn't mean you want them to shit their pants, or that you can't handle the smell.

       Not at all. Many members embrace Kekism, identify as Kekistani, and believe Pepe is a hypersigil that is the key to Meme Magic. Or at least they say they do.

       I agree, this is an absolutely retarded notion that not being an asshole is a conspiracy by the elite. Conservatives are the biggest fucking snowflakes around who get offended by everything. They even cry over what bathroom people use. Who gives a fuck? Just fuck off and live your own conservative fantasy lives worshipping mind reading energy beings who live in other dimensions.

       Communism brings violence? It's not like anyone has ever died under Capitalism right? Tell that to all of Latin America and the Middle East. The Elite are Conservatives running the banks and controlling the military industrial complex that keeps the world living in poverty. The elite are not left.

       Amen! PC culture is thought control. Ever notice how PC culture (like a college campus) only grows in an environment of censorship? PC culture falls apart under an open critique so that is why free speech is such a danger to it.

       Just a means for people to play at being the biggest victim and get special privileges over others (reverse favoritism, be it on race, sex or otherwise).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm against special treatment in general, preferring people to become the best they can be and treated on their own merits rather than be cast aside for the favor of others (even if such favor was to be in mine I felt it undermine the hard work and effort I put in to be where I am so far).

       That person isn't making any claims about American political parties. He's saying that political correctness isn't the same thing as not saying shitty things about people.

       Political correctness gets abused, and it's proponents do use it to stifle speech. However, as a society, it is not advantageous for people to walk around using racial slurs to attack people and supporting genocide.

       They're calling Americans neo Nazis for identify with political preference they disagree with. They're claiming that if you do not agree with them, then you are a racist Holocaust denier.

       PC culture has turned political conversations into shit throwing arguments. Democrats go insane when Republicans simply call out their ignorance of other political ideologies.

       He didn't say anything about Americans. He called the original poster a neo-Nazi, which I agree was likely too far.

      <p>
       But it's probably also too far to call PC supporters Communists. Stalinist Russia was responsible for the murder and incarceration of millions of people. I don't know that the PC folks have quite reached that mark yet.

       And the Nazis supported the working class and stoked racial fears in the populace. We can make comparisons of current American politics all day long. Republicans are Nazis and Democrats are Stalinists.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's easy to do. But I would argue that American politics are unique and that there are many different cultural and technological influences on modern America so comparisons to 1940s political movements, while possible, is not useful. There's something greater at work here than can be covered by simply calling one part Nazis or the other party Communists. It's all smoke, friend.

       I've been trying to argue something like this for a while. The racists and antisemites love the anti-PC movement because it gives them reasonable arguments to support their racism. It's frustrating. When I try to call those people out for blatantly racist statements, they revert to calling their positions "anti-PC" or "anti-identitarian" or some other remarketed bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will see people say shit like "blacks are intellectually inferior to whites." When I say that's fucking racist, they call me a shill or a Communist or a PC Fascist or say I'm indoctrinated. These people are so fucking dense. And I worry that this belligerent racist mindset is spreading widely and quickly.

       You're right, lots of people like to use the word "Nazi" for people they don't like. I think it makes it easier for actual neo-Nazis to slip under the radar. If I hadn't seen the guy's history I probably would have reacted the same way as you did.

       The word itself isn't so wrong. "Nazi" is the hollywood term that was given to germans in general during WWII and is almost equal to absolute evil. Actual, National Socialism was very different from the cartoon version and the people who follow it too.

       Hitler's National Socialists, aka

       <em>
        Nazis
       </em>
       , labelled whole groups of people as "sub-human" based only on their ethnicity or their disability or their religion or their sexuality, proclaimed that those "sub-human" groups were "holding humanity back" from being a "pure" homogeneous race and were "unworthy of life", and set out to destroy them. They slaughtered twelve million of people in pursuit of this perverse goal before they were stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that you can rank people in a hierarchy where some people are worth more than others is itself abhorrent. The Nazis took that idea to its worst possible conclusion. The reason the word "Nazi" is associated with absolute evil is because
       <em>
        they were
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how actual National Socialism was different from the popular media depiction of it? Popular media tends to leave out the truly evil shit that was done by the Nazis. Makes it easier for the audiences to enjoy their movie.

       I agree with you, political correctness is obscene, a degradation of humanity. It exists because the elite control the media, and they have used the media to condition the population of Western nations to accept a liberal fantasy narrative that we're all the same, and that if only we punish the evil white men everything will be fine in the world. It's a total lie, but because many people don't think for themselves, they accept it, and this allows political correctness, which is really liberal fascism, to thrive.

       "Political Correctness" is really of Communist origin. It was originally used extensively by the Soviet Union propaganda offices while enforced by the NKVD.
      </p>
      <p>
       It basically means every speech that's outside the communist party-line's approved narrative is getting shut down, violently if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dissect the word "Political" and "Correctness" you will realize that "Political" refers to the current doctrine approved by the ruling party.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Correctness" just means that it follows the directive by the ruling party, without
       <strong>
        any
       </strong>
       deviation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The WW2 Nazi's used a term called "Gleichschaltung", not to be confused with the technical term "phasing". It means that
       <strong>
        ALL
       </strong>
       media will only propagate one narrative approved by the Government.

       Sorry, but global warming or anthropomorphic climate change, is very real. Come to the west if you don't' believe it, there is plenty of evidence.

      <p>
       I could take you into a million acres of Ponderosa Pine, which have been destroyed in just the last 20 years from the Rocky Mountin Pine Bettle. I can show you retreating glaciers, and temperature spikes that have never been recorded, not to mention carbon dating which backs up these global temp anomalies.

       Maybe your sis dove head first into the other side of weird college stuff, but it sounds like she educated herself on climate change, and I would suggest most skeptics (I used to be one) go visit the world that is being impacted daily.

       If you believe it's real, you should advocate for the cessation of its study and the redirection of funding for clean energy R&amp;D. Win/win whether you're right or wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the science is settled, right?

       There's no such thing as "settled science." That's just a term people  who have biases throw around to dismiss the scientific method. Gravity is still being studied...
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, I used to be a skeptic myself, but I live, work, and play in the Rocky Mountains, and what's happening here is no joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you saying that global pollution isn't a problem? Because global pollution is exactly what climate change is about. It's a big problem if you live in a valley-city in the west, or if you live in the west in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lost snowpack, leads to less water overall, and since the Rocky mountains supply most of the drinking water in the west, it's actually a huge deal out here. Lost snowpack is due to rising temps (now multiple record breaking years in a row). Not to mention drought conditions, which have been amplifying for decades in the west. Of course all of this is available to read and learn about, but you have to be willing to drop the bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many, many people advocate for clean energey R&amp;D. My state leads the country in it. Doesn't mean that's a solution, as fracking operations still dot the landscape, contributing to poisoned water, and degradation of public lands.

       You said a lot and didn't answer the heart of my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not denying climate is changing on local or macro levels. That happened throughout Earth's history before man existed, let alone the industrial revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is that I remain unconvinced of human causes, and the severity of that contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       What percentage of climate change is attributable to man-made causes?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's clear that we're the cause, is it prudent to spend money on further research and modeling, or would it be wiser to immediately redirect that funding to clean energy R&amp;D?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you find it suspicious that the biggest proponents of the climate change alarmism stand to make huge profits from continued research and proposed solutions (carbon tax schemes), while simultaneously it would be unprofitable for them if that money were redirected to energy research?

       The cause is very clear to 98% of the scientific community. It's also pretty basic in theory, that if you continue releasing toxins into the atmosphere, the planet will suffer. Same as a human suffers when inhaling carbon monoxide.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it much more suspicious that the opponents of climate change have come out saying why they oppose it, and do not care that they are lying to you.

       Fixing it is no easy feat and its gonna require a hell of a lot more than one section of one country changing how they do things. Assuming it is man made( just for this example) then think of everything we would need to change. millions on millions of jobs would change and billions upon billions would be spent to change it.

       'Multiculturalism' is a word that gets used multiple ways.  This is probably why there is so much confusion surrounding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can mean 'appreciating other cultures besides your own'.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it can also mean 'tearing down any distinctives between cultures and pretending they don't exist.' Or, 'homogenizing people into one monoculture.'
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that was what the writer was objecting to was the second sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because most people accept people from other cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       What some don't accept is the idea that all cultures must be merged into some kind of 'monoculture' whereby all cultural distinctives or uniqueness are washed away.

       Yikes! I'm sorry to hear that. I had a friend who went to a historically extreme tiny liberal school in California. She came back completely wacko. I am a very open minded person who is willing to listen to and respect others opinions fully, even if I don't believe in/share the same opinions. But she was so PCed that she literally stopped making sense. It was shocking and scary.

       I remember just one of the new opinions she came home with that lacked common sense was believing so much in Abortion she actually believed every woman should be made to have one, and that perhaps all babies should be aborted. I mean, try wrapping your head around that. -_-

       Nope. Telling me I can't say certain words because it enrages a certain group (which 99.4% of the time is upper-middle class millennials who have no little to no association with the word in question) does absolutely nothing except facilitate the process of turning humanity into indistinguishable insects who are not allowed to veer of the path of acceptable thought. This is their end goal. This is Cultural Marxism.

       You get really worked up over the fact that some people get upset when people are being assholes around them. It's not that they can't take hearing certain words, they just think certain things are ignorant to say, and shouldn't be said. If you want to say them fine, don't be surprised if certain people will call you ignorant.

       Lol yeah, I totally go on long winded "social justice" rants. I'm just trying to say you come off like a bit of a dick when you talk like one, that's all political correctness is about. There isn't a secret police that literally arrests people for thought crimes in America, but if you publically behave like an asshole, and have any level of media exposure whatsoever, expect there to be some kind of backlash. people love to get upset over pointless shit. There is a reason why up until trump, being politically correct was done by the major players, they have pr firms and tons of data to back up why politicians do what they do.

       It's pretty sad that your opinion is so controversial.  I mean, like all things, some take it too far.  I've found, however, that people just want the right to say whatever they want, but they don't want to experience any adverse consequences such as social backlash.  Free speech doesn't and shouldn't work like that.

       Political correctness is the way to shut people with a different view on a topic off.
      </p>
      <p>
       This works by making unsane claims against sane points and undermining every discussion by claming unjustice.
Even when it does not have anything to to with the original topic and sometimes their claims are not even remotely logical or rational.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way it is easy to demonise other views becouse the oppsosites are shutting up becouse they are not able to swimm against all the bs. and they don't wan't a false "stamp"on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way the opposition is crushed and reality goos out the door.

       I don't think PC culture is unique to any particular ideology, it's just that liberal PC culture is perhaps more dominant in the media these days.  In the past the religious right were very much engaged in the practice of censoring media of words and thoughts that they deemed dangerous to society.  The religious right is why we have obscene words censored from television.  They continue to fight the normalization of LGBT people in the media.  For example Mark Dice when apeshit when Dove soap company dared to feature one trans couple in their ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also the reason many books have been banned and continue to be banned from public libraries and schools.  Harry Potter was recently the most banned book for like a decade because the religious right felt that it promoted Satanic values.  They frequently organize to ban books that discuss homosexuality.

       Can someone give me a definition and an example of what they believe to be political correctness?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the term gets confused and abused. Take black folks for example. It's not okay nor is it politically correct for white people to call a black people niggers. On the other hand, it is correct to call them African American, even though they are probably not actually from Africa. In this case, black seems a perfectly descriptive and neutral term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or take people with disabilities. The politically correct terms "physically challenged" or "differently able" are just absurd attempts to change the way nondisabled people think about disabled people. If I say that someone with crippled legs has a disability, I'm not subjugating them and oppressing them, I'm merely pointing out a fact. Because I use the world disabled does not mean I am going to beat and ridicule the person. I can tell the truth about their disability and still respect the person and treat them with dignity and kindness. There's no need to change the language I use to describe them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example is post traumatic stress disorder. This is the politically correct term for someone who has had to see or do some fucked up shit. If a soldier in Afghanistan shoots 10 children under the orders of his commander and then develops problems reintegrating into civilian life, he isn't suffering from a disorder. He has done some terrible shit and can't reconcile that version of himself with the current civilian version. His mind and soul are fucked, but we have to say he has a "stress disorder."
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution I see to these examples of political correctness is to just unashamedly tell the truth. Say "black people" and "disabled people," but treat those people with respect and dignity. Don't use the PC language, but still treat people the way the deserve to be treated.
      </p>
      <p>
       What am I missing about political correctness that you all are arguing against here?

       On the whole I agree with you. Whatever words you're using, treat people with respect and dignity. Treat them as your equal. Listen, engage, aide. At it's root, political correctness is supposed to be about that; talking about and treating your fellow like he is your fellow man. Some ridiculous extreme examples come out of it but the answer to that isn't to shut down the whole thing entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason that OP
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       is railing against "PC Culture" is because he's a neo-Nazi who doesn't like that he can't spout hatred about Jewish people and self-fellate to Hitler's portrait in public, and unfortunately I suspect that a lot of the people coming to his defence either have the same views or are willing to look the other way if it means they can rail against their preferred minority target.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only bone I have to pick with your comment is on the PTSD point. PTSD isn't just a disorder suffered by the armed forces, it's suffered by fire fighters and rape victims and others too.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ever learn a new word, then start seeing that word everywhere? That's kind of how PTSD works. When you learn that new word the brain adapts it into your knowledge and will pick it out for you. With PTSD, the person goes through a traumatic event, their brain tries to adapt to recognise the danger to prevent it or react better to it next time. But because it was so traumatic the brain basically picks up anything similar to the original trauma and goes THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! OVER THERE! SAME THING! PREPARE TO DEFEND! Their brain is now noticing all the things it used to discard because it learned this new trick. Normally that would be an okay thing but it interferes with the person's life so it gets classified as a disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       A soldier hears fireworks and their brain screams GUN FIRE GUN FIRE PREPARE FOR DEATH! A rape victim is grabbed without expecting it and their brain screams THEY'RE GOING TO HOLD YOU DOWN PREPARE FOR RAPE! A fire fighter hears a baby crying and their brain screams THAT BABY IS DYING AND WILL BURN TO DEATH!
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand why you have trouble feeling sympathy for a soldier who did a terrible thing "under orders". But I hope you reconsider your view of PTSD as a disorder given that so many of the people who suffer it were the victims, not the perpetrators.

       My comment about PTSD was referencing a George Carlin bit about political correctness. I did not mean to discount the seriousness of the conditions. I intended to criticize the language we use to describe the condition. Carlin says that PTSD used to be called "shell shock," a term which more closely represents what and why the condition is. He says  that calling it PTSD instead is an attempt to dilute the seriousness and origins of the condition.

       I just think that leftists are really becomming the 'boy who cried wolf'. Because they shout about opression where there is none and when there actually is opression no one will listen to them because they are so used to overreact. Honestly, I am transexual and I can't stand my own trans rights movement. We can't even have a real talk anymore. We can't say there isn't opression, opression is very real and deadly to minorities, but leftists are more worried about making those minorities join their own movement and their own pursue of power instead of actually wanting to make a change because they truly care. It's a battle of egos.

       Here's the thing about political correctness- it's basically people telling you you're being an asshole. You have the right to be an asshole, other people have the right to object to vocally object to that. Other people's free speech rights are not eclipsed by your desire to not feel butthurt about society's rejection of your reprehensible opinions. "Oh! I can't say the N word!" Yeah you can. It's legal. But don't expect other people not to judge you for it.

       I think that here are three separate phenomenons intertwined together to create the current mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       a) Communism- This has accelerated due to the orchestrated economic crash, rising student loans, lowering quality employment etc. The desire to have EVERYTHING as free will be high if EVERYTHING is hard to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       b) Identity politics : This is a long term political tool for divide and conquer. Inherently people know that everything cannot be free, so they make groups among similar people to maintain better control for the resources. Politicians and the bankers who control them understand this. So they control the major portion of the resources while distributing little bits to various identity groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       A special note here- Resource can be materialistic or psychological
      </p>
      <p>
       c) Boredom:  I think boredom has a big role to play in the current ultra SJW culture we find ourselves in. If you go to any third world country, there are enough real problem that people have no time for the SJW BS. 
Even in US, UK, France there is a big difference between what the urban centers think of as "social problems" and what the other places think of as "social problems". The SJW "ideas" usually emerge from the upper liberal class. This is a classical example of a "First world problem" becoming a nuisance. Some people need other people to be in some kind of difficulty or problem so that they can "help" them.  In the absence of real issues, they have to pull up issues from thin air.  It is an attention problem multiplied by instant gratification in social media, campuses etc.
      </p>
      <p>

       that must be really tough on you and the rest of the SS. how could we be so blind? It's too bad we destroyed the nazis you surely admire before they could stop the 'white genocide'. which totally exists. and doesn't make you sound like a lunatic.

       That's exactly what you were complaining about.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So this whole thing has been you complaining about not being able to be an asshole to gay people in public.  That was the example you decided to use multiple times.  Maybe you wouldn't actually do that, but that's what you are arguing you should be allowed to do without any societal implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still haven't told me how many times you've been jailed for disagreeing with gay people.  Surely you're not just trying to fear-monger...

       "Political Correctness" is really of Communist origin. It was originally used extensively by the Soviet Union propaganda offices while enforced by the NKVD.
      </p>
      <p>
       It basically means every speech that's outside the communist party-line's approved narrative is getting shut down, violently if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dissect the word "Political" and "Correctness" you will realize that "Political" refers to the current doctrine approved by the ruling party.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Correctness" just means that it follows the directive by the ruling party, without
       <strong>
        any
       </strong>
       deviation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The WW2 Nazi's used a term called "Gleichschaltung", not to be confused with the technical term "phasing". It means that
       <strong>
        ALL
       </strong>
       media will only propagate one narrative approved by the Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see this happening in the USA today. All MSM is bascially the same voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US. Government is successfully uniting Fascism and total Communism in one form.

      <p>
       But it's probably also too far to call PC supporters Communists. Stalinist Russia was responsible for the murder and incarceration of millions of people. I don't know that the PC folks have quite reached that mark yet.

       You're just mischaracterizing my position.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe all drugs should be legal, all of them. I believe that good quality heroin should be available to the public as well as stigma free treatment and recovery. Do I believe people should do heroin? Absolutely not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in sexual acceptance but I do think sexual degeneracy exists and is a problem. Sexual degeneracy is a bigger problem today than bigotry. I don't believe in public displays of sexuality and lewdness. Promiscuity is a proveably bad idea but I don't believe in sexual repression.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all probably far to subtle for ham fisted lug such as yourself, but I can tell by your username that your making an effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would never just unleash heroin on a repressive moralistic society because that's an explosive combination. Likewise I would never promote sexual degeneracy on an uptight sexually repressive society.

       Well... not really.  If you recognize that we all have biases and you're able to recognize and correct cognitive dissonance, in an intellectually honest way, then you could work through being "brainwashed" if you really were.  All of us are prone to confirmation bias too, it's not something that Liberals or Conservatives exclusively experience, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm getting at is that through introspection and... just being honest with yourself and, most importantly, being consistent in your beliefs, then you can keep yourself in an intellectually honest place.  You won't always be successful immediately, but if you try to keep yourself honest then you'll eventually come around.  I believe that it's inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example;  Wanting to use your free speech to openly criticize someone's lifestyle while complaining/disliking/(wanting others to be unable to critique) about the social backlash of others using their free speech to critique the original criticism shows an inconsistent/hypocritical belief in free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the issue of using physical violence in response to someone exercising their right to free speech.  There are some who would enthusiastically agree with my first example yet they cheered "bash the fascist (they also didn't recognize irony)" as Richard Spencer (I think that was his name) was sucker punched and assaulted.  He holds some pretty disgusting ideas, but if you really believe in the idea of free speech then you should decry the act of violence perpetrated against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like people just want to be assholes to other people who do something or espouse ideals that they disagree with.  I know that I'm certainly guilty of this.  This turned into a bit of a jumbled mess as it's difficult for me to convey my thoughts about this.  It could be my lack of education in cognitive sciences, definitely.  I suppose I could've been less verbose and just said "remember the Golden Rule", but I hope it made a little sense.

       Yeah, I made a long and rambling post about this.  They're completely inconsistent in how they apply free speech.  They want to be able to criticize lifestyle choices and ideals that others espouse while being immune to people criticizing their speech.  One of these days they'll recognize how hypocritical it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't have quality discourse when accusing others of shilling and digging through their post history in order to discredit them instead of addressing the content of a post.  It's actively encouraged here.  Maybe they'll recognize this too.

       You get really worked up over the fact that some people get upset when people are being assholes around them. It's not that they can't take hearing certain words, they just think certain things are ignorant to say, and shouldn't be said. If you want to say them fine, don't be surprised if certain people will call you ignorant.
