    <div class="md"><p>As a conservative that supports paul and works for mmj, i work for a grow. The dems did have 8 years and they didn&#39;t do fucking shit. You people failed and can&#39;t handle being called out on it. Failed at the one thing id hope barry would do right because of how much you liberals preach about freedom. I get it now, freedom from responsibility. The funniest bit ive learned from working in the industry. Its not full of these liberal hippies like the media points out. Why do you think the atf is against us? Everyone ive come in contact with through work labels themselves conservative or libertarian leaning conservative. None are down for this socialism &quot;share the wealth&quot; bs either. You know why? We all work our fucking asses off to provide an amazing fucking plant to the public. Im far from rich. When you get to smoke it its all good and dandy. But when it comes to fighting for it they sit on their asses and just complain. As someone who loves weed and treasures it. Any fucktard with half a brain could see the republicans going after weed. The dems who preach and preach in order to appear trendy to the youth failed us. You fucking cunts failed us. All bark no bite. Pussies. Oh and this is close to universal among people who actually work with the plants. You know work with them. Care for them grow them. Not some sorority twit who likes to get stoned and suck dick. Fucking a </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just mine. All the growers work their asses off. Its hilarious how many people who go to &quot;weed school&quot; or college thinking they are going to innovate the industry. They make it about 2 weeks after the point of them saying &quot;my fingers hurt&quot; then we get in some farm boy from the midwest and he has no problems mulching or hauling loads of coco and perlite.  The typical liberal college kid does not last in the industry unless its some cushy dispensary job. Which dont even get me started on those cunts.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, except Obama oversaw and tolerated the full legalization of cannabis in multiple states. He had the chance to set the new precedent or crack down, and he chose correctly. That was a huge shift, given the past decades of governmental reefer madness. What would have happened with Trump and co. in charge, if the blue states started legalizing under Sessions&#39; nose?</p>
