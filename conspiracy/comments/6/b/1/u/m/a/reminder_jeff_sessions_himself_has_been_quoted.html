Your god emperor Barry O has 8 years to do something but decided to attack whistleblowers exposing his unconstitutional crimes &amp; fund terrorism with his free time.

       This thread is still fucking stupid &amp; it doesnt make my original point any less true.  This isnt a fucking conspiracy.  Its a rant about the current administration full of circlejerkers who suddenly expect the republicans to change yheir stance on an issue that is a cause dems pretend yo care about but did nothing to change after 8 years in power.

       As a conservative that supports paul and works for mmj, i work for a grow. The dems did have 8 years and they didn't do fucking shit. You people failed and can't handle being called out on it. Failed at the one thing id hope barry would do right because of how much you liberals preach about freedom. I get it now, freedom from responsibility. The funniest bit ive learned from working in the industry. Its not full of these liberal hippies like the media points out. Why do you think the atf is against us? Everyone ive come in contact with through work labels themselves conservative or libertarian leaning conservative. None are down for this socialism "share the wealth" bs either. You know why? We all work our fucking asses off to provide an amazing fucking plant to the public. Im far from rich. When you get to smoke it its all good and dandy. But when it comes to fighting for it they sit on their asses and just complain. As someone who loves weed and treasures it. Any fucktard with half a brain could see the republicans going after weed. The dems who preach and preach in order to appear trendy to the youth failed us. You fucking cunts failed us. All bark no bite. Pussies. Oh and this is close to universal among people who actually work with the plants. You know work with them. Care for them grow them. Not some sorority twit who likes to get stoned and suck dick.

       Not just mine. All the growers work their asses off. Its hilarious how many people who go to "weed school" or college thinking they are going to innovate the industry. They make it about 2 weeks after the point of them saying "my fingers hurt" then we get in some farm boy from the midwest and he has no problems mulching or hauling loads of coco and perlite.  The typical liberal college kid does not last in the industry unless its some cushy dispensary job. Which dont even get me started on those cunts....

       It's the best nutrients you can buy hands down. The owners name is Scott he has a couple YouTubes where he breaks down the entire nutrient line. If you contact the company they will send you a sample box if you cover shipping cost.

       Yeah, except Obama oversaw and tolerated the full legalization of cannabis in multiple states. He had the chance to set the new precedent or crack down, and he chose correctly. That was a huge shift, given the past decades of governmental reefer madness. What would have happened with Trump and co. in charge, if the blue states started legalizing under Sessions' nose?

       yes, it has failed...that doesn't mean sessions isn't trying to keep it going or intensify it... whether he does or doesn't is to be seen, but just because the general public for the most part understands the war on drugs was a colossal failure doesn't mean the government will suddenly stop cracking down on drugs...

       The war on drugs has been functioning exactly as it was intended.

       The only part failing on the war on drugs is a few states legalized cannabis.

       sessions straight up said he would be prosecuting harshly the CARTELS that ship 100s or 1000s of pounds of marijuana and other drugs across the border, he said nothing about legal marijuana being grown distributed and sold in the US. people are making this a giant psyop against trump, like always

       Well... considering only a few months ago Sessions was spouting off about attacking medicinal/recreational states I think this is a logical fear. Sessions is a dirty slimy piece of trash, whether you support Trump or not you should still understand this.

       If Sessions does something about Pizzagate then I can accept some temporary regression on marijuana. Sometimes you need a hard ass who would slap cuffs on his grandma for jaywalking to have the balls to confront such a monstrous evil.

        Reminder

       Jeff Sessions has no authority to write laws. But it is his job and duty to enforce the existing laws. If you want to complain about the war on drug quit being an ignorant tool and complain about the law makers who actually effect and create the law.
