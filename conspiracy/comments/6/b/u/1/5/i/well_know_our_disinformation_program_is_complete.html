       I just want to put out a quote that really tells the tale of what's been happening lately. There's a nugget of truth in there and we have yet to find it. 
We as humans need to gather collective consciousness in a lens that can only include positive and loving visions. Until we see each other as brothers and sisters of the human race, we will suffer.

       I am the source for this quote, which was indeed said by CIA Director William Casey at an early February 1981 meeting of the newly elected President Reagan with his new cabinet secretaries to report to him on what they had learned about their agencies in the first couple of weeks of the administration. 
The meeting was in the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White House, not far from the Cabinet Room.  I was present at the meeting as Assistant to the chief domestic policy adviser to the President.  Casey       first told Reagan that he had been astonished to discover that over               80 percent of the 'intelligence' that the analysis side of the CIA produced was based on open public sources like newspapers and magazines. 
As he did to all the other secretaries of their departments and agencies, Reagan asked what he saw as his goal as director for the CIA, to which
he replied with this quote, which I recorded in my notes of the meeting
as he said it.  Shortly thereafter I told Senior White House correspondent Sarah McClendon, who was a close friend and colleague, who in turn made it public.  Barbara Honegger
