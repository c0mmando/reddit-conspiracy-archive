       Shareblue, CTR, whatever boogeyman you want to invoke clearly have no power here. 24% of the front-page posts are about Seth Rich's "murder".

       No evidence for it has been provided -- which should be fine for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       . But somehow no evidence being provided is always used here to dismiss the Trump-Russia claims..

       It's so annoying too...

       People think it'd "impossible" for the shills to pretend to be pro trumpers and sabotage this place with anti Hillary, anti bill nye, and pro conservative links...it just doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB are trying to take away our non partisan appeal. They are pushing us toward the side of the political spectrum that we naturally "lean", to make us look "fringe".

       We are waking too many damn people up and they need to put a stop to it somehow. This is their plan. And Jones did their bidding like a little puppet and led his followers towards republicanism...

       I'd say conspiracy theorists are more conservative (myself included). That word has become so perverted lately, but honestly is just means we want a smaller government.
      </p>
      <p>
       A smaller government would mean less power which would give them less control over us.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I agree when people say that, they don't mean what I have explained above

       Keep in mind the_donald uses a lot of bots to upvote their people and spam other subs/manipulate posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know they will fail most places (by votes or mods) so they pick friendly subs (they want to defend him more than just their sub).
      </p>
      <p>
       Critical thinking here is gone mostly. More than a few posts critical of their master trump have been flaired. This is their home away from home now. It isn't about conspiracies anymore (trump/russia as a current example) but about pushing hate/negative propaganda against hillary.

       That's all off of the top of my head and it's pretty clear why the left has been regarded as blind in this sub. We could go on and on about the GOP as well, Trumps our last shot at a new direction, if he fails, trust me we all fail. But atleast with trump we have a chance at righting the ship, everyone else is deep state shit heads.

       There's now way to think it wasn't forged when you watch the link provided above. It is, in 100% fact, a forged certificate that was presented and put on to the whitehouse website. It's. It an argument, it's is 100% confirmed.

       Im still looking for the email, I am saving this thread and will post when I find it. Here's this in the meantime that quotes Podesta saying that they need to create buzz around a trump/Putin "bromance".

       Also, just out of curiousity, how do you think Russia helped Trump? Do you think it was a hack? Because it wasn't a hack, it was a leak. So what exactly do you think Russia did to help trump? Did they give Hillary the questions to a debate before hand, because I remember that being Donna Brazile and Hillary cheating...

       ha ha ha this should be a memory card game. How many totally true, real and reported conspiracies can you name? The whole problem with the system the Deep State or whatever you call it is that conspiracies are too easy to do! Now there's so many we can't even name them all. Whatever changed in the past 70 years that made the creation of conspiracies reproduce exponentially should be stopped before there's no turning back.

       Media says that Russia hacked server.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only evidence of this is from Crowdstrike - a private company.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI asked DNC to hand over the hacked server multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC refused
      </p>
      <p>
       WikiLeaks who published the emails said it was not from a State ie Russia
      </p>
      <p>
       Seth Rich was shot twice in the back in a 'robbery' nothing stolen
Julian Assange hints that the leak was Seth Rich and offers a 25,000 dollar reward. (in total 105,000 reward ..silence)
      </p>
      <p>
       The US ambassador to UK claims Seth was leaker and gave Macfaden " WikiLeaks lawyer now dead"
Then we have semi confirmation that Seth had been in contact with WikiLeaks.
Media and politicians goes full spastic attacking trump.
If Seth Rich is the leaker the mainstream media are proven liars - and Russia story gone.
And lets remember at a time when Trump was considered no chance and also a time when Clinton emails say they were trying to elevate trump because he was an easy beat, the Russians hacked DNC emails and released to WikiLeaks.. Would make more sense if they wanted Bernie to win as it was before convention.

       Once I noticed Alex Jones slowly starting to lean towards more "conservative" ideals, this to me was a dead giveaway that someone was in his ear "forcing" him or assisting him in this merge/transition..

       Seth Rich's "murder"?  Why the quotes?  Do you doubt he was murdered?  I would love to hear your "theory" as to how he died if it was not murder.  I think you are the only "person" I have seen question that he was murdered.  Do you think he "committed suicide"  or is he still "alive"?  This may be a breakthrough OP!!

       Funny, my front page doesn't have any of those stories. Mind sharing a screenshot?
      </p>
      <p>
       To your question, I don't presume to know the answer but I'll offer one observation. Every time there's a troubling problem for the Trump organization, candidate or presidency, there's  an almost immediate release of a bombastic or otherwise headline grabbing story by them or those from their portion of the spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often they anchor the story on the non-alt media and then refer to it in their own stories as part of the pattern. Regardless it seems a standard behavior trait, almost like a tell that says something is bothering them. In this case there's a lot of buz about the possible repercussions of the compromised mossad asset and also the special prosecutor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they're linked? You decide.
