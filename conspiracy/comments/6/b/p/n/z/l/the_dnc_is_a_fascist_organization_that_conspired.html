    <div class="md"><p>Yes, 100% you are correct. The DNC and its supporters are true fascists in every sense. They are trying to unseat Donald Trump by undemocratic means at the top, and meanwhile at the bottom their brownshirt thugs are attacking people in the streets who wear Trump hats! In some parts of America people are actually afraid to admit that they support Trump, or that they voted Republican. This is insane. In America this should never have been allowed to happen.</p>

<p>We have been taken over by a liberal fascist-leftist (no, they are not antithetical to each other) soft coup that gained complete control over the mainstream media, the university and schools, the justice system, and much of the bureaucracy, including critical agencies such as the FBI, NSA and CIA. These fanatics are convinced that it is their right to rule America, and they were outraged when Trump was elected in place of their puppet, Hillary Clinton.</p>
