       The wall is a good point of exception worthy of an entire discussion.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Consider the difference in the way Donald Trump treats the wall versus the health care issue. He has been far more adamant when it comes down to real legislation on getting rid of Obamacare than building the wall. His Obamacare solution is a complete flip-flop on his campaign talk toward the establishment Republicans that he supposedly opposed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         By keeping "the wall" issue out there, the public is presented with a contrast that makes their usual agenda now the "moderate" alternative -- and therefore more palpable than it would be otherwise. This is a common trick. Republicans did the exact same thing with the Tea Party.  They are
         <em>
          moving the center
         </em>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If Donald Trump fails to get the wall, he ends up conveniently in alignment with establishment Republicans. The Wall becomes a political tool just like banning abortion. It never seems to get done, but it wins people over to support them.

       GOP corruption (or ineptitude, still not sure) can exist along side DNC corruption.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  But yeah, keep trying to silence any negative talk about one particular party, that isn't fascist or anything.

       Ya but they can only hate him a Little, Ryan would probably have lost his election if Trump was not on the ballot, and the same is true for other elected Republicans.   They might hate Trump, but Trump was their electoral magnet to make up any deficiencies in the very successful voter suppression.

       Yes, 100% you are correct. The DNC and its supporters are true fascists in every sense. They are trying to unseat Donald Trump by undemocratic means at the top, and meanwhile at the bottom their brownshirt thugs are attacking people in the streets who wear Trump hats! In some parts of America people are actually afraid to admit that they support Trump, or that they voted Republican. This is insane. In America this should never have been allowed to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been taken over by a liberal fascist-leftist (no, they are not antithetical to each other) soft coup that gained complete control over the mainstream media, the university and schools, the justice system, and much of the bureaucracy, including critical agencies such as the FBI, NSA and CIA. These fanatics are convinced that it is their right to rule America, and they were outraged when Trump was elected in place of their puppet, Hillary Clinton.

       Standard republican agenda like building a wall and stopping illegal immigration? Because what republican offered that besides trump? What establishment republican is supporting him on it now?

       The wall is a good point of exception worthy of an entire discussion.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Consider the difference in the way Donald Trump treats the wall versus the health care issue. He has been far more adamant when it comes down to real legislation on getting rid of Obamacare than building the wall. His Obamacare solution is a complete flip-flop on his campaign talk toward the establishment Republicans that he supposedly opposed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         By keeping "the wall" issue out there, the public is presented with a contrast that makes their usual agenda now the "moderate" alternative -- and therefore more palpable than it would be otherwise. This is a common trick. Republicans did the exact same thing with the Tea Party.  They are
         <em>
          moving the center
         </em>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If Donald Trump fails to get the wall, he ends up conveniently in alignment with establishment Republicans. The Wall becomes a political tool just like banning abortion. It never seems to get done, but it wins people over to support them.
