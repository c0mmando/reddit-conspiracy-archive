        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It makes no sense. Comey is a career prosecutor and was the head of the FBI. There is no person in the country who should be more aware of what constitutes obstruction of justice or an impeachable offense. And yet we&#39;re supposed to believe that Trump made a clearly criminal statement in private conversation with Comey back in February, and all Comey did was quietly record it in his files. If this conversation actually happened, and it&#39;s as big a deal as the media is trying to make it, shouldn&#39;t Comey have immediately gone to Congress, or at least opened up a serious investigation into the president? If he didn&#39;t, he&#39;d have to be dangerously incompetent and unfit to be head of the FBI. </p>

<p>Thus, either the conversation didn&#39;t happen the way it is being presented, or it&#39;s not actually that big of a deal, true or not. Either way, this is not something that will take Trump down, because if it was Comey wouldn&#39;t have been sitting on it since February. And it doesn&#39;t reflect well on Comey.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that the elites are colluding with Russia? That makes no sense. The elites were all in the tank for Hillary.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Obstruction of justice is a crime. If the head of the FBI has evidence that the president committed a crime, he wouldn&#39;t just sit on that info for three months and then casually have it leaked to the press through anonymous sources after he was fired, all the while allowing the president to govern as normal. He would pursue that angle IMMEDIATELY. There would be plenty of time afterward to continue other investigations. The fact that this didn&#39;t happen suggests that, like all the other Trump stories, this is a big nothing that is being hyped by the press. </p>

<p>Proof that you do not know what you&#39;re talking about. Stop fixating on Hillary. Conservative elites did not want her, though I&#39;m sure a few retired ones did (<em>CoughBushCough</em>). </p>

<p>Like I said, I don&#39;t know if you know how this works, but anything that could be grounds to remove a sitting POTUS does not get acted on &quot;immediately.&quot; The FBI is not impulsive. Those memos were likely intended as either a fail-safe, for when something like his firing inevitably happened, or as groundwork evidence in case of future obstruction. Every good player has a card up his sleeve. Don&#39;t you recognize 5D chess when you see it? </p>

<p>Exactly this. We (everyone, the media, readers, viewers, etc) need to stop jumping on &quot;anonymous&quot; and &quot;unverified&quot; reports, or at least call them out when we do see them. Until there is solid evidence or on-record confirmation, the media should not be saying <em>anything</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah Comey was unfit to run the FBI... He&#39;s probably the more capable man within the FBI since J. Hedgar Hoover but Trump dismissed him therefore Comey must be a terrible guy... right? </p>

<p>he led the prosecution of three men involved in one of the largest identity fraud cases in American history. He led the indictment of Adelphia Communications founder John Rigas for bank fraud. He also led the indictment against Martha Stewart, Samuel Waksal, Mark Rothko, Richard Serra, Roy Lichtenstein, Frank Quattrone and Willem de Kooning for frauds. </p>

<p>He disrupted the mass surveillance program of Bush (PRISM on steroids). Comey was one of the few members of the Bush administration who had tried to prevent or limit the use of torture. </p>

<p>Even Edward Snowden <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Snowden/status/862069019301601281">opposed the firing of Comey</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this guy was a hero, nothing would be further than the truth. However, he was a very capable FBI director and I would rather put my trust on him than any Trump proselyte submitted to his will.</p>

<p>But since Trump is a paladin devoted to the truth and none of his action shall be questioned, lets claim it&#39;s all a &quot;conspiracy against him&quot;. I&#39;m probably paid to say that btw. </p>
