        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know most regulars in r/conspiracy already know this, but we have a lot of new users in here and this needs to be discussed. Most of the powers that be are the large old money families from around the world. They control most of the important companies and news outlets in the world and also control the banks and markets.</p>

<p>Case in point, the 2008 Stock Market, most can recall only certain companies were allowed to survive and others were shunned and given no bailout money. Hank paulson came in and rammed down a 3 Trillion Dollar bailout down the throats of the american people, each day that passed when the banks didnt get bailed out, the stock market would drop 300 more points, or 500 more points, every day the bailout was pushed back the stock market always reacted with more extreme down days. So you can see, the powers that be can use the money and market leverage to get what they want from Washington, whether it is congress or the President, the power money families will use the market to get what they want. This is the next game to watch play out since certain sides of influence are not getting what they want out of the news outlets, they will have to step up their game and start putting pressure on the stock markets, not just in America, but stock markets around the world will be used to start a correction or downward move. Also, be aware, they will show charts they will stats that all point towards why this is happening, but you should all know, you can use charts and stats all day long to prove your point positive or negative and your side will always be right, little trick to watch out for. What you should watch out for is the market correlation to the Trump Presidency and the powers that be getting what they want.</p>

<p>But, if you think the huge money power houses around the world dont have an interest in what the President of the United States is doing, you need to rethink the world around you. Everything is controlled by about 100 or so large families around the world and they can get their way by tanking an economy or keeping an economy floating along (this is their final leverage).</p>

<p>Keep an eye on the Stock Market in the coming months and see how it correlates to getting Trump out of office or keeping him in office. If Trump doesnt play ball, watch the powers that be use the stock market to point to why Trump is not good for America (further increasing the what the polls will say about his presidency and increase how they persuade the masses to point to why he is not fit to be president), or if Trump plays ball with the Powers that Be, watch the stock market just keep a steady 2-3% rise until the 2020 election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump can be in bed with the establishment, AND have differences in policy at the same time.  Im not defending him, nor do I like him - but some people think that he &quot;isnt establishment because hes nationalist&quot; OR &quot;everything he does is a fraud&quot; - neither is necessarily true ; he can push a more nationalistic rulership, but at the same time, continue the suppression of technology (r/new_american_system), and maintain the perceived level of human freedom (which is still far below our true potential).</p>

<p>Does this make sense?  </p>

<p>I am agreeing with you, but also defending the OP post.  Trump probably knows the crash is coming; hard to say if he is playing a role going along with it, or if it is a genuine motherfuck-job; either way, i believe he supports the establishment, yet still his ego wants him to go down in history as a reasonable president - thats where the complexity of the situation comes in of being an establishment nuisance, i reckon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very nice comment, attack the poster. Here is an idea, how about you show some evidence on how Trump is just another puppet and show how he is in bed with the elites. I&#39;ll wait here while you show all of this. </p>

<p>As of now, with all of these people calling for impeachment, that does not seem like a person who is in bed with the elites and is just a puppet, if he was a puppet they would want him to be in office, not impeached out of office. </p>

<p>Ok, your turn to show me your theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up X22 report on youtube, whoever controls the crash controls the outcome.</p>

<p>Trump is trying to put set pieces of policy in place so that when the economy crashes it will brind down the federal reserve with it and the Cabal will no longer be able to use it as their personal piggy bank.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TPTB are extremely pissed at Trump because he totally destroyed their TPP, this would have crashed the economy also, but allowed the Federal Reserve to continue. Cheap foreign labour would have been able to flood into the US and only paid the same wages as their country of origin. E.G Chinese would be paid the same $250 per month that they would receive if they were working in China. This would have caused U.S. workers wages to shrink dramatically in response and destroyed the economy without affecting the Petrodolllar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that TPP has been killed, bilateral trade agreements are going to be negotiated by Trump&#39;s administration since trade will have to replace the failed US petrodollar. In order to survive the crash of the petrodollar we need to be energy independent and have no redtape to block the rise of US manufacturing needed to help recovery.</p>

<p>Now if you look at the content of the posts (which im guessing you did not judging by your lack of effort) you will see they are not about President Trump, they are about other people.
