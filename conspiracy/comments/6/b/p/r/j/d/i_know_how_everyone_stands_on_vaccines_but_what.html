<p>I&#39;m 49 and got allergy shots when I was younger. I never noticed a difference or that they actually helped me. (I think I only got them for a year, and around the age of 7 or 8).</p>

<p>I am interested to hear everyone&#39;s thoughts on this subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to call my Mom today and ask her. Never really talked about it, to be honest.</p>

<p>Yes, I know that they inject a little bit of what you are allergic to, to try and boost your immunity to it. But that seems a little scary to me and a little risky.</p>

<p>Also, I know that vaccines have a lot of bad stuff in them (preservatives).</p>

<p>I need to do some online research, I know that.</p>

<p>Just wanted to get everyone&#39;s opinion here too.</p>

<p>Of course, my son is 19. Even if I do not want the shots, he is an adult and can over-ride my decision.</p>

Something that was so rare I knew only one such sufferer, until about 2000,  but now have three in my extended family alone, full out Celiac&#39;s not just gluten sensitivity. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying vaccines caused my son&#39;s autism. I don&#39;t know what caused it. Honestly, I don&#39;t think it was one thing. I think it was a combination of things. But that is just my opinion.</p>

<p>We live in a part of the country where a lot of people suffer from allergies. To me personally it just seems like inconveniencing yourself every once in awhile just to still suffer from allergies. </p>

<p>Surprisingly, my younger son does not suffer from allergies. But my older son does.</p>

<p>Wish I knew you in January. I would have invited you to my home on January 20th. Here is a picture from that day. Had a small get-together to celebrate.</p>

<p>The rate of lung cancer in my area of VA is incredible, this has touched my family. (Healthy adult died of lung cancer, never smoked or drank and ate pretty healthy and was very active)I have looked into air quality issues and not only do we have big allergy problems, we have a massive air pollution problem and the area affected by high rates of lung cancer is surrounded by some of the biggest polluters. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbc12.com/story/32775684/top-cities-in-va-with-highest-toxic-air-emissions">http://www.nbc12.com/story/32775684/top-cities-in-va-with-highest-toxic-air-emissions</a></p>

<p>No surprise that the most toxic air has the highest cancer rate but I thought since you are from the area you may be interested if you weren&#39;t already aware.</p>
