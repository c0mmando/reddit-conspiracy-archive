        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Global warming has become a religion. This is the opinion of <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/07/07/deniers-in-their-midst-all-is-not-well-in-nobel-prize-land/">Nobel Prize Winning Physicist Dr. Ivar Giaever</a> , <a href="https://defyccc.com/category/richard-lindzen/">Prof. Richard Lindzen</a>, and many others. Climate change alarmism has a surprising number of attributes of a medieval or even ancient religion. Nevertheless, real religions have some pre-requisites, like a tradition spanning at least few generations. So the proper name for climate alarmism is a cult. And these are the telltale attributes:</p>

<p>1) Climate alarmists pretend to possess indisputable truths about the past, present, and future. From minute details of the paleoclimate to the world state 200 years in the future, alarmists know everything.</p>

<p>2) The alarmist movement stubbornly refuses to debate its dogma, calling it “settled science” and viciously attacking its critics. The attacks are not limited to name calling but include prohibiting scientific research that contradicts this dogma. Significant figures within the movement call for criminal persecution of those who publicly disagree with the dogma and, in some cases, for those who do not follow it. Proposed punishments for <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgawker.com%2Farrest-climate-change-deniers-1553719888&amp;date=2015-06-01">“heretics”</a> and <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2008%2Fjun%2F23%2Ffossilfuels.climatechange%3Ffeed%3Dscience%26gusrc%3Drss&amp;date=2015-06-01">“infidels”</a> include prison and even <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6D8yy8NUJ">death</a></p>

<p>3) The alarmist movement has a formal doctrine-setting body — the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The reports and summaries by this body are considered by the alarmists to be the main source of authority on all things related to climate, energy, the biological cycle, and consequentially, everything else. The cult followers (individuals, organizations, and even governments) regularly quote these unholy texts and use them to justify their decisions.</p>

<p>4) The alarmist movement has its own priest class: taxpayer-funded impostor “climate scientists”, having almost no real (i.e. independent of the climate alarmism) scientific achievements.[1] Frequently, they do not even have scientific degrees.[2] The alarmists sincerely believe that only members of the priest class are capable of understanding and seriously discussing “climate science.” Physicists, biologists, meteorologists, engineers, mathematicians, and other outsiders need not apply.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that this priest class was appointed by politicians (largely from developing countries) and is completely disconnected from the eminent scientists who founded climate change research at the peak of their scientific careers and produced the most results prior to 1985. All the eminent scientists who have publicly spoken on the topic since the early 1990s strongly opposed climate alarmism and were attacked or defamed by the alarmists. The list of these “skeptics” and “deniers” includes Freeman Dyson, William Nierenberg, Frederick Seitz, Richard Lindzen, Fred Singer, and Roger Revelle. None of the founders of climate change research support the alarmism.  An anti-alarmist <a href="https://defyccc.com/oregon-petition/">Oregon Petition</a> has been signed by more than 31,000 experts, including more than 9,000 Ph.D.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you aware that Raw data is useless, and that all data must go through adjustments? </p>

<p>They used Karl et al 2015 which does away with the pause by cooling the past and warming the future. They modified past temps, cooling them under the excuse that technology at the time wasn&#39;t capable of making accurate measurements, and then warmed the present by adjusting ARGO data (relatively recent system of buoys accurate to a thousandth of a degree or some such) using SST data.</p>

<p>SST data, which is collected from ships, can range from:</p>

<p>-Sailors put water in a bucket, haul it up, drop in a thermometer.
-Ranging from canvas, to wooden, to steel buckets.
-Measuring temp of intake water being used to cool the ship&#39;s engine.
-Only taking measurements when they feel like it, because a sailor is not going out in a storm to fill and measure a bucket of water.</p>

<p>This covers some other problems with Karl and SST data in depth
<a href="http://www.rossmckitrick.com/uploads/4/8/0/8/4808045/mckitrick_comments_on_karl2015.pdf">http://www.rossmckitrick.com/uploads/4/8/0/8/4808045/mckitrick_comments_on_karl2015.pdf</a></p>

<p>Interestingly enough NOAA has the <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/national-temperature-index/time-series?datasets%5B%5D=cmbushcn&amp;amp;parameter=anom-tavg&amp;amp;time_scale=p12&amp;amp;begyear=2005&amp;amp;endyear=2015&amp;amp;month=12">USCRN</a>  and <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/national-temperature-index/time-series?datasets%5B%5D=cmbushcn&amp;amp;parameter=anom-tavg&amp;amp;time_scale=p12&amp;amp;begyear=2005&amp;amp;endyear=2015&amp;amp;month=12">USCHN</a> which are climate reference networks designed for gathering data for the climate, rather than the weather (As most stations were designed to do and then adjusted to attempt to determine climate).</p>

<p>Notice the pause or even slight cooling from these datasets, sans the SST data.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like pushing the up button on Excel until the result is what you want...</p>

<p>Here is what they said when busted...</p>

<p>Q. In general, why do datasets transition?
A. The curation and stewardship of historical weather and climate data, like any vital records, must account for changes over time. These may include: the introduction or discovery of new source data (such as the digitizing of records previously held on paper), changes in the situation or usage policies of data providers, progress in the scientific understanding of data and related analysis (such as the relationship between buoy and ship-borne data), improved quality control techniques, and evolving computational and storage technologies.</p>

It has a negligible impact on the long-term surface warming trend. Furthermore, even those minor adjustments were shown to be accurate through numerous lines of evidence (satellites, ocean buoys, and argo floats) in Hausfather et al. 2017. </p>

<p>Except your hero, Lindzen, looked into the &quot;manipulation&quot; and concluded NOAA/NASA did <strong>not</strong> manipulate the data in any significant way. The error was caused by bloggers pulling from the wrong files. When the Lindzen/Hayden mistake was discovered it was <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/03/misrepresentation-from-lindzen/#more-11099">so blatantly wrong that they had no choice but to retract it</a>, saying </p>

<p>but the damage was done and <strong>still</strong> to this day you see hoaxers claiming NASA-GISS fraudulently edits their data using the same technique of using a historical links and altered graphs.</p>

<p>But as <a href="/u/thepaperskyline">/u/thepaperskyline</a> noted. Why look at bloggers when you can actually go to <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/history/">the official record of NASA-GISS temps over time</a> and see how the changes actually are made and why. </p>

<p>But... since being wrong once means we no longer believe anything that comes from the source.. Let&#39;s take a look back...</p>

<p>“Earth Day” 1970 Kenneth Watt, ecologist: “At the present rate of nitrogen build-up, it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and <strong>none of our land will be usable.</strong>”</p>

<hr/>

<p>“Earth Day” 1970 Kenneth Watt, ecologist: <strong>“The world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years. If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000.</strong> This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.”</p>

<hr/>

<p>April 28, 1975 Newsweek “There are ominous signs that Earth’s weather patterns have begun to change dramatically….The evidence in support of these predictions has now begun to accumulate so massively that meteorologists are hard-pressed to keep up with it….<strong>The central fact is that…the earth’s climate seems to be cooling down</strong>…If the climate change is as profound as some of the pessimists fear, the resulting famines could be catastrophic.”</p>

<hr/>

<p>1976 Lowell Ponte in “The Cooling,”: <strong>“This cooling has already killed hundreds of thousands of people. If it continues and no strong action is taken, it will cause world famine, world chaos and world war, and this could all come about before the year 2000.”</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>July 9, 1971, Washington Post: <strong>“In the next 50 years fine dust that humans discharge into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuel will screen out so much of the sun’s rays that the Earth’s average temperature could fall by six degrees. Sustained emissions over five to ten years, could be sufficient to trigger an ice age.”</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>June, 1975, Nigel Calder in International Wildlife: “The continued rapid cooling of the earth since WWII is in accord with the increase in global air pollution associated with industrialization, mechanization, urbanization and exploding population.”</p>

<hr/>

<p>June 30, 1989, Associated Press: U.N. OFFICIAL PREDICTS DISASTER, SAYS GREENHOUSE EFFECT COULD WIPE SOME NATIONS OFF MAP–entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming is not reversed <strong>by the year 2000.</strong> Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of ‘eco-refugees,’ threatening political chaos,” said Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program. He added that <strong>governments have a 10-year window of opportunity to solve the greenhouse effect.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Sept 19, 1989, St. Louis Post-Dispatch: <strong>“New York will probably be like Florida 15 years from now.”</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>December 5, 1989, Dallas Morning News: “Some predictions for the next decade are not difficult to make…Americans may see the ’80s migration to the Sun Belt reverse as a global warming trend rekindles interest in cooler climates.”</p>

<p>—****</p>

<p>Michael Oppenheimer, 1990, The Environmental Defense Fund: <strong>“By 1995</strong>, the greenhouse effect would be desolating the heartlands of North America and Eurasia with horrific drought, causing crop failures and food riots…”(By 1996) The Platte River of Nebraska would be dry, while a continent-wide black blizzard of prairie topsoil will stop traffic on interstates, strip paint from houses and shut down computers…The Mexican police will round up illegal American migrants surging into Mexico seeking work as field hands.”</p>

<p>You can find a shit-ton of time, newsweek, blogs, FOX, vlog, .... non-science media sites selling catastrophe in order to get eyeballs and sell advertising.

<p>In a fact-based, evidence-based, discussion regarding science, what matters is what <a href="https://youtu.be/MTJQPyTVtNA">the boring, non-catastrophe science says</a> .</p>

<p>And just like the <strong>false</strong> story that the consensus of scientists in 1970s were saying we faced global cooling <a href="https://www.insidescience.org/content/my-1975-cooling-world-story-doesnt-make-todays-climate-scientists-wrong/1640">based on hyping magazine articles at the time</a> but not <a href="https://youtu.be/MTJQPyTVtNA">actual published papers by scientists</a> pointing to something you read in &quot;entertainment weekly&quot; or the like isn&#39;t a good argument either. </p>

<p>Several authors have presented data indicating that sections of the Arctic have experienced warming trends prior to about 1950 and have experienced cooling trends since that time. Zubov’s (1943) data show a warming of the Arctic for approximately 100 years prior to publication in 1943. He shows that Arctic glaciers have receded and the southern boundary of Siberian permafrost has moved northward. Zubov also present comparative data obtained during the drift of the ‘FRAM’ and the drift of the ‘SEDOV’, 43 years later, over similar tracks in the Eurasian sector of the Arctic Ocean. The mean ice thickness was one-third less and the mean air temperature 4°C higher in 1937-40 than in 1893-96. Dorf (1960) quotes Willett (1950) who states that in Spitsbergen mean winter temperatures have risen about 8°C between 1910 and 1950. Dorf (1960) also quotes Ahlmann (1953) who reports ice free ports in Spitsbergen to be open to navigation about 7 months of the year as compared with only 3 months 50 years earlier. Mitchell (1965) states that world climate during the past century has been characterized by a warming trend from the 1880’s to the 1940’s. Thereafter, the warming trend appears to have given way to a cooling trend that has continued to at least 1960 with some evidence that it was continuing in 1965.</p>

<p>This article reviews the information on the climatic effect of carbon dioxide and aerosols and outlines man’s part in contributing to their occurence. Recent downward trends in the average surface temperature of the biosphere has lead some scientists to conclude that albedo increases due to the effect of aerosol backscatter is the causative mechanism. While there is evidence for and against this hypothesis, this paper emphasizes that albedo changes due to aerosol modification of cloud cover may be a more significant mechanism for explaining temperature trends.</p>

<p>The authors of this paper show, based on some examples from climatic history, that climate can change rapidly and that these changes can have drastic effects on world food production, as well as on other aspects of economic and cultural life. The historical examples are the Arctic expansions of around 1900 B.C. and A.D. 1200. The authors also describe a presently occurring Arctic [ice] expansion and its world-wide effects on climate to date.</p>

<p>Changes in the poleward energy flux by the atmosphere and ocean as a possible cause for ice ages</p>

<p>It is proposed that the two preferred modes of temperature and circulation of the atmosphere which occurred over the past 100,000 yr correspond to two modes of partitioning of the poleward energy flux between the atmosphere and ocean. At present the ocean carries an appreciable fraction of the transport, for example about three-eighths at 30°N. In the cold mode it is suggested that the ocean carries less, and the atmosphere more, than at present. During the formation of the ice, at 50,000 BP, for example, the overall flux is expected to be slightly lower than at present and during melting, at 16,000 BP, slightly higher. The transition between the modes is seen as a natural imbalance in the atmosphere-ocean energy budget with a gradual warming of the ocean during an Ice Age eventually cluminating in its termination. At the present the imbalance is thought to correspond to a natural cooling of the ocean, which will lead to the next Ice Age.</p>

<p>Recent anomaloous weather conditions of the 1970s have revealed the possibility that significant aberrations in global climate have and are occurring with serious consequences. The 1970s have seen a generally overall greater variability and instability of global weather. Regions in Asia, Central America, and Africa have witnessed a higher frequency of monsoon failure which has led to a prevalence of severe drought conditions and an extension of desert boundaries.  Whereas in other parts of the globe, severe flooding has been recorded. … Records of past climates have indicated that a greater variability of climate is generally synonymous with a major cooling trend in temperatures.</p>

<p>[A] general consensus that a major upheaval in climate is taking place. …There is no way of determining, however, whether or not the world is entering into another major ice age or if the present cooling of temperatures is simply a pause in the warming trend that began in the mid1800s.  At present, insufficient knowledge is available on the delicate balance among the various interacting factors controlling climate to determine precisely the future course of climate.</p>

<p>The trend of world temperature in this century appears to be directly related to the trends of atmospheric carbon dioxide content and atmospheric turbidity (dustiness). Both are believed by various scholars to be related to human activities. Since 1940, the effect of the rapid rise of atmospheric turbidity appears to have exceeded the effect of rising carbon dioxide, resulting in a rapid downward trend of temperature. There is no indication that these trends will be reversed, and there is some reason to believe that man-made pollution will have an increased effect in the future.</p>

<p>An appreciable number of nonurban stations in the United States and Canada have been identified with statistically significant (at the 90% level) decreasing trends in the monthly mean diurnal temperature range between 1941–80. The percentage of stations in the network showing the decrease is higher than expected due to chance throughout the year, with a maximum reached during late summer and early autumn and a minimum in December. Monte Carlo tests indicate that during five months the field significance of the decreasing range is above the 99% level, and in 12 months above the 95% level. There is a negligible probability that such a result is due to chance. … The physical mechanism responsible for the observed decrease in the diurnal range is not known. Possible explanations include greenhouse effects such as changes in cloudiness, aerosol loading, atmospheric water vapor content, or carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>cooling-2</p>

<p>Introduction: As described m ore fully in the accompanying state-o f-the-art report on the Detecting the Climatic Effects of Increasing Carbon Dioxide (see Chapter 4 by Wigley et al. 1985), there is no clear indication of a monotonic warming over this period [1880-1980], as would be anticipated from the observed build up of CO2 in the atmosphere. Instead, these data sets indicate a complex picture including interannual variability and, perhaps, some systematic trends. Indeed, the global temperatures seem to have increased from 1885- 1935, and the extent of Arctic sea ice decreased from 1925-1945. This was followed, however, by a leveling off and then a subsequent decrease in temperature. Although it is possible that the data sets are incomplete, these surface air temperatures do not appear to display the monotonic increase in global mean temperatures predicted by CO2-driven climate models. This does not necessarily mean an absence of an effect thus far, because the superposition of climatic variability from other ay obscure the signal. Among o th er things, therefore, transient climate models are needed to address whether historical records are consistent with predictions of past warming from increasing CO2 concentrations, as well as where and when a climate change is likely to be observed in the future.</p>

<p>Introduction: In the last century it is possible to document an increase of about 0.6°C in the mean global temperature between 1880 and 1940 and a subsequent fall of temperature by about 0.3°C since 1940. In the polar regions north of 70° latitude the decrease in temperature in the past decade alone has been about 1°C, several times larger than the global average decrease (see Fig. 3.8 in the SMIC Report). Up till now, past climatic changes (except possibly those of the last few decades [of cooling temperatures]) could hardly have been caused by man’s activities. However, we have recently realized that man has altered the face of the earth and the composition of the atmosphere on such a large scale that his influence can no longer be ignored relative to nature’s. … Two of the most publicized means by which it is thought man could influence climate are related to the dumping of CO2 and ‘dust’ particles (or gases such as SO2 which are subsequently converted to atmospheric particles) into the atmosphere, from activities that are usually associated with the burning of fossil fuels. … Some scientists already feel that particles might be responsible for the recently observed decrease in the earth’s temperature</p>

<p>The climatic warming trend since the 1880s, which seems to have been global in extent and was manifested by an upward trend in mean annual (and particularly mean winter) temperatures, seems to have given way since the 1940s to a cooling trend, which is most marked in higher latitudes.</p>

<p>—–</p>

<p><a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0477(1975">Collis, 1975</a>056%3C1078%3AWAWF%3E2.0.CO%3B2)</p>

<p>It is not clear how such favorable and relatively consistent conditions are related to the higher temperatures in this century or the peaking of temperatures around 1940. The reversal of this warming trend, however, could mark the beginning of a new ice age as some climatologists have indicated. It should be noted, though, that even if we are in fact heading for another ice age, many years or decades will elapse before this will become apparent</p>

<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2326-1951.1974.tb01149.x/abstract">Haber, 1974</a></p>

<p>A meteorologist and Director of the Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Dr. Bryson believes that the Earth is moving toward an inevitable climate change; the consequences, he says, are already being felt – tragically – in the drought-plagued belt of West Africa called the Sahel. The global climate will become cooler, Bryson predicts, the pattern of rainfall will change, and a southward movement of the subtropical deserts will take place. Since rainfall and climate affect crop growth, since crop growth affects food supply, and since food supply affects life itself, Bryson’s prediction may be of paramount importance to mankind.   The drought that has gripped West Africa since the late 1960s is just one reminder that climate cannot be taken for granted. There is little “green” on present-day Greenland, but sedimentary remains, deep below the thick slab of ice that blankets four-fifths of the island, reveal prehistoric existence of oak and chestnut trees and other forms of verdure. In northern Europe, deposits formed 40,000 years ago include fossils of palms and other plants associated with warmer climes.</p>

<p>We turn now to the question of which features of atmospheric phenomena are “most important.” Certainly temperature is one of them …. Also humidity, wind direction and intensity, cloud amount and precipitation, all play a major role in determining what is perceived as weather and hence should be time-averaged (and, possibly, space-averaged) into climate. … Some attribute the assumed decreases in solar radiation to changes in the parameters of the motions of our planet (Milankovitch, 1969), others to airborne volcanic dust due to an increase in volcanic activity (Fuchs and Patterson, 1947), and so on. There has also been a concern about a possible climatic catastrophe [global cooling] being imminent because of the increase in the quantity of industrial pollutants in the atmosphere (Rasool and Schneider, 1971).</p>

<p>[CO2 not mentioned as a “most important” feature of atmospheric climate determinants.]</p>

<p><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.395.3637&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf">Wahl, 1968</a></p>

<p>A comparison of climatic data for the eastern United States from the 1830’s and 1840’s with the currently valid climatic normals indicates a distinctly cooler and, in some areas, wetter climate in the first half of the last century. The recently appearing trend to cooler conditions noticed here and elsewhere could be indicative of a return to the climatic character of those earlier years [1830s, 1840s].</p>

<p>This penultimate climatic episode, called the “Neoboreal” by Baerreis and Bryson (1965) and also frequently referred to as the “Little Ice Age” (Brooks, 1951) apparently started during the middle of the 16th century at a time of glacial advances both in Europe and North America. It continued as a distinctly cooler, and, in some regions, wetter period well into the 19th century. Following it was a warming trend that between 1880 and 1940 to 1950 became quite pronounced in very many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. During the last two decades there appears to be some evidence that this warming trend of the last 100 yr. has changed over recently to a distinct new deterioration of the climate, leading to conditions that in the 1960’s appear to approach those which were generally found around the turn of the century or even earlier, i.e. a return to the climatic character of the 19th century … A downward trend of the mean temperature, especially in early fall, will tend to increase the likelihood of early frosts (such as Wisconsin experienced in 1965 with some killing frost in lowlands on July 6) and thus may require changes in agricultural practices. One should not forget that an average decrease in mean monthly averages of about 4° is equivalent to a displacement of the isotherms by about 4° latitude or 250 to 300 mi., or to reaching a certain temperature threshold about 10 days earlier in fall.</p>

<p>So after again - picking at these sources it&#39;s clear you aren&#39;t finding any papers that support your opinion that the scientific community was pushing global cooling and again the fact that you are finding books and thesis papers that look at the Plains of Canada and claiming that they discussed global patterns is evidence that you aren&#39;t reading the papers you are quoting and are in fact just doing another gish galosh. </p>

<p>Yes - you said - it was &quot;the scientific community&quot; so find something that&#39;s part of the scientific community. Not blogs, newspaper articles, not someones masters thesis, not a chapter in a book written by a meteorologist who thinks CO2 doesn&#39;t have any impact.

<p>Part of arguing in good faith is <strong>understanding</strong> the evidence you present. If you don&#39;t understand or don&#39;t know what the paper is about then you aren&#39;t arguing in good faith.

<p>Sorry - if you are going to quote papers as examples of what the the scientific community concludes is/will-be happening then it <strong>is</strong> the <strong>conclusions</strong> of the paper that are relevant. </p>

<p>Let me make it simple: Let&#39;s say a paper says </p>

<p>&quot;Some nuts think the moon is made of green cheese. We look at moon rocks to see if the moon is made of cheese.... Conclusion: we looked and the moon is not made of green cheese.&quot; </p>

<p>If you exclude the conclusion and only quote the part  that says &quot;some think the moon is made of green cheese&quot;  in your excerpt you not only fail to prove your point, you damage your own credibility because you clearly aren&#39;t reading or understanding the papers you quote as evidence.

Try again. Pick your one best example - <strong>that you&#39;ve actually read</strong>* t show us you do understand the paper you are using for evidence. </p>

<p>There are some intersting video&#39;s debunking the &quot;global cooling&quot;myths. Here&#39;s one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbW-aHvjOgM">Lord Monkton was saying global cooling and his claim was debunked</a>. Or perhaps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbW-aHvjOgM">Broeker and AMOC and the media hype ... But also not a global cooling prediction</a>. </p>

<p>TLDR; The idea that scientists were predicting global cooling or a new ice age is a myth perpetuated by hyping media and is not supported by a review of the conclusions of papers in the boring, peer-reviewed, fact-checked, scientific journals where the scientists publish their evidence and conclusions. </p>

<p>Cooling from 1940 until <strong>today?</strong> Sorry - but you&#39;ve been lied to.  Even your hero Lindzen accepts this fact and said so that there has been global warming. The only people who still make that claim have cut off their data at about <strong>1980</strong> and falsely state that 1980 is &quot;today.&quot; </p>

<p>Now there are smaller natural variations (noise) on top of a stronger, long-term (30+year) global warming (signal) trend. That&#39;s accepted by everyone and there is no disagreement with the scientific community there. </p>

<p>Observational evidence is the basis of the scientific method. We saw a short cooling after each El Nino. We saw a short cooling after each volcano. We saw the cooling caused by <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-cooling-mid-20th-century.htm">sulfates and aerosols</a>.  These observed short and/or localized  trends do not change the overall long term signal nor change what the scientific community was saying and thus do not support <strong>your</strong> claim that the scientific community was predicting global cooling in some &quot;alarmist&quot; manner.</p>

<p>All your &quot;evidence&quot;  showed was that in the <strong>hyping</strong> and <strong>non-scientific</strong> media, a bunch of bloggers, vloggers, magazine writers, TV hosts, students, and the like wrote that the &quot;sky is falling.&quot;  We know that Entertainment Weekly and Dailymail loves to scream and panic at the slightest rumor. Does that impact the scientific community? Nope. </p>

<p>As I said before ... You can find a shit-ton of time, newsweek, blogs, FOX, vlog, .... non-science media sites selling catastrophe in order to get eyeballs and sell advertising. You can find a shit-ton of opinion pieces by armchair scientists who wrote lots of letters that kind of say &quot;I guess.&quot; Does that impact the evidence as published in peer-reviewed journals. <strong>Nope.</strong>  Just like the <strong>false</strong> story that the consensus of scientists in 1970s were saying we faced global cooling <a href="https://www.insidescience.org/content/my-1975-cooling-world-story-doesnt-make-todays-climate-scientists-wrong/1640">based on hyping magazine articles at the time</a> but not <a href="https://youtu.be/MTJQPyTVtNA">actual published papers by scientists</a> a gish gallop of opinions/books/newpapers/popular media/non-peer-reviewed stuff/etc. won&#39;t cut it. </p>

<p>Your gish gallop of student papers and guys saying &quot;&quot;I have no idea about the atmosphere&quot; weakened your position further. All it showed was that yes - science was accurate in it&#39;s measurement of global temperature anomalies between 1940 and onward. Well, since the evidence you presented agrees with the point that temperature anomaly measurements are accurate, we can agree on that point. </p>

<p>In a fact-based, evidence-based, discussion regarding science, what matters is what the boring, non-catastrophe science says . Since the science is driven forward by what&#39;s published in the peer-reviewed, fact-checked journals. If you want to prove the scientific community was having a &quot;sky is falling&quot; episode regarding global cooling then you have to show that in their official peer-reviewed, published paper&#39;s they were predicting global cooling. The scientific community presents their conclusions in the peer-reviewed, fact-checked, scientific journals. You have yet to show <strong>one</strong> example of this. </p>

<p>Go ahead pick your <strong>one</strong> best source that states that in regards to global cooling &quot;the sky is falling.&quot; Not a gish gallop. One. You say it came from the scientific community? Find one that comes from the place the scientific community places it&#39;s conclusions... in the peer-reviewed, fact-checked, scientific journals. </p>

<p>They were <strong>your</strong> gish gallop of sources that were weak.

<p>It&#39;s not about winning or losing in science. It&#39;s about having evidence that supports your conclusions. That&#39;s it. Step away from the win/loss and only focus on what conclusions are supported by evidence. In science - when something is disproven - there&#39;s no &quot;losing&quot; as <strong>everyone</strong> benefits from having that outdated and wrong information no longer being used. Newton didn&#39;t &quot;lose&quot; when Einstein came up with Relativity. Lindzen didn&#39;t &quot;lose&quot; when he apologized and said the NASA/GISS data analysis was ok. You won&#39;t lose to accept Lindzen made an error too. </p>

<p>Given that you&#39;ve not addressed any of the factual evidence presented and abandoned the defense that Lindzen&#39;s quote was in error. Does this mean you now </p>

<ul>
<li><p>accept that nobody in the peer-reviewed, fact-checked, published findings of the scientific community was claiming &quot;the sky was falling&quot; as it relates to global cooling? </p></li>
<li><p>Agree that Lindzen&#39;s quote as in error? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know we now both agree that temperature anomaly measurements through the 1940s and onward have been accurate as you have now used evidence supporting that as a source numerous times. </p>

<p>So this is your best shot? <a href="https://www.desmogblog.com/george-kukla">The micropalentologist, George Kulka</a>. Ok let&#39;s dig in. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s review: </p>

<p>1) Peer reviewed? This was was published in &quot;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/journal/0300-9483_Boreas">Boreas</a>&quot; as one of the first papers the journal ever published. Here&#39;s what they say </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boreas has been published since 1972. Articles of wide international interest from all branches of Quaternary research are published. Biological as well as non-biological aspects of the Quaternary environment, in both glaciated and non-glaciated areas, are dealt with: Climate, shore displacement, glacial features, land forms, sediments, organisms and their habitat, and stratigraphical and chronological relationships. <strong>Anticipated international interest</strong>, at least within a continent or a considerable part of it, <strong>is a main criterion for the acceptance of papers</strong>. Besides articles, short items like discussion contributions and book reviews are published.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So. <strong>No.</strong> This is not a paper published where the scientific community publishes their conclusions. Namely not in a peer-reviewed, fact-checked journal. Is that a disqualification? Well let&#39;s not be hasty and continue.</p>

<p>2) Fact-checked Journal? <strong>No</strong> - we already covered that. in #1. Is that a disqualification? Well let&#39;s not be hasty and continue.</p>

<p>3) But let&#39;s ignore #1 and #2 for the time being. Let&#39;s see if he was using the standards of science from the scientific community. Recall at the time, scientists already knew about CO2  and it&#39;s warming effect on the climate. That was a fact of physics.  Here&#39;s what Kukla says in his paper: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>man has had little influence on global climate ... Two facts are highly probable 1) In A.D. 2100 the globe will be cooler than today, and 2) <strong>Man-made warming will hardly be noticeable on a global scale at that time.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what was this statment this based on? <strong>Nothing!</strong> Not an equation in the paper! Not <strong>one</strong> calculation of radiative forcing, CO2 density, or any physics at all! (Later, Kukla  admitted he was wrong and humans <strong>do</strong> contribute to global warming.) </p>

<p>So does this paper represent a conclusion from the scientific community? It&#39;s not peer reviewed, it&#39;s not in a fact-checked journal, it <em>completely</em> ignores the physics of CO2. So this guy was not even writing from a solid set of facts from within science! Fail. </p>

<p>In this paper, just quoting others and not presenting any new findings. He did <strong>no calculations!</strong> He quote - correctly - that solar activity was predicted to be decreasing and <a href="http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/pmod">this we&#39;ve observed.</a>. So if it wasn&#39;t for human-caused CO2 we would be in a cooling phase.  But ignoring CO2 in a climate prediction is as bad as someone ignoring the wind in a prediction about whether or not a kite will fall or rise. Let&#39;s ignore the wind .... and predict all kites will fall!?! Moronic. </p>

<p>So this is your <strong>best</strong> example? A guy who ignores CO2 entirely and writes for non-fact-checked, general-interest magazines of <strong>anticipated international interest?</strong>  The best you can do is an outlier who says &quot;fuck the physics of CO2?&quot;</p>

<p>Ok then - since you can&#39;t present the case that the scientific community was saying &quot;the sky is falling&quot; about global cooling we&#39;re done with this claim. </p>

<p>Claim: &quot;The scientific community was saying the sky is falling and predicting global cooling&quot;</p>

<p>Findings: 
 * There were smaller time periods of global cooling and the temperature anomaly measurements were accurate. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Those who liked to write for the <strong>general public</strong> in the hysteric media loved to scream about global cooling and coming ice ages to sell advertising. </p></li>
<li><p>The scientific community (e.g. papers that appeared in the peer-reviewed, fact-checked scientific journals) did not.  </p></li>
<li><p>Some confuse the mass/hysterial/advertising/general media with the scientific peer-reviewed fact-checked papers. They are different and you can&#39;t use</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ok - great. Now we&#39;re done with this - let&#39;s continue our last point </p>

<p><strong>mere presence!?!</strong> All sorts of climate hysteria appeared in Time and 1000 other <em>hyping media sources</em>. Is the presence of someone shrieking in the ad-based or general media evidence of a scientific conclusion? Nope. The conclusions of the scientific community are published in the boring, peer-reviewed, fact-checked, scientific journals. </p>

<p>Might as well point to the &quot;mere presence&quot; of someone in 1970 saying the earth is flat. </p>

<p>And you didn&#39;t read this one either. This is an opinion piece quoting Kukla (your &quot;best&quot; and failed shot) which QUOTES Kukla and then goes on to say they <strong>DISAGREED</strong> with KUKLA.  LOL.  Here&#39;s their exact quote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last year Kukla [claimed] ...  But there is as yet <strong>no evidence that further cooling is likely</strong> in the immediate future. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. The very article <strong>you cite</strong> says that Kukla was <strong>wrong</strong> in his future estimate of &quot;global cooling.&quot; And that was the <strong>one</strong> best source you claimed you could pick for &quot;the scientific community saying the sky was falling&quot; </p>

<p>Let me repeat what they said in that article</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>no evidence that further cooling is likely</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again a Gish gallop where a sample of the articles don&#39;t support your case and in fact claim the <strong>opposite</strong> </p>

<p>So to restate: </p>

<p>Claim: &quot;The scientific community was saying the sky is falling and predicting global cooling&quot;</p>

<p>Actual Presented Evidence: 
 * There were smaller time periods of global cooling and the temperature anomaly measurements were accurate. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Those who liked to write for the <strong>general public</strong> in the hysteric media loved to scream about global cooling and coming ice ages to sell advertising. </p></li>
<li><p>The scientific community (e.g. papers that appeared in the peer-reviewed, fact-checked scientific journals) did not.  </p></li>
<li><p>Some confuse the mass/hysterial/advertising/general media with the scientific peer-reviewed fact-checked papers. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ok - great. Now we&#39;re done with this - let&#39;s continue our last point </p>

<p>In your first gish gallop it was 100% media. In your second+third+fourth I went though a random sampling and showed they were gish gallop with 100% of the ones I reviewed (I believe I&#39;m up to 8 of them) were not supporting your claim and in fact showed the opposite of your claim. </p>

<p>You have not disputed any of the findings of fact I presented and in fact <strong>again</strong> haven&#39;t disputed the evidence.</p>

<p>The gish gallop is a logical fallacy and since you can&#39;t/won&#39;t/don&#39;t defend or remove any of the ones that have failed - it destroys your claim. I asked you to pick <strong>one</strong> that you said was good. You did. I looked at it and instead of defending it - you just dump another gish gallop. Stop running away from evidence. </p>

<p>Why should I look at all of your gish gallop when you haven&#39;t? The gish gallop is a logical fallacy designed to waste time. I asked you to pick your <strong>one</strong> best source. You did. I looked at it, showed it to not support your claim, and you refused to defend it and instead did another gish gallop using sources I already showed didn&#39;t support your claim. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t appear then that you are arguing in good faith because you continue to refuse to discuss evidence that disputes your claim. </p>

<p>Um - actually the Mann paper I reviewed and it said the opposite of your claim. You didn&#39;t dispute that. I asked you to pick your best example. You did and I reviewed that one too and showed it didn&#39;t support your case and you didn&#39;t dispute that either. But aside from that - a random sampling and analysis is how disproving a gish gallop works. if you don&#39;t want a gish gallop disproved - then don&#39;t do a gish gallop. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to disprove what you wrote. The gish gallop logical fallacy is &quot;look at all these things supporting me!&quot; and is disproved easily by finding a random sampling of them and showing they actually proved the opposite of your claim. Yet instead of defending the ones that were disproven, you just say &quot;keep going through all of them!&quot; Gish gallop. I think that you keep getting confused between what&#39;s published where the scientific community publishes their conclusions (e.g.  the peer-reviewed, fact-checked scientific journals) and all other media is pretty telling. </p>

<p>So if you really still think you have a case - you&#39;ve yet to show any evidence that &quot;the climate science community was claiming that the sky was falling in regards to global cooling.&quot; We&#39;re still at the following findings of fact: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>There were smaller time periods of global cooling and the temperature anomaly measurements were accurate.</p></li>

<p>When you&#39;re searching for peer reviewed journals on the internet, start your google search with &quot;scholarly article&quot;.</p>

<p>Example: &quot;scholarly articles scholarly articles hpv vaccine adverse reactions&quot; would have given you the following peer reviewed studies (in order of relevance):
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-abstract/93/4/284/2906462">Safety and Immunogenicity Trial in Adult Volunteers of a Human Papillomavirus 16 L1 Virus-Like Particle Vaccin</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s good advice. You can also start with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">https://scholar.google.com/</a> . I hope <a href="/u/timo1200">/u/timo1200</a> takes this advice and starts to generate conclusions about the science of the world more based on where scientists actually place their conclusions instead of newsweek, hyping MSM, blogs, opinion pieces, letters to the editor, etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;d add to <a href="/u/UpperLeftyOne">/u/UpperLeftyOne</a>&#39;s advice the following: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>when quoting these papers - take the quotes from the &quot;conclusions&quot; section instead of from where the authors are quoting someone else or what the authors think might be wrong or interesting to review and investigate.  Case in point: the opinion piece <a href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/254014a0">http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/254014a0</a> you quoted as evidence of a prediction of scientists saying here was some global cooling hysteria but when you read the letter (not a paper) in the conclusion the authors were saying &quot;Last year Kukla [claimed] ... But there is as yet no evidence that further cooling is likely in the immediate future. &quot; so showing the opposite of your claims that the scientific community were hysterical about global cooling. </p></li>
<li><p>Stop talking about &quot;sides&quot;  and winning vs losing. Everyone wins in science when evidence eliminates claims not supported by the evidence. That&#39;s the nature of science. Lindzen/Hayden gained credibility when they <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/03/misrepresentation-from-lindzen/#more-11099">apologized</a> for getting the evidence of NASA/GISS temperature anomalies wrong and <a href="http://repealtheact.org.uk/blog/apology-from-prof-lindzen-for-howard-haydens-nasa-giss-data-interpretation-error">accepted that the temperature data was correct</a>. Spencer and Christy gained credibility when they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAH_satellite_temperature_dataset#Corrections_made">apologized and accepted</a> that their satellites were publishing temperature anomaly data that was too low and adjusted their temperature anomaly reports upwards. </p></li>

<p>As I&#39;ve said - you and I agree that global temperature anomaly measurements are accurate. We see <a href="http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp">that 1940 decade or so period of cooling in the data</a></p>

<p>It seems like you are now changing your claim now that &quot;ONLY there existed a period of global cooling.&quot; Ok then, If that&#39;s your claim - then we agree. Scientists accepted the data of temperature anomaly measurements as accurate and still do. Lindzen apologized and accepts the NOAA/GISS data as accurate too. </p>

<p>Do you now withdraw the other part of your claim that there was a &quot;sky is falling&quot; alarmism in the scientific community about a <em>prediction</em> of global cooling? All the evidence you&#39;ve provided so far supports the following: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>There were smaller time periods of global cooling and the temperature anomaly measurements were accurate. Scientists acknowledged these accurate temperature anomaly measurements. </p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>all this is on the internet ... all you have to do is search ... you don&#39;t even have to do the calculations ... they are all done for you. </p>

<p>Wot? That IMHO is not the words of a scientist who is still thinking critically. </p>

<p>You can see  <a href="http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/videos/34729/ivar-giaever-global-warming-revisited/laureate-giaever">the talk by noble laureate Dr Glaever</a> and cringe. </p>

<p>Sad to see an old guy follow the same path of many a grandparent and start flooding your inbox with &quot;proof that vaccines cause cancer!!!&quot; because it appeared somewhere on the internet. But a non-emotional review of this talk shows the errors which (IMHO) show the early onset of logical failure. Let&#39;s begin .... </p>

<p>He starts his talk and goes on and on about how the vertical axes of temperature measurements are all bogus, but 1) doesn&#39;t understand these are <strong>anomaly</strong> measurements not raw temperature measurements. 2) Then goes on to that same vertical axis but from hoaxer sites which have been caught <strong>faking</strong> their graph data. And yet he takes this in uncritically. </p>

<p>Bad or Faked data proof. Example 1: Take the graph about how hurricanes are &quot;less now&quot; and across his title it says through 2005. Yet he gave this talk in 2015 and when we look at his graph it shows NO hurricanes of category 5 .... hmmm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> was in 2005. Missing. </p>

<p>Bad or Faked data proof. Example 2: Compare <strong>his</strong> chart with <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DSPrbsJoR9Y/VIBsV1_nyrI/AAAAAAABtPw/EpWec6gdEMI/s604/clip_image0021.png">bogus data</a> vs <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/satellite-measurements-warming-troposphere.htm">good analysis of the same RSS data on top of other measurements that agree</a></p>

<p>Sad. And what&#39;s sadder comes later as he keeps saying </p>

<p>&quot;all this is on the internet ... all you have to do is search ... you don&#39;t even have to do the calculations ... they are all done for you&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and you realize that he&#39;s become like the old relative who listens to anger media and can&#39;t tell good data from bad. And they say &quot;I believe this is true because the internet told me!&quot; Or the old relative who&#39;s sent all their money to the Nigerian prince. </p>

<p>The most telling of this is when he uses that same justification of &quot;the internet has all the information&quot; to erroneously claim &quot;all you have to do is light <strong>one</strong> match to equal all the CO2 emitted by all cars across the entire world in 20 YEARS OF DRIVING!&quot;  </p>

<p>Scientists all over the world who heard that &quot;nuterance&quot; cringed as they watched the collapse of what was previously an intelligent person. </p>

<p>Even the <strong>simplest</strong> of calculations will tell you that is complete and utterly wrong. Even if <strong>100%</strong> of the matter in a match was converted to CO2 that&#39;s <strong>less than a gram of CO2</strong>. The ratio of CO2 to other gases emitted when burning gas in a vehicle is 98.8%. <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/refs.html">In 2011, the weighted average combined fuel economy of cars and light trucks combined was 21.4 miles per gallon (FHWA 2013). The average vehicle miles traveled in 2011 was 11,318 miles per year.</a> that means for just ONE car you&#39;ve got in ONE year CO2 emissions of (11318 miles)(1/21.4 gal/mile)( 8,887 grams of CO2 / gal ) = 4700 kg of CO2 for ONE CAR in ONE YEAR. Multiply by the number of miles driven by cars around the world? You are BILLIONS of times larger than what you&#39;d get from lighting a match. </p>

<p>TLDR; Giaever&#39;s talk is provably false and full of &quot;because the internet said so&quot; rantings. </p>

<p>Interesting. Isn&#39;t the differentiation between religious fundamentalists vs the opposite, the strength of the hard evidence on which they base their actions? One could say the same thing and use it to attack those who believe in evolution as religious fanatics.

<p>Ok - let me restate your point and see if I understand your position: </p>

<p>Since you won&#39;t/can&#39;t make a judgment on the <strong>factual</strong> nature of the argument - you are reacting to the <strong>tone</strong> of the participants. Your decision on whether or not you believe in increased CO2 causing global warming is based on the <strong>emotion</strong> and <strong>feelings</strong> involved in how people have presented the information. You feel those arguing that increased CO2 causes global warming can&#39;t be right no matter what the science says are because it doesn&#39;t feel right to you. Do I have your position correct? </p>

<p>2) <a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/6b41x5/dilbert_red_pills_a_few_people_today/dhoszus/">Do you accept Lindzen&#39;s quote is in error</a> when you quoted him saying: </p>

<p>Do you accept that as being incorrect? Here are the 2007 IPCC reports.

<p>Lindzen used to. He reversed himself and if he still has concerns there&#39;s nothing stopping him from publishing a re-analysis with the unchanged raw data (the raw data is unchanged). </p>

<p>Your two links referred to the GISS homogenization process for one location which tracks back to this blog post: <a href="https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/giss-make-the-past-colder-in-reykjavik/">https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/giss-make-the-past-colder-in-reykjavik/</a></p>

<p>But <a href="https://moyhu.blogspot.com/2012/01/reykjavik-and-ghcn-adjustments.html">&quot;No, history was not rewritten. What the folks there don&#39;t seem to want to acknowledge is that GHCN circulates two files, described here. The file everyone there wants to focus on is the adjusted file (QCA). This, as explained, has been homogenized. This is a preparatory step for its use in compiling a global index. It tries to put all stations on the same basis, and also adjust them, if necessary, to be representative of the region. It is not an attempt to modify the historical record.&quot;</a></p>

<p>And as one would expect. <a href="https://moyhu.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/study-of-ghcn-v3-homogeneity.html">Some go up, some go down and the net effect is symmetric</a> that&#39;s a factor of 10 smaller than the measured rise. </p>

<p>The problem with bloggers only getting upset about the one that changes up and not getting upset with the counter that goes down is that their readers get misled into observation bias. </p>

<p>Yes - confirmation bias. We agree. In order to avoid confirmation bias instead of doing what Homewood does - you look at ALL the devices you see it is not &quot;(almost) always ... an increase in the rate of warming&quot;. Some go up some go down <a href="https://moyhu.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/study-of-ghcn-v3-homogeneity.html">and the net effect is symmetric</a> you can see it when you don&#39;t pick and choose just 8 sensors like Homewood did. </p>

The dominant religion in the West used to be Christianity, but that has been mocked and discredited by atheistical liberals, leaving the people with nothing. When you believe in nothing, you are capable of believing in anything. The people make their own religions. Man-made global warming is one of those cultic religions. It has no foundation in reality, it is purely mythical in the true sense of the word.</p>

<p>Yes I agree humans / businesses pollute and it is very bad and we should focus on this rather than saying 100% of scientists agree the sky is falling.  The climate on Earth has been changing for 5 billion years, also if we prove humans can impact a planetary climate system, that would be strong evidence we are headed for a Type 1 Civilization, which is a good thing because we can control a planetary climate system in a Type 1.</p>

<p>Impact doesn&#39;t imply control, nor does it provide evidence that it is leading toward control. You can impact the life of someone by shooting and killing them, but that doesn&#39;t mean you have the ability to control life/death with those same tools. Similarly although it is proven that the recent rise in CO2 is from humans and proven that this has warmed the planet, that does not mean we have the ability to remove that CO2 and/or stop the positive feedback loops that have now started. </p>

<p>Does any google engineer comprehend the number of bytes collected by their search engines and still instruct it to operate? Does an astrophysicist comprehend the size of the galaxy and yet measure size of the supernovae beyond it? One doesn&#39;t have to comprehend a number to do the calculations with it. </p>

<p>Ad Hominem....  How many climate scientists were there in 1975?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You</strong> were making the point that climate scientists were wrong about &quot;global cooling&quot; so if your point is now that there are too few climate scientists in 1975 to quote so you feel you have to quote from people writing masters papers and from meteorologists writing chapters, you&#39;ve just <strong>destroyed your own point!</strong> LOL! So if you want to make the point that &quot;scientists were wrong&quot; about global cooling then it was <strong>you</strong> who set the rules about them being scientists. </p>

<p>As I said before: A dump of a bunch of media hyping stuff? Another dump of masters papers and opinion pieces by those who actually say &quot;I have no idea about the atmosphere&quot; AHAHAHAHAH.</p>

<p>You can find a shit-ton of time, newsweek, blogs, FOX, vlog, .... non-science media sites selling catastrophe in order to get eyeballs and sell advertising. You can find a shit-ton of opinion pieces by armchair scientists who wrote lots of letters that kind of say &quot;I guess.&quot; Does that impact the evidence as published in peer-reviewed journals.  Nope. </p>

<p>In a fact-based, evidence-based, discussion regarding science, what matters is what <a href="https://youtu.be/MTJQPyTVtNA">the boring, non-catastrophe science says</a> . </p>

<p>And the science is driven forward by what&#39;s published in the peer-reviewed journals. <strong>You</strong> want to prove science was predicting global cooling? Then <strong>you</strong> set the requirements that this was serious and moved forward in the scientific community. You made your bed. Now you get to lie in it.  </p>

<p>Nope - I&#39;d just again pick a few at random and see if they were weak as is indicative of a gish gallop. If the random sample found they didn&#39;t support your case - then there is no point in continuing with more analysis of a gish gallop. </p>

<p>You provided 25 examples of something that didn&#39;t happen? HAHAHAHAHAHAH. Bravo - you just contradicted yourself. </p>
