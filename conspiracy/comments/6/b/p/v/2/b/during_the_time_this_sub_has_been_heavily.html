    <div class="md"><p>If we&#39;re in a closed, pressurized system, why does atmospheric pressure decrease as you increase in elevation? A closed, pressurized vessel has homogeneous pressure in its volume. Thats also doesn&#39;t explain gravity, because pressure is not a force. The only way for pressure to exert a force on you is if you are experiencing uneven pressure across the surface of your body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pressure decreases at higher elevations because you are in an area of less dense air. As you get closer to see level the pressure rises because the air becomes more dense. Think of air as a liquid. Density and buoyancy create the &quot;gravity&quot; effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesnt make any sense, a pressure gradient can only exist in a fluid if there is a constant force acting on that fluid. The buoyant force pushes upwards, not downward. Because the pressure increases in a fluid as you go downward, if you are standing up to your chest in water, the pressure at your feet is higher than the pressure at your chest, so you are being pushed upward. Thats why you feel lighter in water. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats not a plausible explanation. Density is not a force, its a measure of mass per unit volume. For an object to move, a force has to act on it. If there were no gravity and you placed a rock in water, it would not move as there is no force acting on it. The force that causes an object to sink is gravity.</p>

<p>First lets talk about how fluids behave. As you get deeper in water, pressure increases as more and more water is on top of you pushing down. So lets say you are scubadiving and you are sitting right at 5ft depth. At your feet, the water pressure is higher than at your head. To calculate the force, you would multiply the surface area by the pressure. On the lower half of your body, you are being pushed on harder than the upper half, so the net force is actually UPWARD, that is why you feel lighter when you&#39;re in water than when you&#39;re on land: The density gradient in water is higher because its a more dense fluid. The reason you sink is that you are being pulled down towards earth harder than you are being pushed upward by pressure differences.</p>

<p>So lets say that it is pressure differences holding us down (even though we know that the pressure gradient is actually pushing us up), in that case, more dense objects should fall faster than less dense objects. But we can demonstrate that thats not true: drop a block of lead and a block of wood: they fall at the same rate, meaning density does not effect the rate of descent. Additionally, if density gradients were causing us to &#39;sink&#39; to the earth, if you were to pull a vacuum in a glass container and put an object in it, that object not sink as there is no density gradient to sink in. Or you could make the argument that it should sink FASTER, because you can&#39;t pull a true vacuum, so it would actually just be less dense air. Neither are the case: it falls at the same speed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Thank you for such a well thought out and detailed reply! The very last sentence made it all click for me, an &quot;ohhhh yeah that&#39;s right!&quot; moment. Another question, since I am not well versed on this subject at all- what kind of effect (if any) would the shape of the Earth have on gravity? Were it indeed flat would gravity behave in the same fashion? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So gravity pulls any 2 objects with mass together. The more mass, the harder the pull. The further away, the weaker the pull, very similar to a magnet. </p>

<p>If you put a ball bearing on the outside edge of a flat magnet, its relatively easy to remove that bearing, as most of the mass of the magnet is far away from the ball bearing. If you put the ball bearing in the middle, however, most of the mass of the magnet becomes closer to the ball bearing and it is harder to remove. </p>

<p>here is an image: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZXRZYDY.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/ZXRZYDY.jpg</a></p>

<p>So you can see, on a flat earth, as you moved away from the center, the force of gravity AND direction would change as you are farther from the center of mass of the earth. By the time you are on the outer edge, you would be pulled back towards the center as well as down towards the surface. </p>

<p>At any point on a sphere, however, you the same distance from the center of mass of that sphere, and gravity is always in the same direction: towards the surface of the sphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And here&#39;s one of your comments from four hours ago:</p>

<p>&quot;i know, let&#39;s just turn this sub into a smaller version of <a href="/r/T_D">/r/T_D</a>. I mean, it&#39;s basically going that way anyway, but let&#39;s just drop all pretense and crosslink every single post from there to here. I&#39;m sure that would make a bunch of people happy&quot;</p>

<p>Fancy that!</p>
