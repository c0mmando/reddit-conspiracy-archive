       Well I can see why you were downvoted for that. Cause breihart is on a hole other level compared to CNN. They both spew shit but breihart are something else. From what I think is that people felt like you thought they were about the same... When they're not. Anyway shit like that happens alot.

       to promote an album thats already been widely panned by the community, and flooding it with positive astroturfing about the album so that anyone coming into the forum to get information on hip-hop will leave thinking that that album has community approval and the only people panning it are fringe lunatics.

       You asking for "something" didn't even make sense.

       People were saying Bidens "creepiness" would make him unelectable, I rightly pointed out Trump has all of those same issues.

       There are videos and pictures of him awkwardly grabbing his own daughter and talking about how what they have in common is sex. There is the video of him talking about trying to fuck married women and grabbing them.

       They're easily available on YouTube. Go and have a look.

       The public opinion is that Biden is a far better person.

       Okay I looked it up...this? Tell me at what point that's even close to being equal the Biden videos. Some of his comments are really creepy but that video is not groping, or necking like Biden.

       I've blocked a lot of those "people" already, I guess, cuz I can't see man of those comments. After they reply, if you block them, they'll never see another of your posts.

       You need them to reply to your comment. When you first look at your unread messages, fourth option below the new message/comment in your private queue will be "block user."

       I'm seriously considering doing this at this point. I have never blocked anyone in all of the years I've been on Reddit, but I'm sick of this shit. I have to avoid this sub, otherwise I get irritated af after reading a few front page posts, the content is irrelevant most of the time about imaginary Trump supporters.

       Fuck this sucks. I don't want to do it, but it seems like the only way at this point.

       The same that's happening when you get downvoted for saying you don't trust Dear Leader. Both sides are here to push the propaganda machine.

       We have to do what we've always done and that's critically think and form our own opinions. I personally believe all sides are shit, Alex Jones plays an insane character to push an agenda, Rachel Maddow plays a concerned liberal character to push an agenda. It's all garbage. Different types of garbage, but all garbage.

       Yep. If we just get disheartened and check out, they win by default. If they can disrupt our communication, they win by default. If they can keep us from being organized, they win by default. If they can keep us afraid, they win by default.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to win is to accomplish the opposite of all of these things.  Stay engaged and educate yourself. Stay tied in with local elections, support your local precinct and show up to witness vote counting, encourage politicians to look at getting rid of voting machines or make them open-source.  Stay in communication with like-minded people and downvote the noise bots. Look for alternative places to meet up such as voat and other places.  Get organized and don't let them disrupt that. Don't be afraid. THEY should be afraid of US. Don't ever forget that.

       He's actually doing wayyy better then I thought he would do. I don't have any problems with him at the moment mostly because he's keeping his promises. He's definitely not the worst and that's coming from an Indi.

       â€¢Trump has attempted to enact a Travel Ban that is 100% CONSTITUTIONAL AND is made from the seven (six, now) "countries of concern" outlined by the Obama Administration. This has been blocked by an extremely liberal Hawaiian judge who was appointed by Obama. (The blocking of this travel ban might piss me off more than anything that has happened during his presidency, because judges should be blind to politics, but that is proving to be false.) Hopefully this will go to the Supreme Court and be overturned quickly.

       People cry about the deep state whenever a leak is bad news for Trump. Rather than acknowledging any wrong doing, people cry about the deep state sabotaging him. When he acts shady as hell with Comey, people deflect by crying about the deep state.

      <p>
       When it comes to CNN, yeah they've gotten things wrong. All news stations get things wrong. Lord knows fox has spread some bullshit over the years too. But just because they've gotten stuff wrong doesn't mean everything they say is bullshit. If CNN is propaganda for the left then Fox is definitely propaganda for the right.

       When did you see a front page post about Trump being a fraud? I don't think I've ever seen a front page post that was bad for Trump. The worst thing I've seen here is about how Sessions is an asshole about marijuana. That's about it. Everything else gets downvoted immediately.

       Yeah the Syria thing was just about the only time I can remember where there was in fighting with the Trump supporters.

       I feel a lot of the ridicule is aimed at posters who see the deep state as  leftist controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that the current admin is being attacked by the deep state because its going to "drain the swamp" is worthy of ridicule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying you are part of the group who believes this, but many talking about the deep state have obvious political bias.

       Drain the swamp really shouldn't be about left vs. right. Should be about corrupt establishment politicians, dirty dealings, and deep statism unelected fourth branch of government that answers to no one.  They overthrow

       This is their new version of whataboutism. Not saying that is the case here, they are just defending the news source they trust. But I talk shit about msm, and out they come trying to imply I give fox any credibility. People like us don't trust any tv.

       And I'm asking you where does he say it only pertains to one side? Where is he saying this is only CNN or only the left? He isn't but you're trying to claim that is what he's implying since his post only mentions CNN in the title. However if you actually spent time to read his comments, he drags on Trump and Fox as well. So now your argument doesn't make sense because he's now stated the exact opposite of your claim. So show me the damn quote, otherwise you're just putting words into his mouth just so you can have some holy crusade and purpose to give your life meaning.

       It's the purposeful omission.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lie of omission is still a lie and it's a consistent theme from posters here to only attack anything left wing as the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm doing is pointing out that media being misleading is across all political spectrums. Fox News for example has led the way in lying and manipulation for decades now. But weirdly enough we never see a post like this about Fox News. That's my issue and my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not excusing any bullshit CNN has pulled. But if you read the original post again this whole post is people specifically complaining that a source they politically agree with got upvotes. And I haven't seen the same thing about a right wing source for over a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's telling that over and over he will single out CNN, but only occasionally even timidly admit that other places do it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to summarize, you're trying to deliberately be misleading by saying "show me a quote" for a situation where the issue is a lie of omission. And you know that, it's an argument about semantics. It's like arguing that dog whistle politics isn't racist because there isn't anything clearly and brazenly obvious.

       For the 10th time, you're angry that I've added context that media is bad. And you're angry that I pointed out that he (meaning your alt account) was intentionally pushing a narrative complaining about people upvoting a source he doesn't like.

       I'm not angry at all actually. And where did I say I was "angry" for you adding context that media is bad? Wtf does that even mean besides you trying to play scrabble to sound neutral? Both sides are corrupt and both CNN and Brietbart are "fake news". So now how are you going to spin it that I'm upset that "you're calling out the media bias of the right"? Because that's not what I'm arguing against. I'm arguing that it's ok to have a complaint about CNN and to make a post about it. Making a post about it doesn't mean you love Trump and are there just to push some right wing narrative. I'm saying you can post about it and still not like Trump. Much like OP has actually said.

       Complaining that people were up voting a left wing source. Not complaining about false stories, not complaining about misleading stories, complaining that a source you don't like was getting upvotes and you weren't.

       Oh so glad you understand OPs thought process. If only we could all have your mind reading capabilities.

      <h1>
       If you're upset at a lack of posts about Fox or others, then make your own post about it.
      </h1>
      <p>
       OP and everyone else here isn't here just to post about the things you think should be said. So if they aren't saying it, or saying it loud enough for you, then grow some balls and say it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're attacking people for absolutely no reason. To you the world isn't fair unless both sides are mentioned in a post. It's fine that he's calling out CNN and not others (even though he did in the comments
       <strong>
        multiple times
       </strong>
       ). You know why? Because that doesn't make his point any less true. Neither does it diminish the truth that there are right wing news sources that suck just as much as CNN. Both statements are still true and OP agrees with both. So what the fuck is your actual problem here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I love your obvious newspeak. You say
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's telling he will
        <strong>
         single
        </strong>
        out CNN, but only
        <strong>
         occasionally
        </strong>
        even
        <strong>
         timidly
        </strong>
        admit the other places do.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When in reality he made a
       <strong>
        single
       </strong>
       submission about CNN and
       <strong>
        multiple
       </strong>
       comments about right wing news sources. Not only that but how was what he said timid? He directly states he hates Trump and he hates the other news sources as well. Do you just picture him saying that timidly, so you think his comments must be timid?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also let's be honest. Reddit is left wing, hardcore. You do see a disproportionate amount of submissions here calling out the left, but that is fair I believe because the rest of the site does a great job at calling out the right. Point is, it doesn't have to be perfectly 50\50 in here for it to be fair.
       <strong>
        You're lying by omission by skipping over that.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       You're whole argument is moot and pointless, yet here you are still trying to create division where there doesn't need to be any.

       It's pretty easy to see such an obvious narrative. Even you can see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP himself is now saying it's a media as a whole issue despite the thread, and countless like it lately here, pretending that it's a left of center problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never said the world was fair, but intentionally leaving out the whole context is exactly what people here would attack CNN for doing. And my too long ago the opinion was it was media elites behind this, now post Trump it's only attacking anything seem as left. You're getting mad at me for pointing out the context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your last point completely supports my argument:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      <p>
       You're literally saying that this sub lately has directly pushed a right wing narrative. But you'll excuse it because that fits your narrative and your politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm doing is pointing out the context that even if you want to believe it isn't your side, it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If calling out things is "fair" as you say then I don't understand your anger at me doing exactly that.

       This post called out a left media outlet. OP then further substantiated his claims by saying it's not just CNN and the left, but Fox and the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is any of that pushing an agenda? What the agenda that the modern day democrats are just as cancerous and stupid as the republicans? Or are you just pissed because it's "your team" that is on blast right now? It's obvious you love the DNC and think they can do no wrong. Along with their supporters and media organizations.
       <strong>
        You're just pretending to be neutral.
       </strong>
       we all see through it which is why you're getting downvoted STILL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also love how you totally ignored the rest of my comment and have no rebuttals for my other points.

       And maybe you're new but I was around here back when it wasn't right v left. It was against the elites and TPTB.

       Nope! Your complaints in other posts are only negative about the right and not the left. This is clearly you attempting to
       <em>
        appear

       neutral while not actually being neutral. You definitely are only concerned with pushing left wing bias and narratives.

       Ok I haven't seen it an I stalked your profile a good 10 pages. I see you e submitted a lot of pro democrat stuff and a lot of anti-Trump stuff. I don't disagree with the anti-Trump stuff, but let's not pretend like you're neutral about any of this. You have your world view and agenda that you want to push so you try to oppose anything against it.

       The only thing I saw even remotely close was you said something along the lines of, I'm more liberal than Obama and I don't like some of the stupid shit he has done.
      </p>
      <p>
       WOW so amazing how critical you are of your party's dear leader! You sure did spend just as much time talking about Obama and Hillary's issues as you did about Trumps! Oh wait you didn't because you have a bias. Both sides are fucking garbage and Obama was honestly one of the worst presidents. Trump is doing his best to beat him, but so far Trump hasn't been able to pass much of anything so his effect is minimal. The GOP is still fucking over the little guy as always though.

       You know why you won't quote it? Because you'd have to quote him saying that both CNN and Fox suck, and then there goes your precious narrative. So unless you can prove that OP is only pushing right wing propaganda by calling out CNN, then you have no argument besides just to stir shit up and cause drama.

       So show me in the post where he talks about this only being an issue of the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you something sincerely. If this post was about Fox or Brietbart, would you honestly have made the same comparison that the OP is just agenda pushing because it only mentions ________ right wing news site?
      </p>
      <p>
       You wouldn't because you're very left wing (as your comment history proves) and you only seem to have a care for whataboutism when there is something attacking the left. You don't have the same whataboutism speech for anything right wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of us here were adult enough to look at OPs post, agree that CNN is dog shit, and then in the comments have discussions about media bias in general and not just about CNN. You're only focusing on the fact that the title doesn't directly call anyone out besides CNN. That is literally your issue in which you're describing to me. Because it's a "lie by omission" because it doesn't have Fox in the title either by itself or along with CNN. To you it's only fair and balanced if it's ALWAYS mentioning both sides (or at least just the right side, since you carry water for the democrats like a good little voter).

       <p>
        OP and everyone else here isn't here just to post about the things you think should be said. So if they aren't saying it, or saying it loud enough for you, then grow some balls and say it yourself.
       </p>
       <p>
        You're attacking people for absolutely no reason. To you the world isn't fair unless both sides are mentioned in a post. It's fine that he's calling out CNN and not others (even though he did in the comments multiple times). You know why? Because that doesn't make his point any less true. Neither does it diminish the truth that there are right wing news sources that suck just as much as CNN. Both statements are still true and OP agrees with both. So what the fuck is your actual problem here?
       </p>
       <p>
        It's telling he will single out CNN, but only occasionally even timidly admit the other places do.
       </p>
       <p>
        When in reality he made a single submission about CNN and multiple comments about right wing news sources. Not only that but how was what he said timid? He directly states he hates Trump and he hates the other news sources as well. Do you just picture him saying that timidly, so you think his comments must be timid?

      <p>
       All I did was point out that CNN is just one cog in the machine and you're missing the forest for the trees.

       In this thread I have spoken more about other medias being shit than cnn and yet you act like its all about one side. When it wasnt even about politics and you bring politics in.

       No no, which words in the post. Is the the CNN, the downvote, or what? You're purposefully ignoring the question as it is written. I'm saying what words and you can't even show one

        word

       you have an issue with. You can just say all of it.

       Your claim was the literal opposite of the post title. You said OP was mad for people
       <strong>
        upvoting
       </strong>
       liberal sources like CNN. The title literally is about OP being
       <strong>
        downvoted
       </strong>
       for saying CNN is propaganda
       <em>
        in the conspiracy subreddit
       </em>
       . What do you have to say to this?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can't even defend it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, are you trying to say I'm an alt account? Because look at my trophies. Alts don't do secret santa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'm calling you out because you deserve it. People who claim to be neutral but really only bat for one political party disgust me and should be named and shamed. You are a hardcore democrat trying to pretend to be neutral. It's obvious. You even state that in some of your previous comments that you're extremely liberal. So stop pretending like you care about true objectivity when you're the one pushing a political side here.

       To your post about fox and such being as bad as cnn my reply was "of course". Check it out if your brain was incapable of retaining that memory.

       You got an exact quote of him bitching about anyone complaining about right wing news sources? I didn't see it in all his comments on this post so you're talking out your ass to have this conform to your world view. Also since apparently you love defending CNN by saying "It's not as bad as _______" let me just say CNN is one of the worst actually. CNN is literally cancer trying to sell you bullshit. It could easily be argued CNN is the most "fake" and bullshit of all the news agencies. CNN is pure trash and anyone who takes their articles at face value are too stupid to engage with anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a troll and it shows because you won't let this discussion happen because it didn't mention Brietbart or some other right wing fake news source. Spoiler alert: we can talk shit about CNN without being right wing nuts who only listen to Fox News and defend Fox and whatever. Fuck them all but especially fuck CNN and

       Because this sub has devolved. A year ago people would realize that all these media companies are just  coordinated in selling us outrage to get everyone worked up. Now it's pretending that it's only left wing sources that are the problem.

       You're actually retarded. If you want to post about Fox or Brietbart or CNN or NBC or whoever the fuck, then
       <strong>
        make the post yourself
       </strong>
       and don't expect everyone to make the posts you want. Why is it OPs job to cover every single news organization every single time? Why can't he make a specific post calling out CNN? Based off your history and there fact that..
      </p>
      <h1>
       You voted for Hillary hahaha
      </h1>
      <p>
       (PS I didn't vote Trump or Hillary. I voted Bernie and then Libertarian just to vote third party as a protest vote) we can
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       conclude you wouldn't be making these claims if someone made this post only about Fox. If it was only about Fox you'd be praising this post and not calling any attention to the fact that CNN is just as terrible. You're only trying to defend CNN here because they have been nice to your waifu Hillary. It's funny because you're trying to say OP is pushing a narrative because he's talking about CNN but not Fox in this post, but yet you're pushing a narrative with all of your comments. Sure I may agree with your narrative because it's anti-Trump, but don't pretend to be neutral or someone who just cares about the facts. You just care about your precious Hillary and your precious news sources that protect her. It's transparent as day and I don't care if you disagree because based off the downvotes, people aren't buying your bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it wasn't you, it was someone else in the comment chain replying to OP that I just thought was you because I didn't read the username first.
      </p>
      <p>
       So once again, if you're gonna claim I voted for and carry water for Trump, then fucking prove it with some links or STFU. Same with OP. If you got links and
       <strong>
        facts
       </strong>
       to back yourself up then great. If not then you're either a bad troll or just functionally retarded.

       I checked your history and it looks like your post is an authentic concern. I don't agree with your post though because you missed some key facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, Conspiracy is overrun with Republican partisans who politicized the whole idea of conspiracies for the purpose of swinging elections. And, considering how close the 2016 election was, it worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I avoid self-posts about the sub to cut down on the overflow of low-effort space-hogging stuff filling the NEW page, but I did make one
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ggost/politics_in_conspiracy_history_exists_to_figure/">
        here
       </a>
       . This post documents what I described. Republicans have politicized the sub. Of course, there is going to be a reaction from Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting to check the histories of those posting pro-Trump/pro-government articles to the sub. Nearly all of them have been around for one year or less. What happened one year ago? We were in the middle of an election. Coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, if you look at my history it goes back nearly five years, is loaded with critiques against MSM
       <em>
        more than any other topic
       </em>
       , and does not show any increase in partisan posts at that critical time before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone wrongly accused you of being pro-Trump. You responded:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I never have posted breitbart, never even mentioned it in the thread where I got downvoted.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Actually, you did. You posted that Breitbart link to the protest at CNN. For all we know, and based on
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6hzn6q/mods_of_marchagainsttrump_refuse_to_tag_a_post_as/dj2je7v/">
        history
       </a>
       , there is no reason to think that whole thing was not staged. If we look at the
       <a href="http://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/the-tea-partys-revival-as-the-party-of-trump/74685">
        history
       </a>
       of the leader of this protest, it
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       looks staged. In any case, this is a generalized pro-Republican partisan protest of insignificant size. These types of protests happen all the time, and they are simply not newsworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are users throughout this thread posting Breitbart links in reply to comments criticizing this post. Breitbart is all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, MSM is full of distortions and propaganda, and sometimes even flat out lies (especially when it related to promoting wars), but Breitbart, which is essentially fake news, is no antidote. Breitbart is the controlled opposition -- the Hegelian dialectic -- the place where people who hate "fake news" go to find "fakest news."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'd say not that your complaint against CNN is wrong -- but that it is out of balance based on a misunderstanding of what is happening here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans have infiltrated conspiracy sites, proliferated fake news, and used their members to turn conspiracies into a partisan political campaign. Democrats have rushed so far away from any notion of the possibility of of conspiracies (while hypocritically believing a few select ones) so that now ....
      </p>
      <p>
       CONSPIRACIES THEMSELVES are being reduced to nothing more than a partisan political tool -- the new ABORTION.

       When I think about that Democratic partisan site, the first thing that comes to my mind is "ShariaBlue." Why? Because the Republican partisan spin machine has filled up the internet so much with propaganda that they did a psyop on me. At least I realize it though. :)

       Fox are the ones calling out the bullshit MSM narrative that Russia "hacked the election" and that Trump is a "russian puppet". You need to take another look at Fox.

       Did Fox News cover the 9/11 false flag attacks? Didn't they help perpetuate that hoax? And all of the shitty false flags in between ? Lol it's just more fake news dude..how can you look me in the cyber-face and defend Fox News on a fucking conspiracy sub? You look ridiculous...

       You completely ignored this part of my comment. You instead decided to go on a crazy defensive rant, pulling out all the lame catchphrases you lot like to use when you start to lose an argument or look stupid.

       No more needs to be said.

       The Enlightenment that saved us from serfdom and the Dark Ages in general was predicated on the concept of a "marketplace of ideas". So burning people to death for concepts at odds with the powers that be (mostly the church) kinda fell out of favour. But there's always a residual instinct in human nature to get on back to those good ol' medieval times.

       A lot of Kool Aid drinkers who refuse to acknowledge they live in an increasingly controlled bubble roam aimlessly around the web bereft of meaning, goals or purpose and stray here for their amusement. Then they see something that challenges their understanding of their shopping mall universe and lash out in self defense. So they've got that going for them anyway...

       laws, at least a
       <em>
        proper
       </em>
       law is based upon morality or right and wrong.  whether the sentiments are codified in legalese o paper for use in a court of law or applied withiin the context of internet forums that are not as stringent or well-definees, they are still valid, i.e. defamation

      <p>
       as well, my initial concern was a question, not a demand.  the purpose of which was to introduce an idea that was relevant to me and timely considering all of the accusations of brigading, shilling, manipulation etc., from all "sides"
      </p>
      <p>
       the notion of "reporting" someone and not being able to discuss the reasoning behind it directly with the one who did the reporting is what evoked the concern, it was not for the purpose of tracking them down, or antagonization.

       ..what it COULD BE used for, not necessarily "WOULD".  the same way contentious replies COULD be used the same way.  as well those that are motivated enough to track people down could do so regardless, but thats the risk we take putting ourselves out there.

       Yeah, I suppose the admins could, but report storage is kinda funny. If I approve a reported comment all the reports go poof. So, I can't go see what another mod saw in a report that they saw fit to approve anyway, if that makes any sense. So, they either are being stored indefinitely, but obfuscated after approval, or it is blowing out the records when accepted by a mod. The lazy DBA in me says they are blowing out the records. Reports would become a pretty irritating garbage collection issue.

       This isn't just a "leftist" game. My comment wasn't clear, but it's everyone subscribing to the bs left/right paradigm that clutter the hell out of the reports with petty nonsense. It's like as long as it's my guy fucking me, it's AOK. I wish there was a way to extricate politics from conspiracy, but politics is literally institutionalized conspiracy. So, fat chance.

       You aren't wrong, I had just failed to recognize that this issue was coming from both sides. But it is probably 10:1 as you say, if I had to put a number on it. Not the least of which because of orgs like Shareblue with a clear mission to disrupt places like ours in this way. But, just because the Trump fans are organic and not particularly organize does not mean they don't participate.

       Not partisan, in fact, I'm anti-big govt. I want to pay less taxes. I want affordable health care with a health savings plan. I want peace through strength.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN and mainstream media colluded with the DNC/Hillary campaign. Fact! Hillary is the establishment. CNN is the establishment. Trump beat them and EXPOSED them. If you can't see that then you're too far gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       What made me a democrat? Prepare yourself. I grew up poor, roaches in dark corners and under appliances, mice in the walls. My mother raised three kids on welfare. My father was a low-wage worker, he struggled with addiction and never bettered himself. I was conditioned to believe that Democrats cared, that they were there for me and would take care of me. I was told Republicans were mean old bullies that hated the poor. Until I met one and he took a liking to me and changed my life by offering me a job, and showed me what it meant to be a conservative. He was hard on me, judged me in a way that didn't make me feel little, it made me feel loved and that I had tremendous potential. I worked hard and in a few years, raised up the ladder. I learned that through hard work, anything is possible. He gave me an opportunity and I ran with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all that, and after working for several years I still voted for Obama. Twice. Because I hated what Bush did. I was still a Democrat and believed Obama's lies... And then things got worse. Terrorism happened and the media wouldn't call it what it was, they covered it up. I saw what was happening in Europe. I saw ISIS spread and take control of oil fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       Serious question, how does a terrorist organization take oil fields and make millions per day from them? How the fuck!!?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, I believe that we do not know the full truth of 9/11. I believe parts of our gov't are involved in the drug trade. I believe there is a reason we went to Afghanistan, for the poppy. I believe that ISIS was allowed to spread to destabilize the region. And I believe that the CIA colludes with MSM to push these narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of all, I believe the LEADERS of this world do not know what the hell they're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then I watched the very first GOP debate. That was my first real red-pill. A former Democrat, who knows the dirty inside of DC, told it like it was. I looked at my gf and said that I'm voting to take back control of our country. We're overthrowing our govt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is the anti-establishment candidate that Bernie wished he could be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you'll say, then why did he fill his cabinet with the swampiest people possible? If you have followed Trump like I have with an open-mind, all I see are people who love their country and want to make it the wealthiest place in the world. This is how you better your people, not by giving away hand-outs.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've spent trillions in the Middle East. We could've rebuilt our infrastructure 3 times over. We're being left in the dust and are looking like a 3rd world country compared to places over there and also China. We've given away too much, it's time to bring back jobs, put America to work, hold people accountable (like welfare recipients on drugs), enforce our LAWS, and rebuild our nation. There's no reason for the best country in the world to have shitty infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       We bring in refugees and treat foreigners better than we do some vets. It's fucked up. They get welfare, food-stamps, housing, free school, and there are vets living on the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to fix it now before it's too late. And that's why Trump will hold office for 8 years.

       Hahaha, for the most part I can either see the POV of complaints about me, even if I don't agree with them. Or, I know how to characterize the abuse. I have been slinking around the internet a long time. I would be shocked and disappointed if I was abused any less.

       Obviously the feed cuts are them making it obvious they're trying to silence somebody mid sentence. It's not like satellite feeds can be disrupted and it's not like they let people finish what they were saying. Why wouldn't they just pre record the interviews?

       They all are, because they are NOT a News business, they are an advertising business using the news platform to sell Ads.  This has basically turned them into tabloid news, very little is correct, oh but they brought this Bullshit to you 1st at least.

       They're all pro-corporatist and pro-globalist. Nature of the beast, their upper tier management all have a vested interest in tearing down barriers to trade and/or travel. Gotta make sure it's nice and easy to move money around to the Caymans or Bermuda or wherever the fuck. Can't say anything too out of line on immigration and global trade because the advertisers all want that kind of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's possible to have a non-globalist media operation with the paid advertising revenue model on TV. TV itself is a dying medium, these media companies are increasingly forced to grovel to the same dwindling pool of high-dollar advertisers (many if not most of whom are foreign.) This naturally creates an implicitly pro-globalist tone.

       So it's like I said earlier then?  Any time someone shines a light on the bullshit on the left, then they must support the right?  This entire thread is about CNN, and just because it doesn't address the bullshit on the right doesn't mean it supports that side.  That's called flawed logic.

       The point of the thread is to point out that CNN is garbage and shouldn't be trusted.  It should be common sense that this largely applies to ALL of them, including Fox, if you're properly skeptical of the MSM.  That you can't fathom the point that you don't have to pick a political side and can equally criticize both sides of the lying shitheads without being one of them is exactly why you're an idiot.

       They're irrelevant because we're talking about CNN, which has nothing to do with Fox or Breitbart. You decided to deflect to a users post history and some whataboutism. And followed it up with a personal attack.

       Fox News invented the shit people are complaining about. People on this sub would lose their fucking minds if CNN did a story half as ridiculous as attacking Obama for asking for mustard.

       And don't use terms you don't understand. Stating that their criticism isn't valid because it's done by ALL media isn't "whataboutism". Rather than lookin at the whole picture and understanding that the media elites are all pushing these narratives together to divide everyone you have fallen hard for supporting your "team".

       Why don't you make a post about Fox and Breitbart then? I never said that they didn't participate in what CNN is doing, but attacking the person who is calling out CNN and going "well what about Fox and Breitbart Mr Donald poster" is not productive conversation.

       No one here ever defends CNN, they have sucked and have been known to suck for a very long time here. It's simply not a valid reason to thereby discredit every single thing they or all MSM do or have ever reported on.

       Because it's too dangerous for just anyone to speak out against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to be clear, I'm a rabid environmentalist.  I understand Limits to Growth and I know where we are going.  But this global warming stuff has been just an NWO power grab from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's put it in simple terms.  If you look up whether it is more "green" to buy a new car or keep your old one, the answer is to buy a new one.  There is actual research that says this.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is flatly ridiculous on the face of it.  And if you go reading the research and actually think it through, sure enough, it is a picture fucking perfect example of why global warming is total bunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a shocker:  any climate model that ends up recommending you buy a new fucking car is bogus.  You are being lied to.

       Agreed. Environmental marketing and sponsored studies can be really misleading. Eco-economics can focus on different targets to achieve their aims (e.g. cars reducing pollutants instead of targeting total life cycle impact).
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose you are questioning the proposed solutions to global warming. E.g. C02 tax in Europe is certainly not working as it is far to cheap to discourage coal power plants.

       The way I see it, before you had a president who didn't even argue just did everything the deep state wants, now you have one that depending on your view, I just think he's retarded and does what he wants, others may think he's "fighting the good fight" but I disagree. But we can all understand that Trump is unpredictable and it's likely a loose bet for them.

       The sheer number of new posts calling out the just how inept they are at "blending" and seeming organic, is all the proof we need to show there is a new concerted effort to end one of the last free speech communities on the internet.  They used to get by with just labeling us "conspiracy theorist" and be done with it, but the paradigm is shifting, and for the first time ever, there is an active attempt to subvert this community.  We should see it both as a threat (a grave one, for if this wacky place ever truly falls, we have lost a great space), and as an affirmation that we are close.  That maybe, just maybe, they can only play their games so much longer, and that a global awakening truly is happening during our lifetime, where truth will finally prevail, and those only attempting to subjugate, mislead, imprison, and control, will finally lose the battle our human souls scream to us is completely unwinnable for them

       Jesus this thread is one massive circlejerk about how anyone who doesn't think CNN is literal propaganda must be paid what a joke, you have all drunk the right wing smear koolaid, CNN is a rag but its not some shadowy propaganda its low effort low production value for maximum profit, the narrative that its propaganda is being perpetrated hardest form actual consumers of actual propaganda like breitbart and FOX.

       They all are BS, because they are NOT a News business, they are an advertising business using the news platform to sell Ads. This has basically turned them into tabloid news, very little is correct, oh but they brought this Bullshit to you 1st at least.
If you call out only Fox News, you are seen a a leftist shill, if you call out CNN or MSNBC, you are seen as an alt right nut job.
If you call all three out for what they are at least you are getting the idea of the truth

       Could you provide an example of that happening? Typically this sub is anti-CNN as they come. The top post in this thread is a collection moments in which CNN earned their fake news reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the deep state we all tend to agree that it exists. Even talking heads are acknowledging it's existence at this point. I'd like to see an example of that too.
      </p>

       I don't mean to be a dick but I participate in this sub a bit and haven't seen what you claim is occurring, what I've been seeing are a collection of people claiming that it is occurring which I find suspicious.

       Fox are the ones calling out the bullshit MSM narrative that Russia "hacked the election" and that Trump is a "russian puppet". You need to take another look at Fox.

       Is opening your mind involve pretending that right wing bullshit doesn't exist too?

       Fox News invented the shit you're complaining about but naturally that doesn't get brought up here does it? It would go against he narrative.

       Pay no attention to the billionaire elites pulling the threads behind the scenes, CNN cut a mic!

      <p>
       rather sweeping statement, and imho this inability to confront accusers would lead to more abuse as well what would the consequences be to the accused knowing?

       this is a public internet forum with relative anonymity via screennames, not cosa nostra. should i worry about the things im saying?

       In the title he didn't call them all out but he doesn't have to! For fucks sake. It's honestly like talking to clever bot. You have your responses and that's all you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHERE DOES OP SAY DIFFERENTLY THAT THIS ISNT ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM? Oh wait he only mentioned CNN so he must be a Trump stooge out to brainwash everyone! Or, you know, he could just be calling out CNN because they are indeed "fake news". His title doesn't need to be about CNN and Fox to make it fair since his statement is still correct about CNN

       There are videos and pictures of him awkwardly grabbing his own daughter and talking about how what they have in common is sex. There is the video of him talking about trying to fuck married women and grabbing them.

       They're easily available on YouTube. Go and have a look.

       The public opinion is that Biden is a far better person.

      <p>
       Are you done stalking after me because I said, rightly so, that any issue Biden has is equaled by Trump in a hypothetical match up?

       Okay I looked it up...this? Tell me at what point that's even close to being equal the Biden videos. Some of his comments are really creepy but that video is not groping, or necking like Biden.

       What the fuck is up with the "stalking" bullshit? No offense, but you're posting for hours a day and expecting to not be seen by people? You posted in a thread I'm actively getting other responses in. Pretty weak ass deflection tbh
