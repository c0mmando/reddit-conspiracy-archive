He has been a alcoholic for a while but the past 6 months or so all he has been doing is watching videos on niburu or &quot;Planet X&quot;. He is completely convinced the world is ending soon so there is no point to do anything but drink his life away. I know part of that&#39;s just a excuse to drink and not feel as bad about his addiction, but if anyone shed some light on the subject so I can maybe convince him otherwise it would be super helpful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more important that your father receives help with his alcohol addiction issue. One symptom of alcoholism is dementia due to brain damage and early onset Alzheimers.</p>

<p>My father-in-law was an alcoholic and was pretty bad off the last few years of his life. He was blackballed by most of his family and thought the world was out to get him. He had his good days and his terrible days. But the more he fed his addiction the worse off he got until he could barely function.</p>

<p>Seriously, get him help with his addiction first. His other issues may clear up or he may be too damaged to recover.</p>

He&#39;s had severe depression for most of his life, and refuses to take the medicine ever since my mom and him get a divorce.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a 8 year recovering alcoholic and believe me its the hardest thing to quit. It is one of the most physically additive drugs,I spent 3 months in hospital after being admitted close to death from diabetes complications namely DKA. Whilst being treated I had the shakes,hallucinations and finally seizures resulting in cardiac arrest. This in no way helps your nibiru quest,but I now feel great and have a much clearer head. There is so much more to life after drink and that&#39;s what your father needs to see,I feel your anguish as I nearly tore my family apart. Drink will kill him long before some rouge planet.</p>

<p>When in reality the planets orbital plane is tilted relative to the Sun&#39;s travel. So the planets go infront and behind the Sun throughout their orbit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the core, he needs someone to genuinely talk to and be truly heard. Be that person or find that person. There&#39;s a good chance, as you&#39;re his son, he may not be 100% comfortable talking to you about somethings.</p>

<p>I believe it all, and at the same time believe none of it. TV is 99.99% bull shit. YT is almost 100% bullshit. We must embrace the bullshit along with the truth to really learn though. Everything is true in some sense, and false in some sense.</p>

<p>He might be right. Who the hell really knows?</p>

<p>Show him that you care and he may just want to spend the rest of his days making the most of what little time we all may or may not have left.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think trying to rational with an Alcoholic on any subject is going to get you anywhere.  They will use anything as an excuse for drinking.  Reach out to someone at a local Alcoholics Anonymous group or if he&#39;s the type who gets super dead drunk then call the cops and have them do a mental hygiene arrest.  When people are doing stuff like that it&#39;s normally a sign of being suicidal.  Actually most alcoholics are also suicidal but choose to drink themselves to death instead of another method of suicide.  Especially if they are religious or have had religious values instilled in them or forced on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give him a good punch right in the face! He has lost it and is ignorant piece of shit staring only at his own belly. If he doesnt learn from a punch coming from his own son, he is lost for good. I am sorry for you having to deal with it. Having seen my own father go due to drinking addiction, i cant feel sympathy for a person who chose self-pity over life.</p>

<p>A good punch is the only way to wake him up. The shock makes him think. He needs that shock. I am serious, punch him good! Thats what i would have done if only i had been older.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This hits close to home... You need to talk to you dad. Sit down and maybe have a few beers, and talk man to man, convince him that there is more to life than drinking it away.

<p>Health is the number one reason to get him better. 
Second, maybe convincing your dad to try marijuana? I know others are saying shit like shrooms, but that&#39;s up to your old man. The most important this is to spend time with him and get him away from that BS for now</p>
