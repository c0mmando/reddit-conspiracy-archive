<p>They literally released him the same way US prisons can choose to release a prisoner if they are terminal.</p>

<p>If the &quot;evil North Koreans&quot; are so evil he would have just died in prison. End of story.</p>

<p>Do you think maximum security prisons in the US are not going to &quot;fuck up&quot; an upper-class Western college student who never did a day of time in his life?</p>

<p>But none of that is the point. The point is that the &quot;evil North Koreans&quot; had every reason and right to let him die in prison. </p>

<p>And yet they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>It would be silly to assume that he&#39;s making trips to NK without any US Gov contact. At a minimum he asked if they needed anything while he was heading out and they said, yeah, pick up that kid while you&#39;re there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A parent would be more afraid if their kid died abroad and they never got to see the body.</p>

<p>Its important to fold back the decades-long anti-NK circlejerk, and then wonder why they would let him go home if they are so evil.</p>

<p>The most evil thing would have been to let him die and then simply just never mention it again and everyone would believe he were still alive.</p>

<p>They could also simply have &quot;added time&quot; to his sentence forever citing crimes he &quot;committed in jail&quot;. </p>

<p>North-Korea is not evil.  It is an isolated regime that is oppressive towards its population in the Stalinist way.  Objectively, no different than many regimes we are happy to do business with...Saudi&#39;s for example. </p>

<p>Smart planners don&#39;t want to invade it.  Even if the military action is successful, no one wants the refugees. Both, South Korea and China would be overwhelmed, and they don&#39;t want that problem.  </p>

<p>That is assuming that nuclear weapons are not utilized. </p>

<p>The problem is the old Pentagon guard who knew this posturing is bullshit are dead and retiring, and the new guard believes the rhetoric. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I&#39;m not mistaken, he was brain dead since right around the time of his arrest. Silencing him on what? Everyone knows he got arrested for something ridiculous and its all that more obvious he got his ass kicked seeing as how he&#39;s in a coma. I doubt he knows any state secrets. Don&#39;t take this as sarcastic, im honestly curious because I think maybe they might have thought he was a spy or something and I&#39;m just missing a piece which explains the logic.</p>

Well he probably got a bit of rough treatment to say the least, plus all the propaganda and what not they would have been spewing at him, also if he was doing hard labor at some point they probably don&#39;t want someone who knows what those conditions were like getting back to the west to tell stories.
