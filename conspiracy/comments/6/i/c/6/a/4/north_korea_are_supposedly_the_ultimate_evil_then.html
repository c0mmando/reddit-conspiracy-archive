       Of course it is. He was sentenced to 15 years.

      <p>
       They literally released him the same way US prisons can choose to release a prisoner if they are terminal.
      </p>

       If the "evil North Koreans" are so evil he would have just died in prison. End of story.

       Do you think maximum security prisons in the US are not going to "fuck up" an upper-class Western college student who never did a day of time in his life?

       You absolutely do go to prison in the US for
       <em>
        stealing
       </em>
       . Which is exactly how North Korea and many asian countries view "borrowing something from the street that isn't yours". They just call it stealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also treat it so harshly because of how rare it is. Believe it or not, many cities in Asia are extremely safe because of the harsh consequences for being a thief.

       It would be silly to assume that he's making trips to NK without any US Gov contact. At a minimum he asked if they needed anything while he was heading out and they said, yeah, pick up that kid while you're there.

       A parent would be more afraid if their kid died abroad and they never got to see the body.

       Its important to fold back the decades-long anti-NK circlejerk, and then wonder why they would let him go home if they are so evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most evil thing would have been to let him die and then simply just never mention it again and everyone would believe he were still alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could also simply have "added time" to his sentence forever citing crimes he "committed in jail".

       If he died there, the propaganda campaign would have been a lot more dangerous and effective. His death will be used to rile up North-Korean sentiments for sure, however, the success is counteracted, to some degree by his return.

       North-Korea is not evil.  It is an isolated regime that is oppressive towards its population in the Stalinist way.  Objectively, no different than many regimes we are happy to do business with...Saudi's for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smart planners don't want to invade it.  Even if the military action is successful, no one wants the refugees. Both, South Korea and China would be overwhelmed, and they don't want that problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is assuming that nuclear weapons are not utilized.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the old Pentagon guard who knew this posturing is bullshit are dead and retiring, and the new guard believes the rhetoric.

       I think his father on the news looks like one of the Sandy hook fathers or one of the "event" recently. He looked very comfortable infront of the camera. I just don't have time or care enough to figure out where he is familiar from.

       I think they are thinking they will win favor with Trump by returning him but knew they had to silence him so they made him brain dead before sending him home.

       If I'm not mistaken, he was brain dead since right around the time of his arrest. Silencing him on what? Everyone knows he got arrested for something ridiculous and its all that more obvious he got his ass kicked seeing as how he's in a coma. I doubt he knows any state secrets. Don't take this as sarcastic, im honestly curious because I think maybe they might have thought he was a spy or something and I'm just missing a piece which explains the logic.

       Says the North Koreans...  Well he probably got a bit of rough treatment to say the least, plus all the propaganda and what not they would have been spewing at him, also if he was doing hard labor at some point they probably don't want someone who knows what those conditions were like getting back to the west to tell stories.  It's pretty likely they might have just worked him to death, maybe he got exhaustion or severe heatstroke, dehydration something like that.

       Is that you, Kim Jong-Il? You murdered a peaceful visitor from another country. They sent him back home a coma. How is that not enraging and inhumane? Have a heart.

       You absolutely do go to prison in the US for
       <em>
        stealing
       </em>
       . Which is exactly how North Korea and many asian countries view "borrowing something from the street that isn't yours". They just call it stealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also treat it so harshly because of how rare it is. Believe it or not, many cities in Asia are extremely safe because of the harsh consequences for being a thief.
