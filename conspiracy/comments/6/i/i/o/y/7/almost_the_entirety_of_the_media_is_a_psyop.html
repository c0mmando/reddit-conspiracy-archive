        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I studied the basics of media violence (both psychological and physical violence) extensively. Instead of explaining the nuts and bolts, I&#39;ll just explain what certain media clips are aiming to do. Keep in mind that the Zionists own all the media circuits in the US and they have been coordinated by the Mossad, CIA, and other sinister agencies to ruin and demoralize the average citizen. They have been very successful only because this psyop has been going on for many decades now. The media psyop is basically a daily dose of poison to slowly poison the minds of Americans. </p>

<p>Here are some examples of what&#39;s going on right before our very eyes and it is good to be able to identify the tricks:</p>

<ol>
<li>A show like Kardashians is clearly a psyop to disrupt the day to day relationships of the average citizen by depicting extremely violent behavior as some kind of norm. They also glamorize it like they have always glamorized violence to trick youngsters into thinking this is proper behavior. Violent media start on screen but then it goes into the minds of the masses and from there it hits the streets. </li>
</ol>

<p>Violent Media -----&gt; Mind of Masses --------&gt; Real Life</p>

<p>This is exactly how it works and why violent media is no laughing matter whether it be psychological violence or physical violence. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Shoot em up video games are always 1 man with a gun fighting everyone. Everyone is the enemy. This type of media desensitizes people to pulling triggers and encourages aggressive approaches to resolving day to day people problems. </p></li>
<li><p>The show West World is particular violent both psychologically and physically. Shows like this and Hannibal are mostly focused on increasing fear within the common citizen through entertainment. Fear tangles up the brain and so the more fear that is pumped in through media, the more dysfunctional the average citizen becomes. </p></li>
<li><p>News agencies are always trying to create of sense of dire emergency to increase the fear load. Also, the way the journalists communicate is extremely abnormal. They speak at hyper speed, they hide all emotions, they seem pretty self-centered and assertive, ect.. This type of behavior is typical of selfish self-serving assholes. Again, they are trying to brainwash you into thinking this is what successful people look like and how successful people act in hopes to trick you into acting the same way at work. I&#39;m sure its extremely exhausting and it would most likely lead to many quarrels with co-workers which is good for TPTB because it helps separate us. </p></li>
<li><p>Women&#39;s magazines are simply designed to make women feel ugly so that they can purchase equipment advertised in the magazine to make them beautiful again. </p></li>
<li><p>The news is also fully designed to create a false reality which is supposed to hide the real reality of what&#39;s actually happening behind the scenes over in DC and beyond. </p></li>
<li><p>Most all of the comedy sitcoms display extremely dysfunctional behavior where it is packaged as cute and funny behavior. They know exactly what they are doing with this one. Cute and funny behavior is one thing, but in the average comedy, almost every character on the show is extremely manipulative and insulting. These comedies might make us laugh but they leave a feeling of disgust in the end. Oddly enough, nobody gets into serious fights on comedy shows. These stupid bullyish behaviors are brought out into our reality where someone eventually angers another and starts a dispute that can sometimes go on for years. This is good for TPTB. The more divided we are, the weaker we become. </p></li>
<li><p>Adult swim in its entirety is disturbing garbage at a whole new level. Comedies like this are sure to drive a fully normal person insane overtime. </p></li>
<li><p>Prison shows are mostly to increase the feeling of fear against the government. Everyone knows prisons are modern day torture chambers and the government wants everyone to know how bad it really is inside. Instead of educational rehab centers, they throw people in a small monkey cage and humiliate them live on TV. Cop shows are mostly to intimidate the public and increase fear. </p></li>
<li><p>Most all movies seem to have an egocentric hero. Egocentric is actually a negative orientation but since the hero is egocentric, it tricks the people into thinking the good guys are always egocentric. This is another subtle manipulation. </p></li>
<li><p>Most anything concerning the powerful emotion of love is laid out in the cheesiest way possible to the point where its almost repulsive. It is very hard to find a good movie about love and that is intentional because love is the exact opposite of what TPTB want us to experience. </p></li>
<li><p>A lot of music is bad. The beats and lyrics often talk about disturbing things in a fun way. Many rap songs, heavy metal songs, and pop songs are extremely disturbing or tend to promote an egocentric lifestyle. The reason the elite likes egocentric media is because it perfectly describes who they are. Egocentric people are only worried about self gain no matter who it hurts and they would rarely lift a finger for anyone outside of themselves. If our entire society behaves like this, the people will be separated and weak since a united people are extremely powerful. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Many people who stopped watching MSM altogether swear up and down that they feel a whole lot better. This is because they are simply not being poisoned. The only solution to this problem is to not watch MSM and focus on media that can be self-selected like youtube videos. This way, the viewer gets to watch what they want and so are self-empowered not to poison themselves. </p>

<p>TPTP call media the &quot;Great Power&quot;. This conspiracy is one of the most underestimated ones in the country and the elite are liking this confusion. Every time we turn on the TV, we are falling right into their trap. </p>

<p>If anyone wants to learn more, pay attention to the behavior of the TV characters and try to identify the psychological violence that spews out of everyone&#39;s mouth as it is presented in some sort of acceptable way. It is packaged in an attractive way to trick the common citizen into adopting this behavior, bring it into society, and further disrupt and divide humanity. </p>

<p>Does all this work? Yes, it works like a charm but if enough people know about it, they will immediately learn to be cautious. Ingesting media poison is very harmful. Intelligence is not a determiner of how media poison affects the mind. A full blown pHd can be mentally ruined by watching too much TV. </p>

<p>Once people learn to ingest media responsibly, the poison in the body of America will be greatly reduced which will further empower the people. </p>

For me, I can &quot;feel&quot; the difference in a very subtle way.  440 tends to throw me off balance and fucks up the way I think.  You can test this for yourself and listen to music in the 432 hz on youtube and try to see if you can notice a difference in how you feel/think after a couple sessions</p>

<p>if you do not like one of these videos right away, just try another video, and another, until you find one you like. do not spend an hour listening to a video that you do not immediately like, because it will not get any bette and your experience will be bad. you have to listen to quite a few to find one you like especially the binaural beats (which should be listened to with headphones) </p>

<p>432Hz is considered a more natural tuning than 440Hz. Like, 432 is divisible by 3, 6 and 9 etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but no one was explaining the difference between 432 and 440. Like the physical difference. It&#39;s the fact that middle A is tuned at 432 instead of 440 and the rest of the frequencies follow in line with that logarithmically. With A being at 432 the rest of the notes are harmonically in tune but while A is at 440 some of the notes are slightly off making them non harmonic. </p>

<p>That was my question. And I answered it myself</p>

<p>Not following you on this.</p>

<p>440hz is the frequency corresponding with A4.</p>

<p>If a song is in, say, Fm, a common key, then A is not even in the scale, so 440hz will produce dissonance that will sound like shit in 99% of songs.</p>

<p>Hving too much 440 hz or any of its relative fundamentals or harmonics will ruin a mixdown if the song&#39;s key doesn&#39;t contain A, so youll notch those frequencies down or filter them out completely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have audio engineer background too and wasn&#39;t quite following until I realized 432 is what they tune A4 to. And the rest of the keys follow suit from there. This is what Verdi and Mozart used because it&#39;s a more natural number than 440 musically and in the universe. So yes while a song in Fm might not contain A4 it is still tuned from 440 and not 432 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have an audio engineering background then you should no that even a song in a key not containing A, is going to contain 440 as a harmonic of variable amplitude. Its is also going to contain 432 as a harmonic. Even instruments tuned to 432 are going to produce 440 as a harmonic.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Musically and in the universe? In what way is it more &quot;musical&quot;? If I take a recording and speed it up gradually, as the speed and relative pitch frequencies increase, is the song become more musical? Less musical? Please actually try to answer this thought experiment rather than ignoring it.</p>

<p>Finally, do you know the definition of hertz is? It is based on the <em>second</em>, a man-made concept that has no &#39;harmonious&#39; significance in the universe. In fact, there is debate about the standards of time measurement. So how confident can you be that ratios are better than others when your ratios are derived from a man-made concept like the second.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been wondering about the mass effect of MMA/UFC on society--it seems the US military and fed/state/local police are all being trained in MMA basics now.  Beyond that--I&#39;ve also recently seen a streetfight via youtube which was extremely violent --complete with one punch Knock Outs and people savagely kicking people in the head (the fight was in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuEX7-U5FHw"><strong>Louisiana</strong></a>).</p>

Its not fun. Those sports can mess you up for life. Many people have lost their eyesight in an eye, or had a caved in skull from those bloodsports.

    <div class="md"><p>Courage and risk are excellent qualities but like all things, they can be used for good or evil. Media is trying to push the thought that men who use courage and risk for evil are attractive. This technique is starting to be used for women too. The lady on Gotham was drugged and became evil and suddenly very sexy. They are trying to make it seem like evil is attractive but its not evil that is attractive. Courage is what&#39;s attractive especially when courage is used for noble causes. Media doesn&#39;t portray noble people with courage. They display evil people with courage. The last thing they want is a bunch of courageous, risk taking citizens who will step out of the comfort zone to fix the world. </p>

<p>The whole idea is to steer humanity to the evil side so that it falls apart on itself while the cabal parties with trillions of dollars. They want to look down on us because their self-esteem is so low that they need trillions to feel good about themselves as they look down on the rest of us as lambs for the slaughter. </p>

<p>A good example of a noble, courageous risk taker is JFK. I&#39;m sure Marylin Monroe and his many girlfriends were attracted to JFK for this reason. </p>

<p>Take out the middle man (power and wealth) and you will have this statement:</p>

<p>Women are attracted to safety and security. This is a very accurate statement. </p>

<p>Keep in mind the black hats who enslaved the world created a system that benefits the criminals because they themselves are criminals although crime itself comes with huge consequences. We will eventually flip the system so that cooperative, positively orientated white hats achieve safety and security and this will probably happen when we remove money and trade out of our economy and replace it with the sharing/caretaking system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mind control through media is the best way to sell propaganda. 
I have been interested in symboligy and numerology used by the secret societies to show their presense and also communicate with other members. One thing i have noticed is that the most successful type of media like sitcoms for example arrested development which im currently watching and contains proper theater acting has symbols like checkered floor, a 666 sign, hand symbols, eye symbols, and other body symbols to assert their allegiance to the secret societies. 
By insertimg these symbols, it seems the shows tend to become popular and generate a huge audience. 
Why is that really? Shows that have little symbol presense inside them do not have a huge presense in the media. Could be that it is given the most publicity and we have been decensitized into attracting the symbols in our life to a point that we cannot even know if its right infront lf us. </p>

<p>The propaganda of the msm relies on people who come home from work and choose the most easily accessible source of information and confirm any biases using different-in-name yet identical-in-agenda sources.

    <div class="md"><p>Not who you responded to, but I saw that and read the post about it here a couple of weeks back. Whenever my stepdaughter is on YouTube, I ask her almost compulsively what she&#39;s watching and I&#39;m always listening. I also changed my YouTube history settings (I used to have it set to not collect any viewing history) so that I can go back and check. She&#39;s 9 and enrolled in gymnastics. She loves watching gymnastics on YouTube so when I saw some of the shit a few weeks ago (the videos and comments) I was nauseous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post op...and I agree 110%. The human soul is under attack. Relationships are being brought to the most superficial of levels by a media that enshrines itself within a false benevolence. The true spiritual nature of love is being erased by a digital artificial world and medias intentional corruption of the mind.</p>

<p>The true nature of what it means to be a man is now being attacked by cultural Marxism and Feminism. The once familiar roles of men and women in society are now being blended, confused and erased...that confusion rears its ugly heads in marriages...divorce rates soar because nobody is fucking happy with the &quot;new&quot; demented way of arranging what nature has intended. Men are being feminized, women are being masculinized...and the unhappy confusion is taking hold around the world...and people are still eating this evil bullshit all up as  something that makes men and women equal...no, it&#39;s just fucking us all up...as intended by the psychotics who are programming this total mindfuck upon us. <a href="http://www.karenrauchcarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yin_and_yang.png">The Ying and the Yang</a> of society is turning completely gray and losing its definition.</p>

<p>Get rid of that insidious cable tv and its MSM programming and corruption of the soul and mind. Get back to NATURE and the natural world. READ good books. TALK to your loved ones and people of all cultures...and get your sorry ass face out of your fucking cell phone and be aware of your surrounds and actually try to have a conversation with those around you. WAKE THE FUCK UP!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hollywood has been pushing abusive women in marriages for 30 years now. They want women who enslave men with the control of sex. Basically, they want to teach women to expect men to bend the knee in hopes that they will eventually get sex. </p>

<p>All evil power equates to the power to enslave and women have typically been more angelic in America. The cabal probably noticed this and decided to ruin women and their relationships with men. Also, the family unit is mankind&#39;s most successful intuition and so they are targeting that as well. </p>

I thought this was going to be a piece on the corporate mainstream media, which is entirely bullshit news designed to confuse and divide the people.<br/>
Industrialized pop culture can also be bad for you. Shows like GI Joe and Transformers are obviously Pentagon psyop entertainment that warps our minds and allows us to excuse the hyperviolence of the US military industrial complex.<br/>
There&#39;s plenty of good music, and good movies out there. It&#39;s only when art was manufactured in an industrial manner, for the purpose of mass consumption, that it&#39;s value is diminished.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent write-up. This is a subject I&#39;ve been studying myself for the past few years. All media is propaganda, all media is thought control. And it is very very effective. </p>

<p>20% of the population is easily hypnotized, 60% moderately so, and 20% are immune to hypnotism. The video image (movie, tv, smartphone, tablet, monitor) quickly changes the brainwave state of the viewer and puts most into a semi-hypnotic state. Couple this with how much time people stay in front of a screen then we can safely assume that 80% of the population is regularly in a hypnotic trance. Of course hypnotism is just one form of thought control, there are many others.</p>

<p>One other very important point. Just because one knows that media is being used to manipulate it&#39;s viewers, does not make one immune from it&#39;s affects if one chooses to consume it. As the poster said, the current media environment is poison. I label it as toxic and dangerous. I have not had a TV for 4+ years, do not have a Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon account. Stopped listening to the radio years ago. I still watch video, but have become very careful what I watch, and basically do not watch any recently produced content.</p>

<p>If you want to be FREE, then you must free yourself from the the primary tool(s) used to enslave us... media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly American big budget productions feature more violence than moving images from other cultures. The romance/sex is also censored and abbreviated, with the relationships forced and the sex quick, like it is just about mating and not about a bond. But these things have always been attributed to &quot;commercial value&quot;, that viewers both American and intntl want explosions, fist fights and a hookup in every movie. It doesn&#39;t matter if that&#39;s actually true. Hollywood decision makers are very superstitious and this is what they believe a show needs to make a return.</p>

<p>There are obvious and open propaganda relationships, very similar to what USSR did with their industry, wherein military will let a production show their equipment if it agrees to script alterations. I thought you would have discussed some examples of this.</p>

<p>Even your most compelling mention of rap as a base expression of desire for economic, sexual, violent dominance is lacking in examples. I bet there is some intel involvement in promoting that type of material, but it can again be attrtibuted to superstition. Entertainment is a frenetic fewst or famine business full of superstitious pigeons looking for their next hit/show/payday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think youre right. Seriously. Its like the first reaction to an opinion differing is violence or public shaming.
Its so easy to fall into the trap because its everywhere. 
I think, and call me whack, is that the adultery that is glamorized on the media by dysfucntional people, is to destroy the community structure that we crave as humans. To push us further away to where it is a single parent raising their child, who may not even have time to raise the child because they work so hard to support, feed, and clothe them. This is where media steps in further. Media comes in and tells the almost parentless, directionless, child of a single mother what it &quot;means to be a man&quot; and that men do this and that, and makes people believe that this is normal to act horrible, when it is not. The media raises them. Ive been a victim of it. A lot of people have.</p>
