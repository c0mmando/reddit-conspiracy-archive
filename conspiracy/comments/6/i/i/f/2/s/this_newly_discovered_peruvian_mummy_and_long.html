       It's time to wake up to the fact that extraterrestrials have shaped in extraordinary ways. This is all a part of the unveiling which will propel us into the next age of mankind... we are not alone, and never have been.

       Angels (fallen or not) were created as immortal spirits. They are
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       bound by the laws of this world. In fact they play a role in enforcing what we observe as the Laws of "Nature".
      </p>
      <p>
       They can transmute into shapes, objects, even present themselves as fleshly men so perfectly that most ppl are unaware of their presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've observed them with my own eyes, the movement and instant direction changes alone prove they are not of this realm, but they are not ETs, rather inter-dimensional is more approporiate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fallen ones lie and deceive people. They are tricksters, and retain a
       <em>
        portion
       </em>
       of their former God given power. They use the same parlor tricks as they have in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many different
       <em>
        types
       </em>
       of them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       "And each went straight forward. Wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the living creatures. And the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. And the living creatures darted to and fro, like the appearance of a flash of lightning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them. As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl. And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel. When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went. And their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels." -

       God is an eternal, immortal Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       He created other immortal spirits before mankind (angels). 1/3 of these fell and started an angelic war/mutiny (they have free will and can choose to accept, or reject the one True Living God, just as we can.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the earth was created, along with flesh (all types, fish, animals, men).

       Our ancient had something that we do not. We're missing a link they had..our math and science is supposed to be far superior but our structures will be wiped out in less than 1000 years. While theirs remains standing, buried and element battered. Truly mindblowing.

       We "comprehend" to the best of our knowledge. But our current ideas for how they did this is easier to disprove than actually prove. Like I said they understood something we are missing. I actually think the old world was a once thriving global civilization..what happened I cannot say for certain but a lot of theories point towards some cataclysmic event.

       Well they have predetermined thoughts on non-terrestrials and simply due to their ignorance assume it is fake but their belief system does not allow for this to exist. Take a look at all of the comments dissenting in the forums for this entity. All they do is claim it looks fake based on appearances. NONE of them can counter the science and research being done so they stick to a logical fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously the shills and zealot skeptics will dismiss this immediately. I just hope those ignorant of the facts don't immediately dismiss it. There is still research to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all one can do is say it looks fake then that person is neither being critical nor looking at the fucking facts. It looks odd and that is for sure. Who the fuck is to say that a decomposing body of another species would not look like this. Shills and zealot skeptics do not look at evidence and use tyeir rhetoric to confuse the ignorant public. I hope the evidence is shoved down their throats then maybe they can choke on that.

       Whilst you might be right, are all the others in the video [cat scan doctors, the woman, all other photographers and journalists etc] all fake as well?
What about the samples and the lab that will test them? Are they dodgy?
Personally, just because someone is interested in the non conventional and believes it, doesn't make them a quack. It makes them an enthusiast if their overall goal is finding out our history or life and death in general.
It is surely a very good hoax so far, I will only be convinced or not once the DNA findings are out.
Exposing hoaxers is one thing, stifling people who are trying to go against the norm is quite another.

       I'll try to look up the three fingered alien later but first, this is what I found when looking up Jaime Maussán...
      </p>
      <p>
       Jaime Maussán is linked to an earlier hoax stemming in May 2007 Mexico known as the "Metepec creature", alleged to be a baby alien caught in a rat trap but was later debunked in December 2012 by Channel 4 (UK) as a prank by a bored taxidermist with too much time on his hands and access to a rare breed of Marmoset. Urso Moreno Ruíz (who used the alias Angel Palacios Nuñez) was filmed making his confession to the prank. He had earlier confessed on an online forum to the prank (

       accused Jaime Maussán, Mario Moreno and Marco Salazar of creating the fraud.

       Mario Moreno sold the creature to Jaime Maussán for 300,000 pesos ($23,000).

       There's a lot of drama surrounding the people involved (if you Google their names) in the discovery so I'll just leave two links for anyone curious.
