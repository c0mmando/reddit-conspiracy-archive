       I think Julian did not want to be marginalized.  If he came out and stated that he subscribes to 9.11 conspiracies it would have been a lot harder to work with MSM outlets, and Wikileaks would have had a harder time operating.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was mistaken in his judgments that there is no evidence to support 9.11 as a conspiracy.

       Siding with 9/11 truthers is a social death sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange is a very mysterious figure indeed, but he is certainly calculating.  If he is working with some sections of the wealthy elite, Assange would need to keep his credibility as high as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a security perspective, only releasing leaked documents without taking political positions (save on the 1st Amendment) is probably a tactic to try and not get assassinated.  Many in power do wish Assange dead and he may never walk free again despite his attempts to stay neutral at all times.

       It's quite possible he is compromised, or always has been.  I would like to believe this isn't so and that he really is genuine in his pursuit and spreading of truth and information.

       1) He is limited hangout US intel asset
2) He has a complex and nuanced view of 9/11 similar to what many of us suspect but stays mum because he cannot prove it and in terms of PR and MSM coverage,  staying quiet and towing the line is the only way he will continue to receive interviews and the occasional empathetic ear. He is not a stupid man.
3) He has 9/11 evidence that he is waiting to release. He knows if he times it poorly, he will be disbelieved and killed or subjected to even worse torture than at present. Perhaps he is even waiting to reveal it after his death. He is not a stupid man.

       Noam Chomsky and a number of other professional critics are similarly positioned.

Not all of our "heroes" are going to publicly project taboo viewpoints. Certain statements get you utterly ostracized eg Helen Thomas. The smart ones know the game they're playing much better than we do.

       Although there is evidence that something screwy happened there, there's not exactly a lot of hard, concrete proof of the fuckery. I can understand people not being willing to use words like "inside job" or "false flag". I'm not sure exactly what happened either, the only difference for me is that I'm not the head of a major journalistic organization and I can afford to take a harder stance despite not having absolute proof of the conspiracy's specifics.

       Unfortunately neither science nor facts have been involved in this. The NIST report is missing the most vital research, debris was got rid off before anyone could apply any science.
Further science [that of physics] is actually saying [well only over 2000 demolition experts, architects and physicists anyway] that something is not right about what we are told and what we can see with our own eyes.
The government must be glad to hear that some people buy their crap without questioning and do the dirty work for them by calling anyone who is doubting the official fairy tale 'uneducated'.
well I am educated BSc [hons] and I still say that if something sounds like bullcrap and doesn't make sense, it's usually just that.
No feelings involved, just a lack of evidence for the official version and plenty of evidence for the rational people version.

       Problem is that what we see (or think we see) doesn't prove anything. We wouldn't have magic if your vision was a 100% accurate representation of reality.

       There isn't a single piece of "9/11 conspiracy evidence" I have seen  that hasn't been debunked.

       There is even a blacksmith heating up the same kind of steel they used in the buildings to show at which point it turns into spaghetti. Of course he might be lying (again, our eyes etc..), but then all other information about the structural integrity of steel is also lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the experts, we really have no idea what they where told or what questions they were asked.

       PS: There is "experts" saying that the world is flat. Some scientists also believe that the world was created 6000 years ago.

       Please don't tell me you have just put flat earth nutters and people with degrees and visible skills in one pot to make a point?
It's like comparing the town freak with a professional working person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please never compare those again. The flat earthers can immediately be silenced with a short demonstration in science and if they don't believe their own eyes then there is something majorly wrong with them.
The others [architects, demolition experts] are highly educated/trained and employed to give visible results that don't kill people. How can you lump them together...at all?

       Just look at the infrared videos on youtube. Without a doubt, clear as fucking autocalibrated flir infrared camera can be, the temperature of the fires was kot hot enough to weaken steel let alone melt aluminum or steel.
