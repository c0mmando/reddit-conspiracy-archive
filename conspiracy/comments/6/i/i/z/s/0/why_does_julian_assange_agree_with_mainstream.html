    <div class="md"><p>Siding with 9/11 truthers is a social death sentence.</p>

<p>Assange is a very mysterious figure indeed, but he is certainly calculating.  If he is working with some sections of the wealthy elite, Assange would need to keep his credibility as high as possible.</p>

<p>From a security perspective, only releasing leaked documents without taking political positions (save on the 1st Amendment) is probably a tactic to try and not get assassinated.  Many in power do wish Assange dead and he may never walk free again despite his attempts to stay neutral at all times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) He is limited hangout US intel asset
2) He has a complex and nuanced view of 9/11 similar to what many of us suspect but stays mum because he cannot prove it and in terms of PR and MSM coverage,  staying quiet and towing the line is the only way he will continue to receive interviews and the occasional empathetic ear. He is not a stupid man.
3) He has 9/11 evidence that he is waiting to release. He knows if he times it poorly, he will be disbelieved and killed or subjected to even worse torture than at present. Perhaps he is even waiting to reveal it after his death. He is not a stupid man.</p>

<p>Noam Chomsky and a number of other professional critics are similarly positioned.

Not all of our &quot;heroes&quot; are going to publicly project taboo viewpoints. Certain statements get you utterly ostracized eg Helen Thomas. The smart ones know the game they&#39;re playing much better than we do. </p>

Further science [that of physics] is actually saying [well only over 2000 demolition experts, architects and physicists anyway] that something is not right about what we are told and what we can see with our own eyes.
The government must be glad to hear that some people buy their crap without questioning and do the dirty work for them by calling anyone who is doubting the official fairy tale &#39;uneducated&#39;.
well I am educated BSc [hons] and I still say that if something sounds like bullcrap and doesn&#39;t make sense, it&#39;s usually just that.
No feelings involved, just a lack of evidence for the official version and plenty of evidence for the rational people version.</p>

<p>Problem is that what we see (or think we see) doesn&#39;t prove anything. We wouldn&#39;t have magic if your vision was a 100% accurate representation of reality. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a single piece of &quot;9/11 conspiracy evidence&quot; I have seen  that hasn&#39;t been debunked. </p>

<p>There is even a blacksmith heating up the same kind of steel they used in the buildings to show at which point it turns into spaghetti. Of course he might be lying (again, our eyes etc..), but then all other information about the structural integrity of steel is also lying.</p>

<p>Regarding the experts, we really have no idea what they where told or what questions they were asked. </p>

<p>PS: There is &quot;experts&quot; saying that the world is flat. Some scientists also believe that the world was created 6000 years ago.</p>
