<p>McCain is like many within both of the major parties where they put on a public face with public stances but then you look at their positions on issues and how they vote on them and other bills and it&#39;s like they&#39;re a completely different person, because they are, the public face is for us, the private face is for their donors and their party leaders. </p>
