<p>It had to have been easily possible for Adolf to be ushered into a submarine and taken to the Americas. Even old eye witness reports claiming sitings of men who beared the resemblance of the Fuhrer have been circulated throughout the conspiracy world.</p>

<p>What are you&#39;re thoughts on these artifacts being discovered from a High-Level Nazi Party member? </p>

<p>LOL</p>

<p>No, but seriously, yeah. I think there&#39;s significant reason to doubt that Hitler died in Berlin as the Soviets insist that we believe. It would be absolute idiocy to take the word of a communist at face value in most circumstances.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t investigated a lot of the evidence for Hitler having escaped to Argentina, but as I understand it, there is indeed evidence to that end, and I&#39;m open to investigating when I have the time. I&#39;d love to know if they were able to find writings of his after escaping, as I am guessing would exist somewhere, were they not found and covered up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense but it appears the other known high ranking Nazis in Argentina didnt heed the same thought. </p>

<p>Watch some of those shows. Theyre interesting. They even compare a photo of the rumoured tyrant in old age with a young photo. </p>

<p>Cant definitively. No body in Europe adds to the mystery. They even dug up a body, tested it, not him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A skull fragment was subjected to DNA testing by Dr. Nicholas Bellantoni in 2009 and was found to be from a female. But that fragment was recovered from the burial pit by the NKVD about a year after the war. It was not attached to a body, nobody involved in the recovery ever claimed it was his. He died in Berlin. Hitler&#39;s dentist was captured after the war by the Americans. Two of his dental techs were captured by the Russians. Each independently reconstructed the details of Hitler&#39;s dental work from memory. Their reconstructions meshed completely, and they fit with the details of the dental work on the jaw fragments attributed to Hitler AND to the skull X-rays taken of him by his doctor after the July 20 bomb attempt. Bottom line, there is solid forensic proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Hitler died in Berlin.

    <div class="md"><p>No truly &quot;high ranking Nazis&quot; went to Argentina. People like Eichmann, Mengele, and Klaus Barbie were able to escape because the were middle level people. They weren&#39;t being hunted with the same intensity as the real big fish were. Eichmann most likely never even met Hitler, and Mengele definitely did not. The highest level player to disappear with no real info as to his fate was Gestapo boss Heinrich Muller. The people above him were accounted for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is evidence that Nazis were able to go to Argentina at the end of WWII.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that they were able to take so much stuff with them. This isn&#39;t direct evidence for anything to do with Hitler. But it does show they could ship a bunch of Nazi stuff over... and were comfortable enough to do so.</p>

<p>This does make the whole &quot;Hitler escape thing&quot; seem a bit more plausible. If people choose not to believe this, it&#39;s because the idea of Hitler escaping and secretly living out the rest of his life in comfort would really infuriate them.</p>

<p>He died in Berlin. Hitler&#39;s dentist was captured after the war by the Americans. Two of his dental techs were captured by the Russians. Each independently reconstructed the details of Hitler&#39;s dental work from memory. Their reconstructions meshed completely, and they fit with the details of the dental work on the jaw fragments attributed to Hitler AND to the skull X-rays taken of him by his doctor after the July 20 bomb attempt. Bottom line, there is solid forensic proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Hitler died in Berlin. For a detailed account of the forensic exam go to <a href="http://www.nl-aid.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Sognnaes.pdf">http://www.nl-aid.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Sognnaes.pdf</a></p>
