       Hitler escaping imminent doom to Argentina has always been a real, plausible conspiracy theory. With the new evidence provided, could we possibly be looking at actual evidence of a so-called "escape"?
      </p>
      <p>
       It had to have been easily possible for Adolf to be ushered into a submarine and taken to the Americas. Even old eye witness reports claiming sitings of men who beared the resemblance of the Fuhrer have been circulated throughout the conspiracy world.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you're thoughts on these artifacts being discovered from a High-Level Nazi Party member?

       I see what you're getting at, but I don't know if it's plausible that hitler was able to quickly grab 75 of his favorite nazi items including pictures of himself using them—you know, in case he forgot they were his—while fleeing in secret on a boat while the entire public was looking for him.

       I definitely agree that nazis were there, but hitler? I don't think so. Why would they horde his personal items if he was still alive and in contact with them? With pictures of hitler using them? It was deliberate to prove that the items were his and they wouldn't need those if he was still kickin it with them

       I think they were his, I just think he didn't move them. He certainly is dead now, because if he wasn't he'd be 128 years old.

       Right? Such an extensive collection implies highest ranking Nazi in the area. We know there were others.

       I wonder if they met up and reminisced.

       Discovery did a show on it also. As well as others. Btw there are no absolute truths.

       In other words there is a significant amount of evidence. My guess is that this new stash it being so big it belonged to Hitler

       No, but seriously, yeah. I think there's significant reason to doubt that Hitler died in Berlin as the Soviets insist that we believe. It would be absolute idiocy to take the word of a communist at face value in most circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't investigated a lot of the evidence for Hitler having escaped to Argentina, but as I understand it, there is indeed evidence to that end, and I'm open to investigating when I have the time. I'd love to know if they were able to find writings of his after escaping, as I am guessing would exist somewhere, were they not found and covered up.

       Makes sense but it appears the other known high ranking Nazis in Argentina didnt heed the same thought.

       Watch some of those shows. Theyre interesting. They even compare a photo of the rumoured tyrant in old age with a young photo.

       Cant definitively. No body in Europe adds to the mystery. They even dug up a body, tested it, not him.

       A skull fragment was subjected to DNA testing by Dr. Nicholas Bellantoni in 2009 and was found to be from a female. But that fragment was recovered from the burial pit by the NKVD about a year after the war. It was not attached to a body, nobody involved in the recovery ever claimed it was his. He died in Berlin. Hitler's dentist was captured after the war by the Americans. Two of his dental techs were captured by the Russians. Each independently reconstructed the details of Hitler's dental work from memory. Their reconstructions meshed completely, and they fit with the details of the dental work on the jaw fragments attributed to Hitler AND to the skull X-rays taken of him by his doctor after the July 20 bomb attempt. Bottom line, there is solid forensic proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Hitler died in Berlin. For a detailed account of the forensic exam go to

       No truly "high ranking Nazis" went to Argentina. People like Eichmann, Mengele, and Klaus Barbie were able to escape because the were middle level people. They weren't being hunted with the same intensity as the real big fish were. Eichmann most likely never even met Hitler, and Mengele definitely did not. The highest level player to disappear with no real info as to his fate was Gestapo boss Heinrich Muller. The people above him were accounted for.

       They didn't quickly grab anything, there's zero possibility that there wasn't an escape plan laid out for the highest ranking man in the Third Reich. He probably had a personal top secret submarine with ample belongings and provisions for an escape. The public wasn't looking for him, they were fending for their lives against the Allies, namely the Russians.

       This is evidence that Nazis were able to go to Argentina at the end of WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is remarkable that they were able to take so much stuff with them. This isn't direct evidence for anything to do with Hitler. But it does show they could ship a bunch of Nazi stuff over... and were comfortable enough to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does make the whole "Hitler escape thing" seem a bit more plausible. If people choose not to believe this, it's because the idea of Hitler escaping and secretly living out the rest of his life in comfort would really infuriate them.

       Yeah, I'm not discounting the theory that Hitler lived in Argentina and, hell, maybe he married a black lady (though it would be more plausible if he had lived in Brazil instead considering demographics), but

       is neither evidence that the man on the right is, in fact, a Hitler in his 90s (with a thick head of black hair still), nor that the woman standing with him is his spouse.

       He died in Berlin. Hitler's dentist was captured after the war by the Americans. Two of his dental techs were captured by the Russians. Each independently reconstructed the details of Hitler's dental work from memory. Their reconstructions meshed completely, and they fit with the details of the dental work on the jaw fragments attributed to Hitler AND to the skull X-rays taken of him by his doctor after the July 20 bomb attempt. Bottom line, there is solid forensic proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Hitler died in Berlin. For a detailed account of the forensic exam go to

       The FBI files are nothing more than a collection of rumors and stories which were reported to their offices and were duly investigated as they should have been. These were then thrown in the crank files when nothing developed. Go through them yourself, you will not find one page in which anyone states that they found anything of substance in them.

       It was presented by the Argentinian they interviewed as a photo of Hitler in Misiones in 1961. At best, they were fools who swallowed someone else's scam bait without doing a proper examination of it. At worst (and frankly more likely) it was their own doing and they got caught. If they were indeed suckered, they should have stepped up and owned it. But they didn't. Just saying "it's not him" doesn't cut it if they want to claim any sort of credibility or integrity.

       Fascism and the Nazis never died. They only migrated.  Who cares if Adolf died or not, the point is that the knowledge and technology was passed over to the victors of history.  For the U.S...Paperclip.  Why did the space race escalate after?  Social security NUMBERS anyone?
