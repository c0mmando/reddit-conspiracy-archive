       Due diligence of a candidate instead of fawning and buyers regret later. Obama got me, Trump kind of got me, no more ! I don't want to give someone power without being sure it'll be wielded properly.

       Yeah well when does anything positive get passed by the government. I like to have hope some of them aren't corrupt but that's my naivety. This article does nothing to sway me though. I mean she's against more US intervention(apparently) so I can't full on hate her until shown some better evidence than meeting with Assad lol

       This article just talks about how her meeting with authoritarians in Syria was bad and that she had support from Trump. Doesn't mention anything she's done in congress since going to Syria, and doesn't provide any examples of public criticism that it claims she's been receiving in new outlets in Hawaii.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention it was written by someone
       <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/longtime-fighter-shay-chan-hodges-takes-hawaii-rep-tulsi-gabbard-n599371">
        who ran against her and lost
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The main reason this lady was even against her was because Tulsi didn't support certain gun-control bills like the "gun-show loophole" bill (which doesn't even address the "loophole", just makes it harder for operators to even put a gun show on). I'm pleased with what Tulsi has done so far. Does that mean I would vote for her if the election was tomorrow? No. Does it mean I will be watching her more closely as 2020 approaches? absolutely.

       This is the only argument I've ever seen against her. Again, I said I would be watching her more closely.

       Can you provide me something that demonstrates the power of CFR? Because no one here seemed to talk about it at all before people started talking about Tulsi.

       Short, sweet, and VERY informative Expose' on the Council on Foreign Relations, the "CFR". Clinton, Cheney, Obama, Jimmy Carter, Patreus, David Rockefeller, Zibignew Brezinski, and the recent Tulsi Gabbard are all members. It's in incubation tank for future puppets in the political/social realm.

       Ok that's CFR - but Tulsi's speaking about ending US-led regime-change wars and bringing peace to the Middle East by ending those wars. Dennis Kucinich is also a member, which leads me to believe they are 2 of the only peacemakers in CFR.

       The other argument against her I've heard has been how closely tied her parents are to Chris Butler, the founder and guru of the Science of Identity, a religious Hindu offshoot of Hare Krishna some consider a cult.

       The other argument is what people bring up when they can't defeat her on policies, arguments, and positions: They resort to religious bigotry and name-calling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the definition from Google, in case someone needs it: 
"If a person is intolerant of other ideas, races, or religions, we call that person a bigot. The intolerance expressed by that bigot is called bigotry. Bigotry is ugly. There are different types of bigotry — like religious bigotry or racist bigotry."

       I happen to agree with you in this particular case.  That foundation looks to be a pretty healthy take on religion.  However, there are many people who get leery about politicians having strong ties to still-living religious leaders; and sometimes for good reason.  Case in point:  South Korea's former President.

       That was definitely a fiction piece. For one thing, Trump hasn't supported Tulsi. For another, in looking at these links, Tulsi
       <a href="https://www.votetulsi.com/vision">
        indeed supports

       certain gun control bills and

        has at least since 2012.

       The oppo quibble is funny and absurd on its face because none of the gun control bills ever been brought to the floor for a vote, let alone entertained by the Rep-held House.

       This is the only argument I've ever seen against her. Again, I said I would be watching her more closely.

       Can you provide me something that demonstrates the power of CFR? Because no one here seemed to talk about it at all before people started talking about Tulsi.

       Yeah well when does anything positive get passed by the government. I like to have hope some of them aren't corrupt but that's my naivety. This article does nothing to sway me though. I mean she's against more US intervention(apparently) so I can't full on hate her until shown some better evidence than meeting with Assad lol
