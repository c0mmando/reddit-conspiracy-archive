    <div class="md"><p>This article just talks about how her meeting with authoritarians in Syria was bad and that she had support from Trump. Doesn&#39;t mention anything she&#39;s done in congress since going to Syria, and doesn&#39;t provide any examples of public criticism that it claims she&#39;s been receiving in new outlets in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Not to mention it was written by someone <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/longtime-fighter-shay-chan-hodges-takes-hawaii-rep-tulsi-gabbard-n599371">who ran against her and lost</a>.</p>

<p>The main reason this lady was even against her was because Tulsi didn&#39;t support certain gun-control bills like the &quot;gun-show loophole&quot; bill (which doesn&#39;t even address the &quot;loophole&quot;, just makes it harder for operators to even put a gun show on). I&#39;m pleased with what Tulsi has done so far. Does that mean I would vote for her if the election was tomorrow? No. Does it mean I will be watching her more closely as 2020 approaches? absolutely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok that&#39;s CFR - but Tulsi&#39;s speaking about ending US-led regime-change wars and bringing peace to the Middle East by ending those wars. Dennis Kucinich is also a member, which leads me to believe they are 2 of the only peacemakers in CFR. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other argument is what people bring up when they can&#39;t defeat her on policies, arguments, and positions: They resort to religious bigotry and name-calling.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the definition from Google, in case someone needs it: 
&quot;If a person is intolerant of other ideas, races, or religions, we call that person a bigot. The intolerance expressed by that bigot is called bigotry. Bigotry is ugly. There are different types of bigotry — like religious bigotry or racist bigotry.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I happen to agree with you in this particular case.  That foundation looks to be a pretty healthy take on religion.  However, there are many people who get leery about politicians having strong ties to still-living religious leaders; and sometimes for good reason.  Case in point:  South Korea&#39;s former President.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was definitely a fiction piece. For one thing, Trump hasn&#39;t supported Tulsi. For another, in looking at these links, Tulsi <a href="https://www.votetulsi.com/vision">indeed supports</a> certain gun control bills and <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/2012/07/27/breaking-news/candidates-agree-on-ban-of-high-capacity-magazines-for-semiautomatic-weapons/">has at least since 2012.</a> The oppo quibble is funny and absurd on its face because none of the gun control bills ever been brought to the floor for a vote, let alone entertained by the Rep-held House. </p>
