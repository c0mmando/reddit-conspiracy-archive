        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No single ruler/hero is going to fix our world. It is the people as a whole that will. </p>

<p>The current update on the Illuminati&#39;s plan to conquest is to create WW3 so that Zion and Muslims can fight in a massive war which is designed to transfer money from the middle class to the rich through companies that create weapons and oil. Eventually they want the people of the world to be in such a massive state of suffering that they beg the rulers to help them. At this point, the rulers will suggest a 1 world government in hopes that the people will agree but they know that suffering has to be really bad for this to work which is what they are working on now. </p>

<p>How are they doing this more or less? They simply vacuum money out of the economy. They know that there has to be a certain amount of cash in society so that society can flow smoothly. Cash is like oil but if you take out the oil from a car, the engine will eventually be damaged and weakened. For example, if we had a village of 100 people and we wanted to use money, we can&#39;t just print $5 and expect it to work? Of course not. We would want to probably print about $10,000 - $50,000 and see how things flow. This is basically what happened and so the elite decided that they can just find sneaky ways to vacuum up the money from our economy knowing that this would completely disrupt society. The idea is to bring our entire planetary society to its knees. </p>

<p>So we know that money is being used to enslave us since there is such little of it left in America that bosses are paying less in wages and business are unable to generate enough cash to keep up with the expenses so they can&#39;t hire as many people. Also, since the elite are getting massively wealthy by stealing our money, they are buying out everything. Amazon is about to buy Whole Foods for over 10 billion dollars which is nothing to Amazon. </p>

<p>The Rotshschild family along with the rest of the Illuminati have created a free for all where they create fake wars for profit, fake diseases for profit, refuse to release cures to diseases for money, create fake foundations for tax-free profit, ect... Basically, they perverted the entire purpose of money and used it to enslave mankind and spread endless suffering around the world. They are just getting going. It will be worst in the future unless they are stopped. </p>

<p>JFK tried to help us and they killed him. Nobody really knows if Trump is for us or not but the elite have successfully fooled us into thinking the Illuminati stooge Presidents of the last 200 years were here to serve us. Most every time, US presidents have been working directly for the Illuminati. </p>

<p>Here are the solutions for some of our major problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Money - We can experiment with a new economic model called Sacred Economics which doesn&#39;t use money or trade whatsoever. To understand this model, imagine the family unit. Everyone in a healthy family household works to keep the household clean and prosperous. Nobody keeps score when they do this. Nobody asks money from the household when they take out the trash, cook food, serve food, vacuum the living room, or help the kids with homework. That would be pathetic. They just do it because they are all in cahoots to make a wealthy, prosperous household in the sense of being extremely fluid and functional. The entire country can be run like this. In a nutshell, we would accept everyone to work 5 hours a day by law (anything beyond 5 hours is optional) at any place they desire (encourage people to follow their passions) for 5 days a week. How easy can it be to work a mere 5 hours a day/5 days a week at a job people genuinely love and want. Basically, we all just consume for free and decide together at what we need (IE we might need another bar in CA, another Chinese restaurant in NY, another museum in MI, ect..). The only reason we put these businesses up is because the people desire them. The whole thing would be free anyone. All works is free. All consumption is free. The ownership rule is that the people own everything and so when someone is keeping onto something, we will call it caretakership instead of ownership. If Bob is using a TV, he is the caretaker of that TV. When Bob no longer needs the TV, he recycles it back into the economy by giving it away to someone who needs it and this person will now be the caretaker of the TV. The way to bring this into fruition is to build a website directory of businesses who agree with the new economic model and want to participate. When enough people participate, we send out newsletters and make phone calls to establish a date when we will begin the new economic system. It might be Jan 1, 2018. Once the day comes, money becomes obsolete because the people said so. In this way, we take life into our own hands like we are supposed to be doing. Also, anyone who goes to college won&#39;t have to work because college is work. More info on Sacred Economics here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs&amp;t=204s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs&amp;t=204s</a></p></li>
<li><p>Laws. First of all, we have to admit that we cannot legislate morality. We all know the morale code within ourselves. Everyone knows right from wrong. We need to agree that we all have an internal weight system to weigh out certain behaviors to determine if they are evil or generally good. We can all use this weight system to determine if our actions will cause harm to others. For example, murder, robbery, rape, physical assaults, ect... are all considered harmful to other people. Everyone knows this. There is no reason to make hundreds of thousands of laws outlining every little evil that can possibly happen. People are manipulating these laws in court anyway. Instead, we create moral guidelines and educate the youth in school and the masses on TV. The moral guidelines is that we all have to listen to our inner weight system and determine if something is a selfish attempt to harm others for self gain. When serious things do happen, we take everyone to court where a jury hears the story and votes to see if intentional evil for self-gain was made. If found guilty, instead of throwing the civilian into a monkey cage, we send him to a loving rehab center where well-trained, wise nurses educate the individual on why crime doesn&#39;t pay and how to accomplish what he wanted to accomplish without crime. If the person is too dangerous and cannot be in society, we will put them in a small rehab city specifically made for criminals. This way, we can quarantine them in a city instead of an inhumane monkey cage. We will basically replace an entirety of legal mumbo jumbo that is so often manipulated in court and which costs us so much time and expense with a common sense approach where a jury decides and punishments are replaced with rehab. Btw, the reason punishment doesn&#39;t work is because the culprit always resumes his behavior once the punishing hand is out of the picture. A wild teenager might be obedient to his parent but once the parent is off to work, he will resume his behavior. Since beliefs cause behavior, to alter behavior, one has to alter beliefs through educational methods. </p></li>
<li><p>Government. Government has to be completely open source so that anyone can inspect and see exactly what is happening at anytime. This transparent system will make hiding shady behavior very difficult. Pretty much all positions in government has to be very short so that we can cycle mankind through government. Anyone should be able to jump in or out of a government job anytime they want regardless of the position within government but they should only be able to serve a maximum of 2 years regardless of the position. The idea is to cycle the civilian population thoroughly through government so that as many people as possible can see what&#39;s happening from within. This way, shady behavior becomes even harder to hide. </p></li>
<li><p>Since all property belongs to the people, hoarding resources and technology is not allowed. This means, we can release our 50-100 years worth of hoarded technology which will boost society up lightning fast. Also, they are hoarding about 1000 years or so worth of a whole variety of resources (wood, steel, plastics, ect..). These hoarded resources will be found and allowed to enter the main stream economy so that we will have enough for whatever we need. </p></li>
<li><p>Education will be reworked so that it actually teaches people who to be successful human beings in general. As of now, education teaches people everyone except how to be successful which is done intentionally. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The rest of the stuff is fairly easy to figure out. We only need to coordinate together to jump start our plans. We can&#39;t really do much unless we get off our dependency on money and trade which is covered in #1. Once we get rid of money/trade, we will be totally free to do almost anything we want because everything is free. We are essentially oiling up the system to max capacity by dumping money. With this kind of freedom, we can arrange plans to hold meetings with government, protests, or whatever to further our goals of peace and property. Protestors, ect.. would not have to work because protesting is a job too. Once we get to this point, it would all get very easy. </p>

<p>The only thing that is required by all people is cooperation. We have to stop thinking in selfish terms and think in planetary wealth terms where we turn this whole planet into a wealthy abode for all of us. It is 100% doable and I have laid out a roadmap that can be altered and upgraded as we go. </p>

<p>The one thing everyone has to admit, without a shadow of a doubt, is that people have to save people. We have been fooled into thinking a single man in government is some kind of hero that is going to help the whole world but we are constantly disappointed when we realize we were lied to and played for fools. Then, another cuck shows up claiming the same thing and we get all excited until the day we realize that we were, yet again, played. Then another stooge pops up and claims he has all the answers to society and that he will guide us into the golden age of man, but by the time his term in done, the people are disillusioned that the country is in worst off shape than it was before. We have been fooled for thousands of years but we are smarter and more sharp now. We are more educated and we have more access to each other thanks to the internet where we can share ideas and coordinate with each others. A lot of people dread doing something challenging but very beneficial (IE going to college) but everyone knows it is well worth it and once the hard part is over, true freedom is felt and suffering goes away. What an awesome reward. Everyone can agree this is what they want. </p>

<p>First thing first is preparing the mind by doing a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Eliminate racism, prejudicial attitudes, ect.. and replace it with the thought that everyone can be a useful tool in society. Someone might not like Chinese people but a Chinese man is still a good worker that we can team up with to build the country up. Everyone holds major value. Value is in the person, not a piece of paper. </p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate fear which is a form of control. The secret to eliminating fear is to not think about the future or the past and stay in the moment of now at all times. Fear only exists outside of the now when we imagine the worst possibilities. Fear is a major control tool. </p></li>
<li><p>Americans are brainwashed to be selfish regardless of who it hurts which causes a lot of problem. Instead of this, we need to always consider what is most fair to all parties currently involved. Instead of thinking of people all as separated individuals, we can think of ourselves as one, united organism which is what we really are. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>That is what can be done right now. Overall, we need to mentally prepare ourselves to pick ourselves up from our bootstraps and fix this country and hopefully the whole world. We cover every square inch of this world and we are 7 billion strong VS the 10,000 psychopaths who have a very different future in mind for us which is a future of pain, suffering, and enslavement. We need to admit that we are extremely powerful when united. One day we will see how extremely powerful a united people are. The power we are talking here is mind boggling and cannot be imagined but it can be understood through experience. This is what is called positive power which is the power to build and is the opposite of the type of power the Illuminati uses which is the power to enslave. </p>

<p>Willpower + Faith = Action   </p>

<p>Love + Understanding = Cooperation</p>

<p>We only need to settle our minds into these thinking patterns since the mind is where everything starts and ends. Everyone is responsible for adjusting their own self to optimize the hive-mind of humanity so that it can work towards prosperity harmoniously. Everyone is a leader and has to do what they can from their corner of the world to help bring these things into fruition and by doing so, it shall be. This is summed up in a genius statement from the 80&#39;s: Just Do It. Everyone needs to put a little bit of effort because a little bit of effort spread across millions or billions of people is what leads to change. The first step in everything is always making adjustments within the mind to prepare itself for future action and that can be done right now by everyone without much effort at all. </p>

<p>You have been manipulated to think that. Selfish as an individual is much worst than being selfish as a planet. Would a selfish planet permit homelessness? It would eradicate it asap. Selfish as the 1 group that we are is productive but the &quot;every man for himself&quot; motto is destructive which is why the elite pushed this manipulation on us not to mention, that is the way they operate so if you approve of this behavior the you will automatically approve of their behavior. Your consent gives them power.</p>

<p>We never didn&#39;t have the technological tools to work together.  By the time our ancestors became anatomically modern they were reliant on cooperation for their survival.  We&#39;ve always had to work together to stay alive so all our ancestors had the tools to do so.  </p>

<p>Oh? Then you not be aware that before we were semi-civilized we were semi-barbaric and before that we were barbaric and before than we were semi-savage and before that we were full blown savages. </p>

&#39;&#39;In Good News, Edward Abbey’s acclaimed underground classic, the West is wild again. American civilization as the twentieth century knew it has crumbled. In the great Southwest, a new breed of settler, whites and Indians together, is creating a new way of life in the wilderness—a pastoral economy—with skills and savvy resurrected from the pre-industrial past. Meanwhile, in a last surviving bastion of urban life, the remnants of the power elite are girding their armed forces to re-impose the old order. This is a land of horses and motorcycles, high-tech weaponry and primitive courage, and the struggle for the American future is mounting in intensity. No quarter is asked or given, and the outcome hangs in perilous balance against a background of magnificent nature and eternal human verities.&#39;&#39;<br/>

Before the population can both understand how to, and have incentive to act in their own best interest they need to first realise the farce that is the politics matrix. It&#39;s just a way for the elite to divide the people and rule while making the population believe they rule themselves, united. So long as people believe in practicing politics (at the very least in the way we understand &quot;politics&quot; in its current incarnation) then we won&#39;t be able to break out of the slavery and truly live with freedom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have a built in law system inside of us. That is our internal weight system that determines right vs wrong. We all have it. If any disputes come up because of harm caused that wasn&#39;t fixed, we send the people to court so a jury of 12 can figure it out. </p>

<p>For example. Jack breaks Joes furniture in a fit of rage. The jury finds Jack guilty of breaking basic moral codes and sends him to a certain rehab program the judge deems would be best for Jack so that this problem doesn&#39;t happen again in the future or it is at least greatly reduced. </p>

<p>Right now, lawyers are like idiots in a court room always looking for ways to turn the court into a circus by manipulating laws by dissecting every word in a way that benefits the criminal and so rich criminals are always set free even though they commit the most crimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you say about the legal system is true. However, bad people cannot always be rehabilitated. What you misunderstand is that evil is manipulative and will take kindness for weakness. Evil flourishes because they use trickery, manipulation, intimidation and force. Good people follow a code of honor evil does not. Your idea kindness nurturing evil will not work. Christ cursed the tree that produced no fruit. It&#39;s ok to curse bad fruit and throw it out. I myself believe that evil is a scourge and an infestation in public institutions. It&#39;s out of control, and the public has tolerated and allowed evil to flourish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not, when society returns good for evil, it will calm the raging hearts of the evil people. Right now, society returns evil for evil. Not only does it not help the culprit, but it fucks up our entire society. </p>

<p>One day I was talking to an ex-gangster who went to AA and fucked up the Turkey on Thanksgiving by putting his hands in it and tearing pieces off. When he turned around, the lady running the Thanksgiving dinner smiled and offered him desert without any sort of judgment. That single incidence convinced the gangster to stop being a gangster. The best way to label what happened here is love conquered evil. </p>

<p>Evil for evil doesn&#39;t work. Look at how horrific our prisons are. If anyone is too dangerous to live in society, they will be moved into a city where they cannot leave but have to live in a constant state of rehabilitation. Some European countries (I believe Finland) are already doing this to their criminals and there is never any rape, theft, murder or anything. These people have 8 inch cooking knives and never use them. They just like like normal people and these are the worst of the worst criminals (ie murderers). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that. I am more concerned with evil entities/ cabal that are probably more intellectually evolved taking advantage of humanity. Small time criminals who make choices because of limited options and a poor sense of values is deifferebt. 
There is an experiment I heard about where they some mice were addicted to heroin. One group was put in over crowded dirty cages. The other was put in the ideal cage for a mouse with lots of fun mouse toys and ideal living living conditions. The group that was in the ideal cage had no interest in heroin even though it was available. The group in the over crowded cage preferred heroin over water. I will try to find the link. I was simply told about it though. So I might be remembering a detail wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the idea is to stop playing the cabals game. If we keep playing their game, we will end up losing. It is designed to destroy us. If we get out of the cabal game, we need to have a replacement for sure or else it would be anarchy. All that debt shit would have to be canceled and I&#39;m sure we would all agree to do it at once. We need to get rid of credit scores too so they can&#39;t use it against us. We just ignore them. They can&#39;t arrest all of us. They will just huff and puff for a couple of weeks and then realize that there is nothing they can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say that money is the underlying tool to enslave us and basically control the world, which I agree with.</p>

<p>Then you point to Sacred Economics as an alternative.  I&#39;m not disagreeing with this, it might be a viable alternative, but I think you&#39;re omitting another <em>major alternative</em>.</p>

<p>Digital currency, or cryptocurrency, is an alternative money system based on blockchain technology.  It&#39;s 100% peer to peer, open source, decentralized, and has many characteristics that make money sound.  I&#39;m more confident in this being a practical alternative than Sacred Economics.  For the forseeable future, people in this world will need to trade and have a unit to quanity fair exchange of goods and services.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We will have a website where people can collaborate on what&#39;s needed. So, if we look up Austin, TX, we might find these openings:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Trash Man</p></li>
<li><p>Biologist</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Considering there are millions of people in the region, we would expect someone with a high school diploma to sign up for the trash job. Keep in mind, a trash man would no longer be looked at a shit job but rather as an honorable job. We will be thanking this man for freely choosing to be a trash man. Also, a lot of these drudgery jobs will be replaced with robots once we get our hoards of secret technology the cabal is holding back from us so a lot of these types of jobs will be run by the robots.</p>

<p>Since college is considered work, someone fresh out of college, with a passion for biology and a degree in biology, will be the one to take the biology job. Instead of making many, people will be improving the world. For example, a biologist might find a cure for some disease within an rare African plant. He or she will bring that cure to the forefront of society and will be honored for it. Napolean once said that soldiers are willing to die for badges since badges equate to recognition. The biologist who already loves biology would gladly accept honor for the cure he or she discovered. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t stop it from being a dangerous, hard, and smelly job.</p>

<p>Unless when said biologists was forced to work on something else.  Remember your society is based on using force to get people to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, people are forced to work a measly 5 hours, 5 days a week but they are instructed to follow their own passion. Why should they follow their own passion? Because work isn&#39;t work when its fun plus they do a better job. We have basically eliminated brutal work and turned it into productive fun. </p>

<p>As far as the trash job, think of society in percentages. The top 1% are service orientated and would gladly take the job if it meant helping the people. The bottom 1% are more self-orientated (selfish) and would probably avoid honorable jobs like trash pickup. There will always be someone to fill the job. We have 300 million bodies in this country so there is plenty to go around. </p>

<p>Nobody keeps score when they do this. Nobody asks money from the household when they take out the trash, cook food, serve food, vacuum the living room, or help the kids with homework.
