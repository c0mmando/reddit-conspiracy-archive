       I was in high school in 1989 in San Bernardino, California. Medflys (Mediterranean fruit flies) were big in the news. An organization calling themselves The Breeders claimed they released the flies as a form of bio-terrorism in retaliation for the state spraying its citizens with malathion.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malathion">
        Malathion
       </a>
       is a pesticide that is carcinogenic to some degree and has been suspected of causing ADD (of course that's never been proven). Our teachers were required to tell the students to make sure to cover our cars and turn off air conditioners when they were spraying and to keep all pets inside and to absolutely not go outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a teacher who was in her mid 60s and she was a conspiracy theorist who had a POW flag hanging in the classroom. She told us that the medfly stuff was bullshit and that they had stopped spraying actual malathion a couple years before. When people asked why we were still doing the spraying she didn't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       One night in June near the end of the school year
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/10/us/california-resumes-air-war-against-invading-fruit-fly-stirring-debate.html">
        there was a series of sprayings
       </a>
       . They usually did it around midnight. I always got up to look out the window because it looked really cool. Imagine seven or eight helicopters flying in a straight line with arms on either side all lit up. (
       <a href="http://leahelicopters.com/hueyspraying.jpg">
        Like this
       </a>
       but at night with lights all over).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my classmates went out shortly after and scraped a sample off of a car and brought it to the teacher. She took it to a friend who worked at a university who analyzed it. She told the class that it was almost pure molasses with some other elements - but no malathion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where it gets weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years later when nobody I talked to remembered anything about all of this (there's no conspiracy in that, just self-centered young people who can't see past their own nose) I met a guy who had lived around the corner from me at the time of those sprayings. He said that his dad said it was all bullshit so he and his dad went outside as the copters were coming (they believed they were just spraying plain water) and he said there was a police officer standing on the corner (two houses down from where I was looking out the window) who drew his weapon and yelled at them to get back in the house. The officer had no protective mask or any other coverings according to this guy (I guess the officer didn't know he was about to be covered in sticky molasses) and he insisted that he did draw his weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Norton Air Force base was in the process of closing at that time (it was finally closed in 1994) and from what other people have said there was a large convoy of trucks leaving the base every time the sprayings were happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've ever seen the movie

       </a>
       ? Dan Aykroyd says "O.K., boss, this LTX-27 concealable mike is part of the same system that NASA used when they faked the Apollo moon landings. Yeah, the astronauts broadcast around the world from a soundstage at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California..."

        They may have been moving UFOs.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After Norton was closed there was a controversy about what to do with the base housing. Everybody thought it would make good housing for low-income families or the elderly but nothing was done. It was bought by the local native American tribe and over a decade,
       <a href="http://www.highlandnews.net/news/old-norton-base-housing-being-demolished/article_98b01b75-2819-5952-b2ac-a9c8b09a54d3.html">
        it was all just torn down
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because the aircraft that was used in the 1940s for nuclear tests were often landed at Norton and washed. All of that radioactive water was allowed to flow down the street and now that whole area is radioactive and not safe.

       I always figured the jet fuel contamination story was a line to get everyone paying for East Valley Water (Mafia aka "Necessary Monopoly") District to build a multimillion dollar compound just outside of town where they can utilize that otherwise senseless and wasteful dam (Seven Oaks Dam, if I remember correctly). And then there's Nestle's involvement with Strawberry Creek. Let's not forget Amazon, Mormon real estate, the drug market, etc.

       Local politicians know that if you want to make connections you need to get in good with East Valley Water.

       Another one is that we San Bernardino is a human trafficking hub. Lots of hand-made "we buy houses for cash" signs the usually don't mean houses. (That's in a lot of other cities too).

       "We buy houses for cash" signs don't usually mean houses?! What the heck, I see these all the time in towns/cities with higher rural populations in my state.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always thought they were for people who wanted to flip properties and avoid taxes or something. It's creepy to think that what they want to buy is not 'houses' at all, Jesus

       I spent a year or so star gazing, and found SB to have quite the interesting sky life. Plenty of con trails, but the real chem trails seem to happen very early in the morning when the sky is clear. Then we have our commercial flights that use this valley as a turning point for landing in Ontario. I've noticed extreme low flying helicopter activity that doesn't have obvious purpose. On one of these occasions a helicopter was flying in circles just over head for about an hour. Fifteen minutes after the helicopter departed we had a substantial earthquake. Fracking is bad, but flying low enough to vibrate fault lines is A-OK, apparently. I've seen high flying craft that looked like a far off star fly in a tight circle just to make a 25 degree turn from original course. I've seen on three separate occasions low flying meteorites going from North to South over Del Rosa as if there's some magnetism to space debris that makes lightning strike the same place multiple times. This is definitely a great place to check out the night sky when we aren't getting choked by LA's mass pollution.
