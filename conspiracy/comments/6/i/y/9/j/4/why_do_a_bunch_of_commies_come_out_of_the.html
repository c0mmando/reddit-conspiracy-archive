       I ask myself this, too. Not sure how "conspiracy theorists" could be down with Statists of any kind. I'm not just saying Socialist, I'm saying Libertarians, as well. Fuck the State/Government, we can self rule, thank ya' very much! To those people, methinks you have a few more rabbit holes to jump down. Here's my hand, let's jump together :)

       I didn't specify what laws or regulations. Just that some basic ones are needed for the benefit of everyone. Having no standard for workers rights and giving the banking industry carte blanche is a recipe for disaster.

       TBH? Baby steps, we could've did it with Ron Paul. But we need a weening. I'm dead serious.. Those of us who feel this way, we should peacefully seize one of the millions islands "owned" by countries.. I'm from the North, so I look at Northern Islands. Many are uninhabited.. Why? Why do they claim them? Fuck them... Lets seize them peacefully... Who is to stop us?  I'm a Voluntaryist... Let's claim our own space and live how we want to.... People are so afraid of this... Lets do it... If we die? So be it, we will die under this system any way.... Why continue it?

       So do you want less State?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lower the taxes
      </p>
      <p>
       Sell all State-owned companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reduce the number of Public Agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reduce the need for welfare by promoting free market (strong economy = more people employed = less people on welfare)
      </p>
      <p>
       Reduce the State regulation on all spheres
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how you get less State.

       That's not Socialism/Communism, hombre. What you're looking for is Voluntaryism, which is what I am. Socialism (and the others) require a State. Anytime a State is involved, they fuck over one group in favor of another group. But yeah, that's compassionate, amirite guise 👌?

       Because most "woken" people are sheeple, themselves... Hate the word, but it's the truth. I have a very open mind, which allows me to go down damn near every rabbit hole you can imagine (and play complete Devil's advocate).
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are others here, like me - but we are a minority (being wedged out) - not too mention the newcomers "normies". I'm crucified for this, though. People are starting to realize this, though. I see it. Topics I was downvoted into hell for in the past, are now being researched and upvoted (not that I care about votes - I care about education/truth).

       The government is the grand conspiracy.  That's where all the secrets are. That's where the power of total destruction lies. That's where psycopaths accumulate.  Government has killed more people than anything except disease. Governments commit atrocities.

       “The proletariat seizes from state power and turns the means of production into state property to begin with. But thereby it abolishes itself as the proletariat, abolishes all class distinctions and class antagonisms, and abolishes also the state as state. Society thus far, operating amid class antagonisms, needed the state, that is, an organization of the particular exploiting class, for the maintenance of its external conditions of production, and, therefore, especially, for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited class in the conditions of oppression determined by the given mode of production (slavery, serfdom or bondage, wage-labor). The state was the official representative of society as a whole, its concentration in a visible corporation. But it was this only insofar as it was the state of that class which itself represented, for its own time, society as a whole: in ancient times, the state of slave-owning citizens; in the Middle Ages, of the feudal nobility; in our own time, of the bourgeoisie. When at last it becomes the real representative of the whole of society, it renders itself unnecessary. As soon as there is no longer any social class to be held in subjection, as soon as class rule, and the individual struggle for existence based upon the present anarchy in production, with the collisions and excesses arising from this struggle, are removed, nothing more remains to be held in subjection — nothing necessitating a special coercive force, a state. The first act by which the state really comes forward as the representative of the whole of society — the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society — is also its last independent act as a state. State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies down of itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The state is not 'abolished'. It withers away. This gives the measure of the value of the phrase 'a free people's state', both as to its justifiable use for a long time from an agitational point of view, and as to its ultimate scientific insufficiency; and also of the so-called anarchists' demand that the state be abolished overnight."

       In this currently uber hostile political climate everyone is calling everyone else every name in the book right now... but nobody is calling anyone Commies. Wierd, right? Especially with all the Russia talk going on... and the criticism of NK but rarely of China.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gotta be communists orchestrating all the tension and division... I don't even know what a commie really is... but the fact that no one is bandying about is suspicious.

       Everyone is simply self advocating.  That means that some exclusionary language and behaviors need to change in order to accommodate.  Don't be slinging the fag word around if your establishment actually tries to hire fairly.

       And if you don't know about the people around you, your sense of decorum should stipulate that you don't assume to know whether or not they are part of a minority group or intimately linked to a minority group.

Bitching about being courteous to people they don't know.  And they make millions of dollars stroking that nasty little hatewolf that runs wild in society, usually amongst the insecure and gullible.  Send me 10$ and god will forgive you for all the bad shit you did this week gullible.

       huh?  i'm for collectivism, guy.  i'm for helping people who need help.  this doesn't have anything to do with the kinda badly designed gov that these people think they want.  the truth is they don't even know how it should be designed, just that there should be one, and that's good enough reason to move forward towards monoculture.  they just don't seem to understand the trap they're walking into - and that's my problem with it.

       Commie here, coming out of the woodwork to share a Marxist perspective on identity politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/08/30/pers-a30.html">
        The socioeconomic basis of identity politics: Inequality and the rise of an African American elite
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Democratic Party, supported by all of the various left-liberal and pseudo-left trends, is particularly aggressive and vociferous on this score. Identity politics, the self-centered, upper-middle-class obsession with race, gender and sexual identity, has become one of that party’s principal pillars.
       </p>
       <p>
        As opposed to earlier periods, today the question of race is not associated with civil rights, with a major program of social reform, with improvements in the social conditions of the working class as a whole and certainly not with socialism. The debate on race is largely built around demands for the allocation of greater economic resources to sections of the black petty bourgeoisie. There is a marked and noticeable absence of democratic demands and sentiments within the leadership of these upper-middle-class movements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The character of the present campaigns, including the narrow and vicious tone of much of the rhetoric about race, can be explained if one examines a singular fact: the sharp growth of social inequality within the African American population.
       </p>
       <p>
        The data suggests that while African Americans still play a very limited role at the heights of the corporate hierarchy, there is a highly significant and influential section that has benefited enormously over the past several decades. These people live in another universe and are deeply estranged from the broad layers of the black working-class population, which has suffered continual impoverishment.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the administration of Richard Nixon onward, US ruling-class policy has been to cultivate a black upper-middle class that would be loyal to the status quo. In return, this layer abandoned any connection to mass struggle, social protest and opposition to capitalism. This helps explain why there is no leading African American figure, in any field, who today speaks for and to the broad masses of the people.

       I didn't specify what laws or regulations. Just that some basic ones are needed for the benefit of everyone. Having no standard for workers rights and giving the banking industry carte blanche is a recipe for disaster.
