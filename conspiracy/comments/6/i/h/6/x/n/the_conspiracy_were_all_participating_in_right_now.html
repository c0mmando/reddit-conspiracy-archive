       The mentality that lead you through making that comment, not just the physical act, but the content itself, somewhat proves the point of your post.

      <p>
       You've been conditioned into spouting memes instead of original thoughts.  Be more cautious.

       I don't think technology means automatic liberation. And I agree, the technology in use can certainly be used to reinforce the current system of power and control. The Basilisk is trying to be born.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it is not predestined to be so. Oh no. Certainly not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wisdom, willpower and compassion... these  aspects of our human nature will be what liberates us. The technology that is here are just the tools we will use.

       Get creative.

       Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?

That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.

       But the meme of "fake news" which steals elections is a creation of the last year or so, clearly meant to detract from the revolting things we learned about human trafficking, elite pedophilia, and general media corruption.

       You clearly haven't read the foundational literature on democracy and it's function. The occlusion around these subjects is quite recent and only functions for those uninterested in

       Sure, why not, I was just reminding everyone (in spades) to stop repeating the "fake news" meme / nomenclature by pointing out that it was a verbal tic pushed around October 2016 by the very news you purport to mistrust.

       Just reminding everyone in spades that a significant portion of world elites engage in pedophilia, murder and cannibalism and we found on through WL.

      <p>
       What are your thoughts on reading WL or about the Satanic pedophilia and murder that was revealed in late 2016?

       If you want to know how the powerful abuse the power they've accumulated there are far less occluded sources than wikileaks. Just read works on the habits of leaders of the first democracies.

       Ask yourself, why isn't this commenter capable of actually engaging in authentic conversation or willing to provide sources for their claims?

      <p>
       Why do they engage in theatrical tricks instead of trying to actually have a meaningful exchange?

      <p>
       Is it possible they're a bot, or an actual human employed by Peter Scheil or Shareblue to push an agenda?
      </p>

       I personally wouldn't accuse them of that. But it's an interesting thought to consider, isn't it?

       Projection much? And a marked change of tone. Algorithm, or boss standing over your shoulder?

      </p>
      <p>
       But I'll play. What is your innocent explanation of the pedo language in the emails, or any of the stuff surrounding James Alefantis? Why is this supposedly humble pizza shop owner calling little girls #hotard on social media? Why is his entire IG pedophilic with IG friends obsessed with child coffins and female child dolls? Do you think it's normal for an adult gay childless man tied up in a political/social circle of a Satanic banking dynasty heiress to have unidentified children taped to ping pong tables? Is it normal when said children have bags under their eyes and look dazed? Wouldn't parents of said children find this creepy, and if not, why would they just not come out and say "Oh yeah we know James you guys are nuts piss off."?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're deflecting. You can't mention anything but generalities because it's not in your code book. Let's gab about specifics of these emails? Nah. Cause I know what you are. And I assure it's time to burn this account it's no good anymore. Also please consider hanging yourself, pedo apologist scumbag.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of these questions have good answers. Assuming you're not a bot

       Is this because they're not doing the things you accuse them off? Not necessarily. More likely that they're just not the stupidest ones in their group of sickos.

       I'm just telling you that you seem to be a moron who thinks they're going to find TRUTH and not FAKE NEWS on the internet.

       Again, this is a wonky fun house mirror way of thought. You insisted on using the term "fake news" but say that sometimes we have to trumpet the truth to the masses because they yearn for it. You did this... on the internet. Wut?
      </p>
      <p>
       Going back and forth between grandiose language about the masses and then saying first-hand leaked emails are occluded, but again refusing to get down to specifics?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which people are you referring to? Do you mean James Alefantis and John Podesta or did you mean it as a generic "these people" so that you again don't have to mention which specifics are unconvincing to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're all over the fucking place.
      </p>
      <p>
       #hotard ? Can I at least get you to admit that James Alefantis shouldn't have posted that on a child's photo and that he and his pedophilic IG circle should be investigated (fairly), but investigated?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just stahp. Stop the shucking and jiving shit is offensive and transparent.

       You clearly haven't read the foundational literature on democracy and it's function. The occlusion around these subjects is quite recent and only functions for those uninterested in
