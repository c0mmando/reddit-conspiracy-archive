    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like a guess to me.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty convinced ancient cave paintings were drawings of plasma discharges and the sun symbolism that came shortly after stemmed from different perspectives of the lining up of Venus mars and Saturn and the product of the reflecting light from Sol behind Saturn.  </p>

<p>A polar lined solar system with electrically charged alike planets on different poles of the central sun.  Something set them differently and the intersecting polarity between the different planets caused Motion instead of locking.  This is probably what created gravity.  The plasma reactions between the differently charged electric bodies in space on a vacuum cause motion because electricity is a binary function moving from charge to opposite charge.  </p>

<p>We are created out of harmonized electricity vibrating as matter in a limited physical space being focused in through our pineal gland when we are awake.  </p>

<p>We are fragmentations of the same original perception and opportunity and our ego creates the illusion that we are individual but we actually share everything.  </p>

<p>Dinosaurs seem like a control mechanism to keep the pieces separated more than they already are.  Gut feeling because any time tptb bank on nostalgia and money making product off of science I get really skeptical.  </p>

<p>Jurassic park was almost just too much for me to not feel like the idea of dinosaurs was being force fed to my childhood.  &quot;Appealing&quot; to my sense of wonder.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really try to confirm my bias so much in regards to dinosaurs though.  I let the information come to me and as it does I definitely see some suspicious connections between limited scientists working on them and the funding.</p>

<p>The associated aftermath of science that came after their discovery and my uneasy feeling with a lot of that on its own doesn&#39;t help my trust in paleo-archeologists on a Dino quest.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that the more I look into the things that the elite are obsessed with I find underlying &quot;truths&quot; that &quot;rewrite&quot; my ideas of how distractions work for the profane.  </p>

<p>We may find out someday the extent of the lies, but the &quot;program&quot; is very well written. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like a guess to me.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty convinced ancient cave paintings were drawings of plasma discharges and the sun symbolism that came shortly after stemmed from different perspectives of the lining up of Venus mars and Saturn and the product of the reflecting light from Sol behind Saturn.  </p>

<p>A polar lined solar system with electrically charged alike planets on different poles of the central sun.  Something set them differently and the intersecting polarity between the different planets caused Motion instead of locking.  This is probably what created gravity.  The plasma reactions between the differently charged electric bodies in space on a vacuum cause motion because electricity is a binary function moving from charge to opposite charge.  </p>

<p>We are created out of harmonized electricity vibrating as matter in a limited physical space being focused in through our pineal gland when we are awake.  </p>

<p>We are fragmentations of the same original perception and opportunity and our ego creates the illusion that we are individual but we actually share everything.  </p>

<p>Dinosaurs seem like a control mechanism to keep the pieces separated more than they already are.  Gut feeling because any time tptb bank on nostalgia and money making product off of science I get really skeptical.  </p>

<p>Jurassic park was almost just too much for me to not feel like the idea of dinosaurs was being force fed to my childhood.  &quot;Appealing&quot; to my sense of wonder.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really try to confirm my bias so much in regards to dinosaurs though.  I let the information come to me and as it does I definitely see some suspicious connections between limited scientists working on them and the funding.</p>

<p>The associated aftermath of science that came after their discovery and my uneasy feeling with a lot of that on its own doesn&#39;t help my trust in paleo-archeologists on a Dino quest.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that the more I look into the things that the elite are obsessed with I find underlying &quot;truths&quot; that &quot;rewrite&quot; my ideas of how distractions work for the profane.  </p>

<p>We may find out someday the extent of the lies, but the &quot;program&quot; is very well written. </p>
