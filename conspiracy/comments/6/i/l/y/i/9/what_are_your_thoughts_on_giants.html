    <div class="md"><p>science has shown that species size is based on oxygen concentration and food supply. So if we extend the human timeline further back (which a recent discovery of an ancient skeleton may do so) then its scientifically viable for giants to exist. Ultimately, i believe they existed and that its being covered up by the scientific community because anything that lends credence to the bible is a zero sum game to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone up this comment chain posted a video explaining why that kind of <em>has</em> to be the case.</p>

<p>Specifically, it brings up the insane torque needed to keep the head of a Brachiosaurus lifted. I think he says it&#39;s something like half a million foot pounds of torque just to keep the head lifted horizontally, as it would need to be. It&#39;s head couldn&#39;t be straight up/down because of the loss of blood pressure that would occur, and a heart large enough to sustain that blood pressure would be absolutely massive.</p>

<p>So the only ways it could really work as we know it is if either gravity was lower/less powerful or something else somehow made their heads lighter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not religious, but more than once the bible mentions &quot;mighty men&quot;, aka nephilim, offspring of &quot;the <em>sons</em> of god and daughters of men&quot;. So basically offspring of &quot;angels&quot; and mankind. The problem is, supposedly, there&#39;s not any evidence of these mighty men existing other than the bible.

    <div class="md"><p>Man I watch a documentary on netflix recently, totally forgot what it was called as it was just something to stare at until bed time. But it brought up the conflict between young and old earth paradigms being the basis of current science and its disagreements with religious doctrine the bible. </p>

<p>It was obviously for the young earth, but it brought up some interesting points and also brought up a lot of flaws. I have a good bud that went to seminary but also has his masters in applied mathematics, definitely up their on the intelligence scale. And the documentary brought up a lot of what him and I have shot the shit about before. </p>

<p>It is definitely a time scale thing. Our current scientific theories and evidence hold up when it is true that we have billions of billions of years of time. But - some stuff with carbon dating and how we extrapolate our history back to the big bang, and even some little moments in the fossil record showing complex ecosystems emerging out of nowhere, very rapidly, on the timescale of like hundreds of years - show little holes in how we are not 100% aligned with the billions of years of time thing. It is truly a best guess sort of deal, as in, most everything would make sense and align if that were true, and for most scenarios it seems to be likely. But their is a good handful of things that get sort of &#39;cold cased&#39; because it actually does align with a young earth type scenario.</p>

<p>Anywho - going back to roomate and I talks, and mind you, very humbly I say we are fairly intelligent people you know. Well rounded at least, mostly sane. But we definitely have given the idea magic existing, giants existing, straight up lord of the ring type shit existing at some point, maybe multiple points in the planets existence. With what we know about the phases the earth went through - if you want to run with the conventional billions of years timeline, there is also time for a full oh I don&#39;t know 10 millennium cycle where humanoids with magic, giants, elves, banshees, all sorts of crap could have existed - even wrote a history that was all destroyed by the point our type comes a long. </p>

<p>We know the atmosphere had different hiccups along it&#39;s development cycle, the earth terrain, continental plates, etc - when the time scale wants to be in the billions you can make all sorts of conjecture as you zoom into the thousands so it is interesting. </p>

<p>What the commonality is that as humans, there is and <em>has been</em> some sort of memetic thing throughout our history where each and every culture develops some sort of spiritual/magical/supernatural ideas. The origin of that, that seed that begins that development of those ideas despite isolation or location or anything is interesting. Is it even something that would exist if never exposed to it? Maybe not. But if that is the case - then that means we have a millennium upon millennium old meme inherent only to our human species where search to find something beyond our selves at some point. Being perfectly religiously neutral in this point I want to elaborate that I mean anything ranging the most bizarre pagan shit you can imagine to the simple idea of luck - everyone is aware of some sort of karmic-esque power beyond us and it is only humans that even consider these sorts of things. So a few things to leave people thinking about. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the earth has had billions of billions of years is it possible that multiple civilizations as great as our own have grown and fallen within a timescale of 10-20 thousand years, perhaps multiple times somewhere in there, despite the harshness of our landscapes and atmospheres? </p></li>
<li><p>If so, within those civilizations could they potentially have been involved with magical/supernatural &#39;powers&#39; directly? Could there have been some species that truly communicated telepathically and we just have no history of them what so ever?</p></li>
<li><p>If not, where do you think we get these ideas from. What do you think primes the minds of most people to search or think about things like the supernatural or spiritual? </p></li>
<li><p>Do you think it something that is innate to all humans or some sort of idea that just happened to be handed down to everyone after every generation and never lost, even though there are so many ideas and technology we lose over even just a couple hundred years, for example go try to learn about how to create and work on steam engines. That knowledge is all but erased even with the internet. So why then does the idea of the spiritual or supernatural persist?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Very interesting stuff to think about.</p>

<p>Giants could have existed. In fact I&#39;ll go ahead and say since we have some mention of them in a text that has been handed down for millenium and nothing to to say contrary that giants did NOT exist, and the fact that we even still have cases of gigantism today. I will say that it is more possible giants are more likely to have been prevalent at some point than not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s a ton of human prehistory that we have yet to discover.  I see no reason why there couldn&#39;t have been an exceptionally large subset of humans who existed before recorded time</p>

<p>Were they 12 foot monstrosities, probably not.  </p>

<p>The other thing to think about, is historically human were smaller than they are now, so someone who was 6&#39; 6&quot; or even 7&#39; back in Roman time would have been perceived as a giant</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great question. It&#39;s a rabbit hole for sure. 
I think it&#39;s related to other world visitors that may have been visiting humanity for a long time. They have suppressed and gas lighted UFO and archeology researchers as standard practice. Project blue book is a great example. Why would they hide this? Rather than why I ask what are they hiding? The Bible talks about nephilim. Is the Bible true? King tut had an elongated skull but it is not ever mentioned by main stream archeology. If it does not fit the theory they are pushing then they ignore it. Maybe this why:

<p>I think secret societies have hidden knowledge that they do not disclose. And work very hard to keep secret.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s is a Urantia book reference for you. If you have looked into it it&#39;s free online to read and listen. Straight revelation.
Here is the one and only reference to the Nephilim in The Urantia Book:    </p>

<p>77:2.3 The postrebellion era on Urantia witnessed many unusual happenings. A great civilization—the culture of Dalamatia—was going to pieces. &quot;The Nephilim (Nodites) were on earth in those days, and when these sons of the gods went in to the daughters of men and they bore to them, their children were the <code>mighty men of old,&#39; the</code>men of renown.&#39;&quot; While hardly &quot;sons of the gods,&quot; the staff and their early descendants were so regarded by the evolutionary mortals of those distant days; even their stature came to be magnified by tradition. This, then, is the origin of the well-nigh universal folk tale of the gods who came down to earth and there with the daughters of men begot an ancient race of heroes. And all this legend became further confused with the race mixtures of the later appearing Adamites in the second garden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also in the Urantia Papers:<br/>
The green race split into three major divisions: The northern tribes were subdued, enslaved, and absorbed by the yellow and blue races. The eastern group were amalgamated with the Indian peoples of those days, and remnants still persist among them. The southern nation entered Africa, where they destroyed their almost equally inferior orange cousins.</p>

<p>64:6.19 (724.9) In many ways both groups were evenly matched in this struggle since each carried strains of the giant order, many of their leaders being eight and nine feet in height. These giant strains of the green man were mostly confined to this southern or Egyptian nation.</p>

<p>64:6.20 (725.1) The remnants of the victorious green men were subsequently absorbed by the indigo race, the last of the colored peoples to develop and emigrate from the original Sangik center of race dispersion.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on giants?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>few and far between.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible they were &#39;real&#39; and we have been mislead? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>certainly, but why should we think so? moving past bare, brutal <em>possibility</em>, i would ask you to consider the <em>probability</em> of this narrative. (just to be clear: i am not implying that said narrative is ludicrously improbable, but many people seem to confuse possibility, probability, and certainty; such confusion considerably complicates investigation of even <em>conventional</em> narratives, let alone <em>conspiratorial</em> ones.)</p>

<p>a final, minor matter: &quot;misled&quot; is the past tense of the verb &quot;mislead.&quot; this correction is not commentary on the truth or falsity of the scenario you proposed, and is offered in the spirit of fraternal charity.</p>
