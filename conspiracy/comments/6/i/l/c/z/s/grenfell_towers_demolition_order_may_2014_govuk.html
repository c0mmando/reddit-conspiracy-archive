      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, I do not understand the implications of that site... who can help? 
It says: 2014, Sep : [...] new overcladding &amp; windows [...]. Status: Completed Not approved

       did a piece about this.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ‘The building works under FP/14/03563’ relate to the refurbishment that are believed to be linked to the rapid spread of the fire, so the demolition notice is not completely irrelevant to the disaster, but it is not, at least according to all the available evidence, the ‘smoking gun’ of a conspiracy theory to get rid of the tower for property development or something similar.

       "Your new post is very misleading.
It is not a demolition order, that's when you're ordered to demolish an unsafe structure, one that is highly dilapidated, or one built without permission.
It's an application for permission to carry out demolition work, demolition work != total demolishment. Any structural alteration requires planning permission. Little more on this application.
And see This about the status of the later works."

       But: a relevant question was asked, and a good answer came out of that. I say: win, and net-gain of information.   :)

       BTW, I now understand why the fire spread inwards:

       graphic shows, that the windows were directly connected to the cladding...
       <br/>
       So when the latter burned down, the appartments were left with no windows (or burned/broken ones). Leavinga gaping hole for the fire to roll in...  source:

       u/lord_Buckethead is correct, in most places in the US anyhow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typically any jurisdiction with a reasonably developed building code, or adopted building code (read: 2012 international building code, for example), will generally require a planning committee review for any work being done on a new or existing building. Such work would include any demolition, where demolition is essentially the removal of any portion of the building. Even cladding/veneer. Some jurisdictions require review and permitting of things such as repainting a retail building (typically to ensure they don't end up with a hodgepodge of different architectural styles in any given area).
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, the grenfell towers would more than likely need to apply for permits, including a demolition permit, in order to remodel/revamp the building.

       This is for the demolition of the external concrete stair on the South East corner. Search for PP/12/04097; the original planning application; look at the D&amp;A Statement and you will find mention of the demolition works required the external stair on South East Corner. The notice of demolition would be subsequently filed by the contractor,
      </p>
      <p>
       This reference to FP/14/03563 is wrong there is no such application type Ive heard of such as an FP ( I've personally secured 3 major planning applications in various London boroughs and one unsuccessful application at RBKC). As well as FP meaning nothing to me there is nothing similar on a search of Grenfell Tower.

       Its not the demolition of the full building but specifically of an extg concrete stair in he corner of the building to allow for additional floor space. Pls read the Design and Access Statement within the original application and you will see this clearly stated. I ask you again do you know anything about planning application procedure in the UK, as this is perfectly normal procedure.

       Are you willfully ignoring where i posted the explanation from Lord_Buckethead?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so here it is once more -

       Here's a quick recap of the thread.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        I posted the application that is clearly viewable on gov.co.uk
       </li>
       <li>
        It was found out what the application actually was for (ie nothing nefarious)
       </li>
       <li>
        Every went on with their life
       </li>
       <li>
        You arrived to tell me what i already know and make claims of fake news.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Now, if you want to keep going with this you're on your own because its getting silly at this point.

       Something i've not seen anywhere is how the grenfell towers are the one council, working class tower block in the richest, most tory land in the UK.
The same constituency that fell to labour by 600 votes in the election a few days prior. I can imagine some rich faceless men shouting that they will burn them out of the constituency to stop that happening ever again - such a failure of the 1% to control the populous when they're losing their own areas to the poor.
I bet you all of those people that survived will be off out of kensington
