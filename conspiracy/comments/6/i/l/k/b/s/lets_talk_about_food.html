White processed flour causes inflammation, diabetes, and cancer. What&#39;s left? Fresh veggies and fruit. Monkeys do pretty well with mainly fruit. I heard recently 80 percent fruit, 20 percent veg is our ideal diet. What about protein? Can the human body create protein without directly eating nuts and meat? I&#39;m sick of being sick and tired and waking up with diarrhea. When I fast I feel amazing then go back to eating grains and meat and feel like crap. The food industry pushes terrible food that causes sickness and the answer is blood pressure and acid reflux pills? If this isn&#39;t a conspiracy I don&#39;t know what is. </p>

<p>The articles are literally about how these studies generate a lot of buzz because of headlines, but then can&#39;t be replicated in follow up studies.

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Everything in those videos can easily be staged. You can attribute the weight loss to juice, or to simply the fact that they had massive unhealthy caloric deficit for awhile and exercised a lot. There are videos where they say coconut oil is healthy and then show people thinner after they use coconut oil for a certain amount of time. Same with other fad diet videos of diets that turned out to be unhealthy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no idea what juicing is I am sorry. You are misinformed. Atkins is a great diet but I believe it works partly because you are eliminating gluten. Unfortunately meat is very contaminated with antibiotics and hormones that fatten you. I used to use the Atkins diet but eventually it stopped working because of the toxic chemicals I was injesting. Paleo for me and medicinal juices works really well. For you if Atkins works great! But I found it lost effectiveness over the years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you are right about that. I have to tell you I have been researching this a bit, around 2008 the food industry was deregulated somewhat. I am still researching it, but my feeling is they started adding more antibiotics and hormones to meat products. I am an Atkins proponent for along time, but it stopped working also I did not feel too well on it. It&#39;s not the diet itself in my opinion it is the quality of the food.

<p>Some people seem to have reactions not to the gluten, but to the glyphosate that is sprayed on wheat to help dry it out when it is harvested. They spray a lot of different grains when they harvest so even if you think you are avoiding glyphosate by avoiding GMOs, its still on/in a lot of different things. ....soft kill</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calories. It&#39;s true that vegetables are low in calories but most of them are densely packed with nutrients per calorie when compared to other foods. Add in lean meat and nuts for fat and protein, some fruit for carbs and you can get all the calories you need. </p>

<p>The bonus for eating more fresh vegetables than other foods is you can eat a whole lot and still lose/maintain your weight all while getting the nutrients. The fiber from the vegetables will keep you feeling full and curb your hunger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you say that?</p>

<p>If you said on weekdays - I will only eat fruits and vegetables. only raw unprocessed fruits and vegetables - and nothing else.</p>

<p>Maybe i throw in some coffee and water and tea.</p>

<p>BOOM - on Monday thru Friday - I am getting almost 100% of my calories from fruits and vegetables. </p>

<p>If on the weekends i splurge and eat meat or eggs or waffles - then that is splurging and provides some protein and carbs i don&#39;t really need - but that could account for 20% of my weekly food intake - and before you know it - I have a much healthier diet because 5 days a week I am getting almost 100% of my diet from fruits and veggies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Food allergy is possible. More likely an infection of some sort in the gut. I&#39;d see a naturopath and ask about a stool test. Your md could do one, but they probably won&#39;t take you seriously, whereas a naturopath will. </p>

<p>Oh, and you may want to do a candida test to tonight just to rule out the possibility. Put a glass of water next to your bed before you go to sleep. When you wake up, first thing spit into the cup. If your spit float, no cadida. If it sinks, you have candida. Btw, candida is a yeast infection in the tummy. Its treated with a no sugar/no mold diet for a month or so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe holistic doctor is a vague, generic term. Naturopath is a medical degree (NP), from a naturopathic school. Naturopaths use supplements and natural techniques to heal. They cannot prescribe drugs. If they discover an infection that requires an antibiotic or other pharmaceutical, they will give you the test to take to your MD, and your MD will prescribe the drug. The AMA is about 10 - 15 years behind research, and Naturopaths tend to be up with the times. Often, your MD will refuse to test for this or that because its not an AMA approved illness/procedure for said illness, but if you bring a test that the naturopath did, the MD will usually respect it. That said, NDs don&#39;t know everything and just as with an MD, you need to be your own advocate for care. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your protein question, yes, your body can absolutely create protein without nuts or meat. The only thing that matters is that you eat the essential amino acids that humans have lost the ability to synthesize due to the fact that we ate them for so many years. In fact, every time you eat protein your body breaks down the polypeptide into individual amino acids that it uses to make its own useful proteins. So the key is getting enough amino acids, it&#39;s just easier through nuts and meats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To build on this... animal proteins, ie dairy, fish, red meat, poultry, etc. have all 32 amino acids in them, so you get all the building blocks you need with very little protein intake. However, vegan proteins tend to only have a few types of amino acids, so you need to eat a wide variety of vegan proteins to get all the building block amino acids that you need. But vegan protein tends to be high in toxins, and it is a lot of work for your body to process. Also, most animal products are full of toxins due to factory farming, so you need to buy the high end stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what potential benefits embedding poison in our food supply but ok 👌 
I know that rich people buy organic food and I personally believe that everyone should have access to clean water without poisonous additives and clean food without roundup embedded in it.
I myself like honey bees and I think that they are essential to our ecosystem. But Monsanto is more concerned about pushing their patents on an unsuspecting population to enrich themselves. Monsanto are also the creators of agent orange and it makes perfect sense that they should be responsible for our food supply.....NOT!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s my point exactly. There is literally no benefit to poisoning our crops, but that isn&#39;t what a GMO is. That&#39;s just how one company uses genetic modification. Granted that the majority of GMO food comes from Monsanto seeds, that still doesn&#39;t take away from what we could be doing with GMOs. We could be making food healthier, making crops hardier  without pesticides, making them easier to grow instead of making it so you have to buy Monsanto seeds every year. We could be using genetic modification to make cannabis strains that are geared towards certain diseases. I mean c&#39;mon dude, stop perpetuating ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not perpetuating ignorance. I am being specific with a label. You are referring to a hybrid. Hybrid plants are made either by splicing or by cross pollinating. Gmos are regulated to certain crops because they are round up imbedded. That is not a hybrid. A dog is a hybrid animal that was selectively bred. Just like a hybrid plant. A gmo is a plant embedded with round up. That is the government definition and the label Monsanto is required to use. 
It is purposely labeled that way to confuse the consumer. You my friend are trying to blur the differences. Monsanto is nothing like an heirloom tomatoe. So don&#39;t use the same gmo regulated label. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but you&#39;re wrong. That&#39;s not what a GMO is. The governments definition? You&#39;re going to have to cite that. A GMO is any organism that has had its DNA modified using genetic engineering. Has nothing to do with round up and by saying that, yes you are perpetuating ignorance. The technical legal term is any living modified organism, again having nothing to do with round up. Here&#39;s some further reading.</p>

<p>Agreed. The labeling needs to be specific though. Something that has pesticides bred into it should be labeled as such. If it has a potential to harm the consumer, it should be labeled. But like Arizth said up there, just blindly labeling anything that is genetically modified as GMO is frustrating and misleading because most people associate GMO with &quot;literal poison&quot;, when that&#39;s really not the case. </p>

<p>Genetically modified organisms are being specifically modified to work well with RoundUp and other herbicides and pesticides. Some GMOs are also having genes inserted so that the Corn et al can produce their own pesticides and herbicides.</p>

Don&#39;t believe me? Try to plant Monsanto Corn (TM) in the wild and see how long that particular strain lasts.
Wait, you can&#39;t - because they are self terminating due to patent laws. Woops. But it would have been a fun experiment. Hint: It wouldn&#39;t have lasted.
If you breed a bad crop of corn due to selection, it died. It wasn&#39;t kept artificially alive with roundup glysphosate and whatever the fuck else we need to grow our frankencrops with.</p>

<p>Inability of adipose tissue development to engulf incoming fat leads to deposition in other organs, mainly in the liver, with consequences on insulin resistance. </p>

<p>The point of this is that inflammation is an aggravating factor, and leads to obesity being more dangerous in its health impacts as it is stored around organs rather than, say, the belly. This study is arguing that inflammation is an effect not a cause of obesity.</p>

<p>It has become evident that the inflammatory condition that is associated with obesity and overweight plays an important part in the aetiology of the metabolic syndrome and largely contributes to the related pathological outcomes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I no longer tolerate grains or seeds, myself. I deal best with animal protein and fat and fresh fruit and vegetables. In spite of all the &quot;meat is bad&quot; stuff you hear, if you can find clean (no drugs and hormones) meat from grassfed animals it&#39;s far better than trying to subsist on plant protein which comes most often in the form of legumes. Plant proteins and fat are harder to digest and legumes contain a good amount of estrogens (something else we don&#39;t need to overdo). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weston A Price was a dentist who traveled the world and studied the mouths of healthy people in traditional cultures. He wanted to learn why some people had perfect dental arches and zero cavities while other cultures were riddled with dental maladies. It came down to diet. The healthiest people ate lots of animal products, specifically grass fed meat and dairy, bone broths, and organ meats, liver especially. He wrote a book and published his research at a time when nutrition wasn&#39;t as politicized as it is today. The Weston Price organization continues to provide lots of nutritional information today. </p>

<p>The &quot;Nourishing Traditions&quot; cookbooks are a great starting place too. <a href="https://www.westonaprice.org/">https://www.westonaprice.org/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are meant to eat high protein diets with plenty of fats and cholesterol. As far as modern fruit goes, most have been selectively engineered by humans very recently (speaking in an evolutionary sense). Berries are mostly unchanged. But our ancestors didn&#39;t have anything like modern bananas, oranges, apples, etc</p>

<p>Yes, we need more plant matter in our diets, this is the food for the bacteria that sustain our health. Plant matter is also friendly on our digestive systems in the sense that if we are purely carnivorous diets (like a cat) our digestion would get dangerously clogged up (what happened to Brock lesnar).</p>

<p>Steve jobs ate a diet rich in fruits, nuts and seeds, and died of pancreatic cancer. When Ashton kutcher was preparing to play jobs, he emulated jobs&#39; diet until he was admitted to the ER with pancreas issues.</p>

<p>Animal products are critical to the human diet because they contain cholesterol and vitamin B12, neither of which are found in plant foods. The same goes for certain fatty acids (although many may be found in plants, they are only 10-20% as bioavailable). </p>

<p>Dietary cholesterol does not affect blood cholesterol levels, but cholesterol is a precursor to every male sex hormone. Another critical nutrient for proper endocrine function is fats, specifically the right kinds of saturated fats. A lot of nutrition experts argue that if you were stranded on a desert island, the number one most nutritiously complete food would be eggs. Another contender is fresh kefir. </p>

<p>Speaking of gut bacteria and kefir, fermented foods in general have probably played a critical role in the development of human digestion up until this point. </p>

<p>Besides all that, we are pretty deficient in organ meat in the US, which contains a lot of micronutrients that aren&#39;t found in other foods.</p>

<p>The first step in being healthy is to avoid getting sick.  It turns out that most of the big ticket items that kill people off prematurely are caused by lifestyle choices.  Good food and regular exercise will keep most people out of the hospital for most of their lives.  Oh and don&#39;t fucking smoke for god&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>The people working to generate local food sustainability are probably on the right track here.  Eat food grown and raised by people you actually see.</p>

When I was diagnosed, I was literally on the verge of kidney failure.

    <div class="md"><p>I would recommend everyone read the book. There were so many things about my body that I didn&#39;t understand until this book explained it. Like what cholesterol actually does in your body and why a high or low number is a sign of a problem, and some possible potential causes. Right now, if your cholesterol is low, the AMA will tell you are healthy when you aren&#39;t. If your cholesterol is high, they mask the problem with a statin and never fix the root cause, ensuring chronic health problems from the root cause and problems from side effects of the statins. Did you know 2/3 of men with erectile dysfunction are on statins?</p>

<p>It gets into vitamins and minerals and what they do for your body and how they work together. Statistically, people who take multi-vitamins are worse off because the multis are usually not properly balanced for a western diet. For example, most Americans get enough calcium from food, and the multis have more calcium. Too much calcium intake =&#39;hardening of soft tissues and arteries. Hardening of arteries =&#39;heart disease.</p>

<p>Believe me, after reading this book, there will be no doubt in your mind that the AMA is deliberately giving bad nutritional advice in order to ensure that you develop a chronic disease that requires monthly visits to their doctors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to see more people on reddit questioning the food system. It&#39;s totally fucked, but even before &quot;Green Revolution&quot; industrial agriculture, we were degrading our crops.</p>

<p>Nutrient Density is not often talked about around these parts. It means nutrients(Carbs, Fats, Protein, Minerals, Vitamins, Trace Elements, + ???)/mass. USDA defines it as nutrients/calories, which is cheating- think of an apple, hardly anything but water in there.</p>

<p>The issue is with agricultural breeding that humans have been doing for 10,000 years. Our ancestors used to eat wild foods across many kingdoms of life. The rich diversity of foods we ate connected us more deeply to the ecosystem, and acted as a chemical buffer for our bodies against changing ecosystems/climates. How? Plants use chemical defenses that we call phytonutrients, which are things like flavonoids, phenols, carotenoids, etc.. Usually bitter compounds that are very healthy for us. When plants are subjected to stress and disturbance, they produce more or different concoctions as defenses, which make them <em>more</em> nutrient dense. So think about that next time you&#39;re at the store and you put that blemished vegetable down, herbivory can increase nutrition.</p>

<p>So for thousands of years humans have primarily selected crops for taste, sweetness over bitterness. So we bred out many plants&#39; ancestral defenses and replaced those phytonutrients with our management and labor. Most common vegetables and fruit in the grocery store would not be worth much at all if people cared about this issue. </p>

<p>There are still a ton of wild plants that are edible and have retained high nutrient density. Some are being cultivated like dandelion greens and burdock root. It&#39;s not the cultivation and breeding that is the problem, it&#39;s the direction we shift the genetics and nutrient density by selecting for sweetness, and also by replacing pest/disease pressure with our chemicals and techniques. We trade one disturbance for another to improve caloric yield, but spend a lot more time, money and energy and we sacrifice nutrient yield.</p>

<p>Enter Agroecology. Silvopasture. Holistic Management. Zero Budget Natural Farming. Nutrition/acre. Permaculture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been so many differing diets throughout human history, that I think it&#39;s fool-hardy to try and say there is one diet to rule them all.</p>

<p>Some people do well with raw, others with a more cooked diet.</p>

<p>I think the overall moral of the story though, is to get back to fresh ingredients. Real food, prepared by human hands, and not a factory machine.</p>

<p>As for meat, maybe your body doesn&#39;t do well with it, but I would venture to guess that it&#39;s the grains that are affecting you poorly. Have you tried cutting out all grains to see how you feel?</p>

<p>The problem is two fold: big companies make food that makes you hungry/crave it more so you buy more and sell it in larger quantities.<br/>
The other problem is making food deliberately unhealthy in order to work with big pharma to sell people &quot;fat&quot; pills, diabetic medical products, etc.  They market big name brand food and &quot;health&quot; products with the largest profit using celebrities and excessive advertising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. In the American diet we have a lot of filler food items. Such as flour products that have no nutritional benefit really. Bread simply fills you up but it&#39;s lacking in actual nutrition. I make my own bread now with non bromate flour. It is simply a treat, it does not comprise part of a meal. Veggies and protein are how I feel healthiest. A sweet potatoe is my oaccasional carb. Fish, eggs, hummus, olives, nuts, cheeses. I vary my food and follow my instincts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Avoid fad diets. GMOs aren&#39;t bad by themselves. A genetically modified banana is good for you, but no matter how many organic superfood labels you put on deep fried chocolate covered bacon, it&#39;s not going to do you any good.</p>

<p>My advice is to cook your own food, mostly, so you know what&#39;s in it, and to avoid frozen food or pre-made stuff that come in an aluminum bag. Go simple. Eggs and vegetables, rice and chicken, that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>The food industry can sell whatever it wants to, and you can buy healthy food regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) get more fiber
2)take a multivitamin of some sort if you are going meat-free. there are things you cannot get adequate quantities of from fruit/veggies alone.
3) no you cannot synthesize protein from nothing. Eat brocolli if you need protein. stacked with nutrients.
4)just fruit and veggies will make you shit your fucking pants for a week or two when you switch FYI. 
5)stop eating processed food
6)eat probiotic yogurt or take probiotic pills</p>

<p>an important thing to keep in mind is that you very much need to feed both yourself AND your gut microflora (the bacteria in your poop). While you can breakdown and assimilate the majority of the macromolecules and nutrients required for life, most bacteria cannot do this, and must work in conjuction with yourself and eachother to meet their metabolic requirements. The best way to help them do this is to maintain a balanced diet, with emphasis on low carbohydrates but an adequate amount of fiber. </p>

<p>If nothing has been working for a while, I highly suggest you go see a doctor of some sort. You may have an inflammatory bowel disease of some sort, a chronic infection, or an undiagnosed allergy/sensitivity.</p>

<p>best of luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a simplified rule for everyone: don&#39;t eat anything that your grand-grandmother would not have eaten when she was young (this will eliminate processed foods, GMOs, food additives etc). 
A diet consisting of 80% fruit is just going to wreck your pancreas, among other things. No, the human body cannot synthesize protein. Waking up with diarrhea ? Go see a doctor ! Feeling fine when fasting but feeling crappy when eating ? Red flag: food intolerance. Again: go see a doctor ! You will undergo breath tests for lactose / fructose intolerance and then be put on an elimination diet to see if there is anything that does not agree with you and if yes: what it is exactly that makes you feel unwell. Don&#39;t think of food intolerance as a classic food allergy. There are more possible issues than that.

    <div class="md"><p>My rule is pretty simple: if it doesn&#39;t come from the earth, I don&#39;t put it in my body.</p>

<p>As for meat, you want to only eat organic meats that are free from antibiotics, hormone, and ideally don&#39;t eat GMOs (which isn&#39;t easy).</p>

<p>The body needs amino acids and there are plenty of food pairs that are considered perfect proteins such as beans and rice (although I don&#39;t really recommend legumes if you have digestive issues).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re waking up with diarrhea every morning you are likely suffering from some form of dysbiosis. Your gut flora is messed up, which can be the result of intestinal lining issues from eating too many GMOs, too much sugar, and infections such as candida and parasites. An easy way to kill all of the above and reset your gut flora is to consume iodine, garlic, and biofilm disrupters such as haritaki powder (a potent digestive bitter). You also might need to rebuild your intestinal lining by consuming organic bone broths - look into the GAPS diet or specific carb diet for recipes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t eat sugars much anymore, not even from fruit. Occasionally I&#39;ll have some berries. But fruit really isn&#39;t even necessary for a healthy diet, and contains a lot of sugar. Veggies should actually consist of the majority of your diet. </p>

<p>You can also research r/paleo and r/keto for more info on different diets.</p>

<p>I power my body of fats and proteins and limit carbs and sugars considerably with a lot of veggies, salads, sprouts, nuts, and seeds.</p>

Ofcourse there&#39;s lots of processed food. But to claim meat is unhealthy is just stupid. There&#39;s pretty scary studies on how going without some meat has drastic negative effects on the human brain. Its not hard to get good quality white meat. Just stay away from the bagged shit in grocery stores and most red meats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically they found a dozen skeletons and concluded these were the builders of the pyramids, based on signs of wear on the bones?</p>

<p>Weren&#39;t there supposed to be around 10,000 workers per pyramid according to the article?</p>

<p>Also, when I use the word &quot;slave&quot;, I don&#39;t necessarily mean it in the Hollywood sense. I consider myself and most people these days slaves too, although that&#39;s not something that is true by official language.</p>

<p>Unless they found a bit more than those skeletons (they also write in the first linked article that they had poor health btw) I think that archeological opinion contains a lot of conjecture too.</p>

<p>Genetic Mutation.</p>

<p>Way fucking different than franken-splicing genes that haven&#39;t had a chance to properly get into homeostasis with their environment and fit harmonically in the food chain - which only happens through <em>natural selection</em>.</p>
