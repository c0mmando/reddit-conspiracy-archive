       How a mod of any sub would encourage, let alone fucking help a user phish for ips, log, and doxx users on their sub is fucking insane to me.

       And yes, he attempted to steal my information, my personal i.p. address is connected to every activity that has ever run through it.  Someone with the knowledge and skills to do so can find out much more about you through your ip address than just having your username, or even your real name. He failed, because he was running a phishing scheme, which reddit(whose servers are through aws) has protocols in place to stop from happening.  The ips he was seeing opened "at only the speed a bot/shill could" was the spam filter flagging the messages.

        That was an awesome and clever investigation of a very real problem we have. Maybe people wouldn't call you a shill if you tried to be just a touch less contentious than you are with the community? I dunno, that would be a signal to me.

       That's the response I got from a mod who was part of it. Admin should have banned both of them as well.

       I don't get why they've cemented this asinine idea that it's ok to go after "shills" at the mods discretion. One of these people are going to show up at a "shills" house and then it's going to be too late.

       Did You bother looking up any of those situation balthanos made notes about?  He was doing his job each time.  They were breaking the rules and he removed comments.  He most lilely just noted the situation for future actions if the users keep at it.

       I'm not a mod but I've found the notes are added after a comment removal or something. Probably just adding context for the removal or wether it is the users "first warning". Multiple warnings = ban so they have to have some way to track it.
      </p>

       I'm not sure how jurisdiction works out with your request, I know reddit has reacted to German requests to block certain subreddits so you may need to go down the legal route in your own country.

       So it's basically a list of "warnings", right? That's what I gathered looking through them. Still, couple this with a few mods helping that user test his IP stuff rubs me the wrong way.

       That ip thing was weird but I've never seen one of those links in a thread and I spend a lot of time here. I gather the dude was pming suspected shills? I don't know but the mod collusion could probably get them in admin-trouble.

       As to the notes, I think they are generally just warning notes but I'm sure they add in bits of meta data they think is relevant "I'm sure this is the same user as
       <a href="/u/X">
        /u/X
       </a>
       , watch carefully" and so on.

       He's talking about the mod log where they make notes about users and posts/comments that have been reported. It's where they keep track of repeat offenders and some people don't like it, I guess:

       I get that this is just a tool to help moderate the sub, and I appreciate that you guys appreciate are trying, being a mod is a thankless unpaid position.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you shouldn't see users trying to hold mods to a higher standard as an attack.  Someone attempted to steal my personal information, and it not only had approval from mods, but one even admitted to helping do it.  I'm not attacking anyone, I even sympathized with the kid whose idea this was and who carried it out, but this is dangerous territory.  I wasn't even offered so much as an apology from the mods of a sub that constantly talks about the dangers of your personal information being brought public when people on their sub,
       <em>
        including people in a position of power
       </em>
       , attempted to phish my I.P.

       the gov has been doing this for years - taking people's comments and selectively using them to build up strawmen in order to punish people for opinions that aren't in line with their agenda.  that's what the gov does - it selectively enforces.  you should expect that any comments you make will be used against you.  simple as that.  so try to make comments that are things you'd stand behind under the worst scenarios.  and let the disincentive of exposure of gov bully tactics be your defense.  the last thing the gov wants are well-intended, articulate, well-thought critics getting public exposure.  it's the thing they're afraid of most because it calls attention to the lack of evenhandedness and equal treatment that the gov is supposed to be predicated on.  you basically out them as fascists - which of course they are.

if you have concerns about the mods, why not simply ask us before "sounding the alarm" via the sub?
When we ban users, we make comments on why they're banned so the other mods can see why someone was banned.
It's not a conspiracy and we've been doing that since the beginning of the sub's history...there's absolutely no reason to make drama over something that could've been cleared up immediately.
The attacks on the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mods have been ramping up as of late, and while your motives may be genuine, it's fanning the flames of something that's best left distinguished.
If you feel a mod has done something untoward, notify us directly and immediately (send me a PM if you don't want to use modmail).
Anyway, sorry for the misunderstanding and keep fighting the good fight.

       That ip thing was weird but I've never seen one of those links in a thread and I spend a lot of time here. I gather the dude was pming suspected shills? I don't know but the mod collusion could probably get them in admin-trouble.

       As to the notes, I think they are generally just warning notes but I'm sure they add in bits of meta data they think is relevant "I'm sure this is the same user as
       <a href="/u/X">
        /u/X
       </a>
       , watch carefully" and so on.

        That was an awesome and clever investigation of a very real problem we have. Maybe people wouldn't call you a shill if you tried to be just a touch less contentious than you are with the community? I dunno, that would be a signal to me.

        I notice you bring up my comment, but not the ones I removed. Ok

       That's the response I got from a mod who was part of it. Admin should have banned both of them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get why they've cemented this asinine idea that it's ok to go after "shills" at the mods discretion. One of these people are going to show up at a "shills" house and then it's going to be too late.
