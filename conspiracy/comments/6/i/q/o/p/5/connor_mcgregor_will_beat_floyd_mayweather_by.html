       Over the years there have always been accusations of boxers taking dives, promoters tampering with results, and referees giving special treatment towards a fighter to lean the fight towards their benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is believed the Fight on August 26 will garner over 5.5 Million PPV Buys at close to 100 Dollars each.  Plus tickets sales which are believed to be the most expensive tickets for any sporting even in history possibly front row tickets over 750K and some close to over 1 Million.  Also Merchandise licensing and etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Mayweather beats McGregor the results that most people, especially the odds makes are banking on will happen.  There will be no need for a Rematch because everyone is expecting Mayweather to win but if McGregor wins everyone would be in complete shock and I would expect Mayweather would want a Rematch.  Then if Mayweather goes on to win the second fight McGregor will subsequently demand a rematch making it a best of three.
      </p>
      <p>
       McGregor is already a 375 Point Underdog meaning if someone bet $100 feet for McGregor to win at those odds you would almost Quadruple your money at a $375 payout.  This means there could be someone or a group of people willing to make a large payoff to guarantee Floyd losing and securing a massive payoff from legitimate gambling institutions in Las Vegas, The Caribbean, and Overseas as well as under the table book makers located throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any future fights could bring in around the same type of Revenue as the first fight is likely to bring in.  Given that the first fight is an exciting contest.  If a third fight did happened and it was promoted exhaustively it could even surpass the first match.

       McGregor is a badass, but it's not his sport. If he wins it was fixed IMO. I would assume the betting odds would heavily favor Mayweather.

       Floyd doesn't need the money.  He's also older, smaller and arguably at more of a risk of being affected by damage than Conor.  So it well could be an easy moneymaker for people taking the underdog.  I don't think Floyd is in it for the cash.  I think he fights the way he fights so conservatively because he's about demonstrating the success of his style, in general.  I'm less inclined to think it's because he needs more money when he has plenty already.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd rather see Conor take on Tony Ferguson, a guy who has won against dudes who have similar or faster hand speed than Conor (eg. RDA).  I think Tony would beat him on the fundamentals.

       I dunno, man.  If Floyd can demonstrate the slack genius of his style (which is, really, fucking slack genius) he could, like Eddie Bravo, revolutionize the sport.  that alone might be sufficient motivation.

       If they rig the match to make maywether lose, Mayweather will probably make it seem like a close match and have the judges to favor McGregor.  But McGregor doesn't have a lot of stamina, as you can see how heavy he was breathing in the fight with Nate Diaz, plus McGregor drug use is a factor for his stamina conditioning in a 12 round boxing match.

       Floyd is too old for three matches against a UFC striker.

       If McGregor actually knocks him out, none chance Floyd goes back for more.

       Bernard Hopkins won The Light Heavyweight Championship at 48.  Different weight class but Mayweather is just a far superior athlete and boxer pound for pound than Hopkins.

       Mayweather has no need (nor I imagine want) to fight three bouts vs McGregor.  And if McGregor can hurt him in the first bout, zero chance for #2.

       We've found the betting point!  I bet there is no second fight if McGregor pummels him (win or lose).  The risk to rep not worth the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's easy money though, you're def right.  Mayweather will take the money and fame.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hunch is this will be easy money for Mayweather, but were I Mayweather, this is as nervous for a fight as I've been in a while.  McGregor has stopping power.  If he translate that through 16 oz gloves...

       Concur.  If this goes longer than 4 rounds I'm shocked.  McGregor lacks the stamina and style to go 10 so will throw MMA-style KO punches til he tires out.

       Conor McGregor will get destroyed. We're talking about an opponent who can do things like
       <a href="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ImpassionedArtisticGalapagossealion-mobile.mp4">
        this
       </a>
       . And McGregor is essentially a rookie boxer. The only cultural event on display is the collapse of white hubris, which ties in nicely with all the world-themed advertising seen recently during major American spectacles.

       I don't feel any heat for the whole white vs black thing here.  McGregor is Irish anyways.  People don't like Floyd and want to see him get beat because he is the best and because he is easily the most arrogant athlete on earth.  Not because he's a black guy.

       If we really wanted to see him get beaten, why are we throwing a scrub like McGregor into the ring with him? The conspiracy lies in the story of the fight and the message a sound defeat might send to the white community. Big fights are almost like national holidays, many millions will pay to see them live, and everybody turns into a boxing expert the day after. Avoiding race as a dividing line and a keystone for the narrative of the times is akin to watching "The Shining" for the boobies. There is so much more going on here.

       Because this is the only fight that can draw the kind of payday that makes it worth it to come back to the ring.  He's gone on record a bunch of times and said he won't fight for any less than 100 Million.  Who in boxing has that type of drawing power?  No one.  End of story.  Big Fights used to be a huge deal in the 80's and 90's when the heavyweight division was possibly the best it's ever been with SuperStars like Tyson, Holyfield, Bowe, Lewis, and Foreman but in 2017 big fights are not even close to a National Holiday people will but the PPV and have parties but the difference is they are all novice fans back then more people where informed in what was going on in Boxing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that race factors into everything in some way but I don't see this as a white vs black thing.  McGregor is Irish and the Majority of PPV buys are coming from the USA obviously.  Also Floyd doesn't really fit the "Black Thug" archetype to me.  I know he is flashy, had the domestic violence thing, and has feuded with Rappers  but there are plenty of rich white guys who beat their wives and have friends that are sketchy types.

       Good point. I have thought along the same lines before. What other things promoting this theme have you seen at previous major sporting events? Sorry I don't come from the US so don't keep up with the other NBA, NFL, NASCAR, rodeo, boxing events (some) but do watch the UFC most events.

       The last one fitting your narrative I was made aware of was Beyoncé's controversial BLM Super Bowl performance.

       Nope. If they want it best 2 out of 3, then they have to have a controversial ending - not a knockout. McGregor, most likely, looking like he wins but the judges giving Floyd a mixed decision on the scorecards. That's how you keep it going.

       I dunno, man.  If Floyd can demonstrate the slack genius of his style (which is, really, fucking slack genius) he could, like Eddie Bravo, revolutionize the sport.  that alone might be sufficient motivation.
