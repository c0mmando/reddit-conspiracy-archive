       Real skeptic. I don't visit that sub, and never have as far as i know.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say skeptic, I mean that I believe in coming to conclusions using evidence and logic only. And I refuse to believe something unless the evidence is strong. It's not that I DON'T believe things without evidence, it's that I remain "on the fence" until I feel like the evidence is strong enough to warrant one side or the other.

       Technically, he only said that if someone else did what she did they'd be in serious trouble. He also explained many ways that she violated the law, but he also did not ever specifically say she "committed crimes". It's clear that he was explaining how she committed crimes, but he avoided actually directly stating that she was guilty of crimes. To say a person is guilty of a crime when they have not been convicted of it would be slander, so he was never going to say "Clinton committed crimes" anyway even if he was explaining all of the ways that she broke the law.

       False. He said that if a low level employee had done those things, they would face serious "administrative consequences" but that those didn't apply to someone who no longer works for the state department, for obvious reasons.

       I pay attention to the public mod logs and I see rule 10 inconsistently enforced overall. Each mod is different. Some seen to wait for really overt and repeated shill accusations.  Some use public warnings, others don't, etc.

       Haven't noticed anything particular!
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like for everyone the bannings come in waves and usually surrounding some contentious back and forth. I haven't really noticed a huge bias in one way or another, tbh. But I also don't dig too deep into the users and what led up to the bans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it does seem like certain mods ban people just bc they don't like them or use inconsistent enforcement of some of the rules (2, 5, 10, 11, and 12, specifically) but I haven't noticed you as someone who seems particularly vindictive or unfair.

       That is neat to hear. I'm trying back there, but literally every move I make is controversial from some angle. I think there is a push pull thing with the bans. I don't think anyone on our team enjoys banning. It feels hateful. It feels like cheating in a funny way. But sometimes it gets real toxic, a bunch of bans roll, and it chills out. I promise I could justifiably ban 10 accounts a day. It's that bad. But it's a do as little as possible to keep the pressure cooker just right kinda thing imho.

       Maybe you shouldn't team up with the guy admin suspended for fishing IP addresses. That's probably not a good look. As someone who is called a shill daily, I fell that has made these people emboldened in their tactics on their "search for truth".

       That was an awesome and clever investigation of a very real problem we have. Maybe people wouldn't call you a shill if you tried to be just a touch less contentious than you are with the community? I dunno, that would be a signal to me.

       If it was so awesome and clever, why did the user who spearheaded it get suspended from Reddit? You and another mod were complicit in it and now you're saying that I should pipe down rather than engage with the white supremacists and who I would consider Donald shills.

       You actively supported witch hunting. You're a moderator of a subreddit in which it happened. You're condoning it.

       Giving out personal I.p. addresses is absolutely doxxing, you can find a lot more info with an i.p. address if you have the skills to do so than you can with just a username, or even a real name.  So you removing two comments isn't commendable, you shouldn't have taken part in the process or allowed that thread to grow to begin with.

       The only thing blatantly concerning me is that user who was looking for shills by phishing (maybe not the right term) in PMs and the mods backing them up. I'm not against looking for shills, but I'm against this particular method. I see now they're account is suspended though.

       Eh it's not that big a deal, as I already would be wary to click links in PMs from strangers. I did just read the exchange with other mod, celinehagbard, about he users methods that seems very measured.

       The way they were being clicked no matter what within seconds was where it become an oh shit moment. I dunno, I just really wish he wouldn't have gone forward with it, but I monitored the thread for about 8hrs for any PI going out, and didn't think exposing pooled amazon IPs was a problem as long as they were not associated with usernames.

       At the time he asked me if it was ok, I told him it was not ok to publish his findings and that we needed to bring in some more experienced mods to evaluate whether it broke rules, especially because of the phishing. It was obviously shaky ground, but at the same time the results were fascinating. So, I can think results are interesting and think the methodology is questionable at the same time. But, I did request assistance from other mods and the validity of his investigation was in the process of being evaluated. I specifically told him not to publish until we had evaluated that.

       Dont say bullshit, because its certianly true what i said!

       I seen two references to T_d in that post.  But whatever.

       The rules aren't the same for all mods. One mod may not like a certain user and use it as an excuse to get rid of them. The rules here are VERY vague.  "Attacking a user" is a wide broad stroke for the mods it seems. I got a warning for saying "14 day account" on a post. How is that possibly attacking someone?  I asked another mod and they said no its not a violation to that mod but all mods are different.

       Ears burning?  Is it weird that's the 4th time youve used the term "didn't see that coming in 8 hours"? Just an observation I suppose.

       Follow the rules and everything seems to work out OK. I've been banned from about a dozen different subs for political reasons rather than due to any rules being broken, and this is one of the few that has never banned me. Because I generally make every effort to closely follow all of the rules.

      <p>
       Rather than calling out every shill as the shill that they are, recognize that calling someone a shill is an ad hominem fallacy, even when you're right. It's not a persuasive argument. Instead of insults, you'd do better to shut down the troll with logic and reason. If they continue trolling, despite being blown the fuck out, then just ignore them, because feeding them with bullshit arguments and insults is exactly what they want. They literally want you to call them a shill.

       Yeah, why don't you report it when it happens? I see a zillion shareblue accusations reported in the queue, don't see a ton of t_d accusations. But the same rules apply for sure.

       Thanks. I didn't realise this was a ligitimate reason to report!

       I spend an unnecesary amount of time responding to the fact that I post in T_D. Although irrelevant, it's pretty obvious that I do, so nobody's unveiling my hidden ploy to post undercover. Certain people use it is an attempt to shut-down, same as with 'shill'.
