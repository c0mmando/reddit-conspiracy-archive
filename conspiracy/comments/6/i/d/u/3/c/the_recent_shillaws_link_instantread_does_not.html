       Yeah, that seemed a bit suspicious to me. Why would you develop an incredibly smart AI that could communicate so well that people believe they are talking to a human and then be dumb enough to have it automatically open any link you send to it?

       Have you ever played WoW? The bots on that game were programmed to respond in case an admin saw them botting around. I used to mess with bots on WoW all the time and inject commands to have them warp out the area or drop items.

       While I've never actually played WoW, I've seen bots like that in other games. They were nowhere near as sophisticated as the ones that were being proposed in the original post.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't really matter now anyway now that a few other users in this thread were able to reproduce the exact same response times just by sending the phishing links to their own alt accounts and each other. It seems to be Reddit's spam filter that is triggering the link using the Amazon IP address. It was an interesting idea to think about!

       I did. And I'm saying yes, perhaps your spam filter picked it up when you opened the page and looked at the link (not necessarily clicked on it, but when the link appeared on your page the spam filter "clicked on it"). I am saying that these accounts instantly open that link. In the middle of the night, when they haven't been posting, whatever. Within 15 seconds.

       Yep, see I was into it at first because one of the IP's in the OP was configured differently. But then I just had to test it myself and noticed the PM's weren't going through and that I was getting hit by AWS almost instantly.

       Another user does appear to be right, it is a reddit spam filter. This makes a lot of sense, I get it now. Would explain why you don't recieve the message. Apparently I was just sent one as well. Prevents bots from sending spam ads and links and whatnot to people. Im glad I could actually get to the bottom of this. Like i said in an original post, debunking OP is always half the fun.

       It is that I am currently not able to verify it myself. I trusted the user his research. Other people confirming it made it seem more authentic and reinforced my believe for it to be true. Something that people that want to influence us (by bots for example) would exploit as well. This is sadly a weakness we have as humans, but on the other hand also helps us to develop.  This is why we have science.

       It is not that I just believe it, but that I have no way to verify it at the moment (and for several weeks). I just gave my input. It does not matter if it turns out to be fake, that is why I am still researching this. I've seen enough (and made screenshots) for me to believe there is something happening.

       It's incredibly absurd. I love how the mods here allow witch hunts. I don't know how they allow this on Reddit. What they are doing is against site wide rules and if Reddit admin had any spine, they'd shut this place down.

       I believe that it is a mix of the two. It is an aggregator platform that directs "handlers" where to respond to. However, many of these accounts do exhibit bot like activity, very strange posts, while the "handler" is offline. These barely-understandable comments garner a few upvotes here and there to make the account seem legit. Many of them start discussion. Once it gets a reply, a "handler" is called in. At least this is how it seems to me.

       No. As the OP in that thread posted his information, I tested out B-l-a-s-z-e capabilities by creating a link off of Youtube Rick Roll original video and clicking it myself. Then, I submitted that link to a subreddit that I made private.
       <a href="https://image.prntscr.com/image/sILS_iLAQEadeJxz1DTFjA.jpeg">
        I screenshotted the whole thing.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note the first row. This is what shows when I, an actual user on a device, click on a link. The box on the right titled "Hostname" is blank. Now notice the "redditbot" entry below. It clearly says "amazon AWS" as hostname. This means the Reddit bots are hosted on Amazon servers, and the other ones as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the latest update to the story is that Reddit spam filters are now blocking B-l-a-s-z-e links as spam, Bit.ly also refuses to accept those links (though this worked AFAIK) and the site itself seems to be under some kind of attack. This means there is some truth to the story, though I'm guessing it's all too easy to handwave and mock for that sweet, sweet pity karma.

       OP has offered no proof that they ever tested this on themselves or their friends, they claimed they did successfully even after reddit started filtering the link, so that's at least 1 lie. They've also said it works if sending from a new account, I tried, again another lie.

       Another user does appear to be right, it is a reddit spam filter. This makes a lot of sense, I get it now. Would explain why you don't recieve the message. Apparently I was just sent one as well. Prevents bots from sending spam ads and links and whatnot to people. Im glad I could actually get to the bottom of this. Like i said in an original post, debunking OP is always half the fun.
