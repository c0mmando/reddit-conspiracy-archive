       Flat-Earth posts discredit the r/conspiracy subreddit effectively for several reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Flat-Earth position totally disregards the science method and basic mathematics. So, outsiders assumes that every participant in r/conspiracy does the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems too be no reason "the powers that be" would create a round-earth deception starting 2000 years ago. So, by the rule of association, outsiders think there must be no good reason for other conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human participants in r/conspiracy waste time fighting comment wars in flat-earth comment threads, when we should be focusing on more important issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat-earth proponents use the same short, pithy, basic arguments again and again. It would be easy to put these arguments into a text database and write an AI program to spit them out based on the text content of a posting or comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given their lack of belief in science method, you would think that flat-earthers are not very tech-savvy.  However, many of their Youtube videos are professionally edited and polished. Too polished. Are human propagandists being paid to produce these videos?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to see evidence of AI driven shilling, look here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ib4n9/what_ive_learned_hunting_down_shills/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ib4n9/what_ive_learned_hunting_down_shills/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, is there a chance that there are actually many human proponents of flat-earth? Being driven insane by the deceptions coming from a corrupt government (9-11, UFO), mass media (Identity politics) and paid-off scientists (GMO, Tobacco) perhaps there is a small group of people who have become so paranoid that they feel flat-earth beliefs are somehow reassuring? Given that these flat-earth beliefs line up with some religious books is another possible cause.

       I don't have any pantsuits. Also, I don't know the shape of the Earth as you seem to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is that anyone claiming that they know the shape of the Earth (other than the less than 500 people who have ever supposedly been to space) are committing four logical fallacies in one argument.

       Please tell me what kind of logical fallacy it is when you believe that all 99.9% of earth scientists and space scientists in the world have either:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) Been deceived by the global-earth conspiracy. 
B) Are secretly members of the global-earth conspiracy.

       Are you saying that the masses can't be deceived? Are you impervious to deception at the highest level?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, let's assume that I am a non-sentient robot. Would that fact change your opinion about my ability to hold a rational conversation? Robots are better than humans at many things; why should a logical argument be any different? You are the one making a claim, not me.

       The masses are being deceived by AI right now. We are the boiling frogs in the warming water of an internet controlled by AI, not by humans.

       So, who will control AI.  Right now, it is people like the owners of Google and the Owners of Amazon.

      <p>
       If the powers that be have a choice how they use AI, what choice will they make? They will choose to use it to control the 99%.  If they do not, we will rise up and cut their heads off for the crimes they are hiding.

       What I meant is that if you believe that 99% of scientist have been deceived or are part of a conspiracy it is some kind of logical fallacy.

       I do think that 99% of scientist have been fooled or are part of a conspiracy.

       Sure there are shitty corporate and government scientists selling the use of dangerous vaccines or supporting a GMO/Herbicide based agricultural system or those who support the official 9-11 narrative.  But most are trying to do real work.

       Do you speak the language of math and science. Not really, you speak the language of making observations. That is not real science. 
You are unable to predict the next solar eclipse using flat-earth math. Globe earth scientist can predict time and place of solar eclipses for the next 10 years down to the minute and the mile. 
You are unable to explain why planes which fly curves paths over the earth arrive faster than planes flying straight lines. Planes curve south in the southern hemisphere and they curve northward in the Northern hemisphere in order to save time and money on fuel. THESE ARE FACTS, you lose.

I don't trust corporate scientists from Monsanto or Tobacco companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do trust my sister the geologist.
       <br/>
       I do trust the engineers and scientists who designed and built the airplanes I ride on because I know they used the scientific process and scientific method to make it safe. They did not look at birds and decide to make an airplane flap it wings.  They did not only use natural science or observational science. They used theoretical science theory based on a foundation of physics and mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
       That same process was used to understand the earth upon which we live and the universe that surrounds earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or wait, are you a member of the flap-wing theory of flight? Is it not possible for a plane to fly because it does not flap? You had better stop flying because I don't think you understand the scientific process and it reliance on mathematics.

       Did they ask her to join the global earth conspiracy yet or is she still being fooled about that crap they made up where they said they can use a glass prism to understand the chemical makeup of a star. 
Ask her about it, see how stupid she is to believe that there are various stars in the universe, with some resembling our sun and some which are a bit different.

       Interesting. Well if you're too blind, physically or mentally, to see the curve of the earth as you're flying 20k ft above it, there's no helping you. Do you perhaps fly an ultralite to work? They don't gain that much altitude so I could see you missing it then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think your next best bet would be to pay a pilot to fly you around the earth (Or at least to the edge to take a picture for us). Or you know, see if the GPS on your phone will accurately navigate you.

       Also, I've seen hours of high altitude balloon footage showing no curvature ( unless a gopro was used, in that case, the distorted fish eye lens curvature is visible. )

       The globe and the bible only exist to confine humanity. People who believe in a spinning ball are worshipping the same roman polytheistic system with a science fiction veneer.

       Physics and math prove a flat earth. Look up the curvature formula for a 20,000 mile circumference ball earth. If the earth is round, the curvature is missing. Where did it go?

       Years of indoctrination will certainly influence ones outlook on anything, but unfortunately that's not the case here. You're arguing against the scientific method proving correct for decades and decades and decades.

       It's fine though man, to each their own. I was just bored giving you shit cause I know FE'rs have no legitimate arguments against... actual critical thought. Sorry to offend, but not sorry it was fun.

       Boats that "go over the curvature" don't do that. Its a limit to your eyesight. Perspective and vanishing point.

       I did too. Zoom is simply magnification, and in no way shape or form is it going to "bring back" objects that have already gone over the horizon. All footage "proving" this is just someone zooming in on something that hasn't gone over the horizon.

       That's what you said, right? All footage showing how optics/magnification can bring back objects that have gone over the horizon is false, because none of those objects have actually gone over the horizon.

       Right, so when you see light coming from the stars and sun, millions of miles away, it's because of perspective and vanishing point. The limits to our senses! Thats too good man. 😄From the guy who said, "Show me the math."😂

       Science is not debunked nonsense. The literal fact you're using a PC to post on a website validates round earth and the scientific method you claim is debunked dude. You're making 0 progress convincing anyone of your thoughts!
      </p>
      <p>
       For such a strong willed believer, you've presented 0 actual, substantial proof. This itself casts serious doubt on any arguments you have made or will make, and mainly makes you look like a sad troll. But a sad, lonely, FE, troll is too depressing a thought for me so I want to believe you are partially right in a sad, sad way.

       Also, I'm not saying I trust NASA, or the US Govt 100%. But you deflecting to not believing a NASA photo instead of looking into parallaxes, is the whole reason this post was made initially. As if you're not seeking knowledge, but aiming to muddy the waters.....

       When I fly from New York to Tokyo, why does the pilot follow a curved path going NORTH over Alaska? 
Isn't it a waste of fuel? Shouldn't they just go straight over Hawaii.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if I am flying in the Southern Hemisphere why do they curve SOUTH trying to save fuel. I thought corporations were concerned with profit. Longer distance means more fuel used which increases cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a flat earth, why is flying a curved route faster? Why does it take less time and use less fuel?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do they curve all long distance flights to support the Global-Earth conspiracy?

       Watch the upcoming eclipse and note the shadow as it moves across the moon. Its curved. Also note that on the FE model eclipses arent really explained.

       Ask any SR71 or Concorde pilot, they all have seen curvature.

       Calculate how much fuel you will need during a flight. One way on a flat Earth the other assuming curvature. One will be correct. Same with a boat, the results will be different on a FE vs globe.

       Come on don't data dump, those 200 proofs are all debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which argument do you personally find the most convincing?

       So you dont have a response to me asking what proof you think is the best evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just pick a few out and we can talk about them.

       Well. It is how it works. Because you have to prove a spinning ball. The only proof you have is a debunked photo from NASA. Other than that... Nope!

       And you have to prove it's flat. You are the one with the fringe opinion and ridiculous claim. And you spam post one link and don't extrapolate from it.

       So you havent read any of those proofs and you dont have any evidence the world is flat?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a very simple question, which evidence do you think best proves a flat earth?

       Can you answer that question?

       I believe it has been created to discredit all conspiracies. Same with global warming denial (I'm sorry but burning fuels puts pollutants into the atmosphere...) Both of these conspiracies seems to do the same thing, makes us all look like fucking idiots.

       There will be alterations in density depending on the person's density doing the experiment. He is basically measuring his own aura manipulation. The aura within and around your body is actually keeping your body from being a pile of mush on the floor. So this energy in you effects weight distribution and anything you are touching and weighing right in front of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA keeps you dumb about the astral plane , and much of the energy grid of earth. the ancients knew about that. Points in the earth where non physical energy comes pouring in and giving life to creation here. They built structures around them, some are still traceable in Africa from the air, they are dotted everywhere. These points are all over the land. Everywhere. And near these points there is alterations in density because it is an energy pouring in just like the energy that is in the aura of every person alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm way beyond this silly attempt to debunk flat earth this way. There is way more to the earth than the experimenter is observing.

       Southern hemisphere sees stars that north can't and vice versa but there is an overlap during certain times of the year so one hemisphere sees more than what they normally can and then the same cycle repeats (slightly different each year due to the sun moving in the galaxy.) It's not 100% proof of Earth being a globe but mostly shows it.

       Fair enough then, because only a human could joke about pimping whores on Maple ave (though you're suspect for saying none of them ever get in your pants). All joking aside, there could be psyops about psyops and shills and bots about any topic for of against, it's enough to make your head spin. I just try my best to avoid ad hominem bias, and just address an issue as if I'm writing for the lurkers reading my comments, whether I'm replying to a bot or not.

      <p>
       Your test to catch bots is clever, until like the other OP you linked to suggested, it eventually goes to a human. Even then, the truth is the truth, and I couldn't care less if I'm replying to a bot or not, if my comment can add to the discussion, and educate lurkers.

       I'm not really sure that you're familiar much with AI science... That question is a terrible test because it's a ridiculous question. It's nonsense that even a human couldn't "answer". In fact I could write a bot that "answers" that question - but how would you distinguish a bot's answers from a human's?

       I'm not saying that there aren't chat bots here but I think you're wildly overestimating the current state of AI tech if you're under the impression that they'd be able to pass the Turing test in a Reddit thread

       I put the evidence for bots link below, again. 
Bots already are on Reddit and other chat boards. 
They come on, say one stupid thing to stir things up or they come on in groups and vote stuff up or down. This is NOT against the law.

      <p>
       Of course. I'm not disagreeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's a
       <strong>
        huge
       </strong>
       difference between canned responses and the level of conversation that the user above is showing, and your question is not a good one for sussing out who is a bot and who isn't. At this point in time, having a human-like conversation is good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, asking a nonsense question is not at all a good litmus test for AI, because there is no clear "human" answer. In fact, a human is more likely to get confused by and refuse to answer your question, whereas AI at the level we have today will happily chirp out an answer. If you don't believe me, try it out on cleverbot. And for what it's worth, even Google was able to take your question and figured out and corrected the spelling errors, a trivial task. You seem to be under the same impression that the writers for the old Star Trek were - "if I tell a computer 'this statement is false', the computer will short circuit!". But that, and gibberish questions, are not at all any way of testing whether something is AI.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know how scientists and researchers do this, look up the Turing test. The gist is pretty simple - if I have a conversation with it and I can't tell that it's not a human, than it passes the Turing test.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes bots are absolutely on Reddit, submitting links, giving canned replies, and up/down voting. But they are absolutely not conversing
       <strong>
        because we are still at least a decade away from that level of artificial consciousness even in the research world.

       Good point. Another function of flat earth is too distract us from the actual oldest conspiracy of all time.

       Aliens messed with some DNA and produced humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look in most of our religious books, they are basically telling us that the "gods" made us. Does that mean there is no GOD? No. I believe that GOD still exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, flat-earth say one GOD made ONLY the earth and the dome, etc, therefore there are no other stars and so there are no aliens who could have messed with our DNA.

       Your assumptions are incorrect, there is and has been a genetic war since the beginning of creation, the Bible says that a group of divine beings made the universe but through the power of one Almighty God the Father, sometime during the creative days a rebellion happened and a group of spirits/gods wanted the earth for themselves at it had this unique potential for creative forces aka DNA. That is why every ancient book describes the "gods" coming down (there has to be an up) and altering the genetics of the life on earth with hybrids. The rebellious ones have also done this genetic alterations all the way up to Jesus day and beyond to try and prevent the birth of a perfect human aka Jesus in order to reverse what has happened.
       <br/>
       Earth is better described as a "system" or a highly advanced technological enclosure. Our 3rd reality we reside in has the right density and frequency to produce physical matter which is why it's special and there's so much life. Every single life form on earth follows this golden ratio spiral pattern in its creation which is the fingerprint of the way our energy system/life force flows through everything. I could go on but I don't wanna write a book.

       I don't know for sure about the context in regards to why people with their balls cut off couldn't go into the temple lol I'll research tho for sure. And all the cultures around the world have similar stories of mankind's beginnings and a time of mingling of gods and man and animals as well as battles and flying machines/advanced technologies. There's something with genetics and technology that is in everything and we in this day understand the possibilities and implications of that kind of tinkering because we have knowledge of those sciences. If you want to dismiss literally all ancient history in place of whatever nonsense they teach today then that's your choice.

       "Published on Feb 9, 2013
This is the complete 1-hour video of Dr. Martin Hertzberg's lecture and Q&amp;A at the Cafe Scientifique at the Summit meeting in Frisco, Colorado on April 27, 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Hertzberg has a Ph D in Physical Chemistry from Stanford, earned his B A degree, cum laude, from the Heights Campus of New York University, and was trained as a meteorologist at the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School.  His honors include membership in Phi Beta Kappa, a Meritorious Service Award, a Foreign Visiting Scholar at CNRS in Orleans, France, and a Fulbright Professorship.  He has traveled extensively in France, England, China, Israel, Poland, Bulgaria, Germany, and Mexico; is fluent in French and understands German.  He currently teaches science and mathematics at various educational institutions, and occasionally consults as an expert on the causes of accidental fires and explosions.  He served as a meteorologist in the US Navy and has been studying the global warming issue for the last twenty years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Hertzberg's peer-reviewed paper, "Earth's Radiative Equilibrium in the Solar Irradiance", is available at

        I believe it has been created to discredit all conspiracies. Same with global warming denial (I'm sorry but burning fuels puts pollutants into the atmosphere...) Both of these conspiracies seems to do the same thing, makes us all look like fucking idiots.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That in itself is a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll summarise everything here: there are stupid people in this world who believe in stupid things. The flat earth "theory" has been proven to be false without any doubt, as has creationism, the belief that fluoride makes our frogs gay and whatever other crazy right-wing conspiracy theories are popular right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are actual conspiracies - e.g. Donald Trump colluding with Russia - a hostile foreign power - to increase his own wealth and steal the Presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what does this sub spend most of its time discussing? A few years ago it was "Obama is a secret Kenyan". Before the election it was "Hillary and Podesta run a paedophile ring out of a pizza place". I'm sure the right-wing conspiracy theory industry will invent a new conspiracy which defames whoever the next Democrat nominee is.

       Looking at your response to my stupid riddle tells me you are not a bot. Most bots today would just ignore the question, until someone writes a sub-routine that vectors the response to an set of outrage responses that match your anger in veracity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, bot comments and especially bot voting on Reddit, Twitter, Facebook are real things. Any Rich or powerful group can buy up a bunch of server time and run programs designed to control the narrative using AI.  AI is not at Terminator levels yet, but it capabilities have advanced much quicker than most people are aware of. Should this be legal?
      </p>
      <p>
       Should we allow Russia and China to use AI to influence the national debate surrounding the next election? 
Should we allow Shareblue (a leftwing group) or Infowars (a right wing group) to use AI to influence the opinions of actual humans.
      </p>

       I believe the practice of allowing bots to pretend to be humans should be illegal.  I am trying to create awareness.

       I am not a right wing conspiracy theorist. 
I can name 20 fucked up things the Republicans have done and are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dennis Hastert, longest serving speaker of the House, third in line for the presidency? Remember him? He is in jail for child sexual abuse. He was paying off a kid he abused when he was a High School sports coach.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone had crashed a plane into a meeting between Bush and Cheney, Dennis would have become President and molester in chief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think his crime was a one off? No, there are other accusers planning on taking him to court.  Do you think that after he became rich and powerful that he stopped his misbehavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, do you know one of Dennis's best buddies? 
John Podesta. He was Democratic consultant, aide to Obama and Hillary and he was to be the secretary of state under President Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedogate is going to bust wide open before any more people believe in Flat Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       What percent of people on r/conspiracy actually believe in Flat-Earth. 
I bet it isn't more that 15%.  But with strategic posting by AI and humans working for the powers that be, it seems like it is closer to 50%.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to the outside world, people who believe in the JFK assassination believe in Flat Earth.  People who believe in the Gulf of Tonkin believe in lizard people living under the South Pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what do you believe? Do all conspiracies have the same probability of being true?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Princess Diana still alive on an island somewhere with Michael Jackson after being killed by the Queen? Which is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the secret overthrow of the Iranian government have the same probability of being true as the Time-Travel technology cover-up?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Aliens come to earth and mess with our DNA or are we the only intelligent beings that exist in our flat-earth universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are only the Republicans bad and all Democrats are clean? WTF!

       Global warming denial is better stated as man made climate change skeptic. See how your simple term takes away details from the other side?

       Same with anti-vaxxers. Many people who are "anti-vaxxers" aren't against all vaccines. They just realize that not all vaccines are created equally and that some are unnecessary and can be detrimental to ones health.

       Too short, too pithy, possibly pre-programmed answer. 
Only two people in this comment thread have answered my question. How are you going to feel when we have solid proof that bots are manipulating our opinions and behavior.

       I distrust NASA too, they are covering up a lot of shit. 
The people at the top erase any information about aliens. 
They compartmentalize it and keep it secret.  Maybe even a moon mission or two were faked.

       Why does every researcher have to be in on a flat plane vs spinning ball. They can still do their jobs on a flat plane. For instance, several pilots have come forward recently as flat earthers. That doesn't mean every pilot is a flat earther.

       Humans are inherently flawed and bias, math can be proved. Data triumphs everything when used in the right context. Unfortunately a lot of non academics are willing to accept whatever numbers they are shown without looking into what they mean. For the record, flat earth is bullshit.

       Just look at this thread. If flat earth was so debunkable and an obvious hoax , than why all this attention? It's because people know NASA is full of shit and everything we see of the earth is Total Bullshit.

       Light bodies in the astral plane. Let this sink in. What they call outer space is the astral plane. It's all light bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The area between our density, earth, and astral, has a density also. Mainly to keep in the pressure of our atmosphere. But the moon and the sun and the stars are impressed within that layer between earth and the astral plane. The moon and sun are actually in the 'firmament'. Not hundreds of thousands of miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now these other constellations I'm starting to think are other dimensions within our universe. Just like how we have a reality here , and they would see that as a star in their firmament of their world. So all that seperates worlds is this layer between our earth and them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not millions of miles away. Somehow they are traveled to through the astral plane of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon was placed here that way. There is a lot to this, but start thinking in these terms because this is the nature of consciousness. Astral plane is all around us. NASA doesn't want the world to know, it would expand our consciousness beyond their control. But we are heading that way so I'm giving you a head start in awareness of your real existence.

       Okay and where in the mainstream for profit is it being pushed??? I didn't say it doesn't get attatched in some smaller areas. But it isn't pushed at all by the worldly church... for a reason. It's in the Bible and every book yet they don't preach or believe in it.

       It has to be mainstream and for profit for it to be a religious belief...? You said it was tied to ancient spirituality, but awareness of Flat Earth skyrocketed in 2014 due to radical Christian YouTubers.

       It's not in every book, it's in one (apocryphal at that) book.

       Radical = more extreme than whats considered normal. Doesnt really matter if you think regular Christianity is radical as well or not, the people who take the book of Enoch seriously are radical versions of Christians.

       Lol, it proves it happened post-2014. Surely people didn't wait two years after Obama "attacked" your theory to show interest. So what else is there? You said yourself there's too mainstream religion pushing it, and flat Earthers all over the world have made "YouTube Flat Earth Theory" their go-to. What else would it be?

       They didn't wait two years he continually did it. It doesn't happen over night. He made his first comment on it in 2012, next one in 2013, then again in 2014, and then it became popular. I actually said there wasn't mainstream religion pushing it so stop.

       You're right, it didn't happen overnight. It happened when radical Christian YouTubers started going to the streets and yelling "YOUTUBE FLAT EARTH THEORY WAKE UP SHEEPLE" and shouting Psalms and quotes from the Bible. Obama making comments on Flat Earth is both not a surprise at all, and not the first time someone of importance has "attacked" it. Why would it matter that Obama specifically said something about it when the entirety of the scientific community has "attacked" it for centuries now?

       Exactly my point... It's been attacked for years (centuries even). Of course when the truth (bigger than science and invisible numbers we must believe in) starts to come out (as is happening everywhere) it's going to be explored and it's starting to gain traction... clearly as documented by your proof you posted.

       Flat Earth is the best example of scientific ignorance that exists. Of course its used to make climate change deniers look ignorant of science.

       Best example of Science being the new age religion. Bow to the priests in their pure white coats that tell us how our world works. Yet it continues to spiral out of control chaotically. Science is a cult of chaos.

       Actually most real flat earthers use natural science to back up their claims.  Check out beyond the imaginary curve on youtube or john smith globe lie street interviews.

       I don't believe flat earth is an accepted scientific theory. Can I get some sources other than some random cunt talking shite on youtube. I fail to see how there is any scientific calculations so I would like to see them. Ones that can determine the orbit of the moon and earth, something simple to start off with.

       Flat earthers use natural science to show that it goes against earth being a ball. Its not about making a new model but showing that the existing model is impossible according to natural science.

       To prove one model wrong you dont need another model, you need to show that our natural observeable reality does not agree with said model.

       Yes. Just don't get why people need to argue here. If you don't believe it don't partake. It's not hurting anything. Not you. Not how we're viewed. It's allowing people to come together and discuss ideas. Which could potentially lead down some fascinating roads. I am a believer in where we're going. We shouldn't fight it. Either partake or move on.

       And how isn't the flat earth conspiracy a part of it... Aliens is an actual modern day invention you are willing to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say intelligent forces. If there's an intelligent force to create human beings there should be a force that can create a world... If that creator were to make a world would a spinning ball in a vast abyss  going nowhere make sense or world a paradise where all things are possible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I am not saying the world ins't actually spinning, as I think right now it very well could be. But, if there's a chaotic force that can manipulate human beings that's resulted in the fall of man I think there's a chaotic force that can makes us believe we are on a spinning ball of chaos.

       Bible picking and choosing is not a way to run your life. 
Too many religious traditions talk about "gods" creating man. 
These gods were aliens.
However, the existence of aliens does not preclude the existence of one true GOD.  We can still have faith that there is a force for good. The one true GOD gave us brains and our brains designed the scientific process. I don't think it is a sin to use our rationality for knowledge. Knowledge tells us we live on a globe.

       I've traveled around the world, and flown over 2 oceans, so I'm not sure what you're implying. In no way does my travelling prove a round earth. Flight paths, however, do make more sense on a flat earth map (google "flat earth flight paths"), and airplanes never account for curvature. Circumnavigation works on a flat earth map, because you would fly around the magnetic center (the Arctic), to which your compass would always point.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for education, I'd say that
       <em>
        begins
       </em>
       when you've forgotten everything they've taught you in school. It appears many people have yet to reach that point.

       They certainly do not...

      <p>
       One easy way to test this is calculate fuel consumption on a FE vs a globe earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth is a globe you will get a different result than if the Earth is flat.
      </p>

       Even if you yourself dont do it you dont think that someone hasnt noticed their fuel calculations are off?

       What? They definitely do. Havent you ever seen a flight path laid out on a screen? Its not a flat line, it curves. This is because the Earth is a globe. If you had the desire you could figure this out youself.

       Don't engage trolls like this, just downvote and move on. It's hard to not correct such people but you're just playing into their hand. TPTB would rather you waste your time fighting these idiotic comments then posting something intelligent about stuff that actually matters.

       Fixed that for you. GPS is turned off in the Southern Hemisphere, no way to track those flights, which mysteriously veer far off course north for an inexplicable stop, then back south. On a globe, these flights make no sense to go so far off course, but placed on a flat earth, the flight paths become close to a straight line, with the stop halfway on the straight line. If the earth were a globe, those flights should be able to go straight east or west, from Santiago to Johannesburg for example, instead of going insanely off course to Europe.

       And without getting in to the rest of your nonsense, I was referencing the simple fact that you can fly directly from Australia to South Africa faster than, lets say Japan - Spain, and that isn't possible on any FE model I've seen. If you have a different model, feel free to post it

       If we lived on a flat earth, planes would save fuel by flying a straight line. Someone better tell the airline stockowners about this travesty by pilots who are forced to cover for the globe-earth conspiracy.

      <p>
       Next time I fly from New York to Tokyo I will tell the pilot not to fly over Alaska and go straight over Hawaii to save time. Also, I have always wanted to see a volcano.

       There are many delusions in this world.  Religion is one.  Magic is another.  Why, just this morning on Fakebook, I saw a neighbor make a request for a "spiritual adviser" in our town.  Let's face it.  Most people are dumb.  If you read The Bell Curve, you learn that, indeed, more than 50% of humans have an IQ of less than 100.  So it comes as no surprise, that this flat earth delusion would resounds in certain circles.

      <p>
       No, that is not true. I think we need to pass laws that ban the use of computer bots to mimic human users in order to change opinions, behavior or vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when we discover that China is working with a big computer company or lobbying firm to influence US public opinion during the next election, we can legally shut down that operation and make arrests.

       Where is the part of the proof that predicts eclipses. 
If you go to the library, you will see entire fields of science that support Global Earth theory. My sister is a Geologist working at the EPA in Washington DC. When did she secretly join the global earth conspiracy club. Should I ask her? Or did she spend 10 year in post graduate study being fooled.

       Some people will never figure it out. They are cool with going to google, typing in "flat earth debunked", seeing the first results and confirming their bias. I know because this is what I did when my friend told me about the flat earth.

       Blette, what makes you think that you can reason with those who have adopted Flat Earth? Do you think you can reason with converts to any other belief system? I hope not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the kinds of people who are
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjpaL5a4_Us">
        at the top of Flat Earth
       </a>
       then you will see how and why it attracts the people it does. And you will see that there is no reasoning with them.

       It may seem I am joking about bots but I am not. 
Bots are real and the "powers that be" are using them to influence human opinions and possibly manipulate our behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat-Earthers usually have their beliefs because they have lost faith in their government, educational system, corporate science and the mass-media. So, they latch onto a theory which fits their outrage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to show them that they need to be more paranoid than they actually are. In actuality, they are being manipulated and abused with the flat-earth theory by the powers that be who are using the internet and bots to fuck with us humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat-earth not only discredits followers of conspiracy but more importantly I believe it covers up the the fact that 'gods' or 'aliens' messed with human DNA. They need to understand that accepting Globe-Earth theory does not reject the one true powerful and almighty GOD who created not just a dome but an almost infinite universe teeming with life.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of GOD can only create one tiny planet with a small sun and a crappy moon. My GOD created AN ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

       If you watch the high altitude balloon footage, they are showing a flat horizon. when it stops wobbling and showing  a convex and concave horizon, the horizon is flat, you can pause it.

       Yes, there does. An enclosed system prevents exploration. If I tell a bird he's flying in circles on a big globe, he won't bother trying to find anything new. The deception has not been started 2000 years ago. You've been told things in school that make it seem like it would have had to have been started 2k years ago, but that is not the case. With their lies they constructed this narrative, and there was an episode where in popular judeomasonic media, flat earthers were heavily ridiculed and the term was made synonymous with 'idiot' in the jewish press. This is social engineering, and it was no different back then from our modern weaponized terms 'antisemite' and 'conspiracy theorist'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flat earth is real, and it beautifuly connects freemasonry, the jewish world oligarchy, the CFR illuminati, and modern nasa style faux-science. There's a lot of room for speculation when it comes to flat earth, but one thing is certain: There is no curvature.

       You said Flat-earth does not disregard basic math. 
Ok, if it does not do that then I want you to show me how to predict earth's next 10 years of solar eclipses using "Flat-Earth Math"
      </p>
      <p>
       OK? Show me the Flat-Earth science journal that can predict the next 10 years of solar eclipses; giving us the dates and times they will happen, the paths they will take, the duration of darkness, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Globe-Earth Math can do this, it can predict eclipses and those eclipses happen exactly when and where they are predicted to take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       An eclipse is soon to hit the central USA. Hotels near the path are sold out already on the predicted date of the eclipse.  Those same people will fly on engineered machines that take them safely though the air without hitting a dome. It seems that most people have faith in science.

      <p>
       Too bad you believe in a bot-supported conspiracy.

       Scientific models that have NO predictive power are FALSE.

       I know your type, it's not worth the headache engaging with you. You're free to do your own research. There is no 'one' flat earth model that has all the answers. Neither does the globe model have all the answers. Anyway, stay asleep my man. All I can tell you is that I'm many many hours worth of research ahead of you.

       You are asleep to the fact that there is an entire universe created by one all powerful GOD. He put life into that universe and gave it free will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately some form of intelligent life used their free-will and decided to come to earth and play around with human DNA.  That is the conspiracy that is being covered up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government hides the crashed UFOs; the Smithsonian museum dumps the bones of the giants talked about in the bible and other ancient books. Scientists and historians have tried to deny the existence of ancient civilisations which were wiped out in great floods, floods that were also mentioned in ancient books, legend and song. The missing link will never be found because the aliens skipped a generation or two of evolution.

       If you believe in God, then you can believe he can do anything, including a flat-earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says the earth is round.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't believe that the UFOs are extraterrestrials because, if you believe in God, then you believe that God created man in his image. Why would God make another intelligent species other than us? Did he " send his only begotten son" to all their worlds as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a theory that all the UFO talk and 'sightings' are all a ploy to get us to accept that they are real so that they can use a false invasion to bring the world together AKA NWO.

       There are three types of knowledge. 
Spiritual
       <br/>
       Scientific 
Instinctive
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to use all three. 
If you only believe in the bible then you will miss out on scientific knowledge and you may ignore your feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you only believe in science, you are ignoring all the wisdom of your ancestors and your emotional intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you only act instinctively, you will be able to manipulate others but you will lose control of your own lust and greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gotta use all three sets of wisdom in combination. 
If your wisdom triangle is out of balance, you will fail to understand.

       That sounds a bit too woowoo for me, I try to use common sense and trust only that which I can verify myself (aside from evaluating the credibility of sources). I don't know how you can talk about ufo's and alien DNA hybrids and whatnot and get all stuck up about FE. Anyway, not my job to convince you of anything. I know that FE is the truth. You do your thing.

If you're trying to establish credibility for your cause, you're failing miserably. Cause all I see is a guy who dishes out ad hominems and projects unto others what he believes they are trying to do, and then judges them for not succeeding. Get it? Like imagine I called you names, then declared that you were trying to prove the globe earth model in your post, etc. You weren't trying to do that, but I declared that you were, so you failed in doing so, so I get to call you names. Pretty lame and intellectually deficient. The flat earth is not something I'd want to try to 'prove' to anyone. I became convinced of it after a lot of research and study and skepticism. And especially when dealing with someone like op, who thinks he's got it all figured out and knows exactly what other people are (bots, shills, paranoids), it would be an absolute waste of my time to engage him eye to eye.

       What "names" did I call you? What "ad hominem" did I use? My poining out your inability to defend your own positions isn't an unrelated attack on some aspect of your character, it's absolutely relevant to the argument and documented in these exchanges.

       You're avoiding and deflecting away from questions you should, in theory, be able to answer easily. This is not an attack on your character, this is an attack on your untenable position. I made no presumptions as to
       <em>

       My personal opinion, as someone who teaches very advanced concepts to laymen frequently, is that if you are incapable of putting your research and study into an accesible format, then you probably have some serious problems with the actual research and study.

       Furthermore, since you're what you're suggesting is such a world-changing concept, the fact that you don't even care to make the effort over such an apparently grave, drastic issue speaks fucking

       I'm always interested to hear what flat earthers think, as I've encountered several on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, what is your explanation for the phenomenon we call gravity, the fact that objects, regardless of their mass, all accelerate at the same speed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, what do you think is the explanation for the fact that the constellations you see in the southern hemisphere are different from the ones in the northern?
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, what do you think the sun is? How do you explain the electromagnetic spectrum we observe from the sun?

       Glad to see someone with genuine interest. I'll try to make this brief and condensed: Main arguments in favour of flat earth are rooted in knowing and understanding the history of judaism, rothschild zionism, freemasonry, the truth of ww2, the history of nasa (particularly its freemasonic aspect and its faking of the moon landings), and the stranglehold on the publics mind that the elites have via the CFR (they decide what you learn in school). There's a lot to learn that will bit by bit fill in gaps on the way to FE, it's not a fast journey. Gravity is a 'fill in the gap because we don't know this variable' type of thing, similar to dark matter. The real measureable forces are density and buoyancy, nothing else. The azimuthal equidistant is the real map of the world. There's countles incidents of (actually flown, not advertised in ticket sales) flight paths not making sense on the globe, but making perfect sense on the AE map. It is the logo of the UN for a reason (the UN is the vessel for the future one world government of the Rotschild and jewish elites, research the earlier league of nations, who advocated for it, and why it failed). The mainstream explanation for rainbows (I believe) is bullshit, it doesn't do a satisfying job of explaining the arc. However you can easily recreate the effect by breaking light through a dome and having it shine through mist. That dome is the firmament. There's also the phenomenon of three suns being visible on antarctica (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC4Ehfn9bh4">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC4Ehfn9bh4
       </a>
       ) this is also explained by the dome and suns proximity to it (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuUJso1Na_Q">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuUJso1Na_Q
       </a>
       ). No idea what the sun 'is', but it is not as far away as we're made to believe. Stars (this is largely speculation on my part) are projections somehow appearing on the dome (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNHU5KOI9lQ">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNHU5KOI9lQ
       </a>
       ). Constellations look different because you are looking at them from a different angle/distance (AE map helps visualize this and keep in mind they're projected on a curved dome enclosing the flat earth). The geostationary nature of the moon does not make any sense whatsoever if you think about it critically. The 'physics of giant orbs in space' would never bring about a situation in which the moon rotates around the earth in such a manner (no doubt there's convincing sounding artiles on wikipedia about it though). The lack of curvature is a big part of FE theory, and there's plenty of footage showing that without built-in curvature (gopro, fisheye) the horizon does not ever curve, and rises with the viewer (as opposed to sloping down) (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1kz-sqO8qI">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1kz-sqO8qI
       </a>
       ). You can point to beautiful curvatures in nasa footage, at which point nasas credibility and key role as massive propaganda vessel has to be discussed (again if you think the moon landings happened, maybe you should start researching that one). Nasa is the agency used to launder budgets for secretive projects, while it does some rocket tech research and its ISS/Mars rover propaganda. Here you can see how long distance zoom brings back objects that appear to 'drop below the curvature' (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hin3P9zdvRY">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hin3P9zdvRY
       </a>
       ). There's a few other very interesting videos demonstrating visual phenomena that explain common misconceptions regarding the supposed curvature of the earth, but I couldn't find them that quickly. Lastly the knockout proof is in your smartphone, which doesn't have a 'magical gravity detector'. If you download a level app, it uses the phones factory settings to determine the vector pointing straight downwards. And that's the floor. If earth were round you'd have to recalibrate your phone everytime you travel half the globe. But you never have to, because it's flat. There is no curvature. You can try this one yourself, and call your phones manufacturer and ask them about the factory setting. Either way, there's a ton of stuff out there (but also a lot of bullshit used to discredit FE, such as the flat earth society).

       OK, this is very constant with what a lot of other flat earthers believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me preface this by saying I may not address all of your point, because there are a lot to address and I am at work, but I'd like for you to think about this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think its possible that the earth IS a globe, and all of those other theories may also be true? From everything I know of the international banking, one world order, WW2, etc. there is absolutely nothing that hinges on the earth being flat rather than a globe. The most immediate response I usually get from FE people is that they are convinced of those conspiracies, and for some reason they think that they hinge on a flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So thats my preface, I am not trying to discredit any OTHER theory here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with flat earth is that is absolutely and fundamentally does not address basic physical realities we observe every day. Take for instance, gravity. You brought up density and buoyancy. That explanation makes no sense, as it can't explain why an objects density has no effect on the rate at which it sinks! Here is the explanation I gave previously that does a more complete job of describing this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thats not a plausible explanation. Density is not a force, its a measure of mass per unit volume. For an object to move, a force has to act on it. If there were no gravity and you placed a rock in water, it would not move as there is no force acting on it. The force that causes an object to sink is gravity. First lets talk about how fluids behave. As you get deeper in water, pressure increases as more and more water is on top of you pushing down. So lets say you are scubadiving and you are sitting right at 5ft depth. At your feet, the water pressure is higher than at your head. To calculate the force, you would multiply the surface area by the pressure. On the lower half of your body, you are being pushed on harder than the upper half, so the net force is actually UPWARD, that is why you feel lighter when you're in water than when you're on land: The density gradient in water is higher because its a more dense fluid. The reason you sink is that you are being pulled down towards earth harder than you are being pushed upward by pressure differences. So lets say that it is pressure differences holding us down (even though we know that the pressure gradient is actually pushing us up), in that case, more dense objects should fall faster than less dense objects. But we can demonstrate that thats not true: drop a block of lead and a block of wood: they fall at the same rate, meaning density does not effect the rate of descent. Additionally, if density gradients were causing us to 'sink' to the earth, if you were to pull a vacuum in a glass container and put an object in it, that object would not sink as there is no density gradient to sink in. Or you could make the argument that it should sink FASTER, because you can't pull a true vacuum, so it would actually just be less dense air. Neither are the case: it falls at the same speed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So we know that the flat earth model fails to explain gravity. Next we have constellations. I would suggest you get a small book on stargazing... even if it is a dome with projections on it, its absolutely fascinating. Humans have been seeing the same constellations for thousands of years and it is reliable enough to make calendars and clocks out of. Is it alien technology or do you think we had supercomputers and laser projectors in 2000BC? Next, draw in a diagram how it is possible that you can see a constellation on one part of the flat earth, say England, but Alaska, which is relatively close on the flat earth model I am familiar with, sees something completely different, and mexico sees something completely different than that. There is no way to explain that unless you chose to not draw a diagram.

Humans have been seeing the same constellations for thousands of years and it is reliable enough to make calendars and clocks out of. Is it alien technology or do you think we had supercomputers and laser projectors in 2000BC? Next, draw in a diagram how it is possible that you can see a constellation on one part of the flat earth, say England, but Alaska, which is relatively close on the flat earth model I am familiar with, sees something completely different, and mexico sees something completely different than that. There is no way to explain that unless you chose to not draw a diagram.

       And finally the sun: flat earth theory has NO explanation for what the sun is, and IMO its completely damning of the theory. The sun emits a huge spectrum of radiation, everything from gamma to radio waves. We can measure the power that just the earth receives from these waves, and it is ENORMOUS, 10
       <sup>
        17
       </sup>
       watts. Do you think its alien technology? Some kind of enormous fusion reactor? How does it rotate around the dome?

       As for the phone thing, your phone has an accelerometer. Gravity is a force, meaning it has magnitude and direction. A force is calculated as mass times acceleration. The direction of the force is always 'down' as we perceive it, which is towards the center of the earth.

       There was a time when people believed whole heartedly that the earth was flat and that you will walk off. I wonder if they, in the same breath, talked about how evolved they were and how much smarter they are.

      <p>
       Today we have global warming.

      <p>
       A thousand years from now people are going to be laughing at us for believing the earth was going to melt because of cars. Meanwhile, we talk about how evolved an intelligent we've become because we have smartphones and social media.

       Shut the hell up, seriously. Your upvotes are probably from bots because nobody would actually waste 2 seconds on this thread. You're accusing people of being bots over your horribly formed sentence. The only reason you can read it is because you probably ate a few too many paint chips growing up and that's actually how you spell.

       I don't believe everyone is a bot. 
However AI bots are going to become a serious problem on the internet unless we can detect them and ban them.
      </p>
      <p>
       My stupid riddle is one way, but we need more effective methods. 
Once AI can learn to even fool biometric detection we are fucked. 
The people controlling AI will control us. We will be having live video chats with artificial humans and they will be persuading us how to vote and behave.

       I don't know if you played Fallout 4, but that sentiment is eerily similar to an "enclave" you can join where you have to answer a series of questions to prove that you aren't a synth (synthetic human being).  Logical arguments defeat them, but your line will probably only work so far.  Some bot may be able to string a sentence together based on the sound, not just the spelling.  A bot would not probably call you out and pick apart your question.  Also, bots aren't stupid funny like real people are.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be cool to try and devise questions to break bots.  Or be able to test specific questions against various types of bots.  I did against the old Eliza thingy and maybe one actual chatbot, but they were pretty crappy back then.  I guess "they're" having us do it unwittingly in a way.  ;)

       Do you know what fake Twitter accounts are? Bots. Maybe they are mainly just doing up-voting and one off comments but they will grow in their influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should the rich and powerful be allowed to manage bot-farms that up vote opinions and ideas they support. Should bots be allowed to pretend to be human.
How about I send a bunch of bots to the r/depression subreddit and program them to encourage people to commit suicide as a way out. Does that sound ok? Anybody need to go to jail for that? Cause we don't have specific laws against programming computers to impersonate human users.

       120 years ago many people believed we would never fly.

      <p>
       Someday AI is going to be very clever. You don't believe it? 
Because AI just keep on making progress. Chess, Jeopardy, Crossword puzzles, the Chinese master of the strategy game "GO" was just beaten.  Speech recognition, Speech production, Siri....
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think progress on AI is just going to suddenly stop? 
Do you think it will hit some kind of wall? Really? Can you describe exactly which wall it will hit?. 
Progress on AI is now moving faster than people ever imagined.
       <br/>
       AI programs are now teaching things to other AI programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       A computer that does object recognition of things in photos is teaching another program that renders realistic virtual video frames one at a time based on previous video frames.
      </p>
      <p>
       How long before they just let an AI loose on everyone's Reddit comment history and the AI sucks it all up and starts to understand how to be funny or how to verbally attack an opponent in order to get another person to back down.

       I showed you the link to the guy tracking shills back to Amazon. Now maybe most shills are still human. But a bot shill could work 24 hours a day.  And a down voting shill could be working right now up or down voting posts or comments on this subreddit or on r/the_Donald or on r/news.

       Maybe I am a couple years early. 
Better late than never. 
Debating this topic has made me realize how bot impersonation of humans is wrong. We need to outlaw bots that pretend to be people. 
I know Siri voice on my phone is not a real person. 
In the future bots may call you or text you and try to sell you something. That is as bad as robo-calling which is not illegal in many states.

       And r/conspiracy is not obscure. There are many truths coming out here that other people have not conception of. 
It is important that they shut us down in a non-obvious way. 
One way to do that would be to discredit us with non-scientifically verifiable conspiracies.

       A creative human will make up an answer. A bot will not understand the question and panic, trying to avoid answering. The funny thing is a lot of flat-earth supporters panicked and would avoid answering the question.

      <p>
       To be honest, I had no answer for the question at first. 
Some people screwed up thinking the only hole was their fly zipper opening. I had to remind them that they have a waist and two legs. So you, could say 4 holes if you include the fly. However, fashion screws up the answer because a lot of people have rips in their jeans so what is the best answer?
      </p>
      <p>
       My favorite answer is two holes for men and three for women. 
Get it? Men have their A-hole and their P-hole in their pants. Woman also have a baby hole, ha ha. Classic Junior High school humor.

       I'm not saying that because there are flat-earthers, all conspiracies are wrong, but it is a common theme in this sub, and for many conspiracies in general, to reject the dominate beliefs in science (e.g. GMOs, vaccines, truthers).
      </p>
      <p>
       So it shouldn't be surprising at all that there is another conspiracy that also rejects the overwhelming opinion of science. Honestly, for most of us who
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       actually scientists and engineers, most of the conspiracy theories sound nearly as scientifically ignorant/misinformed as flat-earthers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it is time to stop thinking about how people are trying to mislead you by harping on about fake conspiracies and start asking yourself how much you might actually be acting like these people.

       Seriously, you talk about GMOs, but the overwhelming opinion of scientists all over the world, from many different organizations, both NGO and GO, agree that there is no scientific basis to treat GMOs any differently than any other new food. Rejecting this opinion is
       <em>
        almost
       </em>
       to the same level as rejecting the overwhelming opinion of scientists, from both NGO and GO, that the earth is round. It seems to me that, because of this, you are the one being manipulated by a small group of people trying to sow confusion.

       The biggest problem with GMO is most of them are designed to work with herbicides.  Do you know what Roundup is? Is is a herbicide that is used on GMO plants (especially corn) that are designed to be unaffected by it.  So, Monsanto get to sell the seeds and the herbicides together as a package.  If you don't grow Monsanto corn but by accident your corn picks up the genes blown over from a neighboring farm, Monsanto sues you to force you to buy from them in the future. So that sucks for the independent farmer and for crop variety. Crop variety is a form of food security. GMO could quickly cause food insecurity.  Did you know the most popular banana may go extinct. It is because the banana varieties are not from seeds, they are cuttings from a banana plant that had no seeds over 100 years ago. This is called monoculture and one disease is slowly wiping out our most popular banana.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ample evidence that Monsanto insiders in the EPA have covered up the harmful affects of Roundup on humans. That is too bad because if you are American, RoundUp is on most of the corn, soybean and many other grains that you eat. Have you look at the average corn eating American lately, they don't look very healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also evidence that Roundup and other herbicides are killing the bees.  When we have no bees there won't be anymore nuts or fruits.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah, the GMO/Herbicide agricultural complex is not a problem right? Large companies don't control over 90% of agriculture in America, right? The family farm is obsolete, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Poisons in our food, monoculture, family farms, no bees. 
But that is all a conspiracy of lies, right?

       Not true. The main patents on roundup expired by 2000. You can buy generic roundup (glyphosate) at this point. But even if it were the case, if you didn't like the practice, you could simply stop buying from them.

      <p>
       Nope. This is an urban legend. To explain, a farmer knew that his neighbor was using roundup ready soy, and so he knew that some would blow into the edge of his field. So he doused that area with roundup to kill off all the non-Round up ready soy. He then collected the seeds, and planted them almost exclusively the next year in his fields. His crop was something like 95% Monsanto IP the next year and he didn't even deny doing it, he just claimed it was his right because it was his private property and he had never signed an agreement with Monsanto. The courts told him that this was IP theft. Whether or not you think this is right depends on how you view private property rights vs IP rights. But it certainly wasn't an accident by any stretch of the imagination.

       Did you also know that these bananas aren't GMO? Monoculture is not an issue with GMO, it is an issue with certain farming practices. Ironically, they had this same issue with papayas in Hawaii and the industry was actually

       I've not seen anything convincing. But even if this is true, it doesn't change the fact that there is plenty of public studies that show how round up is one of the safest herbicides we've created. This is not to say that I don't think we overuse it.

       There is no reliable evidence that this is the case. In fact,
       <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jee/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jee/tov269">
        the only real study I've come across on this says that it has actually a low toxicity to bees.

      <p>
       Yeah, pretty much. Which is my point. The overwhelming scientific consensus on RoundUp is that it is among the safest herbicides ever. Monoculture has nothing to do with GE. The loss of family farms has nothing to do with GM. The scientific consensus is that RoundUp has nothing or little to do with the collapse of bees (which isn't even happening anymore).

       You are rejecting the science on the matter because you think someone in the government is covering it up. This is

       MONSANTO’S HARVEST OF FEAR
Monsanto already dominates America’s food chain with its genetically modified seeds. Now it has targeted milk production. Just as frightening as the corporation’s tactics–ruthless legal battles against small farmers–is its decades-long history of toxic contamination.

       The first case they talk about in that article is against Reinhart, and it turned out that someone in his family had actually violated the patent, and they ended up settling. Of course, the article doesn't mention this and that seems terribly one-sided and I don't feel like reading the whole thing. So do you mind, specifically, about what in the article supports your claim that accidental blowing of seeds gets you sued and forced to purchase monstanto products?

       So, is this an admission that the article you posted to support your claim doesn't actually support your claim? Now, you want me to go watch 3 movies? As far as I know, they won't support your claim either.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the information is out there, I am sure you can find it on the internet. However, I doubt it is because I've asked this question numerous times before and no one can actually come up with a case of this happening.

       You may be right and it may come out. But, as of now, the vast majority of scientific bodies say it safe, the one that doesn't was based off of research by a scientists that (according to one of your links) was ignored and didn't report information that contradicted his findings. All you have is some possible open investigations, but the only concluded studies seem to suggest the opposite. Like flat-earthers, you are ignoring the science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, Monsanto, a corporation that is about the same size as Whole Foods, has every world scientific body in their pocket. It's the only thing you've got, and it is incredibly weak.

       Look this is r/conspiracy.  I used to work in a "Good" corporation. 
By watching the people in this "good" corporation, I learned that many of the people at the top are "bad" people driven by greed and a lust for power. I saw them break the law with impunity.

       I assume the same exact thing happens at ALL corporations, it is my safety default setting. If a corporation can spend money to encourage the publication of papers that state that their product is harmless, they will do it again and again and again.

       How long has the sugar industry fooled us with criticism of fats?
       <br/>
       Fat does not cause high blood sugar, Sugar causes high blood sugar. EGGS cause heart disease because they have cholesterol? Really? Holy shit!! THAT IS NOT TRUE.
       <br/>
       Yet, look around you. What do you see? An obesity epidemic and heart disease brought on high blood sugar related inflammation causing cholesterol build up in the heart.

       What did we see in the 1950 to 1990's, high levels of lung cancer due to people like my grandfather smoking for 40 years. Yeah, he also did not believe in seat-belts.

       When will we see the kidney cancer rates go up from Roundup and when will brain cancer rates go up from increasing cellphone tower radiation emission. Those studies on harmful effects of microwaves  are being suppressed by Big Telecom. So the good science is still being drowned out by bad science.

       That being said, I fear the monopoly, but this could happen with or without GMOs. If the problem is with a large company like Monsanto controlling too much of the food supply, that I am willing to entertain. But the issue isn't limited to GMOs, as you demonstrated when you showed a non-GM crop running high risk of extinction due to monoculture.

Why don't you cite Tobacco on the health benefits of smoking.

       Or I could just cite "fooddemocracynow" and "ecowatch" when I'm trying to make my case against Monsanto. It's the same level of citing a ridiculously biased source. Which was my point.

       There is an interesting aspect to what I call the Science (note the capital "S") psy-op.
      </p>
      <p>
       The psy-op itself is a syllogism, if A then B.  Here, A = {various well-established scientific theories, data, and propositions taken as 'fact'} and B = {reductionist/materialist nihilism}.   To operate effectively in this world, especially against totalitarian interests, it is necessary to reject B, and most people who still have some native awareness mistrust B.  However, if you accept the syllogism, rejecting B means rejecting A.  You know: if not B then not A (follows from basic logic).   So now they have you, because there is overwhelming evidence in support of A.  By this kind of reasoning (which happens more or less unconsciously) you get people to buy into B.

       I don't see Flat Earth posts here, or at least not ones trying to show support for the idea.  What I do see quite often, on the other hand, are people in this sub making posts and comments shitting on both FE as a conspiracy theory and FE believers just out of the blue.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's with the No True Conspiracy Theorist stuff?  If a FE post shows up in the sub, go in the comments and discuss it with them.  You claim it's a waste of time and we should discuss more important issues, but to actual believers it
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       an important issue in the same way you see something as important.  And posts like this one could be seen as a waste because not only are you wasting time(according to you) arguing with FE'ers, you would also be wasting time talking about arguing with FE'ers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, on another note, what in the heck do you expect to be done with them if you dislike them so much?  There's no way in hell there'd ever be a ban on FE posts/comments in this sub, so they'll continue.  Posting something like this will just make the real believers more sure of themselves because they'll see you as a shill trying to keep the truth hidden, and the ones you feel are a conspiracy will know that their tactics are working and they should step it up.

       Just ignore them then I guess.  You can't control it and any attention positive or negative you give to it only fuels it.  Either AI, Human Counter Intelligence, Actual believers in flat earth, or just plain trolls looking to see the world burn, repeat: Just don't give it your attention.

       How about down vote it if anything? Disregard the buzzwords of "shill" and what not if you get called that, because it that thinking only sets a community back to a name calling, blacklisting McCarthyism type mindset.

       The main important thing of all in this huge mess of conspiracy, corruption, and power is we as human beings need to actually understand what freedom means and how to maintain it.

       The unrest and frustration I think we feel is that the human experience is being undermined and taken advantage of in the most nefarious of ways.

       It is not just the possibility of flat-earth bots, I was also concerned with a couple posts that implied that humans are stupid or useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now maybe today those posts were actual angry or frustrated people but what happens with the AI learns to disrupt discussions with a variety of attacks. We lose our humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason why WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW AI BOTS to pretend to be people.  We, as humans, are born, suffer and work and we have earned the right to be heard.  One rich guy does not deserve to pretend to be 1 million people and have even more influence over our opinions, our behavior and our lives.

       Wrong. The Mossad are the ones who have all the dirty little videos of ⅓ of the important people in DC.  If US leaders don't do as Israel says,  people start to get exposed "Dennis Hastert"/Anthony Weiner style.

       You're confused. Pizzagate is the psyop, Trump's child rape with Epstein is what they are trying to distract from with Pizzagate. Why else do you think "Pizzagate" was unleashed right at the election?

       It doesn't make sense that flat earth discussion is infested with shills debunking and trolling the flat earthers which makes me think they're onto something. I haven't visited the flat earth subs in a year but it was always the same people from topmindsofreddit showing up in every single flat earth related post all across reddit every day.

       There are plenty of reasons to not accept the earth is a spinning ball. I'm not a flat earth believer by a long shot But look at why they believe, not what they believe. Just recently actually I was like, "flat earth is a psyop/ fake conspiracy to discredit"
      </p>
      <p>
       What I found to be the best evidence:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) Flight paths that make no sense, like flying from Argentina to Australia you figure you'd zoom right over the south pole. Nope, you go north then east. In fact, no flights go over Antarctica. Strange. But doesn't mean the earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Nasa rarely shows what they claim to be real photos of space. They even admit most of what you see when you Google 'earth from space' is all cgi/computer mock ups.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) The horizon meets your eye level with no curve at 30,000 feet as demonstrated by dogcam.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) when building the railroads they accounted for extra track to justify for the eat the curve and had the exact amount left over
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people who believe in 'flat earth' don't believe the world is a really actually literally flat. Like how the church of Satan doesn't believe in Satan. Flat earthers say" the world is probably not a spinning ball, since NASA probably lied about the moon landing, they've set a precedent they aren't to be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before my inbox rips, not a believer. Not a flat earth bot. But some of what they say should be investigated even if the motive may be wrong.

       I've tried looking into Flat Earth before. Not because I believe it, but just because I don't have to believe a conspiracy to want to read about it. I just like thinking about stuff. Like why is it that people can fly and sail around the world? Idk tell me about some fucking portal or something left by aliens or reptiles. Just SOMETHING to fucking think about but I could not find anything explaining how or why the Earth would be flat.

       Nice summary. 
Flat Earth not really start trending on Google until about 2014. 
When I was a kid, we thought flat earth was a thing ignorant people believed in around the time of Galileo. However, even then no sensible person believed it. Columbus did not set off thinking he would sail off the edge of the earth.

       I'm not a bot, Eric Dubay/ODD Reality/RichieFromBoston's tens of thousands of subscribers aren't bots, all the crowd-sourced billboards aren't bots. It's not a CIA or Russian psyop, it's never not been around technically, buts it's blown up since early 2015 and you're not going to stop hearing about it because it's a fact, not a fad. Shaq, Kyrie, Tila Tequila, B.o.B., you're going to also see controlled opposition in the future. They're terrified of flat Earth growing, there's actually a "square flat earth" psyop going on within flat Earth communities right now. If you're a free thinker that still takes what NASA says (including coincidences and theories) as gospel, then you're only Diet Woke

       I think Nasa is  full of shit on a lot of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what about Earth scientists who don't work for NASA. The majority do not work for NASA and ALL geologists will state that the Earth is a globe. Oh geographers too (They make maps).
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are asking me to believe that every geologist in the world is either:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) Deceived by the global earth conspiracy.    OR 
B) Part of the global earth conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       My sister is a geologist working for the EPA. I will ask her what group she is in.  She is pretty high up so I am guessing they brought her into the coverup.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I am just joking, you are all idiots with no respect for the hard work done by mathematicians and scientists who have to ability to determine reality.  To also believe that all astrophysicists are just shilling about space in order to take part in a cover-up is EXTREME paranoia and shows a lack not just of intellect but a complete lack of EQ or emotional quotient or ability to trust in some of our fellow humans. Pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, it sad you believe in a god who created only the earth, sun moon and some twinkly lights in the sky.  The GOD I believe in is much more powerful. He was able to create the entire UNIVERSE and he filled it with energy, light and life. He filled with billions of other stars and other planets. This is the official position of most modern churches by the way. The Vatican has it own telescope in Arizona for Christ's sake.

      <p>
       You do. If you’re standing at the equator, your perceived gravity will reduce by approximately 0.35% from the average 9.8 m/s2. This is because the centrifugal force on an object due to the rotation of the Earth is highest at the equator.

       So are Dubay and Jeranism flesh bots? I have never met a serious FEer in  the flesh, but my buddy claims his roommates friends are of the ilk. I can't wait to meet them. I hope I have a few whiskeys in me first!

       Wait until your friends have a couple beers in them and ask them why pilots don't fly in straight lines when they fly from New York to Tokyo. The next time they fly a long distance tell them to go the cockpit and demand that the pilot stop the flat-earth cover up and fly in a straight line to the destination. Ask them how many seconds before they are taped into their seats. What a shame, all the airlines taking the longer curved route just to be sure to maintain the Globe-earth lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have to, bring a ball so you can show them with their own fingers that a curved path is shorter.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW In N. Hemisphere pilots curve north as a shortcut. 
AND In S. Hemisphere pilots curve south as a shortcut.

       Well my favorite is they say that a pilot would have to "nose down" constantly.

       Well wouldn't they need to "veer right" constantly if they were going west to east? !?!

       I suspect one of the disinformation/propaganda vectors is to promote the idea that a much larger segment of the population than most people would believe are not rational or critical thinkers so that when moronic agendas are pursued, rational people can be asked to believe they were holding the minority opinion or that the inmates are running the asylum.   /s

       It may seem I am joking about bots but I am not. 
Bots are real and the "powers that be" are using them to influence human opinions and possibly manipulate our behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat-Earthers usually have their beliefs because they have lost faith in their government, educational system, corporate science and the mass-media. So, they latch onto a theory which fits their outrage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to show them that they need to be more paranoid than they actually are. In actuality, they are being manipulated and abused with the flat-earth theory by the powers that be who are using the internet and bots to fuck with us humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat-earth not only discredits followers of conspiracy but more importantly I believe it covers up the the fact that 'gods' or 'aliens' messed with human DNA. They need to understand that accepting Globe-Earth theory does not reject the one true powerful and almighty GOD who created not just a dome but an almost infinite universe teeming with life.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of GOD can only create one tiny planet with a small sun and a crappy moon. My GOD created AN ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

       Too short, too pithy, possibly pre-programmed answer. 
Only two people in this comment thread have answered my question. How are you going to feel when we have solid proof that bots are manipulating our opinions and behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have faith that my GOD created an entire vast universe teeming with life. Your god created a flat-earth, a dome, one sun and one moon. Pathetic.

       The NWO isn't even a conspiracy, almost every President in the 20th century openly discussed it. You really need to do some research before you discount legitimate info based on your own negligence to do due diligence.

       And without getting in to the rest of your nonsense, I was referencing the simple fact that you can fly directly from Australia to South Africa faster than, lets say Japan - Spain, and that isn't possible on any FE model I've seen. If you have a different model, feel free to post it

       The scary thing is watching reddit subs almost instantly fall to noise generation techniques like these.     Or maybe it's just ad revenue techniques, maybe this is the new clickbait.
