<p>You are clearly a sock puppet account with a clear agenda.</p>

<p>Your mind is clearly made up, and therefore nothing you post can be considered objective.</p>

<p>At one point recently the mods were even considering banning accounts like yours, which I hella support.</p>

<p>Despite what you or the visitors might think, no one here is taking you seriously.</p>

<p>Any &#39;evidence&#39; you post is automatically assumed to be biased, cherry picked, or even downright fabricated.</p>

<p>You an assert the veracity or righteousness of your agenda all you want, it doesn&#39;t make you any less of a joke.</p>

<p>Is it nothing? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s nothing. Hillary sold Uranium to Russia, but somehow Trump appearing in a rap video is &quot;possibly&quot; hard evidence he colluded with Russia. You&#39;re a joke.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a Washington Examiner article from YESTERDAY.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-russia-collusion-fades-from-the-media-headlines/article/2626994">http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-russia-collusion-fades-from-the-media-headlines/article/2626994</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On a near-daily basis for the past five months, the national media published &quot;bombshell&quot; after &quot;bombshell,&quot; incrementally building a narrative that President Trump&#39;s 2016 campaign coordinated with the Russian government and that when the feds were onto him, Trump tried to throw them off by removing James Comey as director of the FBI.</p>

<p>But following Comey&#39;s anti-climactic testimony earlier this month, and the testimonies of other intelligence officials, the subject is very suddenly not so juicy.</p>

<p>Writing in the Washington Post on Tuesday, Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of the far-left Nation magazine, accused the media of harboring a &quot;myopic obsession with all things Russia&quot; that amounts to &quot;malpractice&quot; in journalism.</p>

<p>True</p>

<p>When weeks and weeks worth of multiple investigations go by — the FBI and both houses of Congress are all investigating the same thing — with nothing to show for them</p>

<p>David Brooks, another columnist for the Times who spends his days Googling mental disorders to diagnose Trump with, admitted this week that it&#39;s &quot;striking how little evidence there is that any underlying crime occurred — that there was any actual collusion between the Donald Trump campaign and the Russians.&quot;</p>

<p>That comment came after Comey said that an entire New York Times report alleging &quot;repeated contacts&quot; between Trump and his associates with &quot;senior Russian intelligence officials&quot; was false</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your belief is based on a liberal propaganda campaign that was forced on you for months, with anonymous source after anonymous source, and was wrong every time. Your belief is based on what you want to be true, not on what is actually true.</p>

<p>My belief is based on there being ZERO evidence that Trump colluded with Russia, even after the wiretapping, the investigations, they found NOTHING - because there is nothing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then low and behold a week or two later Trump is under investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is WRONG. Trump&#39;s lawyer says he&#39;s not under investigation. You&#39;ve fallen for fake news, AGAIN. Are you that gullible?</p>

<p>I hate to cite the Crappy News Network: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/18/politics/jay-sekulow-donald-trump/index.html">http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/18/politics/jay-sekulow-donald-trump/index.html</a></p>

<p>Trump tweets: &quot;I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt&quot;</p>

<p>That tweet was in response to a Washington Post story that ran with <strong>five unnamed sources</strong>. Trump&#39;s lawyer says President isn&#39;t under investigation. </p>

<p>Clinton didn&#39;t sell Uranium to Russia. The United States doesn&#39;t have a wealth of minable Uranium, and you&#39;re not allowed to ship it out of the country.</p>

<p>We actually import Uranium from Russia oddly enough. And the Russians bought a Uranium mine in America is what that story says.</p>

<p>It is also true that large donations to the foundation from the chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer, at around the time of the Russian purchase of the company and while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, were never disclosed to the public. The multimillion sums were channeled through a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation, CGSCI, which did not reveal its individual donors.</p>

<p>Such awkward collisions between Bill’s fundraising activities and Hillary’s public service have raised concerns not just among those who might be dismissed as part of a vast right-wing conspiracy.</p>

<p>Yep, because he didn&#39;t have to run for re-election again. This was also at a time before Putin and the US started having tense relations, which were a result of us backing Ukraine and pushing for sanctions.</p>

<p>This was back when Romney was saying Russia is our biggest enemy, and the GOP, as well as most Americans agreed.</p>

<p>The difference between Obama and Trump is the volume of contact between those around Trump in contact with Russia and the actions he&#39;s taken at a time when we&#39;re at odds with them. You have people like Flynn and Sessions lying about meetings with the Russians, and Kuschner as well.</p>

<p>James Comey told the American public that he, the FBI Director of the United States of America, couldn&#39;t trust the President to not lie. He believed, after he was fired that the President did so to because of the Russia investigation, and that he believe the President wanted him to stop investigating Flynn. That is pretty damning stuff right there. </p>

<p>No matter how deep you bury your head in the sand, Trump is a liar, and everyone knows it. But for your FBI Director to say that the NSAs can&#39;t trust him? That&#39;s pretty big shit.</p>

<p>Dismissing that is reckless, and un-American.</p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t under investigation? Someone might want to tell Made for TV Rich Guy Precedent that:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the screenshots certainly show that quote, we should remember that voting for someone doesn&#39;t necessarily mean supporting them. There could be all sorts of reason someone might vote for Trump and hate him..</p>

<p>They could view it as the only way to shake the system up. Or maybe they live someone like CA and their vote literally doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s not for a Democrats. Or maybe they just wanna watch the world burn. Or maybe they did like Trump during the campaign but have grown to hate his policies. </p>

<p>While he probably <em>did</em> support Trump, I&#39;m not sure why we&#39;re surprised someone would cash on Trump&#39;s fame. If it&#39;s true that he&#39;s a Trump &quot;supporter&quot;, what he did was cash in on the hatred for the man. Scummy or not, it&#39;s a smart &quot;business&quot; move. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. I have no idea why he did this. I think the main reason why is to monetize the subs somehow. </p>

<p>The format of the sub is just like t_d, and at least in the beginning, alot of the memes were from t_d and actually made liberals look bad and made Trump look good, such as the Trump dancing video that was upvoted alot and often in the marchagainsttrump sub.</p>

<p>My own pet theory is that they created the sub as a way to  &quot;clearly show&quot; how &quot;liberals&quot; are manipulating reddit with bots. Similiar to a false flag. I think eventually, the moderators are going to pull a prank on liberals or use it for nefarious purposes.</p>

<p>But, I can be wrong, and it&#39;s most likely as you said, probably just an opportunist. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t put it past some people to try and make &quot;libtards&quot; look bad. I find it stupid, as they don&#39;t need any help, but people are dumb :) </p>

<p>That said, I do think it was just an opportunistic shithead. Likely looking to get a sub built as quickly as possible, latching onto the hot meme (Trump is literally Hitler), and then sell it off to some Democratic person who can use it to gather information and shit. </p>

<p>I have no doubt that happens all the time, too, because data is both valuable and expensive. </p>

<p>Completely irrelevant. Rules are rules</p>

<p>No, it was an irrelevant comment. It was in no way attacking you personally. If you removed it, it would be mod abuse, you weren&#39;t &quot;being nice&quot; by not removing it.</p>
