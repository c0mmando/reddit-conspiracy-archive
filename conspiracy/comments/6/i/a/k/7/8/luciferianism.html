        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Luciferianism is Satanism masked in the false light of superficiality and religion. Freemasons are known for worshiping Lucifer and most Freemasons are self identified Christians. Luciferians dress in nice clothes, speak proper, drive nice cars while they condemn others for superficial reasons. They covertly condemn the poor and sick as sinners and claim they are being punished by God. Freemasons are involved in covert persecution against those who oppose their ways and control. Freemasons also created other types of secret societies which they use to do their dirty work. Freemasons get paid to gang stalk and persecute people all over the United States. They operate covertly. They poison people. They slander people. They vandalize their property. They cyber stalk their victims. They gang stalk and mentally terrorize their victims. They are involved with using electronic weapons on people. Electromagnetic Pulse weapons do exist and they are even sold online. Their persecution often leads to deaths, mental break downs, hospitalization, or prison for the victims. Many Freemasons and members of secret societies are involved in computer hacking as well. These secret societies are being funded by the Vatican and royal families through offshore accounts, paypal, and private Swiss banking.</p>

<p>From your link.</p>

<p>Nowhere in religion or the occult is Satan a being, the word is a verb and was mistakenly translated as a proper noun in the west.</p>

<p>&quot;Lucifer is Satan&quot; - &quot;Lucifer is the opposition&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t realize, all this time, that the three Abrahamic religions with all of the evil and destruction and arrogance, compounded by the ignorance they imbue into the minds of billions of people were in fact, all along, Luciferians.</p>

<p>How about that.</p>

<p>I suppose, as a Luciferian I would not know any better. Even though I&#39;ve been criticizing them from the very beginning and calling them out for what they are, and am routinely ignored by most people. And will be ignored by even you, at the moment you read this.</p>

<p>But somehow that&#39;s my fault that you don&#39;t know any better, I guess.</p>

<p>Because, you know, I&#39;m the devil.</p>
