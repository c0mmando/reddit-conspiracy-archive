       Luciferianism is Satanism masked in the false light of superficiality and religion. Freemasons are known for worshiping Lucifer and most Freemasons are self identified Christians. Luciferians dress in nice clothes, speak proper, drive nice cars while they condemn others for superficial reasons. They covertly condemn the poor and sick as sinners and claim they are being punished by God. Freemasons are involved in covert persecution against those who oppose their ways and control. Freemasons also created other types of secret societies which they use to do their dirty work. Freemasons get paid to gang stalk and persecute people all over the United States. They operate covertly. They poison people. They slander people. They vandalize their property. They cyber stalk their victims. They gang stalk and mentally terrorize their victims. They are involved with using electronic weapons on people. Electromagnetic Pulse weapons do exist and they are even sold online. Their persecution often leads to deaths, mental break downs, hospitalization, or prison for the victims. Many Freemasons and members of secret societies are involved in computer hacking as well. These secret societies are being funded by the Vatican and royal families through offshore accounts, paypal, and private Swiss banking.

       The same Vatican that mentions Catholics can't in good conscious become a mason? And that will not accept masons because of their heretical beliefs?

       I agree they're the bad guys but I feel you're conflating issues and using freemasonry as a deus ex machina.

       The Knights of Malta, Knights of Columbus, and Italian Mafia use the same types of initiations as Freemasonry. The P2 Masonic Lodge was involved with the Vatican. The Italian Nobility that run the Vatican created modern Freemasonry.

       Seems kinda biased, no? Have you read into what they believe and why? Seems like you didn't put any thought into it. How about the basic understand of how they think Lucifer is = good because they tried to allow humans to have the fruit of knowledge and for humans to be smart and enlighted, against God's wishes?

       Their knowledge is stolen and perverse. They practice kabbalah and use it for mind control and tormenting people with witchcraft as a means to dominate over society. They are trained liars that claim to control and know everything. They are intellectual thieves that claim credit for what is not theirs. They didn't even know who Lucifer was until I told them.

       Any thoughts on why the Luciferians are trying to fabricate individuals to manifest as if they are Christ?  Like doing things to create the illusion of someone being Christ, false miracles, etc?  Is that to perpetuate their design for yet another go around?

       Lucyfer is believed to be a different being from Satan,  I don't know if what we call "Satanism" worships them as the same thing. But dark occultism between the elites and the church is very real here is an interview of an exorcists that talks about it:

       I read an interesting comparison in a book that I can't remember that said, "Lucifer and Satan are not the same being, but a valid comparison would be dialing a house where either of them could pick up."

       Take the teachings of Jesus from the Church, and all you're left with is Luciferiansm.
      </p>
      <p>
       These systems didn't begin this way, even Freemasonry, but they were all co-opted. They all began as mystery school teachings from before the destruction of Atlantis and survived into Ancient Egypt. The Archons began incarnating into human bodies, and under the watchful EYE of Lucifer, began many systems of enslavement and control.

       There are average Freemasons that are not fully initiated. They draw in people into their lodges through propaganda. They then select the ones that have sociopathic tendencies to be initiated in their inner circles. I believe their degrees in their outer circles are similar in format to their degrees in the inner circle. This creates confusion and a layer of protection. I have noticed that many non initiated Freemasons are still corrupt and get paid money to spread lies and propaganda all over the internet. They often use their children to spread disinformation and chaos online.

       How much direct experience do you have with Luciferianism, OP?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Luciferians dress in nice clothes, speak proper, drive nice cars while they condemn others for superficial reasons.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Like.. say, molesting and killing children in churches, believing in retarded conspiracy theories, funding and supporting Islamic terrorist groups to sow instability and strife around the world, all while claiming to be upstanding Christians, Muslims, and Jews?
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't realize, all this time, that the three Abrahamic religions with all of the evil and destruction and arrogance, compounded by the ignorance they imbue into the minds of billions of people were in fact, all along, Luciferians.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose, as a Luciferian I would not know any better. Even though I've been criticizing them from the very beginning and calling them out for what they are, and am routinely ignored by most people. And will be ignored by even you, at the moment you read this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But somehow that's my fault that you don't know any better, I guess.
      </p>

       Because, you know, I'm the devil.
