    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s very valid. The same Sandy Hook hoaxers believe there were crisis actors used at Boston.  All the photos of the Boston victims are staged,  blood packs used is what they say. They would say the same for any Sandy Hook victims because that&#39;s what conspiracy theorist do.

    <div class="md"><p>Weren&#39;t parents not allowed to identify the bodies of their children?  That&#39;s just insanity.</p>

<p>And when was the last time we dismantled a building entirely because of a shooting?  I&#39;ve never heard of it other than this instance, although it does seem to have some psychological benefit to the community.  Still, there was some released footage of the school that looked like the school was in great disrepair and many areas were filled with junk/leftover school supplies, as if it were a giant storage facility.  If that was genuine footage, it sure raises a lot of questions.</p>

<p>This was a hard one for me to believe with strong conviction due to the nature of the tragedy, but there are too many very odd things about all of it for me to think the MSM story is sound.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t figure out the Adam Lanza part of it.  It seems like he was a real kid, but many claim he was fabricated.  That seems really difficult to fabricate.</p>

<p>Also, weren&#39;t there teachers allegedly killed?  I understand how a child&#39;s identity could be covered up or fabricated easily, but shouldn&#39;t there be a sizeable network of friends and family to vouch for the deaths of the teachers?</p>

<p>There are a ton of other suspicious parts to this story, too.  I don&#39;t want this one to be not what it seems, but you really can&#39;t help but notice how bizarre it all is.</p>

<p>If it was a bonafide shooting, there is probably something more to it than what the news has told us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official story is that there was a law passed in CT. to seal off all the evidence from the public. If this event truly happened as reported then this law is part of problem causing the continuing conspiracy theories. Sure, there would still be some even if released, but it would hard to deny it happened. </p>

<p>Amazing when the idea is brought up that it was staged event how it is resisted. But when I ask someone how they <em>know</em> it happened for sure the stock answer is &quot;there&#39;s no way they could pull it off without someone talking.&quot; But they can&#39;t tell the truth and say &quot;because the news told me it did. But I don&#39;t <em>really</em> know.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The purpose supposedly was to protect the families from CTs. But it also cut off any further investigation by journalists, pro or amateur, and I believe, contributed (if not created) the alleged harassment of the victim&#39;s families by particular individuals.</p>

<p>If people were capable of this, on both sides of the skeptic coin, we&#39;d have made so much more progress in our dialogue by now. Even worse is when people say they don&#39;t have to look at your sources because they&#39;re already <em>positive</em> that you&#39;re wrong and have nothing substantive to provide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you really want to see shattered and shredded bodies of 6 year olds... I have seen a lot of shit in my life but I&#39;m not sure I honestly would forgive myself for looking at those pics, assuming they were released. For the record I think they should be and think it a bit questionable that they are not but I also think it is understandable. I was supisef to learn many of my close friends believe in the false flag thing but idk on that one... ðŸ˜¬</p>

<p>However, no pics of bodies under bloody sheets?  Not even one?</p>

<p>And to address even parents not viewing the carnage, if it was my child, even if it was a smoldering pile of gelatin, I would want to see the body and I know I&#39;m not alone in that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I changed my post because I remembered details wrong. Apparently a lot of bio-hazardous material was cleared out [but nobody saw this] but I remember distinctly reading that &#39;they&#39; either asked for a crime scene cleaner from far away [despite Sandy Hook having several] or it might not have ever needed to be cleaned at all.
I remember that whoever did the research had all available expenses listed  and no cleaners were on the list.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t find it but this is just as good:
