<p><strong>The earths seismic data may not be quite that random at all-</strong></p>

<p>From what I understand carbon emissions lead to the increase of heat decay on earth;
Heat decay is significant as it warms frozen methane pockets allowing the gasses to eacape into our atmosphere. </p>

<p>Earths equator is the warmest section on earth. This is due to orbital forces lifting heat at our centeral most region. </p>

<p><strong>However...</strong></p>

<p>As heat rises pockets of methane which are released as &#39;oxides&#39; travel within the orbital heat decay allowing methane to take flight into the upper atmosphere...</p>

<p>When the methane reaches the &#39;ionosphere&#39;; Ions begin to steadily strip the gasses of their products into their particle makeup, via a process called &#39;ionization&#39;. </p>

<p>As the methane is stripped protons meet with open current electrons, creating what we know as &#39;Plasma tubes&#39;. </p>

<p><strong>With that in mind:</strong></p>

<p>Solar masses of plasma are often released from coronal hole structure, sun spots, coronal mass ejections, and various cosmic weather and interstellar events...</p>

<p>As the masses of plasma arrive to the earth. During the most caustic solar wind  velocity shifts, the earths magnetosphere is breached by photons travelling between 350 and +900km/s. </p>

<p>When photons have surpassed the protective layers of the magnetosphere, and are introduced into the ionosphere. Electrons become the dominant force within the earths plasma tubes. </p>

<p>These tubes then convey deeply into the earths core and magma layer. As magma and particle accelerations interact, heat leads to expansion pockets which trap various expelling gasses. These noble gasses often explode sending a P wave towards the earths surface. (ricocheting off the techtonic plates above them;</p>

<p>The exact location of the striking p wave will be known as an epicenter, while the reverberating effect causes what seismologists know as S waves. </p>

<p><em>&quot;This is a process which creates many of our known earthquakes on earth&quot;</em></p>

<p>Taking existing seismic data from archives seismologists can assign geographic locations, a value of vulnderable via &#39;probability&#39;; assessments in annual interval can be used k. comparrison to the expected incoming solar masses. Leaving upto a 2-30day advanced earthquake precautionary measures window. </p>

<p><strong>Most incoming solar related events have at least a  7 day advanced forcast.</strong></p>

<p>My theory could be tested using a low a paired low frequency radio telescope to photograph the earths flux tubes during an incoming solar storm. </p>

<p>By taking a series of snapshots researchers could record the plasma tubes, as it interacts with the incoming solar plasma sheens. </p>

<p>Earthquakes and seismic data show an indirect relationship; <em>Although: It is known that the data is suggestive of an existing relationship.</em></p>

<p>I feel the primary reason that it remained exlusive to the public is a small list of factors...</p>

<p><strong>Firstly</strong></p>

<p>The process takes time and there is a need to measure the effective time dialation when comparing the known or estimated makeup of the fields. Continued testing would likely evaluate the process giving a &#39;key&#39; to pre-assess the situation. </p>

<p><strong>Secondly</strong> </p>

<p>The plasma tubes are now able to be photographed, which can lead to a documented definition forever changing the field of seismology. </p>

<p><strong>Thirdly</strong> </p>

<p>Seismologists are not physicists; these two fields have common respect to eachother yet their general education is indifferent to eachother. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>&quot;My findings have shown a consistent relationship of this process.  The data is available on the webarchive ceddit.com</p>

<p>(Via <a href="/u/globalhell">/u/globalhell</a> as a tracer.&quot;)</p>

<p>The dedicated fields of (astronomy and seismology), could reason to gain an immersive understanding of an advanced interplanetary system. Giving further insight and knowledge on solar storm effects on earth, as well as their relationship to seismic events which compliment them. &quot;This may very well lead to the future of an advanced earthquake prediction model&quot;. </p>

<p><em>&quot;Using past archives and comparing solar impacts and seismic episodes, may also expand the time dilation which occurs on the process&quot;. &quot;Going as far, as saying that: the locations may also have a clear definiton in terms of probability.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Sorry I deleted my past account; </p>

<p>(Need a break for awhile). </p>

<p><strong>Project Body</strong></p>

<p>Our project scope is to create a multi channel platform, with a sophisticated smart engine. Which uses a probability algorithm to determine the liklihood of an incoming earthquake. <em>With upto a 24hours advanced assesment range.</em></p>

<p>By using the incoming solar wind and bc componet data, in comparrison to recent usgs seismic events. Our goal is to triangulate seismic episodes with advanced probability models in hopes to alert any given region with advanced warning; to limit the loss of life and socio-economical, impacts. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lvN6ykf.jpg">Seismic Module</a> would display the most recent seismic analysis. Determining the likelihood of an incoming shock. Based on the triangulation of variables from existing usgs data sets and the incoming solar wind stream and bz componet data. We will gain a greater ability to assess an incoming seismic activity by imploying a sophisticated probability engine. One which quickly assesses all past archives at every possible interval of time and magnitude to assess the probability of a given seismic episode. </p>

<p>By measuring the time dialation, and magnetic intrusions excreted on the planet we hope to provide an effective system capable of someday assessing the smallest detectable seismic events hours if not days in advance.
So the data must be highly accurate and the timing sequences of between and during all past seismic episodes must be placed with a high level of accuracy taking up as many channels as sevents have sequenced in tandum. This is the body of the project focus. 
The seismic data must be assessed for every sequence frequency and value which compliments a live feed. </p>

<p>My thoughts are to use ten years seismological record. Using the first five years as a knowledge base. While using the following five years as a &#39;sybthetic&#39; live feed. Updating the appropriate values to keep the data on track as the development and deployment stages move along. By measuring the project against known data we can reassess values proving to provide poor reflexes to our model. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/O5a84xj.jpg">Bz componet Module</a> The Bz componet data module (Channel 2), may be the easiest one really. Rhis system is already online with a live feed. We merely need to mark past incidents and auto program a &#39;spitter program&#39; to mark / split &#39;max impact events&#39;; going on to trip an alert system. (When a given range of data provides an algorithm significant to a future seismic episode). <em>All data is already digitized</em>. Making the bulk of this system easy to monitor. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/wV4Gy2n.webp">Solar wind data Module</a>
This is the spine of the project. It is the first line of authority in terms of the seismic prediction itself. 
<em>We will be using this systems display values to trip the probability engine itself.</em></p>

<p>By monitoring for highspeed incoming solar data our seismic system recieves advanced warning of seismic episodes. This is due to the consistent evidence that &#39;will or will not&#39; be discovered while segregating the data into sequences and modeling. </p>

<p>We are hoping to establish a pattern of all three systems. 
Solar winds to bz breaches to seismic activity. </p>

<p>If we can establish a consistent relationship by any degree using the past 10 year data sets of each given value. Then we will remove the feeds and create the final needed mechanism.
A world gps field grid capable of displaying a highly / statistiically supported region to likely produce a seismic event. Based on triangulated datasets.</p>

<p>As well as a color coded alert mechanism.</p>

<p>Green</p>

<p>This digital display showing the percentage of value given to a seismic event in the area-</p>

<p>Thought experiment: <a href="https://youtu.be/mUz1ZaIHvDs">https://youtu.be/mUz1ZaIHvDs</a>
This is a simple experiment which outlines a force interaction. 
Imagine the candle is invisible-</p>

<p>We are attempting to draw the effect of invisible forces by measuring the forces acting around them. 
We do &#39;not&#39; know every intimate detail recordable in the respects of why earthquakes happen on earth. </p>

<p>We are hoping to answer &#39;how they happen&#39;. By measuring what else is happening all around us.  Each venture unraveling a new and significant fragment of the subject as a whole. (start to finish). </p>

<p>&quot;This is equivellent to making earthquakes a social network, And monitoring them&quot;. &quot;Using probability as a tool to determine their next big move&quot;. It may even be possible to integrate all existing data sets to install and add existing network modules on this system. Adding to its very accuracy and logics. </p>

<p>We already have the technological tools to create an existing project. We simply need to process the data with an elite team of staticians and programmer&#39;s. </p>

<p><em>What they can accomplish over a few lunches could help another kind stranger, see his way to his next dinner.</em></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
Print a copy of all three modules. Lay them in side to side format in dated order. Thats the exact circumstances involved in which our model will work. This sequence of events is the very process we are attempting to identify. 
Had we done this sooner. Its very possible we would have seen this moments, hours, or even days ahead of time. 
I see no reason not to attempt this regardless of its complexity. We&#39;ve been collecting records some 20 years. All that data accumulating. </p>

<p>We just gotta put it to work now-</p>

<p>*<em>On the standard globe there are 24 regions depicted in longitude and 14 in latitude. Giving a zone of 24 X 14; making for a total of 344 respective territories.</em></p>

<p>My thoughts are that we should begin this project by assigning each individual zone with a unique and 
identifiable alpha-numerical value system, to be customizable within a digital model...</p>

<p><em>A simple method as shown below:</em></p>

<p>A 1 - 24</p>

<p>B 1 - 24</p>

<p>C 1 - 24</p>

<p>D 1 - 24</p>

<p>E 1 - 24</p>

<p>F 1 - 24</p>

<p>G 1 - 24</p>

<p>H 1 - 24</p>

<p>I 1 - 24</p>

<p>J 1 - 24</p>

<p>K 1 - 24</p>

<p>L 1 - 24</p>

<p>M 1 - 24</p>

<p>N 1 - 24</p>

<p><strong>This would create the base of our model of earth. A 344 region palette. To be used for data-positioning.</strong></p>

<p>Our next step would be to map all seismic events by its respective appearance in timeline. (using a 10 year past data sample) </p>

<p>For a more accurate model we would apply all usgs events from 3.0 to 9.5 magnitude to the model.</p>

<p><strong>note:</strong> a simpler system would focus on 5.0+ events greatly reducing the workload</p>

<p>We have to know the exact time dilation between events as well as the approximate estimation of the events as they were manifested via seismological records; documenting any periods of seismic absence in between events. (to be used via the predictive algorithm).</p>

<p>So now after creating the base system with the addition of usgs&#39;s data sets we will have a basic model showing all 344 regions /zones with an overlay of seismic events which have happened over a 10 year period...</p>

<p><strong>The next step would be to locate frequencies within the data as well as sequences.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Frequency</strong> = how frequent a seismic region is known to strike a region. I.e. Per minute hour day week month year.</p>

<p><strong>Sequence</strong> = how likely the earthquake is to replicate or move to an alternative location. I.e. will an eq in guam be followed by a strike in another region. (based on past activity)</p>

<p>The sequence&#39;s frequency would also likely have to be taken into consideration or any configurations of trend that would help predict the next likely seismic event; *as my initial thoughts are that this is a sort of &#39;sliding-scale&#39; &#39;system&#39;; based upon the earths percieved or &#39;available seismic energy build-up&#39;.</p>

<p>Seismic energy we are hoping will be identifiable, by a respective pattern or &#39;Pitch&#39;.
<strong>Pitch</strong> = solar data high velocity shifts and breaches...</p>

<p>If we use the solar incidents as a &#39;harbinger&#39; in our model to compare for the future assessments of earthquakes in a given region, then once the initial timeline is created via a seismic to solar module. Then the solar module would be placed in a seperate channel.(matching time and date stamps).</p>

<p><strong>The solar data needed are as follows:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bz componet</strong> (i.e. breaches in the magnetosphere)...</p>

<p><strong>Solar winds</strong> (high velocity shifts / impacts with earth)...</p>

<p><strong>Density</strong> (photon absorbtion).</p>

<p><strong>Winds &#39;pitch estimation /values</strong></p>

<p>850 - 950km/s 8.0 9.5+</p>

<p>750 - 850km/s 6.0-7.5+</p>

<p>650 - 750km/s 5.5 6.5+</p>

<p>550 - 650km/s 4.0 5.5+/-</p>

<p>450 - 550km/s 3.5 4.5+/-</p>

<p><strong>Faults respond by type.</strong></p>

<p>Faults that&#39;s palte &#39;expand&#39; typically exhibit growth post event. During a 4-10 hr holding period. </p>

<p>Faults that contrast / subduct typically exhibit symptoms on gain. 4-6 hours into storm conditions. </p>

<p>Strike slips are mid storm. +/-</p>

<p><strong>Findings:</strong>
If we are at a holding speed for a prolonged time. Quakes typically come sooner then expected. </p>

<p>If winds remain elevated for a long duration the estimated size will diminish during that time.</p>

<p>Cme&#39;s typically enduce more seismic activity then coronal wind streams. &#39;Likely&#39; due to their high proton mass.</p>

<p>Coronal holes near sunspots are also more complex. The larger either region is, the more likely the data will work over.</p>

<p>If a determinative pattern can be identified, showing that &#39;Solar data&#39; does in fact act as a &#39;Pitch&#39; value towards seismic events. Then were ready for our last step.</p>

<p>Utilizing a computational predictive algorithm to assess and read the incoming solar data. Recording the &#39;pitch&#39; which would then compute and compare / cross checking our models data points for the mosy likely &#39;seismic&#39; sequence and frequency to follow said pitch in terms of a real time model.</p>

<p>In short by naming each past seismic event on earth with an assigned value via the mean median and mode system; with a high low probability model; This may in fact give us a very significant idea of which of the 344 regions is likely to recieve x amount of seismic energy based upon x amount of solar pitch.</p>

<p><em>Its a very basic system-</em></p>

<p>From there we should begin to program and assign a logic display with a 3, 5, or even 7 scale; Warning tear level. With a level 1, being a low seismic risk value to a level 7 event being given to regions in the highest risk of future seismology events.</p>

<p>By using the 344 region system we also can opt to use a 3x3 grid location value. Meaning that if we see a high probability for an example risk to region B- 14. Our model coyld be assigned to effectively warn a 3x3 grid:
I.e. Region B - 14 level 7 risk. Warnings applied to:</p>

<p>A- 13, 14, 15,</p>

<p>B- 13, 14, 15,</p>

<p>C- 13, 14, 15,</p>

<p>Utilizing a grid will give us the potential to give a mild warning to surrounding areas while a larger probability to the main region in question. (until the system proves effective enough to support reason to be more dialed down).</p>

<p>I&#39;d assume it will-</p>

<p>The main thing I have really thought about this as being significant to our participation is that: &quot;should there be &#39;no&#39; effective relationship or significant meaning to the correlation of solar / seismic events&quot;. This system would still function accurately in the area of seismology itself. (giving a likely and accurate probability of any incoming quake based on the seismological records alone);</p>

<p>This makes the system a needed utility regardless of the time or funds spent devolved in its execution. Which may in time lead our team to a vast amount of discoveries which compliment both the solar and seismic fields.</p>

<p>An effective model would undoubtedly be a ground breaking achievement of human innovation in that regard alone. Yet by identifying if solar energy is a &#39;pitch&#39; regulator in seismic studies would effectively lead to a vast change in the field of seismology itself-</p>

<p>I believe that the pitch factor is evident based on my own personal findings. This is a percieved data imput on the project.</p>

<p><strong>Note: By using the multi-channel system we can later add other channels to our model.</strong> (Such as moon movements, incoming tidal patterns; and going as far as to pairing the solar lens to the earthfacing disk in real time)... (This to map the exact sequence of events taking place from the surface of the sun to earth).</p>

<p>The more features we add the more complex the utility could become either greatly evolving it with vast and needed imputs, or devolving it with less practical methods and useless data points...</p>

<p><em>I assume that our using a 344 point grid. With a 3x3 range. Determined by usgs seismic records and noaa solar records attributed to both the wind fluctuations and bz breaches. (establishing a pitch) (via a 3 channel system) would be the most significant steps we as laymen could manifest on our own accord with the limited resources at our disposal.</em></p>

<p>*This system would then after being trained to read the pitch accordingly would go over ten years past data sets to compile the mathematical values of a tree algorothm which would go on to make an assessment of the liklihood of an incoming seismic event. Likely giving upto 24hours to a weeks warning via the models completion.</p>

<p>At the point that we can establish a working system, we can then switch the solar data module to the real time noaa module. To locate the pitch in real-time. Effectively reading the data and assigning probable seismic data to follow each and every interval that trips its sensors.*</p>

<p>There by displaying a warning level via our 7 tear warning values as while displaying the 1 out of 344 regions likely to be struck in a seismic episode- as well as its general vicinity / probability. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its the gist of my progress. </p>

<p>Honestly thats basically everything I can say to design. </p>

<p>Feel free to read it. Its pretty basic :)</p>

<p>Kinda a wall but its in very simple steps in terms of the projects general scope. </p>

<p><strong>Tl/dr</strong> / <strong>ELI5</strong></p>

<p>Sun acts like a lever arm on a record player. Generally Solar winds are the torque of the record. When the sun burps Earths reaction is like the sound nodules in the grain. 
Solar burps stretch the sound. I.e. like a dj scratches a record. Causing a seismic uptick. </p>

<p>In short ;)
The sun dj&#39;s the earth-</p>

<p>Aurora Watch / Solar Wind</p>

<p>A high speed solar wind stream above 600 km/s is now moving past Earth. Enhanced geomagnetic activity reaching minor (G1) storm levels will be possible during the next 24 hours. High latitude sky watchers should be alert for visual aurora when it is dark outside. Data below courtesy of the DSCOVR spacecraft</p>

<p>Coronal Hole Update / Geomagnetic Storm Watch
On the sun, middle latitude coronal hole #47 will become geoeffective over the next 24-72 hours. A minor (G1) geomagnetic storm watch will be in effect after December 20th once a high speed solar wind stream arrives past our planet. Here on Earth, sky watchers at higher latitudes should be alert for visible aurora later this week. Stay tuned to SolarHam.com for the most up to date information.

Geomagnetic Storm Warning (UPDATED)
A moderate (G2) geomagnetic storm is currently in progress thanks to a high speed solar wind stream above 700 km/s. More storming is expected over the next several days as a coronal hole stream rattles our geomagnetic field. Sky watchers at middle to high latitudes should be alert for visible aurora during the next several nights.

Thanks and I truly just hope people look past me and friggin build it-</p>

<p>Its a very basic concept. Thats the best instructions I could leave at this time...</p>

<p>If it makes anyone rich. Seriously just make a small donation. I don&#39;t care what its worth. It needs to be re explored with newer technologically superior tools and systems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wow. Groundbreaking is an understatement. I&#39;m so interested in this.  I have been a longtime observer of spaceweather. Proposing the connections to geology blows my mind a bit. then to use it to predict events. I hope the Bk model correlates. That would be amazing. granted i know virtually nothing about this, but i liked every word. I sure dig the plan. Kickstarter this one. Kudos and well wishes on your giant Idea. </p>

<p>Im gonna stay tuned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a real way I dont think many people on earth have a full idea of how this system functions. 
I think this will lead to very significant studies in multiple fields, such as plasma research, magnetics, electromagnetic current, static current, gravity, seismology, and geology etc...</p>

<p>Its attempting to record an invisible system with basic tools. This to assess an unknown future. </p>

<p>Imo I am scared about messing this up. 
So the sub <a href="/r/parsingsol">/r/parsingsol</a> is the only backbone I know of. </p>

<p>I just really think we have a shot at this. 
I truly do believe this planetary function exists. 
We just have to map it in action. Which will teach us so much more by default. :)</p>

Although, something I haven&#39;t considered is if the military is also studying this correlation. (in the dark). </p>

<p>My guess is that they are aware of my work as well as any other researchers. So there is a moderate level of competition in that regard. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hadn&#39;t thought of it from that angle, maybe what you&#39;re discussing is something they&#39;ve been aware of for a while and ships like the Amazon Warrior are the telltale sign? </p>

<p>I only brought up seismic vessels as I&#39;ve been tracking them for around 17mths now and every time they stop for more than 12hrs there has always been an earthquake of a minimum 6.0 almost directly below them within 24hrs. EIther they&#39;re a factor overlooked or are using your theory in practise. Either way keep up the work.</p>
