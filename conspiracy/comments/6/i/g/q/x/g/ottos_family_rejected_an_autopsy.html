    <div class="md"><p>Germany used one guy to invade Poland.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They murdered Franciszek Honiok, a 43-year-old unmarried German Silesian Catholic farmer known for sympathizing with the Poles. He had been arrested the previous day by the Gestapo. He was dressed to look like a saboteur, then killed by lethal injection, given gunshot wounds, and left dead at the scene so that he appeared to have been killed while attacking the station. His corpse was subsequently presented to the police and press as proof of the attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thx will check em out real quick. Before doing so, I&#39;d just like to say that many of the citzens of north korea would not react in backlash in my opinion. I&#39;ve heard many journlist that go there explain that they are not as brainwashed as the media would like you to percieve them. They act a certain way/don&#39;t speak up/rat on ppl in order to survive due to it being required under current leadership.  </p>

<p>What would an autopsy do to encourage war with them? isn&#39;t the fact that he died because of his captivity there enough to push a war narrative if they wanted to use just that?</p>

<p>What is he would have survived without some sort of &quot;intervention&quot; after returning to the United States, and covering that intervention up was the reason to forego an autopsy?</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you take college level A&amp;P, you see a real autopsy, at least I did at my college.  I won&#39;t get too graphic, but your entire body is cut open and examined.  Like you mentioned, it won&#39;t bring him back.  I&#39;ve also read that autopsies vary widely on how well they are done.  Personally, I&#39;ve instructed my family not to allow one to be performed on me in the event of my death.  I don&#39;t want the state invading my privacy one last time.  Some religious people even have a law against it.  It&#39;s up to the family ultimately, and people should respect what they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>agree. my point is similiar. Rejecting an autopsy doesn&#39;t really prove a conspiracy to me. The point is he died at their hands, it&#39;s obvious, and if they want to use that for some big conspiracy for pushing war, it can already be used regardless of what the autopsy report would be. It&#39;s not like this guy was randomly found in the woods and they need to figure out how he died. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting take, thank you! The story seems too strange, uncreative and unrelated to any conceivable propaganda use to convince me fully that it was given to him to read. But none of the sources I&#39;ve found that mention it bother to question whether it&#39;s actually true or not.</p>

<p>I also have trouble believing he was just that idiotic to travel to North Korea of all places and do something like that just for kicks. Then the tape of his public confession....It&#39;s just so weird, like it&#39;s obvious he&#39;s acting, but for whom? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What was interesting to me is he noted that the particular propaganda he stole was made of aluminum, which is used in missiles. It&#39;s also just text propaganda, I assumed it would be a kitschy image, why would you steal a long text banner as a souvenier?</p>

<p>Also his background: smart, intelligent, charistmatic. Studies economics (global sustainability) in Virginia, goes to London School of Economics, then Hong Kong, then North Korea? sounds spooky to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, his public appearance was super odd. He was obviously coached by the North Koreans, but I think he was also transmitting information, akin to the Vietnam POW who blinked &quot;Torture&quot; in morse code while reading the official thing. Why do I think this? The way he misspoke the name of his father&#39;s company. I think he was giving a code there and almost gave the wrong code. There were other addresses he gave out. Then saying a particular Google term he used. Because we know the NSA could backtrack and find where exactly in Virginia that was coming from.</p>

<p>Basically he said what the North Koreans wanted him to say, but interjected code words in the form of addresses, the way companies were named, etc..</p>

<p>That guy was very charismatic and media ready. Being charismatic like that is key to being a good CIA agent. Knowing your PR, staying on message, having good production values, etc..</p>

<p>Same reason I always wonder about Snowden (look at how he acts in media vs other whistleblowers.)</p>

<p>I wonder the purpose of the sign though. It was always partially censored in pictures I saw. It&#39;s huge so hard to carry. When I first heard sign, I assumed kitschy visual image. This was all text. He also said it was made of Aluminum. I wonder if it was something regarding metals NK might have. Aluminum is used in missiles.</p>
