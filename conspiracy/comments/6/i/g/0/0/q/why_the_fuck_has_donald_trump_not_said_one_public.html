You can do look up the congressional submittals and even google how long Paul has been supporting MM.

<p>For people who actually understand netsec and propaganda warfare, it&#39;s incredibly obvious that Russia has been manipulating elections all around the world. It&#39;s just tiring listening to all these Trump apologists who refuse to see the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s even more tiring that we have a POTUS who would rather binge watch Fox News than sit through an intelligence briefing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believing that Russia used a combination of information warfare (propaganda, muddying the waters, etc) and cyber warfare (astroturfing, probing election officials, spearphishing campaigns, etc) in order to sow chaos and disrupt our electoral process is NOT THE SAME THING as believing that Trump is some russian spy or sleeper agent or something.</p>

<p>And that is also the most annoying strawman about this entire debate.</p>

<p>Saying that 5+ months of investigation hasn&#39;t revealed anything about Trump is absolutely meaningless on multiple levels.</p>

<p>A- That&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>B- If there was evidence, it would be extraordinarily classified</p>

<p>C- If there was evidence to be found, it&#39;s probably very hard to find and would take some time</p>

<p>D- Just to be clear, whether Trump colluded or not is irrelevant to whether Russia was trying to influence our election.</p>

<p>&quot;bad russia&quot; </p>

<p>oh wait, that&#39;s right, we have a whole 3 letter agency that&#39;s main purpose is to topple governments/institutions of power and replace leaders/people in power with their own stooges. </p>

<p>Russia may have tried to meddle with our elections, but it&#39;s nothing at all compared to what America has done to other nations, hell we destroy nations just to get every last valuable thing out of them and then we make them rely on us for aid and help! </p>

<p>get off the high horse, the air is obviously too thin up there for you. </p>
