       His intelligence chiefs are the same guys trying to discredit/oust him. Not sure he is open to the idea of listening to their claims, especially because 0 evidence has been produced on a national level, only a local FL election. They have been making the claim for 5 months and cant produce anything, which means they more than likely are working off hearsay.

       not saying its fake news, but if you are in this sub you should know 99% of things have an agenda spin on it. You can do look up the congressional submittals and even google how long Paul has been supporting MM. Most of those articles are confirmation bias because the MSM will spin a story from all angles, so if you are looking for MSM for proof of just about anything you will find it.

       For people who actually understand netsec and propaganda warfare, it's incredibly obvious that Russia has been manipulating elections all around the world. It's just tiring listening to all these Trump apologists who refuse to see the writing on the wall.

       And it's even more tiring that we have a POTUS who would rather binge watch Fox News than sit through an intelligence briefing.

       Lets suppose the influence occurred on the POTUS level, you think Clinton would have won? BTW, its a suppose because after 5+ months of investigation, nothing. BTW, im not a Trump guy, im Libertarian and i would want Rand Paul over all.

       Believing that Russia used a combination of information warfare (propaganda, muddying the waters, etc) and cyber warfare (astroturfing, probing election officials, spearphishing campaigns, etc) in order to sow chaos and disrupt our electoral process is NOT THE SAME THING as believing that Trump is some russian spy or sleeper agent or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is also the most annoying strawman about this entire debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that 5+ months of investigation hasn't revealed anything about Trump is absolutely meaningless on multiple levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       A- That's not what I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       B- If there was evidence, it would be extraordinarily classified
      </p>
      <p>
       C- If there was evidence to be found, it's probably very hard to find and would take some time
      </p>
      <p>
       D- Just to be clear, whether Trump colluded or not is irrelevant to whether Russia was trying to influence our election.

       I already blew up B in another response to you. C) they've had plenty of time and that would be on the Obama admin because it was his on his his watch or his admin was to incompetent to prepare for it. D) of course Russia tried to influence it: if they didn't they are not worthy of any worry.if they did it doesn't mean it was meaningful. Again I implore you for evidence...

       I'm curious about two things 1) you're a conspiracy theorist that trusts the media? And 2) I'd actually like to see real evidence that Russia not only "meddled" in our election but that it also had enough of an impact to make a difference.

       And what actual evidence would you see as proof? Do you need a video of Putin saying that he did it 100% with proof that he isn't being coerced?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking, what burden of proof is good enough for you? Because in my experience, every time I get into an argument with ideologue, they refuse to accept any evidence at all. I don't want to waste my time, and it's beginning to look like I already have.

       Ok, I'm not an IT expert but any reports of Russia actually hacking into electronic voting machines that cannot be confounded by Vault 7, evidence that a Russian national paid off election board officials to change, alter, or otherwise change the votes, any actual evidence that Trump is without doubt a Manchurian candidate, any evidence that Russia paid someone for their vote, and that if the aforementioned occurred that it would have changed the outcome. Because if in fact they managed to do that, it is the biggest scandal in our nation's history and that would also mean our national security is an abject failure and is therefore no longer in need of being protected for "national security reasons."

       Then what will you defend? I never accused you of being a "libtard," nor do I listen to Rush. Nor do I bother myself to know the names of false arguments: you offered to provide proof and evidence and I offered to accept if you could do so. Instead I have received platitudes and nothing more and a lame excuse as to why you won't even defend your points.

       what is he going to say?
      </p>
      <p>
       "bad russia"
      </p>

       oh wait, that's right, we have a whole 3 letter agency that's main purpose is to topple governments/institutions of power and replace leaders/people in power with their own stooges.

       Russia may have tried to meddle with our elections, but it's nothing at all compared to what America has done to other nations, hell we destroy nations just to get every last valuable thing out of them and then we make them rely on us for aid and help!
