       Saturn Moon Matrix. Fascinating stuff. Tons of Saturn symbolism in logos. Tons of Saturn symbolism movies. Saturn - The Lord of the
       <strong>
        Rings
       </strong>
       . C'mon. Right in our faces. Sauron - Saturn. Everywhere I look at I see Saturn symbolism. Everywhere. I could go on for hours about Saturn symbolism. My question is how the hell do we get out. Are we literally in a simulation? Or is it just a reptilian draconian system implemented here on Earth. I don't know if blood over intent is the answer, although at times it feels like it's the only thing that makes sense. I've been debating this for a very long time. We are living in a sci-fi movie. They live.

       Hmm it depends on how deep you want to go. There are many, and I mean many different aspects to this. Here is an image I made one day when I was bored

       This is just a preview of what's to come. I recommend googling the North Pole of Saturn. See the Hexagon? Now who lives on the North Pole? Santa, or Satan, or Saturn. You will honestly never be the same once you start looking into this stuff. I'm sure you can type in Saturn moon matrix on youtube and find some great videos, but if you want the whole package, a user on here sent me this link the other day
       <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/HolyYeshua/162563769-thearchonshiddenrulersthroughtheages">

       . It covers everything from Yaldabaoth (the false reptilian god of this Earth, or gaud, should I say, to his archons, to Saturn, to the matrix, etc). This whole world is upside down. You're in for an interesting ride.

       If it helps direct your research, I've recently be studying lost civilizations (just read Graham Hancocks books) and ancient civilizations were extremely in to astrology and there is a lot of symbolism in their cultures that relates to stars and planets. I think it's much more plausible that astrological symbolism we see today has been unknowingly passed down from an ancient civilizations, rather than a glitch in the matrix.

       Mind and soul is huge, also between the self and thoughts
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we create our own thoughts?  Or do they just pass by our "sense" of thought the same way a smell does on a windy day or a bird you see fly by?

       Everyone seems to think we have control or can generate our own thoughts.  I don't think it's that simple; if it were then things like depression wouldn't exist

       Another way of thinking of it is what you want to do vs what's expected of you.

       I just tried to explain in so many words, below, this setiment, but you're exactly right. Everything is twisted in such a way that we are left to find the true path, but that is also why we are here. We all recognize, at the very least, that the "GPS" prescribed route is only the quickest way from point A to B, and not necessarily the "scenic route" that we REALLY need o be on to see the whole picture or even what is around the next corner.

       Is a short simple answer, no, we are not. What we are led to believe is that we are progressing on the exact opposite route, that we are capable of progressing further and further from self sustainability into a world which we must simply rely on outside forces to sustain and maintain that which we have become accustomed to, trust and obey. Everything will be ok. MSM will tell us every 24 hours what we should and shouldn't be worried about. Self sustainability has been marginalized and downplayed as TPTB increase their strangehold on hearts and minds while they shove everything down our throats. The best example I can think of is that movie Wall-E.

       Never thought of life and human progression like this. The benefits of pushing yourself to feel uncomfortable is really underestimated. Being uncomfortable is not only a foreign concept to many but is actively avoided. Our growth is stunted when we stand still.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't mean changing a job that you like just to push yourself but simply being alone in a quiet room by yourself. Being honest with yourself, accepting shame and guilt from your past mistakes. These things are uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving to a new city is uncomfortable but not everyone has the luxury to do so... But why not try to do something different in your everyday life?

       I agree completely also with the other poster that mentioned wall-e. Totally right about wall-e. I feel like people in general have lost touch with being human. I speak for myself too. I used to be a "mainstream, logical person". Ha! The joke was on me. Then one day I got infected with Lyme disease, and whether I wanted to or not I went down the rabbit hole. 2 years later and I really see through so much false pretenses that have been set up. 
Lyme disease was a blessing in disguise. I am so aware now. I see people go to church every Sunday and the ministers guilt them into giving money, and people go to church instead of getting enlightened they walk out funding a pyramid scheme and contributing to enriching a corrupt system, some man whose purpose is to line his pockets. So many people want to contribute and grow in a positive way, but if you follow the system you will enrich a cruel and corrupt system and grow only more bitter and negative. Without even knowing it. 
You go to the doctor to be healthy....but in actuality their treatments addict and make you sick. It's a revolving door health model. They know that too it's purposely engineered that way. You go to church to grow spiritually but instead walk out small minded, and hateful To "sinners?" Forking over hard earned cash to make some institution and minister rich? 
You go to university to gain a career yet what career? Instead you are indebted and unemployable? The education content is worthless nonsense with no application to the real world. Food that is supposed to nourish us instead poisons us. Vaccines that are supposed to build immunity instead poison and destroy immune systems. The system (matrix) is  all twisted into a false dichotomy where good is really bad, positive is negative, and peoples good intentions are turned into selfish evil actions that perpetuate the cycle. 
The good news is awareness breaks the chains!! It's as simple as waking up in the morning. The dream is the matrix; the reality is awareness.

       Depression exists because you generate your own thoughts. I don't see how having control makes life simple. If anything it's so simple it becomes complicated due to either perceived notions of having to be microagressive in details, or just not caring at all. Honestly it affects every aspect of life.

       Derpression is no different from "your" political identify.

       Couldn't depression, in the context of our conversation here, also be the self doubt that is artificially injected on us? Couldn't we also consider it a roadblock?

       Yea depression isn't real. (It's reals but a lot of depression is first world derpression)
      </p>
      <p>
       Depression is funny because of the way it operates and how you subconsciously nurture your depression. Like it's been so glamorized it's ridiculous. Also plays into identify politics, victim mentalities... Honestly I can go on for days really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tbh even saying that self doubt is artificially injected onto is actually being dismissive. Is self doubt taught, or part of life really? You can see self doubt in animals. Squirrels, dogs, ducks.

       Somewhere along the lines of translations of the bible I would like to believe that being a Perpetrator was seen as a deadly sin

       Tbf, self doubt, depression and situational awareness (in your squirrel example) are exclusive of each other and to lump them together is extremely naive as some are natural and some are externally forced upon us. Divide and Conquer is the current meta game and that is not limited to person to person contact and conversations but also designed to keep your mind from yourself. Self doubt IS artificially injected upon us and is very specifically designed to keep you questioning yourself, instead the world around you. Having control of yourself, your thoughts and emotions is extremely important if you want to see and understand why and what is happening around us everyday. Sure we can't be in ctrl of what happens above us but we can certainly be in control of ourselves and emotional states while we try to come to grips with these controls that are the very things we are trying to break free of. I'm getting long winded here but to accept medication instead of reflection, imo, is absurd, and though you make good points I encourage you to think deeper and more critically of these points. I don't disagree with you on everything, I just hope to help you question everything.

       has the right idea when said "Another way of thinking of it is what you want to do vs what's expected of you."
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these things ARE artificially injected on us and we have to accept that dismissing THOSE thoughts only serve to keep us deflated and questioning ourselves instead of the bigger issues.

       You don't understand that the intentional distance you create between  self doubt, self awareness, and depression is way more toxic than you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       To sum shit up as external forces is a legit cop out, because at the end of the day who's making the choice? Yes you can be intentionally  mislead but that's entirely up to you drinking the Kool aid.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's pretty damn close to the mental,emotional,physical cop out of claiming to be born this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       You confusing forced with natural. You're creating your own artificial manipulation. Rarely little is actually forced onto and it's more along the lines of societal peer pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide &amp; Conquer only works because your been lead to create distance between yourself and ideas, thoughts, feelings, and emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is a whole, not separate. That's the key to manipulation. Plays on your natural thought processes. The only artificial part is the medium between the distance you create between yourself and "self doubt, depression" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free will is being manipulated, because people are gullible and predictable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self doubt is not new... You just live in the age of gullible, predictable, and self deprecating society.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's all okay because of bullshit. I'm a hard working blah blah..
      </p>
      <p>
       Really this shit is childish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop saying artificial it's corny and is intentionally dismissive to reality.

       I live in Utah. I have friend that knows some guy who claims that he read some book that had information saying that the Mormon church was actually started because some jewish guys paid Joseph Smith to start it. I can't find anything online. I posted this question before but it got deleted. Normally I wouldn't believe him but he was right about some other things , the yeast conspiracy being one of them. More info would be helpful.

       What's the difference between Zionist Jews (e.g. Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion) and "International Jews?" How about "Athiest Jews?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I read they "split" around 1900. I'm not sure how to understand the differences and who are the "bad guys," if any.

       With the recent post about
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ib4n9/comment/dj5x4qo">
        shills,
       </a>
       and with a
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ib4n9/comment/dj5p899">
        mod helping
       </a>
       and other mods encouraging the phishing of other r/conspiracy users, I'm looking into how often this actually happens on this sub, and how to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where posts are just labeled a conspiracy as guises to phishing your personal information, ip addresses and the like, I'm wary of clicking any links on this sub because of it, and you should be too.  You've got to ask, if the mods here are fine with a user openly admitting to phishing, logging, and doxxing users, what's going on behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's
       <a href="http://imgur.com/sGhuYWT">
        a screenshot of my "conversation" with that op,
       </a>
       and don't worry, it's just a link to the imgur I didn't route it through any site to try to get your info.  The fact this seems to be okay here is crazy, it shows aterrifying lack of respect for your privacy rights, so be wary of clicking ANY links on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only did that post show that the mods will not care if someone is blatantly admitting to phishing personal information, but it gave everyone who looked at it the instructions on how to set that up.  Which should scare the fuck out of this sub.

       That's what he says he's doing, but the only thing he found is ips through amazonaws, originally his claim was that meant the person was a shill, but then when people pointed out that reddits servers are run through aws, and the links were being caught up in reddits spam filters, his argument switched to how fast the links were being clicked meant shills.  Which would still be them caught up in the spam filters.

       I've been trying to figure out who is right in the Scientology/dianetics vs psychoanalysis battle over the true nature of the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know Scientology is bs, but I think there is truth in the "somatic, analytic, reactionary" mind stuff and the thetan as soul stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly is Scientology's view on all that any more weird than Freud or Jungs writings?

       Antipsychotic drugs are anti-psychedelics.
      </p>
      <p>
       They cause damage to the pineal gland/ center-of-brain/dopamine receptors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overprescription of these drugs makes people easier to control.  The opposite is true of psychedelics, which cause creativity and uniqueness.

       Yes! I have a massive interest in the pineal gland and it has only recently cone on my radar but almost every time it comes up the only answer I see is someone recommending some sort of anti-calcification pill or something I should BUY. I would very much appreciate some sort of information regarding how I can focus or study this without a pill or supplement.

       My theories on dopamine are tied into these topics because dopamine, psych drugs, and psychedelics all work on the same part of the brain.  The center.

       Psych drugs are forced on people  (wikipedia rosenhan experiment) outside of the criminal justice system.  Drug effects qualify as cruel and unusual punishment.  Patients may never be accused/charged/convicted of illegal activities.

       I'm gonna copy a PM I sent to someone trying to explain it until I get home and I can spend some time typing something up for you
      </p>
      <p>
       I can give you a rundown as best I can, but it's very very in depth. I learned a lot from this site, whether the more outlandish things are true or not. There is quite a bit about Hermetic Alchemy, Gnosticism, Religion, and more on this site aside from all the aliens, space tech, and human consciousness study.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose I should start with why I don't think it's satire, though I suppose it may be fiction. The articles on the website are largely sourced. Academic journals, old books, government reports, all corroborate what is said in the articles. I've got a couple FOIA requests out right now actually for some CIA documents they list in the bibliography that we want to confirm exist, so that should determine whether or not they are for real. They aren't listed online anywhere in the CIA's reading room or anywhere else from what I can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another factor is the complexity. There are some languages that we won't even touch out of sheer inability to do so. We just simply don't have the conlang experience to even determine what we'd need to be looking for, if it's even possible to translate them with nothing to go on.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also claim to use a lot of information from an entity called XViS, which we think is this. XViS as a project is ran by Lockheed Martin and the Department of Energy, which would explain some of the classified material they list in sources from places like Raytheon.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the best pieces of evidence though is that none of their articles are primary information. One of the ways we've been able to translate some of the languages is that we can find the text (in English) in one of the sources they list in the bibliography. We've found that punctuation and things like dates and acronyms don't go through translation. Like, if a piece of text in one of the articles says something like:
      </p>
      <p>
       Dyzi daamet ned, dy vidzys degoge zin vaong - ver 9/6/2016
      </p>
      <p>
       I would look in the bibliographies for something that matched the punctuation and that date. In this instance:
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Ned, the first language we found - on 9/6/2016
      </p>
      <p>
       Which would allow us to translate that language. This also indicates that they are simply using the articles that they host as a sort of test for their language. They've told us that they try to use as complex of grammar as they can for testing purposes, and what better to use than quantum physics, human consciousness, and philosophy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another piece of evidence I feel adds to it's credibility is it's age. Forgotten Languages has been around at least the better part of 10 years, typically uploading at least one article or video per day, and the only other investigations I can find on the site are on Above Top Secret from years ago, and even then, they didn't quite understand what was going on when they gave it up. The site itself has been running with no ads, no donation button, no solicitation at all this entire time. They have a sister site, Kerysse, that uploads videos and art. Literally thousands of videos on YouTube under Ayndryl Reganah and Kerysse combined, most of which were at maybe a 300 views max on the popular ones before we started looking into it. All of which were not monetized.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the technical bits of information here come from communication we've had with the people who run the site. Back when we started this investigation, one of the first things we did was open channels of communication. Their "spokesperson" is named Ayndryl. (side note: We know with high confidence who this is in real life. When we first started this and we were looking for ways to open communication, we came across this now deleted Proz account, that was registered to a Ruben Cerdan, with an email of
       <a href="mailto:Ayndryl@gmail.com">
        Ayndryl@gmail.com
       </a>
       , which was the same email that the contact form on ForgottenLanguages uses. He was implicit in
       <a href="http://archive.archaeology.org/0909/insider/">
        This
       </a>
       scandal, and disappeared.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go to the website, the languages they use are languages they have created. We've been able to identify several (over 20) unique languages, and have a (very) small amount of translation done on a couple of them. They're all basic conlangs that translate back to a contemporary language (Mostly English, some Spanish.)
      </p>
      <p>
       How they create them is a lot less simple. They take languages that may or may not be in use today, some of them spoken by very few people, and they combine them. The only catch is they have to be vaguely similar. Like, for example, I've seen some languages they use that are a mixture of Chinese dialects and Japanese dialects. They combine the languages to have a functioning syntax and grammar of their own, so that they in effect become their own language.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, they put their dictionary through some kind of software called Nodespaces that they've developed that simulates the effects of time on a language (think Olde English compared to the English we use today) to further develop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the SV17q group is prevalent on ForgottenLanguages, it's only one rabbit hole in this website, and it's really the most recent one I've looked at. The Queltron Machine is another one. I admit, it has sucked me in for the better part of a few months of my life. If you want to see some of the interesting articles I've been looking at, I actually have some posted as well as translation on at least one on
       <a href="/r/ForgottenLanguages">
        /r/ForgottenLanguages
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I can try and answer specific questions but if I get to rambling on this I'm liable to ramble for days lol. Forgotten Languages has kept me up and night for a long time.

       Mind and soul is huge, also between the self and thoughts
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we create our own thoughts?  Or do they just pass by our "sense" of thought the same way a smell does on a windy day or a bird you see fly by?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone seems to think we have control or can generate our own thoughts.  I don't think it's that simple; if it were then things like depression wouldn't exist

       My theories on dopamine are tied into these topics because dopamine, psych drugs, and psychedelics all work on the same part of the brain.  The center.
