This is a billion dollar destroyer with, presumably, very sophisticated radar, GPS, submarine detection and whatever else.  Were these systems shut off? Was someone manually overriding these?

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I heard an interesting theory on YT by a guy named Jordan Sather of destroying the illusion channel, and he said that destroyer was protecting another ship in the region of NK. He was saying that maybe it was taken out to leave the other ship a sitting duck for NK to strike, hence giving pretense to go to war with NK.</p>

<p>Why completely destroy? Just boop it, enough to get it out of commission and back into the docks for repairs... You think like  a simple mind, I assure you, the people in charge... Do not have a simpleton mind...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I explained why it was utter bullshit.</p>

<p>Let me explain further. The East Sea is another name for the Sea of Japan which is between Korea and Japan. More specifically between the west coast of Japan and the east coast of Korea. The FITZGERALD was off the east coast of Japan. It wasn&#39;t close to any OPAREA that would interact with North Korea. Yes, the Navy can and does re-task ships as needed. They don&#39;t need one magical ship to stay in the OPAREA until whatever reason they were there is no longer a factor. They move different ships around all the time. Largely because, and this may be a difficult concept to grasp but bare with me, ships can sail on the ocean and can go anywhere the water is deep enough.</p>

<p>Why put it in the yards? We have a butt load of destroyers and cruisers in the pacific, putting one temporarily out of commission will barely affect the OPTEMPO, have no change in international relations and will change some SOPs and how the Navy operates in crowded shipping lanes. Yeah this sucks for the Naval community, but destroying a warship would have immediate and noticeable affects throughout the entire Navy and cause a larger political effect. You say I&#39;m thinking like a simpleton but you don&#39;t know what the fuck you&#39;re talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about these ships, but large cruise ships have various types of radar and they alert (to the staff) if they sense something but there&#39;s always someone on the bridge on lookout anyways. I&#39;m not aware of any that have an automatic avoidance system.  </p>

<p>(I highly recommend that anyone who takes a cruise and has an opportunity to take a behind the scenes tour, go for it.   The cruise ship may seem really elegant/cutting-edge but when you go below decks it looks like really old tech. The bridge has lots of newer equipment, though.)</p>

<p>FYI: The Captain was on the bridge with me and I was the OOW. I identified the possible risk of collision early and determined I was the stand-on vessel.  The warship was the give way vessel, the situation developed and the warship failed to give way. We were forced to take evasive action when the warship failed to act at an approximate distance of 0.5 Nm.</p>

<p>The Captain then pounced onto the Vhf radio and gave them an almighty serve! We were onboard an LNG carrier heading to Japan 135m3 of liquified gas onboard.</p>

<p>My point? Collision frequently occur due to human error.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A watch keeping Officer has to use all available means to maintain a proper lookout - i.e. sight, hearing and radar (at all times understanding the limitations of each.</p>

<p>When a vessel has been detected you have to then determine if there is a ROC or Risk of Collision, this is best done by taking compass bearings of the vessel in question and comparing to any data you may receive from a automatic plotting on the radar.</p>

<p>If a risk of collision is present you then must determine your responsibility, e.g. one vessel will be the stand on vessel and the will be the give way vessel, or, one vessel will be the overtaking vessel.</p>

<p>Both vessels must obey the corresponding rules for each vessel.</p>

<p>For good reason the Colregs do not require that vessels make contact via radio to avoid collisions....its just not how it works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not impossible to happen coincidentally. I would almost say it&#39;s more likely to happen coincidentally than on purpose. There are several systems, and several individuals set in place to stop something like this from happening, but that certainly doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s impossible. System casualties are possible, and human complacency is <em>very</em> possible. The general public won&#39;t get the full story, for several reasons. I&#39;d bet the farm it was an accident.</p>

Often, on container ships, no one is looking. They rely on alarms to go off when a ship gets close to them. I can easily see why the container ship caused the accident. However, i don&#39;t know how the military ship allowed themselves to be hit. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t an American destroyer have radar, GPS, auto pilot and other systems to warn them they were about to get hit...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some guy posted a very informed sounding comment about this a few days ago. He actually listed a whole bunch of systems that these ships have that are supposed to prevent not just accidents, but all kinds of enemy attacks as well.</p>

<p>So that got me thinking about other possible explanations. Considering the situation in the world right now, maybe this was a cyberattack?</p>

<p>Someone managed to get a virus or logic bomb into the software that controls all that early warning anti-collision stuff? It might even have been written in such a way as to steer the Navy ship into the path of the oncoming container ship.</p>
