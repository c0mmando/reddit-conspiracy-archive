       So, as many of you know, on September 10th, 2001, there was $2.3 Trillion missing from the Pentagon. On September 11th, the Accounting office in the Pentagon where it was being investigated was destroyed. There was never any mention of that money by the government or the mainstream press again.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I've always been curious about is:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) What was that money being used for?
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       b) If 9/11 was indeed an inside job, what could possibly be so top secret that the Pentagon had to prevent it's own accountants from finding out where that money went?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a few theories, but I'd like to see what y'all think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theory 1: The money was used to fabricate evidence of WMDs in Iraq, in order to justify the Iraq War.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theory 2: The money was used to fund deep state operations that we do not yet know about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theory 3: The money went to a foreign nation, possibly Israel or Saudi Arabia, as part of some secret deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you guys think?

       Remember, there wasn't a big safe full of $100 bills... I'm assuming all of it was virtual. Contract invoices that had been paid where we didn't know what we were paying for, ect. It happens a lot, the invoice approver gets a new job and so they have to pass the approval process to the next person. A few people down the line and they forget what they are paying for, they just approve invoices out of habit. Contractors love it, it is a big reason why they encouraged the federal government to move to a "Firm-fixed Price" model as opposed to paying on a cost basis. We don't know what the contractor is paying their employees, just was we are paying to the contractor. We could be paying the contractor $200k per year and only $50k of that gets passed to the employee. Even with 32% for fringe benefits the contractor is still making over $100k profit that they don't have to report.

       The money was used
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       September 10th, 2001. It was missing as of that date. But not exactly missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The auditors said the money was not accounted. The debits did not add up to equal the credits. The money disappeared over time without anyone bothering to even label it as something.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole mess probably goes back to the Ronald Reagan administration where he was illegally sending arms to overthrow democratic nations while sending money to oppressive regimes to release prisoners (aka "hostages").
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to the 2.3 trillion, the Reagan administration was also drug-dealing, so they spent massive amounts of money for who knows what beyond that which we discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in addition, audit reports have come up in later years and the 2.3 trillion cumulative number is much larger now -- guessing that it is about 6 trillion but there's the web for anyone to investigate. :)

       The $2.3 trillion is all from one year (fiscal year 1999), but it's $2.3 trillion in improper transactions, not $2.3 trillion in actual dollars.  The same money could be improperly accounted multiple times and could have made it to its proper place.

       It may be FY99, based on the 9-10-2001 date. That works for me. I thought for sure it was cumulative, but I can't find the report. This supports what you say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Defense Department's budget for the year is nearly $600 billion, but the accounting errors have run into the trillions of dollars because making changes to one account requires changes to various other accounts. In that way, the amount of one mistake can mushroom to many times the amount of the original error.
       </p>

       This means the total amount
       <em>
        missing
       </em>
       is much less than the 2.3 trillion. I'm changing my comment. Better to be accurate. Thanks. :)

       It wasn't missing, it was just not accounted for. Like the DoD budgets had money disappearing from one account and re-appearing on another because someone neglected the paperwork to show a proper trail. Money in still equaled money out, it's just all the places they went to in the intervening times weren't all accounted for.

       Thank you for pointing this out, Dov Zakheim was brought in to sort out the mess and accounted for almost all of the funds .  If someone is looking for a conspiracy Dov
       <em>

       a good place to start, but for other reasons.  His previous employer made remote control systems for cars, ships and yes - passenger jets.
