       Here on two different NIST claims they “considered the possibility… of explosives.” Then state that “NIST did not test for the residue of these compounds in the steel.” So my question is how did they consider a hypothesis when they never tested for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the “No witnesses or recorded videos” not catching “sound level of 130 to 140 decibels” is an outright lie since 503 witness testimonies to explosives was never investigated and ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The investigation team considered the possibility of other factors playing a role in the collapse of WTC 7, including the possible use of explosives, fires fed by the fuel supply tanks in and under the building, and damage from the falling debris of WTC 1. The team said that the smallest blast event capable of crippling the critical column would have produced a “sound level of 130 to 140 decibels at a distance of half a mile,” yet no noise this loud was reported by witnesses or recorded on videos.”

“22. Did the NIST investigation look for evidence of the WTC towers being brought down by controlled demolition? Was the steel tested for explosives or thermite residues?
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST did not test for the residue of these compounds in the steel. The responses to previous questions demonstrate why NIST concluded that there were no explosives or controlled demolition involved in the collapses of the WTC towers.”

       “14. Search for Explosive or Thermite Residues
      </p>
      <p>
       We agree; there is no evidence that NIST tested for residues of thermite or explosives. This is another remarkable admission. Probing for residues from pyrotechnic materials including thermite in particular, is specified in fire and explosion investigations by the NFPA 921 code: Unusual residues might remain from the initial fuel. Those residues could arise from thermite, magnesium, or other pyrotechnic materials.”

      <p>
       NFPA 921 sets the bar for scientific-based investigation and analysis of fire and explosion incidents. Referenced in the field, in training, and in court, it is the foremost guide for rendering accurate opinions as to incident origin, cause, responsibility, and prevention. It is intended for use by both public sector employees who are responsible for fire investigation and private sector professionals who conduct investigations for insurance companies or litigation purposes.

       What does NFPA 921 address?
All aspects of fire and explosion investigation are covered from basic methodology to collecting evidence to failure analysis.

      </p>
      <p>
       “Extremism-motivated fire setting is committed to further a social, political, or religious cause. Fires have been used as a weapon of social protest since revolutions first began. Extremist fire setters may work in groups or as individuals.Also, due to planning aspects and the selection of their targets, extremist fire setters generally have a great degree of organization, as reflected in their use of more elaborate ignition or incendiary devices. Subcategories of extremist fire setting are identified as follows (a) Terrorism. The targets set by terrorists may appear to be at random; however, target locations are generally selected with some degree of political or economic significance. Political targets generally include government offices, newspapers, universities, political party headquarters, and military or law enforcement installations. Political terrorists may also target diverse properties such as animal research facilities or abortion clinics. Economic targets may include business offices,
distribution facilities of utility providers, banks, or companies thought to have an adverse impact on the environments. Fires or explosions become a means of creation confusion fear, or anarchy. THE TERRORIST MAY INCLUDE FIRE AS A VARIETY OF WEAPONS, ALONG WITH EXPLOSIVES, USED IN FURTHERING HIS OR HER GOAL”

During an investigation, many things must be considered. Aside from the physical evidence, and witness testimony, suspect criminal history also must be analyzed. The investigation must include past history and the Modus Operandi,“M.O.” for short.

$ELLING OUT THE INVESTIGATION (January, 2002)

       “For more than three months, structural steel from the World Trade Center has been and continues to be cut up and sold for scrap. Crucial evidence that could answer many questions about high-rise building design practices and performance under fire conditions is on the slow boat to China, perhaps never to be seen again in America until you buy your next car.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Such destruction of evidence shows the astounding ignorance of government officials to the value of a thorough, scientific investigation of the largest fire-induced collapse in world history. I have combed through our national standard for fire investigation, NFPA 921, but nowhere in it does one find an exemption allowing the destruction of evidence for buildings over 10 stories tall.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Fire Engineering has good reason to believe that the “official investigation” blessed by FEMA and run by the American Society of Civil Engineers is a half-baked farce that may already have been commandeered by political forces whose primary interests, to put it mildly, lie far afield of full disclosure. Except for the marginal benefit obtained from a three-day, visual walk-through of evidence sites conducted by ASCE investigation committee members-described by one close source as a “tourist trip”-no one’s checking the evidence for anything.”

       Also, the NIST report dismissed explosives on the basis of no sounds were recorded around 130 - 140 dB. It always felt a bit arbitrary for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Becuase no 'explosions' were recorded at this volume, NIST didn't look for thermite within WTC 7's rubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       This paper found active thermitic residue within the rubble:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       No idea if it is peer reviewed. Nano thermite would not produce load explosions. Why did NIST not look for all types of explosives within WTC 7?
