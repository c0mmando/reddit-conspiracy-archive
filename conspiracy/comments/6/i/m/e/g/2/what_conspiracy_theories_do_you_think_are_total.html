<p>Why do you tune out? You don&#39;t believe in Satan so you dismiss everything that&#39;s even slightly related?  You&#39;re cognitive dissonance is hindering you.   In my opinion you&#39;re tuning out the core of the greatest conspiracy of all time.   Demons/archons/djinns/other dimensional beings are real and have been influencing humans for countless ages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, and I don&#39;t like Satanic as a label myself. I think that is kind of the result of paranoid and imho naive Christian conspiracy ideas. I think at its root, the thing these people worship predates Satan by a very long time, and crosses religious and cultural boundaries. I might even go so far as to say they have promoted the idea of Satanism to disguise the nature of what is really going on. </p>

<p>Whether such a being exists the part of the story with the metaphysical aspect you mention, although my mostly atheistic self is starting to believe it might. I wonder if in the dawn of society a group of people started literally worshiping the darkness in seeking to acquire its power, this thing that had the most power over their lives and psychology. And it wears a lot of hats, but is all essentially the same idea all these years later. </p>

<p>But whether or not it is real doesn&#39;t matter except in the final analysis. These people will continue to serve its ends as if it does. All the bad things they think it represents, they will be trying their hardest to appease it. The only thing that would be lacking is the supernatural power its influence might bring. But, humans are resourceful enough on their own that supernatural assistance is unnecessary to do great harm.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that is proof at all, but I think its a good starting point for people to go down the conspiracy rabbit hole of &quot;There&#39;s a lot more to reality than meets the eye and it goes back since the dawn of the modern Human era.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alll of the &quot;everything in the tv and radio is programmed&quot; theories. Some probably are. But throwing everything in there just makes it seem silly. I&#39;m sure the CIA uses the media and Hollywood to push their stories, but lumping pretty much everything mainstream into it is silly. I don&#39;t think Katy Perry&#39;s MKUltra is failing, I think she&#39;s just a celebrity who&#39;s been in the spotlight too long and is losing it. Not every celebrity is programmed, not every show is programming, not everything with a &quot;symbol&quot; in it is a sign from the CIA and reptilians. Sometimes people like to use satanism because it&#39;s edgy, sometimes people make movies and shows just to make them, sometimes it&#39;s for money. </p>

<p>I know I&#39;m kinda lumping a bunch here together and saying I don&#39;t believe them, but there&#39;s just so many that I see all the time on here that I think are just absurd. It&#39;s like people don&#39;t think that sometimes people make a tv show just because of the artistic or monetary value, but that everything in the radio and tv is a psyop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That &quot;no planes hit the buildings on 9/11&quot;.</p>

<p>The only plane of questionable origin was at the Pentagon.  It was either a smaller plane, likely a drone, or less likely a missile.</p>

<p>The plane that went down over Pennsylvania was probably shot down, likely by a drone, as one eyewitness reported seeing a small aircraft in the area and the lack of wreckage is bizarre.</p>

<p>Either it&#39;s an intentional disinformation campaign, or someone got confused by all the anomolies of the day and began conflating hings.</p>
