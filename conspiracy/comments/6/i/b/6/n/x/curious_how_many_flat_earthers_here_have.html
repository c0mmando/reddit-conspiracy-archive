 The best friends,roommates, conversations I ever had were the ones who would disagree and argued with me all day about how my ideas are wrong.(without the personal offense and hurt feelings)
Or why should I only consume media thats going to agree with my worldview? Or why should I only listen to musical styles I like?

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people who believe flat earth once believed the sphere model. Most of these people are going through a phase, and I think it&#39;s healthy to question these things. I think it&#39;s harmless to consider the possibility for the simple fact that there&#39;s like 30 astronauts out of 7 billion people. In other words, the curvature of the Earth or lack therof, has no practical significance to people in general. It is completely irrelevant if the Earth is flat or round in our day to day activities.</p>

<p>The immediate topographical features are of a much more practical concern than any imperceptible curvature. You don&#39;t walk down the street, or drive a car, or do your job, or socialize with people based on the curvature of the Earth, so it&#39;s almost meaningless. Unless you&#39;re an astrologer it makes no practical difference. </p>

<p>And all the light pollution makes astronomy a practically useless hobby.</p>

It doesnt falsify the science that gave us the awareness and knowledge to ask the questions in the first place concerning quantum wierdness..</p>

<p>Do you have spiritual beliefs? What are the mechanisms that transfers  information you receive from god ? If you dont know about the existance of such  hypothetical bosons, then does it falsify your metaphysics?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science gave us knowledge and awareness, is science some kind of deity that bestows such things? Or did humans, using the tool of science, give themselves knowledge and awareness?</p>

<p>Spiritual beliefs? As in some sort of spiritual being that interacts with us, umm I guess, I&#39;ll try anything once.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t because metaphysics is a tool, and tools have no feelings. I can call my impact gun a flimsy chinesium piece of shit, and it&#39;s not going to flinch one bit. Although maybe if I direct enough negative energy at it I can accelerate it&#39;s destruction, who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  The age of misinformation. My gut feeling  is its due to lack of crucial mandatory school classes, like Critical Thinking and Logic.. Cant tell true or false without a strict proven  empirical method thats separates subjective from objective,  fact from fiction. the kind of empirical method a court of law  and both sides would demand and agree upon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole FE resurgence thing in the past few years started as a prank by the Church Of The Subgenius. They picked the most unbelievably ridiculous idea they could find - Flat Earth - and rebooted it on the internet. Their idea was to see how many gullible fools they could convince, and they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, Ill look it up.I remember something about that but its been a long long time. Ive been following  conspiracies / creationism/end times since the Satanic Panic and come from a large  fundy homeschooled family, but never heard of flat earth as a defense of supernaturalism until only the past few years, without the usual decades long evolutions of conspiracies like  spiritual Ufoism. I was curious where  this is originating from and if parents are teaching thier children FE. Its seems so suddenly popular from out of nowhere.</p>
