       I come here because I am the rare individual that that ignores the ideas I already agree with and enjoy opposing and disagreeable  worldviews that challenges my worldview and mind. Its all about  progress thru falsifications of my own hypothesis.

      <p>
       Ive realized over the years,  I am abnormal because of this. Nobody picks up a book of someone that hates them....I on the other hand find no  mental satisfaction in being around a group of  people who would agree with me.

       Most people dont understand the joy and value of communicating with those who would fundamentally  disagree with you.
 The best friends,roommates, conversations I ever had were the ones who would disagree and argued with me all day about how my ideas are wrong.(without the personal offense and hurt feelings)
Or why should I only consume media thats going to agree with my worldview? Or why should I only listen to musical styles I like?
Show me music I hate and Ill listen to it for 3 hours  until I  finally "get it"

       I guess youd have to love the era of Newton, Royal Society and the historical developments of  Philosophies of Science, science history to understand the appeal of  arguing against antiNewtonian  flat earthism. Its like  the same  satisfaction an antique collector gets touching and feeling a rare boring artifact for hours on end and daydreaming about its history

       A lot of people who believe flat earth once believed the sphere model. Most of these people are going through a phase, and I think it's healthy to question these things. I think it's harmless to consider the possibility for the simple fact that there's like 30 astronauts out of 7 billion people. In other words, the curvature of the Earth or lack therof, has no practical significance to people in general. It is completely irrelevant if the Earth is flat or round in our day to day activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The immediate topographical features are of a much more practical concern than any imperceptible curvature. You don't walk down the street, or drive a car, or do your job, or socialize with people based on the curvature of the Earth, so it's almost meaningless. Unless you're an astrologer it makes no practical difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all the light pollution makes astronomy a practically useless hobby.

       Its only "meaningless" "completely irrelevant" and a "useless hobby" if you lack curiosity and find no value, satisfaction, in knowledge or education.
I can assume though, you love sports, or movies, your favorite music or  matching sets of furniture in your home? It probably has value to you, because of a whole list of reasons.

       How does astrology affect you personally? I can make generalized statements about your life, and blame it all on retrograde mercury, doesn't mean it's practical information.

       By mechanism you mean bosons and hypothetical  gravitons? Yes thats why point particles are changed to (super)strings to explain gravity.
It doesnt falsify the science that gave us the awareness and knowledge to ask the questions in the first place concerning quantum wierdness..
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have spiritual beliefs? What are the mechanisms that transfers  information you receive from god ? If you dont know about the existance of such  hypothetical bosons, then does it falsify your metaphysics?

       Science gave us knowledge and awareness, is science some kind of deity that bestows such things? Or did humans, using the tool of science, give themselves knowledge and awareness?
      </p>
      <p>
       Spiritual beliefs? As in some sort of spiritual being that interacts with us, umm I guess, I'll try anything once.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't because metaphysics is a tool, and tools have no feelings. I can call my impact gun a flimsy chinesium piece of shit, and it's not going to flinch one bit. Although maybe if I direct enough negative energy at it I can accelerate it's destruction, who knows.

       Basically, yeah. Except it's not first generation, it's just the first generation for which TRUE vs. FALSE and REAL vs. FAKE has been deliberately blurred and confused while the access to both REAL and FAKE has become unimpeded.

       Yes.  The age of misinformation. My gut feeling  is its due to lack of crucial mandatory school classes, like Critical Thinking and Logic.. Cant tell true or false without a strict proven  empirical method thats separates subjective from objective,  fact from fiction. the kind of empirical method a court of law  and both sides would demand and agree upon.

       Op stated in another thread just now that "the sun goes under the pancaked earth" referring to the flat earth theory. (The sun does not go under the "pancake earth" in the theory, the sun goes around the "pancaked earth") Most people think flat earth theory is fake, stupid, and or bullshit because of the simple fact that they do not understand the theory.

       Yes thats true but dont get offended. Flat earthers think the Ballers are fake, stupid,and bullshit...also flat earthers can believe  Im ignorant and possibly satanic and subhuman.....its not a personal attack on ones character, but an argument against the idea. Which should be fair game in a civil society that can be critical without Ad Hominen or personal offense

       There is a difference in understanding something someone made up for fantasy/fiction and believing in it. I don't need to understand all the theories people come up with for their fictional/fantasy worlds they create for role playing/book writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You understand the theory, which is nice for you, but can you tell people here that to you the earth is flat and you can offer real proof of not only that but that every scientist in the world that has worked on space programs is a liar? People who think like that, to me, are delusional.

       User soonerchad brought up the point that this thread was made to ridicule a theory. This is more important than the semantics of understanding something.

       Ridicule them in a thread that supports that theory. Creating another thread about the subject only perpetuates the idea.

       This whole FE resurgence thing in the past few years started as a prank by the Church Of The Subgenius. They picked the most unbelievably ridiculous idea they could find - Flat Earth - and rebooted it on the internet. Their idea was to see how many gullible fools they could convince, and they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.

       Thanks, Ill look it up.I remember something about that but its been a long long time. Ive been following  conspiracies / creationism/end times since the Satanic Panic and come from a large  fundy homeschooled family, but never heard of flat earth as a defense of supernaturalism until only the past few years, without the usual decades long evolutions of conspiracies like  spiritual Ufoism. I was curious where  this is originating from and if parents are teaching thier children FE. Its seems so suddenly popular from out of nowhere.
