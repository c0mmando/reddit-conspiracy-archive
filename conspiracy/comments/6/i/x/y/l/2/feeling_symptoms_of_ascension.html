       Is this happening to anyone else? I feel my energy changing. I have put thousands of hours into rocket league and PS4 and all of the sudden I'm trying to sell it and feel like getting back into working out. I'm a previously shy but now pretty introverted 24 year old white male quality control inspector in a Metro Detroit factory, with tons of ex convicts and scary people. It's hard to keep positive energy there. I normally don't take risks on asking girls out that I hardly know, but I went for the new intern, lol. Turns out she has a boyfriend, but the point is I just never would have done that before. It's just happening recently. I'm beginning to think more positively. I'm taking more risks, and just 'going for it', if you will.

       Thoughts? Please no passive aggressiveness :]

       I'm in the same boat as you. I have gotten much more spiritual this past year after calling myself an atheist for most of my life. Human frequencies are rising across the globe due to the magnetic polar shift. We will emerge from the dark 3D world to 5D, where the cabal will completely lose their grip on us when they face the overwhelming light of god which transcends all of us. Our souls chose to enter this earth at this specific time and the fact you're in the sub and talking ascension means you, with many other people here are early risers in this process. As we enter the new age it's important to let go of your ego and search for your true inner self. Meditate and be mindful of what goes in your body.

       skip the pills.. nothing wrong whit weed but dont make it an everyday habit. (easier said then done, i know) but if you get the opportunity try some psychedelics, but see it more as an spiritual trip then a party trip.. go out in the wood early, maybe take a friend that you trust and eat some mushroom or acid  ( not to much at once ) try to have as little outside stimulants as possible. let nature guide you

       Weed is fine. Depends on the pills...if it's opiates, yeah, stop doing those immediately. If it's molly/mdma, probably okay if used recreationally once in a while (a big night out with friends/a show/etc.)

       in the same boat, Was a very quiet child growing up, became empathic back in october 2008 since then its been a crazy adventure to the now. Watching humanity starting to wake up and feel the same things that i do, i know its something we can all do once we step out of ego and the matrix. Something is happening here, and as stated above the very fact were here talking about it, sharing the vibrations and looking for truth. All my family are doing the same thing but theyve turned to christianity and the church.

       We are in the Great Awakening/Unveiling, our frequencies are changing, and there are many  happenings going on in the Cosmos. The fact that you are feeling this means your getting more and more in tune with your spirit being and the point of this "experience" you're having, imo. That's a great thing, and I'm glad to hear it!
      </p>

       I've been noticing many changes in myself, as well. What a lovely time to be alive, and a point in time in which our Spirit Beings chose to be in ;). There is a reason you are here.

       Alan Watts (and others) really changed my life. Hopefully that inspires you, as much as it inspired me. Peace and love.

       People are reporting this for revealing personal information. I approved it, but you have narrowed yourself down to a vanishingly small pool of unique humans. You might want to edit put a couple details.

       Upvote this. I can relate. I feel this energy that seems to be amplyfing lately. I even meditate. The meditation has even become intense like a trip. Except I am not taking anything to produce those effects. I have had some really eye opening prophetic visions too.
