        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>ATTENTION ON DECK!
A message to all Patriots - it has been made public that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as the democrat Party have openly pledged millions of dollars to finance what they are calling &quot;the summer of rage&quot; - basically an all out assault by leftist groups like ANTIFA, BAMN, etc - starting on July 2nd... I myself have people in numerous ANTIFA groups and they are absolutely planning on, in their own words &quot;extreme rioting and violence&quot;....
Fellow Patriots - simply put - we must oppose this at all costs... I&#39;m not calling for violence - I am calling for all out organized protection of our people and our communities... if they want to riot and destroy liberal cities then have at it... but we need to fully mobilize and protect our people...
They are looking for symbolic targets - in the south they will be targeting confederate and patriotic monuments - as well as nationwide targeting of republican/conservative centers, clubs and political offices. They have buses ready to go, housing arrangements set and in many cases are being paid.... and there are a lot of them... we must take this threat serious and start planning accordingly.</p>

<p>Could anybody elaborate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Men in masks attacking attendees is a great way to solidify the resolve of them.  It would make it really easy to move people into it.  He has had bomb threats made at other places.  No intelligent person would pay to have them riot like that as it would not help their cause in any way unless they wanted more resolve among his supporters.</p>

<p>Granted the case points to him pissing off some big players.  He has had numerous bomb threats made most likely due to BAMN.  He is a controversial figure to say the least.  The far right are using this against them.  BAMN needs to up their game in this though.  You don&#39;t go after the person like this.  We are dealing with contagion in ideology that goes against justice.  You have to remove the distribution system like Briefshart by defunding and removing the credibility of their sold products.  Then discredit some of the major thought leaders.  Trump is probably the most major distraction on who runs the show.  Any direct attack like what happened at Berkeley or Kathy Griffen&#39;s artistic expression (In bad taste) will be used against them.  The people fighting this stuff have never dealt with manipulative groups like I have.  Physical violence will accomplish nothing but causing a greater divide which is what Russia, Turkey, Iran, and Syria want.  This is why I think that Russia could be playing both sides in order to further cause enough instability so that it grants Trump and co more power.</p>

Any group out to destroy stuff just because they disagree with the other side is out of their mind. They are all just taking advantage of their rights thinking it&#39;s legal when what they are doing is against the law. If people want a civil war they are very ignorant. That will never happen.
We have fallen way too far into political correctness. It is mind blowing.</p>
