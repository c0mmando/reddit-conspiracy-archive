        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the recent leak of the Majestic 12 document that for the most part has historically verifiable information, I took it upon myself to further investigate if the information from the EBE fits with comments made by Nikola Tesla and Guglielmo Marconi. </p>

<h1>The Majestic 12 EBE Responses</h1>

<p>The EBE makes some remarkable statements implying that Tesla and Marconi were both the recipients of radio signals that did not have terrestial origin. The responses we are interested in are <a href="http://imgur.com/a/b49J9">here</a> (along with some statements from Tesla in 1900 to match the timeline). The EBE states that Tesla made contact in 1899, and they responded immediately. Tesla makes the claim in 1900 that he has made contact with another planet. The  EBE also make the claim that they contacted Marconi with the letter &#39;V&#39; in his own code. </p>

<h1>Guglielmo Marconi</h1>

<p>I did some digging and found a paper titled: &quot;An Historic Report on Life in Space: Tesla, Marconi, Todd&quot;. This paper was presented at the American Rocket Society, 17th annual meeting, November 13–18, 1962, in Los Angeles. A cached version of that paper can be found <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:i7tWFC04whEJ:www.anakinovni.org/marconi.htm+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">here</a>. The following is an excerpt from that peper:</p>

<p>In Newfoundland in 1901, he (Marconi) received the first radio signal sent across the Atlantic. People were wowed, Marconi became well-to-do and built a mobile laboratory on his yacht the Electra, so that he could work in privacy. As Electra sailed the Mediterranean in 1921, Marconi received a signal that he viewed as being of interplanetary origin. The London manager of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, J. C. H. MacBeth, reported this news:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The signals . . . registered high in the meter band, although the maximum length of earth-produced waves at the time was 14,000 meters. The theory that the waves were produced by electrical disturbances was disproved by the regularity of the pulses. Although the pulses apparently consisted of a code, the only signal similar to earth codes was one resembling the letter “V” in the Marconi Code. Marconi himself expressed the belief that the signal had  originated . . . at some point in outerspace.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>

<p>As shown in the images above, Tesla&#39;s timeline of events matches with the EBE&#39;s responses. In the paper &quot;Nikola Tesla and the Planetary Radio Signals&quot; by K.J Corum and J.F. Corum (<a href="http://www.teslasociety.com/mars.pdf">reference</a>) we get to see Tesla&#39;s thinking behind that letter he sent to the American Red Cross:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The changes I noted were taking place periodically, and with such a clear suggestion of number and order that they were not traceable to any cause then known to me. I was familiar, of course, with such electrical disturbances as are produced by the sun, Aurora Borealis and earth currents, and I was as sure as I could be of any fact that these variations were due to none of these causes. The nature of my experiments precluded the possibility of the changes being produced by atmospheric disturbances, as has been rashly asserted by some. It was some time afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind that the disturbances I had observed might be due to an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another. A purpose was behind these electrical signals; and it was with this conviction that I announced to the Red Cross Society, when it asked me to indicate one of the great possible achievements of the next hundred years, that it would probably be the confirmation and interpretation of this planetary challenge to us. </p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I think there is more than enough evidence to suggest that both Tesla and Marconi received signals that implied a non terrestial origin and both stories align with the supposedly real MJ12 document which was just recently released. At the very least both Tesla and Marconi were receiving signals that could not be explained by natural occurring phenomena, and if Tesla had the capability to transmit at the distance he claimed, then the idea that ETI would be alerted due to that signal is not that far fetched.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good research. I noticed while skimming through a biography that that it did a good job of muddling the issue in regards to the ET signal that Tesla got. Tesla claimed it was ET in origin but then newspapers assumed it must  be Mars. Then, later in the biography the author talks about how Tesla was claiming he got signals from Mars. Then the explanation is that Jupiter&#39;s moon IO would be sending periodic signals and their appearance would be correlated with Mars&#39;s location in the sky around the time Tesla was getting the signals (~September 1899). They really had to jump through some hoops to pull that explanation out their ***, lol</p>
