    <div class="md"><p>EAM is emergency action message.  If the intel community doctored one they could make it look like Trump was doing something absurd, but then that scheme got leaked to the wrong people so the dems behind the scheme backed off the Russia talk, probably Dem leadership was involved and Pelosi will be out of leadership by July 20th when the AP prints their story.  Anyone with connections to the Associated Press, ask them if they are writing a story about this topic, and to print it immediately, the American public deserves to know so our country can stop wasting millions in taxpayer funds paying Clinton&#39;s ex-lawyers to investigate Trump and Russia.  That money should be going to fund health care costs for the lower classes and Flint Michigan water crisis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has more to do with them loosing the recent election. There were a number of talking heads on meet the press basically scalding the leadership for ignoring economic issues while pushing this Russia stuff. Their base is not that responsive, and they certainly won&#39;t budge Trumpets to vote Democrat by pushing this line.   On top of this, the senior editor of the New York Times stated that he is getting uncomfortable by lack of evidence, and the way the story is covered.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how strategic the leadership is... I have serious doubts, but the last round of sanctions that is being pushed is actually jeopardizing the transatlantic alliance, with officials in Germany and Austria openly criticizing and threatening retaliation against the US if the sanctions go forward.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>estimate: 7 to 10 days ago it began to transition, a few days after the Belmont Stakes actually, the transition to &#39;obstruction&#39; is complete and that is already transitioning to something else as Dems look for a coherent message in 2018.

</blockquote>

<p>The pivot towards obstruction started around the last Comey hearing... this is going to be the next political strategy for sure from the neoliberal wing.   No matter what their strategy is going to be, concerning Trump, if they continue to just run negative campaigns, they will not have a good response in 2018. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flynn thought that Trump was going to lose the election and Kushner intel is based on what the Russian ambassador said, you have to trust the Russian account of that story, i&#39;ll give you an example.  You are Kushner, sitting down at a business meeting with Sergie Lavrov and he starts talking about sanctions and you nod your head as if to say you understand his demands.  The next day you wake up and Lavrov is telling the papers that you discussed sanctions with him, i&#39;d consider the messenger on that story.  Back to Flynn, I think he was planning on going back to working for Turkey after the election so he was getting his Russian contacts in order, when Trump won he was like, &quot;Oh sh*t&quot;, end of story.</p>
