       Guess we'll see, too bad we'll have to wait almost a month to see if the theory is correct.  If the AP does write that story remember this post and repost it if you can on July 21, 2017.

       EAM is emergency action message.  If the intel community doctored one they could make it look like Trump was doing something absurd, but then that scheme got leaked to the wrong people so the dems behind the scheme backed off the Russia talk, probably Dem leadership was involved and Pelosi will be out of leadership by July 20th when the AP prints their story.  Anyone with connections to the Associated Press, ask them if they are writing a story about this topic, and to print it immediately, the American public deserves to know so our country can stop wasting millions in taxpayer funds paying Clinton's ex-lawyers to investigate Trump and Russia.  That money should be going to fund health care costs for the lower classes and Flint Michigan water crisis.

       I think it has more to do with them loosing the recent election. There were a number of talking heads on meet the press basically scalding the leadership for ignoring economic issues while pushing this Russia stuff. Their base is not that responsive, and they certainly won't budge Trumpets to vote Democrat by pushing this line.   On top of this, the senior editor of the New York Times stated that he is getting uncomfortable by lack of evidence, and the way the story is covered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how strategic the leadership is... I have serious doubts, but the last round of sanctions that is being pushed is actually jeopardizing the transatlantic alliance, with officials in Germany and Austria openly criticizing and threatening retaliation against the US if the sanctions go forward.

       estimate: 7 to 10 days ago it began to transition, a few days after the Belmont Stakes actually, the transition to 'obstruction' is complete and that is already transitioning to something else as Dems look for a coherent message in 2018.  Pelosi needs to resign first so the fiasco theorized in this post is what I think will occur over the next month, then the Dems will start figuring out what their messaging strategy will be.

       The pivot towards obstruction started around the last Comey hearing... this is going to be the next political strategy for sure from the neoliberal wing.   No matter what their strategy is going to be, concerning Trump, if they continue to just run negative campaigns, they will not have a good response in 2018.

       At this time "Russia" has transitioned completely into "Obstruction".  Why ... Mueller isn't done yet, it has to be something that got the dems spooked about their own collusion and even more, what they tried to do to frame Trump maybe using an EAM, that's the theory.

       No. Now we're talking about both. Are you not aware of the investigations into Kushner and Flynn now and what's been publically leaked?

       Flynn is out of the administration and if Kushner was forced to resign no one would really care since he hasn't accomplished anything tangible yet, the Trump Russia talk is 100% transitioned to "obstruction", which will transition to "Pelosi resigns as speaker because of her collusion with Russia and trying to scheme with rouge intel agents to doctor a EAM to frame Trump."

       Doesn't matter if they are out of the administration if they tried to collude prior to Trump becoming president in January.

      <p>
       Give me a good reason why Kushner and Flynn would try to set up secret communications with Russian using Russian intelligence assets at a Russian embassy and then lying about it on top secret security clearances

       Flynn thought that Trump was going to lose the election and Kushner intel is based on what the Russian ambassador said, you have to trust the Russian account of that story, i'll give you an example.  You are Kushner, sitting down at a business meeting with Sergie Lavrov and he starts talking about sanctions and you nod your head as if to say you understand his demands.  The next day you wake up and Lavrov is telling the papers that you discussed sanctions with him, i'd consider the messenger on that story.  Back to Flynn, I think he was planning on going back to working for Turkey after the election so he was getting his Russian contacts in order, when Trump won he was like, "Oh sh*t", end of story.

       How does any of that make the Trump team look better? That's the NSA and the POTUS's most special lil adviser being excused on grounds of greed and incompetence. Is stupid really that much better than malicious when it comes to running the country?

       The media spends all day saying that putin is a lying criminal, then when the russian ambassador makes a kushner claim you believe every word of it, which means you look bad for being inconsistent.  Nobody cares what Kushner is accused of until he accomplishes something, it is no different than criticizing the last man on the bench in the NBA for sitting there and cheering his team on, nobody is going to understand your strategy there.

       Doesn't matter when it was, the media is relying on the russian account of the meeting, and at the same time condemning russia for being lying criminals, can't have it both ways, you either trust what they say or you don't.  Selectively choosing what Russian statements to believe makes you look bad.
