    <div class="md"><p>Jesus you people are insane. I feel sorry for you. You &#39;re all full of hate and just see the bad side of anything. A few weeks back someone posted a video of two kids dressed as dogs. Pretending to be dogs. Thats just kids being kids.</p>

<p>I doubt anyone who&#39;s backing this &quot;conspiracy&quot; actually has a child in their life. </p>

<p>Even if YouTube is the super evil elite pedo site you believe to be, why would they so blatantly display it. This is exactly why this sub is a joke to most people. Enjoy your witch hunt boys</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you looked at some of these YouTube channels? The videos are uploads with just dates as the titles usually, spanning multiple accounts, and the videos are usually very young, mostly unclothed children doing various things. That. Is. Fucked. Up. Not even mentioning the comments on the videos. Sure, the example you listed with the kids acting like dogs, whatever. You are right. That is harmless. But these videos that have been uncovered(literal CP on YouTube) are not just kids being kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Name-calling too, usually done when you have nothing better to say.</p>

<p>But he was making a play on words about the &quot;edginess&quot; of your comment, although it was poorly worded. Usually people will say something along the lines of &quot;don&#39;t cut yourself on that edge&quot; or something similar. He was trying to equate your edginess to being able to cut cheese. </p>

<p>But really, talking about a cynical hatred as the &quot;price&quot; for being aware of &quot;what goes on behind the curtains&quot; like it&#39;s some sort of sacrifice to stay up to date on these kinds of things... Sure, abhorrent stuff like this really does happen but if you look hard enough for something you&#39;re eventually going to find it whether it&#39;s really there or not. Knowing TPTB indulge in this type of behavior can be pretty shocking, but it doesn&#39;t have to make you a total misanthrope. Not every strange video with children has to be part of some cryptic pedophilia cult. Some kids are just fucking weird. This is a sub where we are constantly exposed to evil and wretched deeds perpetrated by those that deceive and manipulate us, and oftentimes it can obscure the fact that there is good in the world and some things do not have any other hidden agenda besides what&#39;s explicitly on the surface. Like the guy said, go outside and live a little. The conspiracies aren&#39;t going anywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where&#39;s the hate?  Show me exactly how this sub is a JOKE as well.  It probably has some of the most serious discussion around, at least since ATS well, changed formats back in the day.  </p>

<p>Blatant display IS the game, ya know.  That is why they do it, because they can, not because they should.  And when kids dress up as dogs, there&#39;s not parents around or other adults wearing skimpy outfits doing sexually suggestive things.  Just doesn&#39;t happen in real life.  Also, makeup.  </p>

<p>None of that is insanity.  It&#39;s discussion.  You can&#39;t do it.  You can&#39;t draw a line.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I did too just a couple of hours ago. Wanted to link them again to that guy, but can&#39;t find the bad ones again. They may have been taken down. I&#39;d have to call what I saw softcore CP. They were different than just a normal topless child at the beach. Pantyshots, weird poses, a snapchat loop of a small girl simulating oral sex with her hand. Definitely not normal family videos in any way. Like you said, they seemed sinister. Never ever seen anything close to CP before and there it is on youtube.</p>

<p>And the comments were about the girls looks, nipples and  &quot;💦💦&quot;. Didn&#39;t want to keep looking, but similar videos were popping up in related. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be deeply connected to the Elsa stuff, but this can&#39;t be anything else than a pedophile ring if you ask me.</p>

<p>&quot;Mundo da Camilla Araujo&quot; - I don&#39;t speak any Portuguese, but I believe it means &quot;The world of Camilla Araujo&quot;, yet all videos are of him and her or her playing with other kids. She don&#39;t really interact with any other adult at all. You&#39;d think a relative might appear some time. Sure, he could be a single father, but The world of Camilla seems pretty one dimensional.

sexy
alot of stuff in Spanish i&#39;m not sure how to accurately translate</p>

<p>Check out anything on the rec commended sidebar:</p>

<p>So most of the videos I&#39;m looking at have young Brazillian girls doing &quot;afternoon routine&quot;, &quot;evening routine&quot;, &quot;night routine&quot;, etc. Seems like its some kind of  shower/bath thing that they do in South America that these girls have quasi-innocently decided to record.</p>

<p>However, everyone who comments or is affiliated with all this stuff are posting explicitly pedophilic comments and have creepy profile pictures.</p>

Not saying that everyone that practices the religion is bad, but you can&#39;t deny the fact that A) the Catholic church has defended offending preachers that were touching little boys&#39; pee-pees in NUMEROUS instances and B) it is openly advocated and practiced by a not-insignificant amount of Muslims.  There are more examples, but those two are the most prominent ones.  </p>

<p>youtube does have some weird shit indeed, but the moment it becomes popular in any measurement, if its something actually fucked up or demented it gets instantly deleted.i remember like a prank video with a scene from toy story that suddenly cuts to someone slapping their dick naked.i saw that video when it had 200 views.3 years later, like 2 months ago, some dude popular on twitch watched it on stream, given the link from a viewer.within a damn hour, the video was down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These videos are all veiled pedo stuff. Of course they will not make it blatantly pedo, coz they would be arrested, right? So they will keep it &quot;innocent&quot;- like naked kids doing different stuff, eating and spitting gross things etc.
 If law enforcement would actually do their jobs, I&#39;m sure that investigating into this will uncover smth big and these predators will be behind bars. Just the fact that many comments to these kind of videos are sexual should make any normal person/parent to freak out. 
This is NOT NORMAL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for the board mods there, but I am sure that they are nervous about links to possible CP being flaunted on the threads.  There was a legitimate video on YouTube that numerous people verified was real that had a very young girl giving a grown man a hand job.  I honestly could not bring myself to pull up the video, but I do trust what the other &quot;anons&quot; have said.  Having links to that kind of shit on your board is a huge issue from a mod standpoint, legally speaking.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Condition the children to think it&#39;s normal play behavior. It&#39;s basically grooming through YouTube videos. It&#39;s also to get cheap ad revenue. You&#39;ll first start off with Elsa videos and Spider-Man than slowly working into kids and adults that you get the weird stuff like OP described. You have to look through accounts that made an actual comment. These are people who won&#39;t expose themselves unless through private message. For example they&#39;ll see the weird borderline video message if they have more &quot;real&quot; stuff then get sent to 3rd party link or made to pay for it and sent to a DL website</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is true but a lot of people take advantage. My kid actually doesn&#39;t like going on her tablet as much as she used to. She&#39;d rather play with toys or go outside. It&#39;s surprising because it used to actually worry me bc she&#39;d always ask for it. Growing up I played a shitload of videogames. I still do, so I don&#39;t see much harm coming from a lot visual stimulation. Especially if you keep a watchful eye over them. A lot of parents shove an ipad in front of their kids and walk away. Don&#39;t get me wrong it&#39;s ok to have some alone time especially if you&#39;re a busy person/parent. There&#39;s also a ton of innocent content on YouTube but the bad stuff is bound to appear on a kids recommended videos list so it&#39;s a must to peep at what their watching, and deal with it accordingly. </p>

<p>It&#39;s about time you folks found an actual pedo conspiracy you make help with. REPORT.</p>

<p>I stumbled onto this looking for videos about stretching my feet (planar fasciitis) there were related videos in the sidebar that looked like young girls posing, I click thinking &quot;WTF&quot; and then see the comments... grown ass men saying disgusting things to little kids and trying to get their kik and phone number. When you click on one, the sidebar lights up with a never ending stream of young girls doing gymnastics stretches and men making lewd comments. From &quot;you&#39;re so pretty&quot; to &quot;@@&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;$&amp;@@&amp;&amp; your little @&amp;$&amp;@&amp; with my @&amp;$&amp;&amp;@&quot; reporting does NOTHING. These Elsa doctor videos are absolutely fetish videos exploiting children. (Also, search &quot;foot
Challenge&quot; apparently a fake challenge posed to children by pedos with foot fetish.. these pop up in my persuit of a cure for my foot pain regularly...)</p>

<p>If you pizZagaters wanted to <strong>really help</strong> the world and not a political

Warren Jeff&#39;s? However on the same note, Waco has quite a few theories. </p>

<p>Lastly brainwashing, that could mean anything these days, it could mean fake news/propaganda (from either side, I don&#39;t care which side you side with for this response), it could mean parental brainwashing, it could mean religious brainwashing, brainwashing is a pretty damn huge catch all, and MKUltra falls into that category as well. </p>

This is so attractive to a very specific group, it would be unbelievable if there weren&#39;t any paedos watching it. Fake accounts or not, paedos are watching this and getting off on this.</p>

<p>But I think that using one random account that has now been deleted as evidence is complete bullshit, there&#39;s no relation other than the fact that people believe that&#39;s brainwashing their children. Another similar account could leave a comment in an unrelated video and you would believe that the video is related to a conspiracy, it just sounds stupid to use something that is now deleted as evidence and calling it a &quot;huge&quot; development.</p>

<p>GIBBERISH COMMENTS MAY NOT BE GIBBERISH</p>

<p><strong>these videos are landing pages for pedos.</strong> the videos themselves aren&#39;t illegal, but a gathering point to more nefarious stuff. </p>

<p>and the comments of these videos are VERY interesting.
many comments are complete GIBBERISH. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/p21Da">many gibberish commenters are from users that display the same type of uploads...</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>gibberish comment<br/>
goto users profile<br/>
may have a few video uploads<br/>
videos ALWAYS named some kind of date<br/>
videos ALWAYS have less than 5 views  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>videos look VERY sketchy 
could the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/UijGB">gibberish also be a key to illegal stuff</a>?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>onion address?<br/>
unique search term?<br/>
pastebin id?<br/>
bitly hash?<br/>
date of instructions?</p>

<p>same type of gibberish comments were used by malware hackers to relay instructions using comments on britney spear&#39;s instagram.  </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/bp7Dx">https://archive.is/bp7Dx</a></p>

<p>&quot;While it looks like random spam, in this case it was a more sinister means to communicate with compromised computers. Hidden in that comment was a trackable hash that contained a string of characters – in this case 2kdhuHX – that correlated with a bitly link.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For years, a man crosses the border almost daily with a wheelbarrow full of dirt. Each day border security digs through the dirt looking for contraband; and each day it’s the same story – it’s just dirt. He’s filling up a hole. Years later, a retired border patrolman runs into the wheelbarrow man in a social setting. He’s just got to know the real story behind the dirt. “There’s no way you were just bringing dirt across the border; what were you really doing?”</p>

<p>The reply: “I was smuggling wheelbarrows, of course.” ______________________________________</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my theory, it&#39;s not like these fuckers can go around naming their CP videos with generic names because they would get caught straight away, they can&#39;t name their videos in a way that you or I could think of searching.</p>

<p>The random strings in the comments are probably a way for the user to bookmark a video without leaving a trace, so they leave a unique set of characters that they can probably write down or save in a notepad. So they can quickly search the string on google and only ever get the intended results, probably makes it safer to store and easier to share with the added benefit of confusing people into think its bots.</p>

Wheres the proof?
The videos I&#39;m imagining you&#39;re talking about are those crappy spiderman-elsa-joker PREGNANT THOR?! videos?
I thought they recieved a DMCA ages ago, alternatively if they haven&#39;t recieved one and are still watching then that means these videos are still up.
It also means then that these comments, in some form, must still be up.
If you are going to post a &quot;HUGE development&quot; on something, you must then provide verifiable proof (Not media verifiable, but facts that the regular joe (you and me) can go and check.)
If that is not the case, then where was this information given to you? This is a conspiracy subreddit, I&#39;ll be honest if your source is &quot;anonymous&quot;, then I&#39;ll be the first to call bullshit.</p>

<p>Until the criteria above is filled, this falls under a conspiracy theory. Not a conspiracy.</p>

They are all closeups of children. Children writhing around on couches, twerking(the twerking one is obviously a pre-teen girl), crawling around on all fours &quot;playing&quot;. </p>

<p>One was an adult woman with just her face being filmed from a strange angle. She appeared to be in some sort of distress. </p>

<p>They are all ads. Ads for people.</p>

<p>And this is just Brazil. Each region seems to have a different &quot;style&quot;. There look to be &quot;cartels&quot; from Ukraine/Russia, SE Asia, and what looks to be a mediterranean vacation spot.</p>

<p>And then there is that dam FREAK DADDY who has his daughters dressing up as &quot;bad babies&quot;(this seems to be a universal term in this game) and doing the most disgusting food fetish shit you can imagine, probably right around the corner from me.  One of his sickest videos is where one of his daughters drinks from a bottle, rolls her eyes back in her head in ecstacy, and &quot;spits up&quot; all over the &quot;babysitter&quot;. </p>

<p>These are  juvenile girls . . . </p>

<p>The videos themselves are not outright explicit, but they are quite suggestive, even if done totally innocently for the fun of the video. The fact that many of the kety-mety videos have very, very low view-counts attests to the fact that only when the girls accidentally get into revealing positions, etc., do the pedophiles emerge to view. However, if you look at the screenshots for the recommended bar, you&#39;ll see that the suggestive, revealing positions are the ones advertised . . . IDK anymore, man. I just don&#39;t know </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched one of the weird cartoon videos, its a ring of channels all subbed to each other, and each video has comments by people trying to appear normal like &quot;My son loves watching this!&quot;. But every account I looked at was clearly a fake, with the only account activity being subscriptions to the other weird cartoon channels.</p>

<p>If you were making nonsense to get ad revenue, you would make clickbait title compilations with fake thumbnails. I see them a lot.</p>

<p>This is something else entirely. The content of the cartoons is too weird and sexual..one cartoon had a girl tearing off another girls dress and her crying about it and trying to cover he chest. It wasn&#39;t funny, it was just weird and bizarre.</p>
