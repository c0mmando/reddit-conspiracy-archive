        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last night our family rented Beauty &amp; the Beast.  I couldn&#39;t sit through more than 15 minutes of it.  My 6 year old daughter stopped watching 10 minutes after me.  We just thought it was that bad.  Visually and attention to detail were great, but the movie was just boring.   So what&#39;s the conspiracy?   The numbers.</p>

<p>Beauty &amp; the Beast 2017 is the #8 highest grossing movie of all time.  Whaaat?  Who&#39;s watching it?   There is no excitement in the movie like there was for movies like Frozen.   We all remember hearing little girls singing let it go for years.  I&#39;ve yet to hear any kids talking about or singing any beauty &amp; the beast songs, but we&#39;re supposed to believe that this movie sold better than Frozen, or Moana, or even most of the star wars movies?</p>

<p>So why would Disney report the movie did better than it did?  Number 1, the budget to make the movie.  $300 million dollars.  Can&#39;t let shareholders know it was a flop.  Possible number 2 motive is the &quot;gay&quot; scene.  Bob Iger is a hard core democrat with political motivations and is one of those people that would like to start having gay disney characters and showing large box office revenues for this &quot;gay friendly movie&quot; seems like something he would do, but that part is just speculation.</p>

<p>Money is where it&#39;s at though.  Disney has recently said their park attendance has been going down, yet its just as packed as ever if you go there.  I&#39;m suspect they are under reporting attendance(because that will make more people want to go to disneyland/world) and over reporting box office tickets and just kind of moving the money around.</p>

<p>Example.   Say attendance at disney is up 5%, but they report it&#39;s down 1 or 2%.  Thats 7% of park revenue income that can be &quot;faked&quot; as Beauty and the Beast ticket sales.   Disney makes about $1 billion per week in revenue.  It would not be hard to move money from one area and into another.  As long as the accounting adds up and there is no missing money, nobody is going to check really hard.</p>

<p>But whatever is going on, I&#39;m sure Beauty and beast numbers are being fudged somehow.  Very likely to cover their ass on the $300 million they wasted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen it yet, but was planning on renting it soon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you in that I have not heard good things about it. Certainly not as popular as Frozen, as you said.</p>

<p>Not sure if they are fudging their profit numbers or not.</p>

<p>Totally off the subject, but did you see the live action Cinderella in 2015? I LOVED that one! I bought the DVD, which is unusual for me.  :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The movie is bizarre. Belle was autotuned, that toady of Gaston was weird and acted in strange homoerotic ways, and the race thing just irks me. I do not mind when there are others races in say a Shakespeare play, but lately it just seems more of the same desensitization for racial homogenization that supports the continuing incoming of illegal aliens into western nations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The autotuning was horrible. Its not my kind of film anyway but i watched it with the missus. I work in music so she is aware of what bad autotuning sounds like and she picked up on it immediately. </p>

<p>Emma Watson should have been overdubbed with a better singer.. actually the part should have went to a more talented individual in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My daughter and I rented it Thursday night and both thought it was a great movie.  So did her friends who saw it. And frankly I&#39;m tired of hearing &quot;beauty and the beast&quot; sang in an tweens&#39; high pitched voice.</p>

<p>I personally felt there was a strong lesson about not judging a book by its cover or broken down even further, that those who look like us are the threat not the big, scary monster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t like the movie, so there&#39;s no way it could have done well&quot; is not a great reason to assume a conspiracy is at play. Unless you have actual numbers or something other than your opinion of how good a movie is or how crowded a theme park is, this theory is baseless.</p>

<p>PS. I loved the movie and so did all of my family and friends. Maybe some people just have different tastes than you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing though...when a movie does well, you generally hear non-stop talk about it.  I didn&#39;t care too much for Avatar, but when it came out, everyone was talking about it, so I understand it did well domestically.  I&#39;ve heard nothing about Beauty &amp; the beast after it came out.  I mean I heard the whole &quot;gay moment&quot; talk before the movie came out, but after it came out, not so much talk about how &quot;good&quot; it was.</p>

<p>Even on Reddit, when a movie does well, you&#39;ll see references to it in every sub.  Sometimes even new memes are born.   With Beauty...nothing.</p>

<p>After I wrote this post I went to walmart to pick up some things.  I decided to check the girls section to see how much beauty and the beast stuff they had.  They had shelf space for 2 dolls.  I shit you not.   2 dolls only!  Nothing else.   Wonder Woman had its own display in the center aisle.   Beauty did have a display in the center aisle selling the DVD and either they just restocked it or nobody was buying.   Right next to it was the lego batman movie which looked to be a little more empty than beauty. </p>

<p>Something is definitely up with this movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the movie actually released in theatre products were everywhere. The store I work at set up an entire display for the release of the film (we sell movies) along with all the Funko Pop figures and dress up items.</p>

<p>Again, unless you have something other than your opinion of &quot;how things should be&quot; then there is no reason to believe a conspiracy is going on.</p>

<p>Your experience is not shared by everyone.</p>

<p>And I know at least 6 of my friends went to see it too, none of them went alone and only 2 went together. The numbers don&#39;t really jump out to me as a problem.  </p>

<p>The singing of the songs thing came after they bought the soundtrack or had seen the movie so many times once it came out for purchase.  Plus the songs in beauty and the beast aren&#39;t really as good for small kids singability right off the bat.  Longer, harder, not specifically designed with toddlers in mind, etc.</p>

<p>At least you didn&#39;t claim it was PG related...that must be the last level of insanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will allow you to your opinion. Would you allow me to mine? </p>

<p>A lot of people newly coming to (and even some old hands) the wide world of conspiracy and truth seeing see conspiracy in every thing. </p>

<p>Shit movies aside, who cares if Disney is moving money around. Unless they are giving it to a country bombing children, I don&#39;t give a fuck. </p>

<p>And neither should you</p>

<p>What your brain just fired on about for a few paragraphs is a great example of time horribly wasted. (and my time responding to you)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your example is flawed considering Disney is a publicly traded company, thus it wouldn&#39;t have the ability to mislead the public through such footnote disclosures without incurring massive costs to its reputation.</p>

<p>We also need to consider the effects of foreign ticket sales, which as I understand, are the essential drivers of the sequel/product-made-film/superhero/remake based movie industry that has come to fruition in the last few decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The autotuning was horrible. Its not my kind of film anyway but i watched it with the missus. I work in music so she is aware of what bad autotuning sounds like and she picked up on it immediately. </p>

<p>Emma Watson should have been overdubbed with a better singer.. actually the part should have went to a more talented individual in the first place. </p>

<p>Absolute piss.</p>

<p>Again, unless you have something other than your opinion of &quot;how things should be&quot; then there is no reason to believe a conspiracy is going on.</p>
