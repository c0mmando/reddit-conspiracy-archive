       So if you've heard of Liberia, you've probably heard of Charles Taylor. He was a bloodthirsty dictator, educated in the U.S., and helped overthrow a guy named William Tolbert the president of Liberia in favor of a relatively benevolent guy named Samuel Doe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, Taylor fell out of favor for stealing money and storing it overseas, fled to the U.S., but was arrested and held for extradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/07/27/the-devil-they-know">
        Taylor was arrested by U.S. marshals in Somerville, Massachusetts, and he spent sixteen months in jail while his lawyer, Ramsey Clark, fought his extradition.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where the sketchy part begins. TAYLOR ESCAPED JAIL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow, through some stroke of "magic", ended up in Africa, being trained by Gaddafi.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does a former Liberian government official escape from jail while waiting extradition, and then miraculously end up in Africa learning the art of warfare?
      </p>
      <p>
       Charles Taylor himself said his escape was facilitated by the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/world/africa/18taylor.html">
        He told his judges that he did not escape on his own; rather, he said, he was helped by the Central Intelligence Agency.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/world/africa/18taylor.html">
        Soon afterward, he said, a guard, a supervisor, came to tell him he might be freed, but asked if he would be able to leave the United States quickly. “He verified my passport,” Mr. Taylor said.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/world/africa/18taylor.html">
        “One evening about 10, he came and opened my cell, it was during lockdown time,” Mr. Taylor went on. “Then he escorted me from the maximum security side through several gates to the minimum security side.” Two other men were waiting. “We got to the windows,” he said. “These guys took a sheet. We tied it on the bars. We came down and got over the fence.” A car with two men was waiting outside, he went on. “They had instructions to take me as far as New York, where I wanted to go.” His car, he said, was “a kind of secure car, a kind of government car,” he said. The drivers insisted he stay inside, rather than join his wife’s car, to avoid being stopped by state troopers, he continued. “I did not pay any money,” he said. “I did not know the guys who picked me up.”
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A little while later he overthrew the Liberian government and began systemic genocide.

       To be fair, massive government ops can be as simple as getting the right man in the right place. I would keep doing legwork on it and share whatever you find. This is certainly something interesting.

       You've found a brilliant example of the early CIA's activities ...
      </p>
      <p>
       To a small group of those "in the know", the CIA was known to some people as "Capitalism's Invisible Army' ... which this event
       <em>
        shows
       </em>
       that it clearly was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'economic hitmen' who have come forward since have collaborated the Truth of such events!
      </p>
      <p>
       The Middle East has been a hotly sought after arean since the beginning of the 20th century, both for it's oil resources
       <em>
        and also
       </em>
       it's "strategic significane" as countries like Yemen became post WW2
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the (True) story is still coming out

       Great stuff bro!

      <p>
       You are an example of exactly the type of person who 'discovers' such information, which, at the time, was probably of no consequence to the 'average American' and so wasn't considered 'newsworthy'
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT then there's the pov that 'back then' it was far easier for TPTB to do such things with impunity and
       <em>
        even if
       </em>
       they were 'caught' I'm sure they had 'plausibly deniable' cover stories
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism's Invisible Army shows how it's able to flex some of it's  "muscle"

       It doesn't go unnoticed to some.  It goes unnoticed to you though.  And to me.  And to a lot of us.  Why?  Because generally speaking a lot of the information most of us get is through the msm channels - and those channels happen to be controlled by the very powers that set Mr. Taylor free.

       Can someone please point me to something unambiguously good that the CIA has done? Why are they so venerated in the US when I only ever hear about them in the context of super shady operations that don't seem to be in the interest of the American public?

       Because of their massive influence over the media.  Uncritical consumers of CIA-influenced media (meaning many Americans sadly) unconsciously absorb the manufactured pro-CIA memes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, many people see right through this, but they are not represented in MSM, so it's hard to know exactly how venerated they really are any more.

       That genuinely makes me wonder what other elements of modern American culture might not be the organic trends we think they are but deliberate propaganda efforts. Totally speculating, but that immediately made me think of reality TV, which from the beginning of its rise to dominance in the late 1990s was widely disliked (at least according to just about everyone I knew), but watched anyway because it's so addictive. And meanwhile, maybe it trains us to accept highly produced, implausible scenarios chock full of blatant emotional manipulation as "real". Hmm.....

       Its not a major topic of interest for me, but it seems to me that CIA meddling worldwide after WWII allowed the US to enjoy decades of unchallenged prosperity.

       You posted that in another comment but I'll respond here cuz why not...all of it.  I'm like 99% sure the concept of 'organic trends' is complete fantasy.

       The most popular music doesn't become popular because people like it...it becomes popular because its played over and over alongside massive marketing campaigns.  It becomes popular because producers know what people want to hear.  Check out
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Martin">
        this guy
       </a>
       .  Have you ever heard of him?  For 20 years people have fallen in love w/ artists whose success was built on this man's (and a few other's like him) work.  You think Katy Perry would exist as a celebrity artist without him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Movies aren't blockbusters because they're legitimately better than other movies (though they might be), but because of an entire marketing industry that knows what you like because they've been making everything you've liked for your entire life.  The most recent 2 star wars movies are great examples...bland movies that everyone w/in their target demographic goes nuts for because producers know what their demographic wants to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've kind of gone on a tangent here because I can't tie either of these to CIA propaganda, but the point is that no part of modern culture is natural or organic.

       Read the CIA and the intelligence cult.

      <p>
       The have very good analysts that give lots of Intel to the DOD, the book says a lot if their work in the clandestine portion is meh, but a lot of their data collections through mostly technology is pretty beneficial. They also developed the spy plane, and the SR71 was originally a CIA project until the AF took the project and renamed it. But their work in the clandestine services is all pretty bad shit.

       Yeah, it's really mind-boggling to me that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is thought to be possibly the richest country on Earth in natural resources, but is also the poorest country in the world in actual wealth, and completely torn apart by non-stop conflict. Have to wonder how much of that is just because there's so much conflict to gain control of resources, and how much external forces might be promoting that conflict because they'd consider a prosperous independent Congo to be an economic threat.

       The European powers drew the borders of all of these countries, many of which contradicted centuries old tribal borders, which resulted in renewed tribal conflict, often supported and promoted by the same european powers.  That set the stage for the decades of conflict and instability that has racked so much of the continent.  The US is a relatively new player in Africa and is doing just fine keeping with the old script.

       Race is often brought in places it doesn't belong, but it's pretty hard to refute the fact that race was a major factor in European colonialism exploiting the fuck out of Africa. I mean, Apartheid.

       True, there's plenty of nuance when you get into the details, but if you were to summarize the last ~4 centuries of African history in one overarching trend, it would be exploitation by white people. China's involvement is more recent, and I would argue not nearly as devastating.

       Yet. China has bought half of Africa from Africa. It's early days but expect huge ramifications in the next couple of decades.

       True. It's definitely something to watch with caution. I'm tentatively optimistic about it though, tbh. China seems to be prioritizing developing infrastructure in Africa, so here's hoping it will be mutually beneficial. I've been saying for ages that it's totally crazy how Western aid to Africa seems to mostly come in the form of just giving them stuff and creating dependence instead of developing the necessary infrastructure to help them develop toward independence and prosperity. I mean, I don't want people to starve to death, but people talk like sending food and clothing to the needy children in Africa is just the kindest thing you could do, when it's got all these awful ripple effects, like making local agriculture and businesses non-competitive...
      </p>
      <p>
       Promoting education, fighting diseases, and buying African-made goods are causes I can fully get behind to help the continent develop, but infrastructure is really key, and something we seem to ignore...

       Nah China have been sneaky. They are building infrastructure and taking land and minerals as payment. This will work out to be a terrible deal for Africa long term. Sure they get roads today but China gets their wealth and food tomorrow.

       Well, we'll see. I'm cautious of condemning them too strongly/prematurely for it in part because there's an obvious propaganda motive for the West to cast whatever China does in a negative light, since they do represent a major threat to US/EU economic supremacy. I mean, I know China isn't some benevolent patron -- they're putting their own interests first. But it seems like they're doing a hell of a lot more that might actually help Africa develop than the United States and other Western countries have by a long shot. To be frank, I sincerely wonder if the West has been cultivating African dependency on purpose, and China sees a strategic advantage in strengthening African countries as legitimate allies instead of just sticking to exploiting them like we've been doing for centuries. I'm not on Team China here, staying critical, but infrastructure development is a very big deal.

       You have to have roads to get the resources out. Same thing the US does when "developing infrastructure". Hopefully they're building more than roads.

       Building infrastructure implies they plan on staying. If they were just going to rob the resources and leave, they wouldn't need much infrastructure beyond what it takes to get the stuff back to port.

        I made a short comic book story about Charles Taylor
       </a>
       and his business deal with Pat Robertson that talks about some of this.  I find it highly suspicious that Taylor changed his statement in court to say he was not helped by the CIA, though no reasonable explanation on how he managed escaped in the most classical (and predictable) way ever by filing out the bars in a window and climbing down a rope made of sheets.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might add at this point that covert activity in Africa has increased dramatically over the past few years and now that members of "The Fellowship" aka "the Family" aka "The Christian Mafia" are in the White House, they have an infrastructure in place to ramp up their resource wars via proxy.  Seriously, it's already been happening, but largely ignored by the international media, and it's about to get worse.

       CIA were the ones that helped catch Nelson Mandela.

       Both Mandela and current president Jacob Zuma are high ranking freemasons. Zuma was told as a child he would be president of the country one day.

       S.Africa had a surveillance system in place since the 80's or so. And I firmly believe apartheid was a test run of a police-state.

       Just read about this today, but according to Taylor's ally
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Johnson">
        Prince Johnson
       </a>
       Charles Taylor was behind the 1987 coup d'etat which saw Burkina Faso's Marxist-Leninist leader
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sankara">
        Thomas Sankara

       overthrown. Blaise Compaore killed him and reversed nearly everything he had done (he had actually made a lot of progress with the country) and ruled with an iron fist for the next 27 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it's just a coincidence though, am I right? I'm sure the CIA totally didn't target Sankara, even though he's both a socialist and pan-Africanist and their policy around the world has been to remove such from power at nearly any cost...
