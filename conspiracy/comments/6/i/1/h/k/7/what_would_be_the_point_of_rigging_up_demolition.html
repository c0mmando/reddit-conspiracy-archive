        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, lets say the US government planned 9/11 as a false flag against it&#39;s own people in order to justify going into Iraq, pass the patriot act and pay a ton of money to defense contractors.</p>

<p>They apparently went all out, wanting to create a huge psychological impact, by flying two airlines into two giant buildings and a third into the pentagon.  The towers collapse, thousands die, the country is in terror, patriotism goes up to an all time high and people are calling for immediate military action, all before 11:00 am.  Looks like the false flag operation was a complete success!</p>

<p>Why the heck would they then activate planted demolition charges on another building that wasn&#39;t struck by a plane?  Were the 3 plane crashes and the WTC collapsing not enough?  Like if they didn&#39;t blow up tower 7, would the American people not have accepted the Patriot act?  Would the defense industry not have made a ton of money by going to Iraq?  Of course not. Collapsing tower 7 after the events that unfolded that morning was extremely insignificant.  It was so insignificant a lot of people don&#39;t even remember it happened, it was like an after thought that day.  After seeing jets crash into skyscrapers a building collapsing from a fire is kind of mundane.</p>

<p>Why risk getting caught by doing this extra unnecessary attack that is completely different from the airliner hijack attacks?  Planting those demolition charges is just putting extra evidence out there and involving more people that could potentially reveal the whole thing.</p>

<p>Here is what I think happened. </p>

<p>The Port Authority installed giant gas and oil tanks in WTC 7, that violated codes.  There was evidence that the gas lines were compromised, as evidenced by the flames coming out of WTC 7.   This had the potential to destroy the building, however the damage would involve quite a bit of local real-estate.  To limit this damage, the building was brought down into its own footprint. There were multiple lawsuits against the Port Authority, and Silverstein, that were under seal. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.wtc7.net/articles/elitewatch_7wtc.html">http://www.wtc7.net/articles/elitewatch_7wtc.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All the evidence that we stored at 7 World Trade, in all our cases, went down with the building,&quot; according to US Secret Service Special Agent David Curran -- the number three guy in that office. &quot;We lost our network, we lost all our computers, we lost all the equipment that we use as Secret Service Agents. Everything from machine guns to our shotguns to our electronic equipment that we use.&quot;. More destruction insured that Larry Silverstein and his backers, the president of the new York Federal Reserve, Peter G.  Peterson got to replace all 7 buildings at insurance rate payers expense. Thus saving the 2 billion that would have had to be spent to demolish the two main towers  which had been quietly condemned and were scheduled to be demolished by 2007.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t corroborate but the claim is that all of the backup files pertaining to the 2.3 trillion dollars missing at the Pentagon were also  in building 7. It seems highly plausible.</p>

<p>Follow the money,</p>

<p>Rather than costing 2 billion for demolitions  the  elite criminals received 2 billion and got the largest three buildings turned into roughly 30 ft. pieces ready to be loaded onto trucks. The other 4 buildings were also a total loos for insurance purposes.  Imagine that, 2 planes  completely destroyed  all seven buildings.</p>

<p>By now we all know that military exercises have &#39;coincidentally&#39; happened  of the same incidents at the same time and place of most of out national tragedies. There were many exercises of the 9/11 events going on on the morning of 9/11. One exercise involved  at least 4 members of an ordinance disposal company  who were sitting outside the towers at a deli and when the first plane crashed (like something made of butter) they went to their appointment at building 7, some 7 hours later the building suffered a near free fall collapse. These guys working for &#39;VIP&#39;s within the Executive Branch, at this ordinance company,</p>

<p>More likely though is that Silverstein insisted that WTC7 be demolished along with everything else to that complete destruction of the whole WTC complex was assured. That way he gets all the insurance money, and the ability to re-build the entire complex without spending billions on demolition. </p>

<p>I personally think that the impact of the plane on WTC1 was supposed to initiate the demolition, and as the North Tower was coming down, the planners would demolish WTC7. That way it would look like debris from WTC1 &quot;took out&quot; 7. This being the first attack, the only record would be the Naudet footage.</p>

<p>Imagine how differently things would have been if the Twin Towers had collapsed upon the impact of the planes...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Building 7 was brought down to destroy documents proving crimes committed by the FBI, NSA, and SEC. It was also demolished in order to cover up the evidence of how towers 1&amp;2 were made to collapse onto their own footprints. I speculate that there were underground tunnels connecting all of the towers in the WTC complex. There was a large amount of gold removed from a vault in the basement of one of the main towers right before the first &quot;plane&quot; hit. Building 7 <em>had</em> to be brought down. They just thought we would be dumb enough to believe it was due to fires.. laughable!</p>

<p>If there were so many documents proving that the FBI, NSA and SEC are guilty why aren&#39;t these agencies being held accountable?  If you and hundreds of other redditors just &quot;know&quot; these documents were there, what about the federal investigators?  Do they also know that the documents were there?</p>

<p>There were also no copies of these documents anywhere else?  Nothing was backed up securely off site?</p>

<p>The shitty little businesses I worked at in 2001 had off-site backup and disaster recovery procedures to protect important data just in case their office building was destroyed in an earthquake or fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we don&#39;t know for <em>certain</em> that the documents were there; however, we know that building 7 housed the offices of intelligence agencies and the SEC. What do you think the likelihood is that they had some important documents and computers in those offices?</p>

<p>You mentioned copies of the documents. You asked &quot;were there no copies of these documents?&quot;. The answer to that question is &quot;yes&quot;. There were copies of those documents. They were located in the Pentagon, exactly where we were told a &quot;plane&quot; crashed into it on 9/11. The offices that were destroyed in the attack on the Pentagon were where the copies of the documents were stored. Does that make a little more sense now?</p>

<p>This is why none of these agencies have been held accountable. This is why the federal investigators couldn&#39;t get anywhere (not that they were trying to in the first place).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SEC and intelligence agencies have offices/datacenters all over the country.  Why would I assume specific documents about a specific case where in that office?  You are saying this is evidence gathered by a federal investigation against the SEC and the agencies?  Whoever is conducting that investigation would probably have the evidence and in more that one place.  </p>

<p>Regarding the physical nature of this evidence… we aren’t talking about a manilla folder full of papers.  We aren’t even talking about a room full of boxes full of manilla folders.  A huge case/investigation like this is gathered by many different law firms, agencies and data processors. The documents and information these groups gather for a case like this is composed of financial transactions, emails, phone records, taped testimony, prior court records etc..  This information is extremely distributed and most if not all of it is electronically stored and has been way before 2001.  If that information was gathered via federal subpena at one point, couldn&#39;t it be gathered again?</p>

<p>To me it’s pretty obvious that it’s just another example of people putting together a narrative that matches whatever evidence is before them.  Of course the locations targeted in the attacks had important government and financial agencies, that’s why those locations were the targets.  That makes it so easy to just say the evidence for whatever conspiracy theory you want happened to be in those offices.  People just tack on whatever idea they want to involve, I’ve heard those offices contained proof of everything including Enron, zionist conspiracies, Bush family secrets and aliens.</p>
