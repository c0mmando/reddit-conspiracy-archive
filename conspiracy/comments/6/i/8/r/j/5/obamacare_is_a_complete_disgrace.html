       This program is a gigantic catastrophe. These idiots at customer service have no power to do anything. They can't even reset a fucking password. For the last 5 years, I have been sending shit back and forth through the mail. They put my card on auto-charge and repeatedly cancel my insurance for non-payment even though its on auto charge. They can't discuss anything over the phone. They have no power to fix anything. They drop the ball all the time. The insurance is expensive as hell. 80% of the places I go to don't even accept the insurance anymore. When one does accept it, I pay about $550 for a short visit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a problem of stupidy. Its a problem of corruption. They are now targeting functioning systems. Instead of fixing it, they make it worst and then throw up their hands and say, "Oh whoops". As long as these fuckers get kickbacks from corporations, they are happy even if it means ruining 300 million Americans health insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't even have an alternative to choose from anymore.

       Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism:
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for capitalism to generate greater profits than the home market can yield, the merging of banks and industrial cartels produces finance capitalismâ€”the exportation and investment of capital to countries with underdeveloped economies. In turn, such financial behaviour leads to the division of the world among monopolist business companies and the great powers. Moreover, in the course of colonizing undeveloped countries, business and government eventually will engage in geopolitical conflict over the economic exploitation of large portions of the geographic world and its populaces. Therefore, imperialism is the highest (advanced) stage of capitalism, requiring monopolies (of labour and natural-resource exploitation) and the exportation of finance capital (rather than goods) to sustain colonialism, which is an integral function of said economic model. Furthermore, in the capitalist homeland, the super-profits yielded by the colonial exploitation of a people and their economy permit businessmen to bribe native politicians, labour leaders and the labour aristocracy (upper stratum of the working class) to politically thwart worker revolt (labour strike).

       So true!  One of my employees was recently talking about her federal tax return and asked me if I had got my check yet... I told her I don't get a check from the IRS, I send them one! She didn't believe me!  She had no idea that actual people paid taxes into the Federal government!  Mind blowing!

       We have so much in common! Nice to meet you! My husband owned his own business. So I know all about paying taxes and not getting anything back.

       Because of Obamacare, my husband was forced to sell his business last year (before he ended up going bankrupt).

       I worked hard up until the moment some crack head hit me with a car. You are boiling my existence down and know nothing about the circumstance. Therefore you're rendered ignorant on the subject. We still pay taxes. I'm a stay at home dad and as soon as my doctor says go, believe me, I'll be out there making sure people like you aren't in positions of power anymore.

       I am a small business owner.

      <p>
       I have one employee- so very small.
      </p>
      <p>
       I make money off his labor bc it's the way it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any time, he can take the skills I've taught him and start his own business doing the same Thing- in competition with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as I pay him enough to survive on and save the seed money for equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I can just NOT pay him enough for all that, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, Use my excess profit off of him to bribe local government officials and change the laws so he can't ever create a competition for me.

       Yes, you are right. I was not raised in a family that took government assistance for anything. I was raised that if you needed something, you got a job. If that job wasn't enough, then I worked two jobs at times. I'm tired of my tax dollars paying for people to sit on their butts!

       This argument is fucking retarded because minimum wage has not scaled with inflation. Sometimes two jobs still isn't enough because capitalism allows employers to be greedy as fucking possible and pay as little as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've worked two jobs at a time before and it was hard work, but it paid off. I stopped going to school so I could provide for a family my disabled girlfriend and I had begun. Now I've thankfully worked hard enough that I don't make two minimum wage jobs and I pay my share of taxes in the hopes nobody else will ever suffer through that hell again.
