       Yeah, I think this is the freedom that countries cling to that aren't under the financial slavery of the Rothschilds. Our politicians in the West are trying to keep us all under wraps, but since the internet has allowed us all to learn and communicate at levels not seen in the past, we are becoming significantly more aware of what is happening within our countries, and that is why people like Theresa May want to control the internet.

       If everything is supposedly controlled by the illuminati/Rothschilds/Zionist, you would expect a power grab at some point.  Psychopaths don't generally keep their word.  There is no honor amongst thieves.

       The Rothschilds have been at this since the early 1800s, at least. Hpw many coup attemps have happend, failed, and been erased? Who has the capacity to mount a serious challenge?

       Is he doing this so that he can survive within the Zionist dominated echelons? Or is he legit sold out? I know his son in law is a Jew, but maybe Jared is a double agent. Or Trump is keeping his enemies really close?

       JFK started silver-backed dollars and wanted to pull out of Vietnam.  He had many, many enemies.  I am not saying zionists took control immediately, but then again, LBJ was more than happy to cover up the USS liberty, even if he wasn't directly involved beforehand.  Its been a slow process of infiltration at every level, especially banking and media.  If you want to really read a book that blows your mind, read JFK &amp; the Unspeakable.

       Yeah I heard that America was actually about to end poverty at one time, and then LBJ started the Welfare State which actually perpetuated it. I'll have to check out that book. Im sure most of the infiltration happened when McCarthy was being ridiculed for his Red Scare, we know now from the Verona Documents that the communists did infiltrate the American government and Academia.

       You won't regret reading that book.  In fact, you can listen to some talks the author gave on youtube.  His name is James Douglass iirc.  He'll tell you things you never knew about JFK.  He really wanted to make the world a better place, and the powers that be couldn't stand that.

       I'll have to dig later this evening, but some solid Israeli news sites were not convinced he'll help thw zionists. He snubbed Bibi by mot letting him photo op with him by the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, (not in the article) his beloved daughter believed in her marriage enough to convert; there are plenty of less supportive parents that don't accept much less support their adult kids' choices. Trump maybe,
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       has inklings of support for Jews that might not mean zionists get what they want. I foster this as a hopeful thought, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to let Trump off the hook, just some alternative filters that may merit consideration.

       It's ok. An important lesson to learn: don't trust authority. If Trump was ever "our guy", he got turned real fucking fast. We will only win by converting individuals into free-thinkers who don't rely on someone else to fix their problems.

       Remember that a goal by the same people you're implicating is the destruction of America as we know it. Working nicely. We're in a "slow kill" and the coming cultural/economic upheaval will cap off the poisoning from every direction. We're too medicated and stupid to fight back, and they might even add in a good ol' "natural disaster" for good measure.

       Do you mean the Rothschilds or the three countries in conflict? Im sure they both want to see America tank, but I definitely agree, it's a real shame.
