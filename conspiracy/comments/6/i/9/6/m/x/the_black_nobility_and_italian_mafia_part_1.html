        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Vittorio Emanuele IV is the Prince of Naples and has a residence in Geneva Switzerland. The Savoy family governed Geneva for a period of time in service to the Vatican. The Genovese crime family take their name from Vito Genovese who was born in a Naples commune just as Vittorio is the Prince of Naples. Genovese is a surname for someone from Genoa Italy or from Geneva Switzerland. Genoa or Genova in Italian is the same word as Geneva is Swiss. Prince Vittorio is married to Princess Marina Doria who was born in Switzerland. The Doria family were one of the most powerful banking families in Genoa for centuries. The Savoy family put the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in power who established the Vatican as a sovereign nation through the Lateran Treaty of 1929. The Vatican was tied with the mafia during the P2 Masonic loge scandal. </p>

<p>Prince Vittorio is the hidden owner of the Genovese crime family which have infiltrated Wall Street and are extorting businessmen in the United States. Donald Trump used the Genovese owned S&amp;A Concrete to build his condos in Manhattan. Trump used Roy Cohn as an attorney who also worked for the former mafia bosses Tony Salerno and John Gotti. Donald Trump purchased property from the mafia hitman Salvatore Testa to build his casino in Atlantic City. The Italian Mafia have always controlled Atlantic City and use the casinos to launder their personal profits. Donald Trump is a front man for the Five Families of New York City which are controlled by the Italian Nobility. Ivana Trump dated Prince Roffredo Gaetani. The Gaetani-D&#39;Aquila-D&#39;Aragona family of Italy covertly own the Gambino crime family and one of its original bosses was named Salvatore D&#39;Aquila.</p>

<p>Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV has numerous criminal charges against him including murder, association with organized crime, corruption, and exploitation of prostitution. He tends to get off on all his charges though. Prince Vittorio was also a member of the P2 Masonic Lodge which was involved with the Vatican, Italian government, Italian media, and organized crime like the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari fascist paramilitary group and Banda della Magliana or Magliana Mafia. The Massimo family created the Banda della Magliana and NAR to take over the City of Rome. Massimo Carminati who was nicknamed &quot;The last King of Rome&quot; was a member of the NAR and Magliana Mafia. Don Fabrizio Massimo-Brancaccio runs the modern day Roman Mafia or Casamonica Clan as well as most of the Sicilian Mafia. Much of the Sicilian Mafia was established in the neighborhood of Brancaccio in Palermo Sicily just as Don Fabrizio&#39;s name is Massimo-Brancaccio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prince Nicolo Boncompagni Ludovisi is a high level authority in Rome and an owner of the Italian Mafia. The Boncompagni coat of arms has a golden dragon on it. Gold and dragons are symbols for imperialism. Pope Gregory XIII or Ugo Boncompagni purchased the Duchy of Sora for his family to govern over. The Ludovisi family ruled over Venosa. The Casalesi Mafia in Italy have influences in Sora and one of their factions was ran by a man named Raffaele Venosa. The founder of the Casalesi Mafia Clan was from Caserta right near Sora. Prince Nicolo Boncompagni Ludovisi is an owner of the Casalesi Clan. The name Bon-Compagni means &quot;Good Company&quot; or &quot;Good Fellows&quot; since Compagno can be translated to fellow. Boncompagni is where the term Goodfellas derives from which means a gangster or member of the Italian Mafia. They made a major Hollywood movie glorifying the Italian Mafia called Goodfellas.</p>
