       We are about to start a needless war with Russia for Israel's benefit.  We've got no business in Syria.  How many wars are enough until the american public tires of this?  General Wesley Clark was obviously telling the truth when he said it would be

       and it's all for Israel!

      <p>
       I'm really fucking sick of this shit.  This country doesn't invest in itself or its people.  We are constantly lied to, and won't even ensure people have clean drinking water.  Meanwhile we send billions to a tiny country that is already wealthy enough to have a national health care system.  A tiny country that is of no benefit to  the the people of the USA.  Our members of congress are traitors.

       Just ready yourself in your mind to march. That's all you have to worry about so that when we have enough ready people, we go in there and boot them out.

       Not enough citizens are even aware this is occurring so the politicians don't have to make a choice when representing them.  If the majority of voters were aware and wanted to see Israel dry up into nothing, then the politicians would begin pandering to them on that side of the issue.

       The jews have done such a great job of brainwashing people that the thought about questioning Israel is expelled by the subconscious mind before it can even enter the conscious mind.

       Even the gefiltefishes have been brainwashed. That is why you have kids combing reddit and calling everyone an anti-Semite if they have sincere questions about the gefiltesharks' illegal activities.

       It isnt all Jews, it is the wealthy ones. Jewish culture drills the Israel first idea into their heads from an early age. Many of them are savvy enough to see through it and realize that they are being used as pawns. Hell, I knew a Jewish guy who adamantly believed that Hitler was really a Zionist plant whose real objective was the creation of Israel.

       Aĺl true. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney says she was required to sign a loyalty pledge TO ISRAEL  to get endorsed as a candidate, and this is required of everyone. The congress is bought and paid for. There may be no way for the US as we know it to escape this situation.

       I think Rand Paul went too far when he surrounded himself with rabbis to prove that he was kosher. Influence is supposed to be covert, not overt! But how else to change the perception that you may not be a friend of israel? I personally think he should have tried to go around the lobby, not through it. Guess he was trying to avoid the poisonous media coverage his dad got. Unfortunately he also avoided the nomination!
