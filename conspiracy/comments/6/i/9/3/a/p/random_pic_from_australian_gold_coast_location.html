       Look at this pic.. it looks like there is no fish eye lens but not sure. The sky is so clear so it looks like the visibility is very far. Does anyone know exactly where this spot is to see if it shows spherical Earth definitively?
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be a slightly wide angle lens causing distortion though..
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Even if this pic is distorted from a wide angle lens I think this would be a great location to look for curvature because of the features in this location. Look at the way the buildings radiate outward rather than going vertically straight. The distance looks great enough to see some distortion from earth curvature plus it's on the coast and the land looks very flat.

       When I first started hearing that people actually believed in Flat Earth it was a joke. You could tell by the way people were talking it was tongue and cheek. But they had to say it with a straight face or ruin the joke. Apparently idiots started listening to them and took it seriously.

       Sadly, I am starting to thing the less educated among us are starting to believe in it all (and guessing most of them are younger).

      <p>
       I get the larping from people wanting attention or to troll (and trolls are attention seekers as well) but have seen more and more people buying into it. I think some people want to remain ignorant and it makes them feel 'special' to see the world in a silly way, like they have some secret knowledge that makes their life have meaning. Sad.

       Interesting analogy. Take any object and put it on that beach ball, let's say a LEGO man. If this LEGO man looked at the horizon, would he be looking straight out, as in eye level? Or would he be looking at a slight downward angle? Now slowly raise this little man up and away from the ball to simulate climbing in altitude. Would he be able to look straight out to see the horizon, or would he need to constantly lower his gaze in all directions as altitude increased?
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how big of a sphere, if you were to stand on it, by nature of it being spherical, the horizon would
       <em>
        curve
       </em>
       down and away in every direction, no matter the size of the sphere. If you can stand anywhere and look out at eye level to see the horizon, you are not on a sphere. If you can climb in altitude, and not need to consistently lower your gaze to see the horizon, then you really are not on a sphere.

       There's an easy, scientific, and virtually indisputable way to prove something that's been known by scientists and intellectuals since recorded history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stand by an ocean and watch a ship move away from you. Take out the most powerful telescope you can get your hands on and keep your eye on that ship. Note when you can no longer see it even with the aid of optics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a friend stand on the roof of a large building near where you are and perform the same tasks. Note at what time the ship disappeared from view. If your times are identical, congratulations. You've just proven that the Earth is flat. But the times won't be the same. Because the planet which we live on is a freaking oblate spheroid.

       And if you can zoom back in on that ship with a good camera, you'll never say it's evidence of a ball earth, yes? Get a camera and try it: you can bring that ship right on back into view with a Nikon P900. If the ship which had disappeared from unaided view, reappears with a camera, congratulations, you proved that the ship did not "disappear" due to curvature. There are countless videos on youtube showing this, and you can try it yourself.

       I don't get what you are trying to prove with that video. It clearly shows a ship disappearing over the curvature of the Earth. It is still slightly visible unaided, but when the telephoto lenses zoom in you can see how it slowly vanishes from view, bottom to top, no matter how strong the telescope is.

       If the Earth is flat, it would be entirely visible the whole time.

       If you were stood on that beach, you wouldn't have seen any ships on the horizon. When you zoom in, only then would ships appear. In other words, you could have watched those ships "go over the horizon" and disappear from view, and you could have brought them back into view with a good zoom. the fact that you could bring them back means they did not disappear because of curvature.

       They were in view the entire video. You can just faintly make out the ship on the background, all the zoom does is enlarge it and bring it into focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what you say is correct, then a simpler experiment can be performed. Try using a zoom that can get a decent closeup of the ship so that it fills the lens. Then go up a few levels until you can only get half the ship in your lens. Keep watch through both telescopes and see which one disappears over the horizon first.

       Many videos show a flat, empty horizon and then the video zooms in to bring into view many ships. There are also videos of distant islands which should not be seen due to curvature:

      <p>
       If I can't find a video where someone did this, I may get a Nikon P900 or similar zoom camera or telescope and have someone rent a boat and sail it straight out and keep zooming in on it to see if I can bring it back into view after it has clearly disappeared from naked eye, as in, it appeared to have gone "over the horizon." But there are many caveats: light acts strangely over long distances, especially over water (mirror mirages, etc), and swells of water end up adding together across long distances to obscure the distant ships. Very good cameras show this, and I believe that is the reason the bottom of the ships and distant buildings on coastlines are always obscured.

       That video is ridiculous. The math is completely off and relies on tall structures visible from a distance. Of
       <em>
        course
       </em>
       a structure tall enough viewed from a tall viewpoint is going to be above the curvature of the Earth. That's why I was specifically talking about things visible from a beach, because that's as close to a flat surface as you're going to get outside of the Salt Flats. And the one picture of a boat invisible until you zoom closer relies on the resolution being too low to actually show the boat as anything more than a few pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of these examples show either experiment I suggested to you: timing when something disappears over the horizon. There's going to be a longer time to disappearing when viewed from a high vantage point and that no matter how good your zoom is, once it goes over the horizon it's gone. Furthermore, you never gave a good explanation as to why everything disappears from bottom to top. Vague hand-wavy motions and saying "light refraction" don't actually constitute an explanation.

       Take a ruler or stick and hold it on the floor directly under a ceiling light, the only light on in the whole room. Now have a friend hold a stick a few feet away. If you have more than one friend, have the other friend hold a stick even farther. You'll notice that your stick has no shadow, while the others do, with the farthest the longest.
