<p>This post is a perfect example.</p>

<p>The primary reason for this mass immigration to western countries is to create a divide and constant fighting between the groups while the rich fuck us over even more and Zionists experiencing orgasm watching the western countries burn.</p>

<p>If anyone on this conspiracy wants any change, this massive immigration has to stop, and you have to start advocating for it.</p>

<p>Change that starting with yourself. Stop blaming immigrants -- especially here. United States is built upon immigration and the City of New York. At times, New York has been over 50 percent immigrants, many of which could not speak the language.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone believes refugees are about infiltrating our country to harm us.  Folks, mass immigration (refugees) are feeding our unstable economy.  With all they&#39;ve in (which is less than 1% of applicants), this is what is improving our economy. </p>

<p>Refugee = rent/mortgage + food + taxes + gas/transportation. If you&#39;re here, you know money and power is the root of all conspiracies.  </p>

<p>There is #1 reason they&#39;re allowing them to migrate. Of course, it was by design to create war to destroy their country, bring the best financial bets over (and if you think they&#39;re coming over and getting on welfare, you better look again, away from the MSM), to revitalize the struggling dollar.</p>

<p>This us vs. them mentality they are instilling is also designed to keep you supporting their barbarian efforts against people who are just like us.  Mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, grandparents, friends... People who just want to make their way in the world and hopefully be remembered by those they loved when gone.</p>

<p>The only people out to get you is the 1%.  For the love of all things good, we have got to start understanding it is the 99% against the 1%.  There is power in numbers, they know that and therefore they must always breed hate so the 99 never unite against them.</p>

<p>Seriously, if you believe a prime minister or president has any real power, you&#39;re in the wrong place. You need to be in a political forum not a conspiracy forum.</p>

<p>You know...the same elite that gives orders for our pawn US troops to destabilize entire countries which leads to many of these immigrants (less than half are actual refugees) needing to flee their country?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know everything and you come off more pretentious by what you are saying. But I also don&#39;t ignore the fact that there is a fucking systematic destruction od Europe taking place with historians saying within 30 years we can have an all civil war.</p>

<p>I know for a fact, unlike your comment, two above, to which what you just said solely applies.  Typical projection.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again, this is a conspiracy forum not a political forum. Think for yourself, folks.</p>

<p>You&#39;re argument has been refuted and nullified.  Naturally, you have no other recourse but to redirect with a feigned superiority.</p>

<p>They get their &quot;facts&quot; from whoever virtue signaled the hardest in the last reddit comment thread they visited.</p>

<p>I hate to use a meme, but their feelings definitely have a stranglehold on what&#39;s actually real.</p>

<p>My personal favorite was the large groups of feminists who got together after Trump was elected and they walked around with Hijab muslim posters in support of Islam. Hardcore feminists...who believe they can walk around naked and that men are all evil were supporting wearing a cloth that covers your whole body so that you remain pure and men don&#39;t want to rape you.</p>

<p>Feminists and hijabs? Yeah we&#39;ve entered the full on retarded level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing about them, too.  No foresight whatsoever.  It&#39;s like they&#39;re incapable of planning for more than a day at a time, and even that&#39;s probably giving them too much credit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t frequent many subs on reddit, but from what I&#39;ve seen all they talk about is the past or present.  They also like to confuse fiction with reality.  I.e., they process things by referencing things like Harry Potter or other movies/tv shows.  Their life experience primarily comes from what they draw from situations on the jew tube.  It&#39;s no wonder why they have such unrealistic expectations on life and how they implode when reality falls short.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of Harry Potter J.K. Rowling went on a rant about how we should all take in refugees or some shit a few months ago..some people starting tweeting her asking why she has an 18 bedroom house but doesn&#39;t taken in any refugees herself. These fucking limousine liberal celebrities don&#39;t realize that they can volunteer if they want to help. Why the fuck do actors who make $15 million a movie telling us how we can help? They should donate millions and let the 45 year old male refugees move in to their mansions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your post and to take a step further. The reason for the mass migration seems to be these countries have some major problems. It&#39;s time people reform their countries our included. The systems should work to the benefit of the common people not the privelidged few at the top of the pyramid. Until the failing constructs are scrapped immigration will continue to be a symptom.</p>

<p>Who was before? And before them? And so on?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a hint - evolving cultures grow and produce, static cultures wither and die. We can either go to the world (war, expansionism) or let the world come to us (immigration).</p>
