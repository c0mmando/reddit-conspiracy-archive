<p>I&#39;m 49 and have always had a positive outlook on life. Now, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m always upbeat and happy. I definitely have my &quot;down in the dumps&quot; days too. I&#39;m a normal person. And my life is not perfect either. Nobody&#39;s life is perfect.</p>

<p>Still, I am always positive and always see a light at the end of the tunnel.  :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It is one of Christopher Booker’s basic plots that’s of most interest to us. He called it overcoming the monster. Every overcoming-the-monster story, Booker explains, unfolds essentially as follows. The story begins with a peaceful community learning of some menacing threat. A hero is called upon to battle the forces of evil. As the hero comes face to face with the evil, it seems that the evil is much more powerful than the hero. The hero may fall into the monster’s clutches. But the monster has one fatal weakness. Just when it seems that all hope is lost, the hero is able to exploit that weakness and vanquish the monster. The shadow is lifted, and peace returns to the community.</p>

<p>We’ve already seen this pattern played out in Gilgamesh, Beowulf, Jaws, and Bond. And we saw it at the very beginning of the chapter, in David Icke’s conspiracy theory of reality. Icke’s grand conspiracy theory is a classic overcoming-the-monster story; it traces every twist and turn, from the peaceful golden age of humanity and the looming shadow of evil, to the climactic final confrontation and the promise of a return to peace. It’s a dramatic, ongoing saga, and it casts us all in the starring role. And Icke is not unique. All conspiracy thinking plays on archetypes of good overcoming evil.</p>

<p>The best conspiracy theories have all the trappings of a classic underdog story. The enemy is formidable. From the Elders of Zion to the New World Order, from the weapons-industrial complex to Big Pharma, the names given to the conspirators often play up their allegedly overwhelming power and influence. Like every villain, however, the conspiracy has one fatal weakness; if only their schemes can be exposed to the light, the enemy becomes powerless.</p>

<p>And the motive for the fight is noble. Christopher Booker notes that archetypal heroes act not to further their own interests, but on behalf of others. “David challenges Goliath because the giant is threatening his country, Israel; James Bond’s villains are threatening England, the West, all mankind; Darth Vader, in Star Wars, is threatening to impose his tyranny over the entire universe.” And according to conspiracy theories, the conspiracy is a threat to the freedom, liberty, and well-being of all mankind.</p>

<p>At first blush, it seems odd that someone would embrace a position of disadvantage. But as we’ve seen, there are upsides to being an underdog. Without conspiracy theories, people like Wakefield, Duesberg, Jones, and Garrison are just wrong. If there is an ongoing campaign to smear their reputations and discredit their findings, however, they become courageous heroes pushing the frontiers of science by selflessly battling a powerful, sinister foe on behalf of the unsuspecting public. Even more than making heroes out of a few renegades, though, conspiracy theories offer to make heroic underdogs of us all. A conspiracy theory is an invitation to join an enlightened but embattled minority—an elect few who bravely, selflessly speak truth to power.
As Joseph Vandello notes, our understanding of underdogs is “shaped by inspirational archetypal stories of odds overcome.” In the real world, underdogs are, by definition, unlikely to prevail. In the stories we tell, however, the underdog always wins; good always triumphs over evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Educated on the human brain&quot; lol. I love science, however that article is just an opinion, and it has little to no value, im sorry you cant get the global picture. At least you could have said that we try to find purpose in everything when reality shows maybe there is none. But again, love cant be explained or denied, and so many aspects of our reality are still not understood. My post however, was just a protest against pedophilia, which is a terrible crime, I hope you can understand and put yourself in the place of the childs which are suffering it, you dont need education for that. We can continue your empty fucking analysis on another thread.</p>

He brings his copypastas of feeble quality, in an effort to save us from our weaknesses and eccentricities.  He&#39;s quite certain that his understanding of the world is superior to our own, and so he graciously shares from his notebook-saved pseudoanalysis&#39;, which he keeps on hand, ready to paste at a moment&#39;s notice, to prop up his esteemed position.</p>

<p>I have to give him credit, though.  I haven&#39;t seen a person so thoroughly convey snide, smug superiority in so few posts.  I guess all those copypastas are helping him stand out, after all.</p>
