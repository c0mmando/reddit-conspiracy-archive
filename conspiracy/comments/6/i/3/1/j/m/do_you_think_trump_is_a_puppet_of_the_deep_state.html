       Because he stole the coronation from its rightful heir.  He was supposed to just be a good pied piper, say ridiculous shit, and lose it, like a good boy.  But he actually shut his mouth for a few weeks, at the end, and let Hillary lose it.
      </p>

       The vast majority of the "deep state" money was behind the Clinton machine.  Much of it went to waste, when Trump stole the coronation.

       Yes, absolutely.  They all are once they reach these heights.  I believe nearly every member of congress goes to Israel on a red carpet tour as soon as they are elected.  Of course these junkets are not really openly talked about.

       I think he's running scared, and is willing to cooperate with them on the main issues, but isn't as pliable as they want.  He's not a direct CIA plant like Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, or Clinton.

       I wouldn't say he's a complete plant, but - playing devil's advocate here - if he was totally in line with the deep state, it would make total sense for the msm to act exactly how they've been acting so that the public continues to be convinced that "there's no way he's part of the deep state.  Otherwise, the msm wouldn't be trying so hard to have him impeached."

       Good question. I don't think Trump has direct connections to those running the world. But, he is unwittingly their puppet. I think Trump was blackmailed into running for president. I think he borrowed billions from Russian banks (money that was given to the Russian central bank by Bernanke) after sanctions were imposed. I think his "masters" (who are most likely the seven ex-Goldman Sachs executives in his administration; you never see them in the news, now do ya??) tell him what to do and he does it; knowing that if they ever tell the world that he borrowed billions from the Russian banks, he would be impeached, possibly imprisoned and lose his entire "Empire". Trump is a scared man. You can see it in his face. They have him by the balls.

       Speaking of arms deals, did you know Trump once owned the yacht of Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and gave him refuge while Interpol was after him? Khashoggi is also an Israeli Mossad asset according to former Mossad katsas.

       There are factions of the deep state he is aligned with some and not worth others. But to me he had to be aligned in at least some way campaigning on starting out of Syria and then reversing once elected within a month.

       He hasn't exposed 9/11 or the phony war on terror, reformed the Fed, and he Skypes the I.S.S. which he must know is a movie set, and he funds NASA, so yeah I'd say he's a puppet. If flat Earth reaches a tipping point while he's in office he'll be impeached right away
