    <div class="md"><p>Good question. I don&#39;t think Trump has direct connections to those running the world. But, he is unwittingly their puppet. I think Trump was blackmailed into running for president. I think he borrowed billions from Russian banks (money that was given to the Russian central bank by Bernanke) after sanctions were imposed. I think his &quot;masters&quot; (who are most likely the seven ex-Goldman Sachs executives in his administration; you never see them in the news, now do ya??) tell him what to do and he does it; knowing that if they ever tell the world that he borrowed billions from the Russian banks, he would be impeached, possibly imprisoned and lose his entire &quot;Empire&quot;. Trump is a scared man. You can see it in his face. They have him by the balls.</p>
