       Just a thought i had, i heard people think that a lot of people think the cancer cure has been concealed so that they can make money off treating it, but i was wondering that because the royal family are so important to tourism etc do you think they might possibly have access to cures like cancer and life extending treatments?

       Blood of young children probably. I am 100% positive cancer cures, at least some, are being concealed from the general public. Chemo rakes in too much money. If they will suppress a plant, they sure as hell will suppress cancer cures.

       Yeah, she was totally fine. Even right before she died. She was never hopped up on meds like many old people. I think it was just her blood, or heart of something. I forgot.

       I get that you are alluding to 'drinking blood' or some such, but is it possible that they simply avoid eating the processed shit which the masses eat up on the daily? Do people really think humans are supposed to eat food from boxes and cans?

       Unfortunately they most likely died from the toxic drugs they were on rather than "AIDS." If you honestly research it you will see HIV/AIDS is the biggest medical scam in history.

       As someone living with HIV and has a partner and many friends with HIV I can tell you it's not a scam. You get sick, you deal with constant problems. The medicines available today are expensive (
       <em>
        maybe that's the scam

       ) but work well.

       Are you and everyone you know using antiretrovirals? If so, these are more than likely the reasons you are still sick. I have a relative who was diagnosed who was given 2 months to live after they said she had full blown AIDS. She has never touched antiretros and is healthier now 6 months later than when she was when she was first diagnosed. Most people with HIV/AIDS have either bacterial/gastrointestinal or drug addiction related issues as underlying causes. We changed her diet to organic foods and started her on probiotics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not here to convince you one way or the other as it's up to you to believe if you are sick or not. However, I highly encourage you to honestly research the issue and avoid Google as they bury the info so it is difficult to find. Look into Dr. Peter Duesberg and Dr. Kary Mullis. Look into the AIDS study where couples were having unprotected sex with infected partners for 10 years and not one partner was infected. Read the stories of countless people who have either taken the antiretro drugs and quit or never started at all and are alive and well today. Watch the documentary House of Numbers. Research and make up your own mind. It may just save your life.

       hypothetical question here...if humanity had a way to keep data in the public domain in a way that couldn't be corrupted (say like with the blockchain), wouldn't the set of information relating to cures eventually be appended with the secrets we're having withheld from us?  shouldn't the effort be put in building such a system rather than worrying about who isn't doing something for our benefit?

       whilst i get your train of thought, look at it this way. we're sick. but not sick enough to be hospitalised. not sick enough that we would 'risk' not going to work. we're just the right amount of sick. we can still do our godless jobs. drone on and on without much thought. we earn money that keeps us afloat, and enough that it would cover our illness charges that'll keep us healthy enough to keep doing our jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       keeping the money in a constant cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       the work we do is essentially useless, its only purpose is to distract, enslave, instill a routine that if you think of breaking out of, it means certain doom.
      </p>
      <p>
       if we were to be of healthy body, and by extension healthy minds, would all of us be doing these soul sucking jobs? i'm sure everyone would have the energy to do what they want and these jobs and companies will run into the ground.

       I know. If we were healthy and educated, we could do the good, well-paid jobs in good conditions, instead of the crappy minimum wage jobs.

       I personally know mainstream doctors that advocate their own family to avoid chemo, eliminate sugar, avoid radiation too. These docs would never say this to a patient but to their own family this is what they espouse. Cancer is known to be effected by lifestyle changes, hormones, sugar, even stress.

       Exactly! They can afford to hire the best doctors and buy the best medicine and eat the best food. That's why they're in good health.

       There's no proof it works but the placebo effect is almost 40% and rising so as long as PE keeps working we'll never know what works and what doesn't definitively. Some years ago Statins were all the rage now there's doubt about their value. What we need to do is boost the placebo effect.lol

       Are you and everyone you know using antiretrovirals? If so, these are more than likely the reasons you are still sick. I have a relative who was diagnosed who was given 2 months to live after they said she had full blown AIDS. She has never touched antiretros and is healthier now 6 months later than when she was when she was first diagnosed. Most people with HIV/AIDS have either bacterial/gastrointestinal or drug addiction related issues as underlying causes. We changed her diet to organic foods and started her on probiotics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not here to convince you one way or the other as it's up to you to believe if you are sick or not. However, I highly encourage you to honestly research the issue and avoid Google as they bury the info so it is difficult to find. Look into Dr. Peter Duesberg and Dr. Kary Mullis. Look into the AIDS study where couples were having unprotected sex with infected partners for 10 years and not one partner was infected. Read the stories of countless people who have either taken the antiretro drugs and quit or never started at all and are alive and well today. Watch the documentary House of Numbers. Research and make up your own mind. It may just save your life.
