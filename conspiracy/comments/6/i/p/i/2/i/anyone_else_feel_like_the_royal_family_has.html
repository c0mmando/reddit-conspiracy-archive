    <div class="md"><p>Are you and everyone you know using antiretrovirals? If so, these are more than likely the reasons you are still sick. I have a relative who was diagnosed who was given 2 months to live after they said she had full blown AIDS. She has never touched antiretros and is healthier now 6 months later than when she was when she was first diagnosed. Most people with HIV/AIDS have either bacterial/gastrointestinal or drug addiction related issues as underlying causes. We changed her diet to organic foods and started her on probiotics. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to convince you one way or the other as it&#39;s up to you to believe if you are sick or not. However, I highly encourage you to honestly research the issue and avoid Google as they bury the info so it is difficult to find. Look into Dr. Peter Duesberg and Dr. Kary Mullis. Look into the AIDS study where couples were having unprotected sex with infected partners for 10 years and not one partner was infected. Read the stories of countless people who have either taken the antiretro drugs and quit or never started at all and are alive and well today. Watch the documentary House of Numbers. Research and make up your own mind. It may just save your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hypothetical question here...if humanity had a way to keep data in the public domain in a way that couldn&#39;t be corrupted (say like with the blockchain), wouldn&#39;t the set of information relating to cures eventually be appended with the secrets we&#39;re having withheld from us?  shouldn&#39;t the effort be put in building such a system rather than worrying about who isn&#39;t doing something for our benefit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>definitely. pharmaceutical companies make too much money. imagine having a <em>cure</em> for most diseases, people being healthy! a true horror.</p>

<p>they want to keep us sick whilst the elite thrive.</p>

<p>just look at how much more prevalent the rates of many illnesses are these days compared to years ago. the money that shit rakes in will make you want to keep people sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>whilst i get your train of thought, look at it this way. we&#39;re sick. but not sick enough to be hospitalised. not sick enough that we would &#39;risk&#39; not going to work. we&#39;re just the right amount of sick. we can still do our godless jobs. drone on and on without much thought. we earn money that keeps us afloat, and enough that it would cover our illness charges that&#39;ll keep us healthy enough to keep doing our jobs.</p>

<p>keeping the money in a constant cycle.</p>

<p>the work we do is essentially useless, its only purpose is to distract, enslave, instill a routine that if you think of breaking out of, it means certain doom.</p>

<p>if we were to be of healthy body, and by extension healthy minds, would all of us be doing these soul sucking jobs? i&#39;m sure everyone would have the energy to do what they want and these jobs and companies will run into the ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you and everyone you know using antiretrovirals? If so, these are more than likely the reasons you are still sick. I have a relative who was diagnosed who was given 2 months to live after they said she had full blown AIDS. She has never touched antiretros and is healthier now 6 months later than when she was when she was first diagnosed. Most people with HIV/AIDS have either bacterial/gastrointestinal or drug addiction related issues as underlying causes. We changed her diet to organic foods and started her on probiotics. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to convince you one way or the other as it&#39;s up to you to believe if you are sick or not. However, I highly encourage you to honestly research the issue and avoid Google as they bury the info so it is difficult to find. Look into Dr. Peter Duesberg and Dr. Kary Mullis. Look into the AIDS study where couples were having unprotected sex with infected partners for 10 years and not one partner was infected. Read the stories of countless people who have either taken the antiretro drugs and quit or never started at all and are alive and well today. Watch the documentary House of Numbers. Research and make up your own mind. It may just save your life.</p>
