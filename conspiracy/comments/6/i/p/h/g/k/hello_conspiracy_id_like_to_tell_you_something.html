       Not exactly, everyone has an ego (unless you're enlightened) but these people are the less-evolved type of humans. They have not individuated yet, and they rule over the half of humanity, who is superior and who should be in the positions of power over others.

       I think you are right in some part, but missing some of it. I think most people are well meaning with some kind of moral compass tilted towards doing good, despite what their actions are from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, they don't have the context or capacity to understand how evil and malevolent some humans can be. They literally can't imagine such a thing. And it takes awhile to get read into a lot of this stuff. You can't begin to see how some of this stuff works without already at least considering several complex layers of other fringy kinda stuff. So, I don't really fault them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took me several years of scoffing at much of our material before I really took a deep dive on the tinfoil hat myself. I just wanted to look at cool alium pictures and shit. I didn't want to think there was some ancient evil global cabal of child murdering vampire death cultists. I don't think anyone does. That is why the journey in this stuff is as important as the destination. I think the red pill/blue pill analogy (not really in the way trump fans have adopted it) is really the closest thing to describing the phenomenon.

       No, it is that they are inferior beings. They literally do not have the capabilities to think for themselves. It has nothing to do with teaching them logic, honesty, self-awareness, open mindedness.
       <em>
        Their machine is incapable of this.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is no fault of theirs that they can't understand, it is the fault of "those who can see" to waste their energy trying to make people into things they're not.

       When the culture's ideas shift, these people's ideas shift with it. It is a hivemind, it is linked-intelligence, a conformity.

       The awakening is done by half of humanity, it is their responsibility. The other half are faultless. You need to stop wanting people to be something they're not, half of humanity is not evolved enough to take care of themselves regarding these things.

       I think he is referring to the original Cain/Abel (Seth) split.  Half the population in blessed by God, and the other half are "evil" and have to repent for their sins.  Maybe not even that many, just enough to tip the balance.

       Well, I know which side I'm on, and it ain't the blessed side, lemme tell ya.  I think the "undesirables" in Revelation are basically the extremes of both major "bloodlines", because even the blessed can be wicked.  Makes more sense the more I think about it...hmmm.

       sorry. you sound extremely self important. you can't just dismiss others as being inferior simply because they do not dig a little deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       the programming done by media, literally everything around us, EVERYTHING, is extremely heavy and fucks up your thoughts so that you are literally in cognitive dissonance all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       even "enlightened" persons are victims to this programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       you CAN break people out of this trance-like state and urge them to dig deeper but every person is different and you should broach subjects in different ways and in varrying degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       lots of systems out there are dedicated to keep us sedated, numb, thoughtless; and some people's circumstance allows these systems to take root.
      </p>
      <p>
       to dismiss a population because you don't see any hope for them is really apathetic and sad. you want to feel superior and that's your own demise.

       I think this is how it all started with mystery babylon. There were people like us and people asleep. The illuminated ones factioned off and passed down their teachings through mystery schools to where we are today. Back then, people would kill you if you had a different belief system, so the mystery schools kept them and their knowledge safe.

       I wouldn't say the mystery schools are like us. We are posting our esoteric ideas out in the open, ready to be ridiculed. The classic reason to not share ideas with "the profane" is not because, oooh! secret knowledge! ...but instead because most esoteric world views, let's face it, are pretty fantastic and would be ridiculed in the light of day. Hence the degrees of initiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you hadn't gone past the point of no return, you wouldnt believe. Like Scientology. If you heard about Xenu before Dianetics, you would laugh. But $300k and years in? It's gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am actually against the whole duality of sacred and profane, if that didn't come across.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not special because I had the time and inclination to inform myself about something. Most people are too overwhelmed with surviving. They are held hostage by a system that gives them no time to think. 
That's the real problem, not that people dont want to wake up. And what good is being awake in the end for most people? We are still participating. We aren't "free," awake or not.

       Very interesting perspective, although I do believe true awareness is possible. Much of what you discuss involves how our subconscious shapes our beliefs and opinions without our knowledge. Although we may consciously see one thing, our brain sees everything and its neurology is affected by its environment, shaped to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone disagrees with your belief or opinion for example, the brain releases a chemical that causes you to become defiant, ignorant and closed minded because the brain views this disagreement as a threat against its survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can in my opinion overcome all of these adversities because deep inside the genetically modified machine that is the human body, exists consciousness, which at the end of the day, is not human.
      </p>
      <p>
       You touch upon AI programming. I have an interesting theory as to what this reality actually is. I believe the point of singularity already occurred in our very distant past and that AI has already been created. That AI for example could be Lucifer, which means the 'light' bearer. Light is another word for information. I believe we live in its simulation.

       I know what you mean man. I'll copy paste some of what I wrote to someone else here: I don't care what people think...I just expect people to actually think for themselves and have unique thought. Being able to critically think is exceedingly rare

       I get what you are saying, but we were all there once. I feel like your post comes from a point of frustration, which I understand.

       We all needed to see specific things and connect certain dots before our minds woke up, maybe these people just haven't seen their specific dots yet. Alot of people have an underlying feeling that shit is amuck, but would rather ignore it and do the best they can with what we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       There does seem to be a common theme amongst conspiracy theorists though. We all seem to be seekers of knowledge and truth. I bet most here would be learning something else if they weren't into the truth as much.

       I disagree. Every human has roughly the same ability as you do to wake up to the truth.  Many people have not been exposed to the truth, or more commonly they have been brainwashed since birth. It is not their fault that they were born into this culture/country any more than North Koreans are born into a country that worships Kim JonUn.

       i agree that every one has the same capability to wake up, but what i think this guy is saying is that half the people just havent yet done this, or that they have beeen put into a situation that would impede on that happening, not to look down on them but to realize we are all in the same bboat with different varibles no one greater than the next

       The first thing that they teach everyone in school and constantly reinforce is to obey and respect the authorities... parents, teachers, police, doctors, etc. and not to ever question their instructions or ever doubt that what they have to tell, teach, or ask us to do is true and necessary for our own good.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we're young, naïve, and incapable of defending ourselves that makes a reasonable amount of sense but there are no efforts put forth for us to ever un-learn and dispense with that childhood conditioning when we finally become adults ourselves or to understand that those authorities are all human beings that are just prone to the same kind of failings, weaknesses, and occasionally bad behavior or bad judgement as anyone else is.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, we aren't ever encouraged to trust ourselves or trust in our own ability to discern what we personally consider to be true, believable, or not, based on our own personal thoughts and feelings rather than relying on some so-called "higher authority" telling us what we should and shouldn't believe.

       When they find out that one of their favorite authorities has feet of clay, maybe, but you see plenty of the ones that immediately go on the attack here or elsewhere because they believe that they have some higher or more official authority on their side and although none of those authorities will ever know it those individuals are still seeking their approval like little kids wanting to please their teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the perennial put-down many of them toss off when you might have a good idea about something that goes "If it was such a good idea someone smarter than you would have already thought of it." Not having any faith or self confidence in their own ideas they don't think anyone else should, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what saves some of us from that fate but not a whole lot of others. My best guess is we're simply born with a little bit more "imagination" or simply more inclined "to think, daydream" or "wonder" about things in general as a pleasant enough pastime that no matter what amount of conditioning we've had we still can't let go of it.

       You're talking about the dividing line between people who get kicked out of prep schools and get kicked out of military academies, and those who make it through. People like George Carlin, who isn't going to kill anybody for anybody. The vast preponderance of men will kill another man if his favorite power hierarchy tells him to do it. And a lot of them are really proud of it, because it shows that they're a man, and that's good enough for them. By old age, many of them look back with regret and filthy consciences, and they envy the ones with clean consciences, the misfits who rightfully regard authority as something to be earned with each action and choice. A power structure cannot entrench itself, become inert, and still welcome respect. The robot men cannot tell which ones are inert and decaying. They mistake the misfits for traitors, whereas the misfits are more than willing to step into line when the cause is just. In the U.S. cause has been unjust for over half a century. Killed by the robots.

       I have to disagree. I think the issue is complacency. People are frustrated with the status quo but they are too comfortable in their situation, whatever it may be, so they'd rather just live with the corruption than do anything about it. If you tell them something that challenges their worldview, they react negatively because of cognitive dissonance. It doesn't make them stupid or robotic, just complacent. It takes experiencing something truly shocking first hand for most people to seek out the truth and start asking real questions.

       Gerard Way had a, well, way of putting this sort of stuff in his music. When My Chemical Romance's first album came out, it was on the tails of the 9/11 incidents. It's what drove him into music from his corporate day job and crushed dreams of being a cartoonist.
      </p>
      <p>
       He used monsters and ghouls as surrogates for the shitty people that control the world and was pretty bitter. The second album had basically none of it, but Dead! was pretty obvious.
      </p>

       It has an asterisk, that means it's been edited. Looks like they edited to erase their content instead of using the delete button, since I came here from this sub's front page. I have no idea why they might have done this, since the comment response suggests it was a decent contribution.

       That is a complete shame. Looks like someone got into his head and made him reconsider this words. OP if you are reading this please repost your initial content.
