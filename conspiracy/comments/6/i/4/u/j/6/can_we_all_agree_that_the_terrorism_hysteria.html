<p>&quot;Terrorism&quot; is the perfect social hysteria. </p>

<p>This, unidentifiable, untraceable, undefeatable &quot;idea&quot; of an Enemy, is genius. It&#39;s the perfect pretext, to take away our civil liberties, since it&#39;s an enemy that can never be beaten. </p>

<p>Do you see the social programming as work? Or do you honestly think these terrorist groups are autonomous and self funded and directed on their own? Many of them are CIA funded and provided with arms. </p>

<p>Terrorism is the social hysteria of the new millenium. This is how they will pry our rights from us; Under the protection of protecting terrorist attacks.</p>

<p><strong>How obvious is it that the social engineers are trying to pound this into our heads?</strong></p>

where they cited the need for the US to invade Middle Eastern countries, that just happened to be Israel&#39;s enemies. The PNAC was a thinktank created and funded by pro-Israel supporters and it employed the likes of Wolfowitz and Cheney. 9 months after they got into office, the Pearl Harbor type event happened. </p>

He had a guest, don&#39;t remember who, and he showed him clips of ISIS in these parades of trucks with flags flying, going down the road, and another of ISIS tanks placidly assembling out in an open countryside. He asked why did the US not attack them?  They were basically out there &quot;doing donuts&quot; and open to attack.  The guy laughed and said he could not comment. </p>

<p>Your title is true, even if above statement is not. 9-11 was used to advance Bush governments agenda whether or not it was an inside job.</p>

<p>And for what&#39;s it worth, all the other countries used the event to crack down on who they wanted and to apply more surveillance laws.</p>

<p>Russia used 9-11, in part, to justify their smackdown of Chechens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bush (or any leader) didn&#39;t do 9/11. That&#39;s like saying my hands made a sandwich. The Rothschild Family did 9/11 to engage the Muslim world in their third planned world war, designed by American general Albert Pike in the late 1890&#39;s. 
WW1: Destroy Tsar (who resisted Rothschild take over of Russia&#39;s bank) and instill communism. 
WW2: Pit religious- persecuting Communism against the Christian Fascism of Germany. Collect all the broken pieces (banks) when fighting&#39;s done 
WW3: Pit Christians &amp; Americans against Islam. Destabilize Middle East (Anytime there&#39;s a war, Rothschild loans money to BOTH sides w interest) then take control of their banking systems. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the plan. Has been for a hundred years. </p>

<p>and here&#39;s some more logic for ya <em>dog</em></p>

<p>The towers exteriors were made of thick interlocking steel and huge steel core colums connected by horizontal floor slabs of 4-6 inches of concrete and grids of steel trusses...but the jets that hit the pentagon (a single kevlar and rebar concrete wall) and shanksville (a bunch of soft dirt from an old strip mine) all vaporized right?  Cant have it both ways sucka</p>

<p>heres some pictures with words and logic for you.</p>

<p>please explain with your profound appreciation for logic, the significant and professionally inexplicable speed and altitude profiles, not to mention behavior, of the jets.  actually what jets, there is no actual wreckage, no serial numbers, black boxes with 0000 serial numbers, faa or ntsb sanctioned rebuilds (though i was told by a friend that some wreckage was at iron mountain but i dunno), the anomalies are stark and numerous, but dat picture tho, whewww, right bruh...??  oh and group tink, monkey</p>

<p>narrator claims regarding yours, &quot;leslie robertson designed the structure to withstand 707 low on fuel... traveling at low speeds...&quot; (no citation), not only does betting on minimum impact forces not make sense for the tallest buildings in the world housing the worlds stock and bond markets, it does not merit a leap in logic concerning global symmetrical near free-fall collapse of 110 floors from asymmetrical damage in about 10 seconds straight through itself, the undamaged and even more robust structures beneath, as well there&#39;s something called redundancy built into all large structures, especially the wtc, that means that whatever the building was calculated to withstand, it is eventually built with a significant amount more capacity.</p>

The difference is in whether it was a planned reaction to an &quot;organic&quot;&quot; event, or a set up to intentionally create a situation that would allow the reaction to go with minimal public outcry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think using every incident for your plans is something even more dangerous. If you have a agenda to control more - Internet, privacy, distribution of oil in middle east for example- and maybe wait out a catastrophe (man made, foreign or internal) although having the information gathered by security agencies seems  evil enough for me without the NEED for a staging. It means there isn&#39;t a secret order necessarily but people that govern use recklessly whatever they want to build a kind of police state</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The core of the Patriot Act was drafted by Joe Biden in the mid 90&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next year, months before the Oklahoma City bombing took place, Biden introduced another bill called the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995. It previewed the 2001 Patriot Act by allowing secret evidence to be used in prosecutions, expanding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and wiretap laws, creating a new federal crime of &quot;terrorism&quot; that could be invoked based on political beliefs, permitting the U.S. military to be used in civilian law enforcement, and allowing permanent detection of non-U.S. citizens without judicial review. The Center for National Security Studies said the bill would erode &quot;constitutional and statutory due process protections&quot; and would &quot;authorize the Justice Department to pick and choose crimes to investigate and prosecute based on political beliefs and associations.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tara was the name in our ancient past that referred to the Goddess, Divine Feminine archetype.  It is the name of our planet Earth (Terra).  Tara is equivalent to Gaia-Sophia.  Look at the way they pronounce &#39;terror&#39; when the power structure and media speak about the &quot;War on Terror&quot;.  Especially when it was George W. Bush - that final &#39;r&#39; is often dropped in pronunciation:  &quot;The War on <em>Terruh</em>&quot;.  It is very literally a &quot;War on <em>Tara</em>&quot;.  This entire dark occult ritual that happened on 9/11 was meant to usher in an all-out assault on the divine mother and the dynamic of Care in the world.  We are all children of this Earth, of Tara.  Human beings are meant to be stewards, not oppressors, of this planet.  If there is a War on Tara, and we humans are part and parcel of Tara, then this war is being waged against <em>us</em>.  And the force waging this war against humanity is therefore decidedly <em>non-human</em>.  Food for thought.</p>

However, as an engineer(EE not civil), I am interested in 911 and in my opion I have not seen any proof that it was &quot;staged&quot;. </p>

<p>Almost everything else you wrote is a fact, but there is still doubt in my mind. The fact that people use such flawed arguments as &quot; &quot;Grenfell Tower burned completely, every floor is carbonized, and it did not collapse&quot; make me think people have an agenda to spread misinformation. Seriously, as long as people think a  1,792 ft tall Tower damaged by shock of plane stike and filled with a full load a jet fuel is the same as a 220 ft tall building without jet fuel and not damaged by the shock of strike of 2 massive jet liners. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what drew me in to places like this (r/conspiracy)is that when i was getting out of high school i wanted to fight for my country blah blah blah. I chose the other route, college/ life of debt. Looking back i could not even be here or be fucked up suffering from PTSD and it drives me crazy that these people suffering these things are realizing it was all for nothing.  Think about those poor men and women who have made life long friends only to have them taken away and when you learn its all for nothing? ..... I would have no words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of the conspiracy theorists who were exposing 9/11 and 7/7 as being inside jobs (so not entirely the fault of muslims) are now fully onboard with blindly accepting the establishment&#39;s narrative of the Islamic terrorist boogeyman. Infowars and Paul Joseph Watson specifically, seeing them shift to right-wing populism and pushing the Clash of Civilisations plan is unfortunate and proves they care about clicks, not the truth. Useful idiots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I rarely find people who don&#39;t think something is wrong with the whole 9/11 story. Weather they feel it was a complete inside job or with help from us. Just like everyone knows the banks got bailed out and everyone else got fucked. I don&#39;t meet many fanatics of either Trump or Hillary, but a bunch of people understanding of why someone choose one over the other. Which tends to sound &quot;I couldn&#39;t vote for that criminal&quot;, followed by, &quot;yeah, but he&#39;s crazy.&quot; With the agreement of what a shitty choice we had. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t meet many that don&#39;t see MSM for what it is our aren&#39;t in some way woke. They may not believe in pizzagate, but most say they wouldn&#39;t doubt with these power hungry fucks are into weird shut and we can pretty much agree Podesta is kind of a creepy guy. </p>

<p>The thing is we aren&#39;t suffering enough, yet. The ones that aren&#39;t rich are to busy trying to hold everything together. People are to busy trying to survive, which is exactly where the elite want us. To desperate and we revolt, to educated and we revolt, just above starving with mindless entertainment. You can knock down buildings all day to steal another countries wealth and we remain to confused, scared and find comfort in shopping. </p>
