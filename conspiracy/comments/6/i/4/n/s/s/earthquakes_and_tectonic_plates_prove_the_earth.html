        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>if the Tectonic plates are pushing against each other causing earthquakes which I don&#39;t think anyone is disputing. the Tectonic plates must be level with each other. as when they are not completely level one plate goes under the other causing a mountain range or a canyon. </p>

<p>The pacific rim is one giant Tectonic plate. this plate would be curved in theory since the ground is supposedly curved over the whole earth. </p>

<p>The curve of the plates would be the weakest point went pressing against other plates causing the mountain ranges to raise up . not earthquakes to happen. whats easier to push against two flat plates? or two curved plates. the two flat plates will push against each other with more force. Curved plates will be harder to push against each other and easily slip past one another. </p>

<p>The earth having a spherical surface is confusing. don&#39;t act like it isn&#39;t. it is. We know mountain ranges and buildings and canyons are all diverging from the so called sea level. the word level implies flat btw. So all the parts  of the surface of the earth we know are not actually flat they are bumpy obviously. So the earth is not a smooth surface thats for sure. Yet all the pictures of earth from space show the surface of the globe being a smooth sphere. It wouldn&#39;t be smooth thats for dam sure. and the weight on all the sides of the earth would have to be equal or the balance would be off. and don&#39;t say magnetic forces are so strong it doesn&#39;t matter what we do on earth it&#39;s still balanced. Then why does climate change exist? the C02 levels matter? but the way we distribute weight on the surface of the earth doesn&#39;t matter? thats inconsistent AF.
no experiment exists showing water curving to the shape of a sphere.  If the earth were indeed a sphere an experiment with water sticking to a spinning sphere would exist. The idea is foreign because we know water doesn&#39;t behave that way. 
Don&#39;t let your kids be lied to break the chain now!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their is an agenda behind the reason why we were not taught that the Earth is flat. You have to read about the history of it to understand why the truth is not the popular opinion. NASA is a SCAM. 
America was secretly infiltrated by the illuminati, jesuits, and Black Nobility (Canaanites). They signed our constitution, took control of our money, government, education systems, healthcare, media, and people. Under this ruthless vile group no country is allowed to be free and all Christianity must be destroyed, we must always be in war and killing each other. The flat earth is what is written about in Revelations so they lie, hide and destroy it. They literally worship Lucifer and believe they are doing his work. Nothing is to sinister for them. They have come here as the Elite, as Scientists, Doctors, Nuns, and Priests you name it and they stop at nothing to destroy America and any other country that seeks freedom. </p>

<p>“This [American Civil] war [of 1861-1865] would never have been possible without the sinister influence of the Jesuits. We owe it to popery that we now see our land reddened with the blood of her noblest sons. 
The Protestants of both the North and the South would surely unite to exterminate the priests and the Jesuits, if they could hear what Professor [Samuel B.] Morse [Ed. Note: U.S. inventor of the telegraph] has said to me of the plots made in the very city of Rome [i.e., at the Vatican] to destroy this Republic, and if they could learn how the [Roman Catholic] priests, the nuns, and the monks, which daily land on our shores, under the pretext of preaching their religion, instructing the people in their schools, taking care of the sick in the hospitals, are nothing else but the emissaries of the Pope, of Napoleon, and the other despots of Europe, to undermine our institutions, alienate the hearts of our people from our Constitution, and our laws, destroy our schools...

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;...an experiment with water...&quot; is unecessary. If you are honestly interested make an observation of a body of water: Go to a large lake (10 miles in length or longer) where you can view the surface from North to South. Set up a simple vertical tape measure = 2&quot;x2&quot;x 8&#39; length of wood, marked with a felt pen so you can easily see the markings. Look down the length of the lake (North to South) = you will see that the surface of the lake water near to you as YOU yourself &#39;measure&#39; it is higher near you than it is far away. Example: nearby the surface of the lake   will be at X feet Y inches but way down at the South end the surface will look lower than X&#39; Y&quot;  because the entire lake is held in place by gravity and the curvature of the earth will make it look as though the surface of the lake is much lower far away. -- Thanks to the brilliant physicist Stephen Hawking for this indisputable method of observing the earth&#39;s curvature by Yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironicly it makes more sence for the earth to be round. Mostly because of soundwaves and the way we can pickup earthquake across the world.</p>

<p>If the earth was flat, it would be alot harder to detect an earthquake movments from what would be  otherside of the planet.</p>

<p>If sound and movment traveled across a linear surface, such as a flat earth, the sounds and movments from earthqaukes would be alot less noticible from point of orgin to point of recording. </p>

<p>However since sound and movment travel through the earth, it travels less distance then it would have to on the surface. </p>

<p>Its why the USGA in californa can pick up earthquakes in the Baltic sea. Then make earthquake risk easements based on that info. Its why earthquakes can trigger events litarly across the world.</p>
