        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First Syria shoots down an Israeli jet over its airspace that Israel has been violating since the start, prompting for Israel to announce they will shoot down any Syrian air defense system if they try again. This of course is easier said than done because these are essentially Russian air defense systems. This sends a clear message from Putin saying that the games in Syria are over as I don&#39;t think he will allow his air defense systems be bombed into oblivion as Israel has done in the past with other countries.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/381542-white-helmets-al-qaeda-members/">Now Assad has also just publicly and officially announced &quot;Oscar-feted White Helmets are part of Al-Qaeda&quot;</a> meaning they are ready to start exposing the lies with more confidence. </p>

<p>I wanted to hear your thoughts on where this is all heading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a really good point. I read something yesterday that implied that the formation of the state of Israel was in no small way affected by the Bolsheviks. </p>

<p>Be that as it may, it really seems like the current leadership in Russia hates Israel, and vise versa. But, what if that were not the case, and this was just all theater?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hard to say about these two for me. They&#39;ve been pretty mutual consistently on the surface but their agendas don&#39;t seem to align at all either on the surface. In fact their agendas seem completely opposite on the surface yet they&#39;re keeping a very mutual relationship in the public eye. I&#39;m not sure what to make of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying their agendas seem completely opposite on the surface as you mentioned the example of the conflict between Iran (and Syria) yet they never get into a disrespectful yelling match, at least in public, and none that we know behind the scenes either, as far as I know and can remember. Unless I&#39;ve been out of the loop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t believe the Syrian government when they say they shot a plane down or that Russia has told Israel to stop the attacks.  Russia and Israel have good relations and the Russian military put a lot of effort into creating methods of coordinating with the Israeli military to prevent any accidental conflict in Syria.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Syria did shoot an Israeli jet down though. That&#39;s a confirmed incident that&#39;s being talked about a lot in the past days.</p>

<p>This is why I was curious to where this is leading. Shooting that plane down is sending a  strong message. I&#39;m just a bit confused where Russia now comes into the picture between the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything I&#39;ve read is a he said/she said deal, Syria says they shot down a plane, Israel says they didn&#39;t.  I&#39;m inclined to believe the Israelis because if a plane had been shot down the video of the wreckage would be all over the place.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh so Israel is officially denying it? I was under the impression some general said they&#39;d shoot down syrian air defense systems next time it happens. I&#39;m a little bit out of the loop about the incident though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Israel said missiles were fired but that they didn&#39;t hit their planes.  As to the second deal, Israel&#39;s defense minister Lieberman threatened to destroy Syria&#39;s air defense system if they fired at Israeli planes again.  Take it with a grain of salt, he&#39;s well known for saying stuff like that.  </p>
