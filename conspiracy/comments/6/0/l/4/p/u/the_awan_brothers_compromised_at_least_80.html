<p>The Awan Brothers</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 Awan brothers are named by Webb : Imran, Jamal and Abid. (A 4th brother and wife of one of the Awan&#39;s are also believed to be involved).</p>

<p>Originally installed in congressional positions by Greg Meeks who is widely regarded as the most corrupt member of congress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will preface this discussion by stating you will find some variation in the numbers cited. I believe that is because I quoted from stories as the case was developing. The Daily Caller was the primary source for most of the news on the net. I tried to be as accurate as possible with the facts quoting the sources I found. I am posting this because I want answers, it is not a definitive work. I do, however, believe the breach is every bit as consequential as the hillary email server and the CIA Wikileak.</p>

<p><a href="https://spectator.org/the-invisible-awan-brothers-scandal/">Why isn’t the MSM interested in the Awan Brothers: the three IT specialists fired for rooting through House Democrats’ sensitive files?</a></p>

<p><a href="https://investmentwatchblog.com/who-are-the-awan-it-staff-that-hacked-house-intelligence-computers-and-why-wont-the-media-cover-this-evidence-based-story-research-node/">Who are the Awan IT Staff that hacked House Intelligence Computers? And Why Won’t the Media cover this Evidence-based Story?</a></p>

<p>I know a bunch of shills will tear me up screaming, &quot;ya got no proof,&quot; but indulge me in a conspiracy theory. 
I think the greatest disservice the MSM had managed to perpetuate is the fallacy that other than the obvious connection of all these people there is otherwise no connection between these events. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume for the moment that the items described here are patterns of political belief and criminal activity. They aren&#39;t individual acts, but on going criminal conspiracies. Let&#39;s not look at this as an isolated event. While I&#39;m detailing the actions of the Awan brothers. I believe, but can not prove, those action may have been perpetuated in concert with other individuals at work in the under belly of the government. It&#39;s almost as if disparate groups come in contact occasionally when their objectives overlap. As I stated, I have no proof of this, but it stands to reason the flood of cyber attacks and leaks may have overlapped through the individuals linked in the different events. For example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was an integral player in the DNC Hacks and also introduced the Awan brothers to Congress. Is there a connection? Maybe, maybe not. It is not that far fetched, this has happened before, see the <a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/George_Silverman.htm">Silverman group</a>. Silverman associated with the <a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=7511">CPUSA</a> and knew <a href="https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/21133-valerie-jarretts-communist-ties-confirmed-by-judicial-watch">Jarrett’s father, Dr. James Bowman</a> and through <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/07/nsa-admits-it-analyzes-more-peoples-data-previously-revealed/313220/">three degrees of separation</a> used by the NSA is directly connected to <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2015/06/communism-in-jarretts-family/">Valerie Jerrett</a>. If it is good enough for the IC to open an inquiry why can&#39;t we indulge in some similar speculation.</p>

<p>• The First anomalous fact is the Media. Why have they largely ignored the issue. Before you cyber trolls jump on me, I would like you to consider two facts. Congress deals with very sensitive and classified material all the time. The Awan brothers could never have had a secret clearance for any other group than Congress. There is no news story there?</p>

<p>• The Second error is the &quot;smoking gun.&quot; The evidence is always covered up with a coincidence, a cover story if you will. While I believe the politicos in D.C. are pampered rubes, they do have a good support staff, and some have been trained to support clandestine operations. The rest have been hammered with political optics for the entirety of their career in D.C.. They are all trained to control optics and the dissemination of the truth. </p>

<p>• The Third fallacy is the &quot;bad guy.&quot; Why does everyone think an on going criminal conspiracy can be distilled down to a single criminal committing a crime rather than a pattern of criminal behavior with one or more groups profiting off the criminal activities. It is best to think of their actions like organized crime and should be prosecuted like a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96">RICO</a> case. An on going criminal enterprise by an organized group or groups of conspirators. </p>

<h3>The Media</h3>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t the media made this the top news story to at least go along with the Russian hack. Let&#39;s face it, the media doesn&#39;t care about the damage to the country, they only care about their partisan agenda. If they didn&#39;t they would cover stories damaging to the DNC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.thenation.com/article/amazon-washington-post-and-600-million-cia-contract/&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig9ou9uuXSAhVIqlQKHRq-B9IQFggaMAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHV5bq2XmMVImJfxLZwNeg3uzppTQ&amp;sig2=ptiqmz35ckn0791VFSQ-XQ">$600,000,000 CIA contract</a> you would think the Washington Post could afford an investigative journalist or two. Perhaps CNN will take up an interest as this rabbit hole runs deep and wide. Don&#39;t hold your breath.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Snowflakes and &quot;journalists&quot; can call Trump a fascist, but there is nothing  connecting an enormous breach of the United States Security Apparatus by as many as 80 Democrat members of Congress (past and present). We rail on about the Russians and Trump without specific allegations backed up with evidence, but the media avoids providing nightly updates about these 5 spies that have compromised congress. The answer is simple, the Awan Brothers are Muslim and the &quot;victims&quot;/dupes are Dems. Dupes who in fact abused their position of responsibility to end up being compromised by their own &quot;trusted&quot; staff. Several of the Congressmen involved in the breach have gone so far as to blame the allegations on <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/house-democrats-it-staffers-hina-alvi-imran-awan-235569">Islamophobia</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meeks said he was hesitant to believe the accusations against Alvi, Imran Awan and the three other staffers, saying their background as Muslim Americans, some with ties to Pakistan, could make them easy targets for false charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This story damages the narrative that Muslims are benevolent members of the government and Dems care about the country. It really shows the depth of the progressive aims to &quot;<a href="http://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/transformers/">fundamentally transforming the United States of America</a>.</p>

<p>This is where the conspiracy theory comes in. Give me a little latitude to connect the dots, and let&#39;s see where this trail goes...</p>

<h1><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-11/alleged-muslim-spy-ring-why-rex-tillerson-cleaned-house">An Alleged Muslim Spy Ring - Is This Why Rex Tillerson Cleaned House?</a></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The mainstream media seemed far more interested in obfuscating the details regarding the Tillerson terminations than they were in covering what could be one of the most dangerous intelligence leaks in years, of which there has been but a peep out of any major news outlet.  Captain Joseph R. John (Navy-Ret.) has stated that he believes the Muslim Brotherhood “<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/30/capt-joseph-john-muslim-brotherhood-fifth-column-infiltrated-u-s-government/">fifth column” has “infiltrated U.S. Government</a>,” and if he is correct, the Awan brothers could very well be a part of this infiltration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The media is <a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/8/republicans-media-bias-claims-boosted-by-scarcity-/">90% Democrat</a> and I would argue that in recent years the mainline Dems have gone hard left, almost Marxist. They have an almost suicidal pact with Islamists. Where does this scandal connect with Middle Eastern Islamists?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One might well look at the set of circumstances laid out above and see in it a scandal that would make Watergate look like a petty break-in. One might then scratch his or her head and wonder — why on earth would the New York Times or the Washington Post, which incidentally just hired John Podesta (speaking of horrendous cybersecurity!) as a columnist, have virtually no interest in the Awans at all?</p>

<p>Do Carlos Slim and Jeff Bezos, one might ask, really believe they can’t sell papers with such a story to tell?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Smoking Gun</h3>

<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/04/exclusive-house-intelligence-it-staffers-fired-in-computer-security-probe/">EXCLUSIVE: House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committee Members Compromised By Rogue IT Staff</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/03/police-probing-it-contractors-for-house-dems-over-unauthorized-computer-access.html">Fox News</a> is told the employees made “unauthorized access” to the House computer system.</p>

<p>Further, there were instances where House information was discovered in an external “cloud” server. The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server.</p>

<p>“That violates House rules and it puts the House at risk,” a source familiar with the investigation said.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether the access issues exposed the House’s networks to potential hackers or spying efforts by unfriendly nations or terrorist groups, at a time when Washington is on high alert for such cyber-activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually the last statement has been refuted. It has been alleged that Imran Awan had achieved a privilege escalation through <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/09/suspect-in-house-it-security-probe-also-had-access-to-dnc-emails/">Social Engineering</a>. Essentially Imran through the political clout of the Congressional leaders he worked for managed to convinced the Capitol Hill IT staff to escalate the Awans to super user privileges to work on the &quot;Congressional Machines&quot; in violation of accepted practices on the network. One device in particular was the Wasserman iPad compromised in the DNC Leak. It has been also alleged they may have had Podesta&#39;s password. Since the Dems approved the privilege escalation it is now forensically difficult to determine if the Russians leaked the emails or the &quot;enormously trustworthy and drunken&quot; Awan brothers sold access to the DNC servers. </p>

<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/13/house-hacking-suspects-could-read-every-email-dozens-of-congressmen-sent-and-received/">House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldn’t be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After obtaining access to the Capitol server system, the Awan brothers could control all aspects of a congressman system. They sold and configured the hardware setting permissions and remote access to maintain the devices remotely. Essentially the keys to the kingdom. Through congressional requests they managed to completely compromise the network. They could read email, transfer files, install applications (i.e. key loggers). The latter reports that the systems and network were completely compromised. Beyond that, Imran had bypassed IT key loggers and reporting systems by gaining remote access directly to congressional computers. </p>

<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/13/house-hacking-suspects-could-read-every-email-dozens-of-congressmen-sent-and-received/">House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers’ access didn’t span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that once they bypassed internal security there was no <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/13/house-hacking-suspects-could-read-every-email-dozens-of-congressmen-sent-and-received/">logging of their actions</a>. House authorities set their sights on the possibility that a remote server had been used to transfer files off of Congressional members computers. The investigation revealed that Imran had been <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/">stealing money, equipment, and over charging for services</a>. In total for almost 10 years and almost 80 Democrat members of Congress were compromised. </p>

<p>This is where things go hinkey. Rather than turning the case over to the FBI the case is turned over to U.S.C. Police. They are investigating the theft, not the data breach. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s state that again...</p>

<h3>The USCP are investigation the theft of Equipment not the Loss Of Congressional Data.</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/feds-arrest-five-congressional-it-contractors-at-the-capitol?utm_term=.jdKQglv0N#.aodQWknOX">Congressional IT Staff Under Investigation In Alleged Procurement Scam</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“At the request of Members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff,” Malecki said in a statement. &quot;No Members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. It should be noted that, administratively, House staff were asked to update their security settings as a best practice. We have no further comment on the ongoing investigation at this time.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Bad Guy</h3>

<h3>Two of the brothers, Imran and Jamal, have been linked to an emerging security breach</h3>

<p>The Awan brothers managed to get access to the Dems committee computers by just asking for the passwords. In addition the Awan brothers sold the congress outrageously priced equipment and broke into members of Congress&#39; offices to steal equipment and or data.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586">House staffers under criminal investigation for alleged equipment theft</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Five House employees are under criminal investigation amid allegations that they stole equipment from more than 20 member offices and accessed House IT systems without lawmakers&#39; knowledge.</p>

<p>More than 20 members were victimized by the alleged procurement scam and chiefs of staff for the lawmakers were briefed on the matter Thursday.</p>

<p>The former staffer said “Jamal was always there,” but Imran would only work “odd hours.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And who is investigating this fiasco?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is the FBI and why have they left it to the DC police? Is it a &quot;limited hangout&quot; they hope to bury by the promoting the administration&#39;s ties to Boris and Natasha? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>D.C. Metro police have been brought into the investigation rather than the F.B.I at the request of the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586">Congressional members</a> involved with the Awan Brothers. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A source in the briefing said the Sergeant-at-Arms confirmed the U.S. Capitol Police is conducting an active criminal investigation but said no arrests have been made. The source said the FBI is not involved in the investigation.</p>

<p>&quot;At the request of members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff. No members are being investigated. No arrests have been made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why aren&#39;t the FBI involved? I can only speculate, but it would mean that a FBI forensic team would have to comb through all of those congressional computers to determine the extent of the security compromise and data lost. The Dems just didn&#39;t seem up for the inconvenience of allowing the FBI investigation to go forward. </p>

<p>The Awan Brothers had the keys to the kingdom. Physical security is paramount to cyber security. If a hacker has Physical access to a machine they own it. It is the simplest hack to conduct. The Anwar Bros had Debbie Wasserman Schultz&#39;s machine, along with Schultz, at least 80 other Dems also hired the <a href="https://emsnews.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/meet-the-awan-brothers-from-pakistan-they-ran-dnc-congress-computers-committed-treason/">Awan Brothers</a> to provide IT support at significantly higher rates than normal IT support. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jamal, who public records suggest is only 22 years old and first began working in the House when he was 20, was paid nearly $160,000 a year, or three times the average House IT staff salary, according to InsideGov, which tracks congressional salaries. Abid was paid $161,000 and Imran $165,000.</p>

<p>Democrats evidently <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/01/pakistani-suspects-in-house-it-probe-received-4-million-from-dem-reps/">paid the Awan brothers over $4 MILLION dollars</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the fact that these individuals, reportedly heavily in debt, would have failed security clearances they were able to receive top salary from Dems including members of the intelligence panel and members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nation’s most sensitive issues, information and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism.</p>

<p>Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who was shamed for the Democratic National Committee conspiracy against Bernie Sanders, recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and Representative Jackie Speier asked for their <a href="https://fas.org/irp/congress/2016_cr/hpsci-hac.pdf">TOP SECRET CLEARANCE</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://subrealism.blogspot.com/2017/02/whatever-happened-with-awan-brothers.html?m=1">Whatever Happened with the Awan Brothers?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/265729/muslim-brotherhood-security-breach-congress-daniel-greenfield">frontpagemag</a> |  Last year, eight members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a demand that their staffers be granted access to top secret classified information.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://fas.org/irp/congress/2016_cr/hpsci-hac.pdf">signatories to the letter</a> were Andre Carson, Luis Guiterez, Jim Himes, Terri Sewell, Jackie Speier, Mike Quigley, Eric Swalwell and Patrick Murphy. All the signatories were Democrats. Some had a history of attempting to undermine national security.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond the debt, the brothers seemed to have, they had convictions for felony traffic offenses including <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/">DUI</a>. Any one of these issues are enough to prevent or revoke a security clearance for normal folks. I guess things just work differently on Capitol Hill. The American military or college grads are denied clearances due similar issues in their record, but not these Pakistani brothers. Any one of these offenses would have caused me to fail my FBI background check at work, but congress can admit anybody. Do you see a problem here? <a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2418">Valerie Jarrett</a> and <a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2556">Huma Abedin</a> are perfect examples of the double standard in the government / Congress. Staffers of any background history can get clearances, but Dems seem to be able to prevent Trump&#39;s staff from getting clearance. What is going on here?</p>

<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/">http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/07/congress-it-probe-suspects-had-massive-debts-years-of-suspicious-activity/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Multiple small businesses and individuals went unpaid as a result of the 2012 bankruptcy. Abid also had an unpaid line of credit of $10,000 with the congressional credit union at the time of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Abid’s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>with possibly opposing goals. A felon normally commits the felony tens of times, maybe hundreds of times before they get caught. How many times does a Coke head commit a felony buying coke before they get caught? If they ever get caught, how many years do they get away with the crimes before they draw the attention of the authorities. The FBI, Congress, whatever never find the full scope of criminal activity. They may just get enough evidence to convict of a crime, but they never convict for all the crimes committed. </p>

<p>What is really becoming obvious is the Democrats have irresponsibly opened our congressional security oversight to Middle Eastern Factions. These 5 are just one group that were exposed. Hillary had Huma, Obama had Vallery. A sharia practicing terrorist that believes in female circumcision leading a woman&#39;s March to equality in the 21st century. There are so many examples that one has to be purposefully obtuse to ignore the contradictions. </p>

<p>While the nay sayers claim you can not connect the dots it is obvious that the dots were there for all to see and could have been connected. I would say that the deviation from standard security practices was intentional, but Podesta&#39;s password was password123 or some such nonsense. Who knows, our leaders may really be that incompetent. They haven&#39;t even made it to the minimum expectations to be employed in corporate America. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know what to make of two very different groups with nothing but vaguely similar beliefs in Marxist ideals working together. Many of the thoughts I have on the subject are almost too extreme to believe, but the evidence is almost unavoidable. None of it makes sense unless someone is lying about their objectives. </p>

<p>Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) confirmed to Politico that Hina Alvi’s last day as an IT support staffer in his office was Tuesday. Her husband, Imran Awan, was working for Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) as of Tuesday evening, but a spokeswoman for Fudge said midday Wednesday that Awan was no longer an employee.</p>

<p>CORRECTION
February 2, 2017, at 9:13 p.m.</p>

<p>This post has been updated and corrected with new information from US Capitol Police, which said no arrests have been made but there is an active investigation ongoing into IT staff who were involved in an alleged procurement scam. A lawmaker briefed on the situation had told BuzzFeed News that arrests were made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, fixed...</p>

<p>What is really becoming obvious is the Democrats have irresponsibly opened our congressional security oversight to Middle Eastern Factions. These 5 are just one group that were exposed. Hillary had Huma, Obama had Vallery. A sharia practicing terrorist that believes in female circumcision leading a woman&#39;s March to equality in the 21st century. There are so many examples that one has to be purposefully obtuse to ignore the contradictions. </p>

<p>While the nay sayers claim you can not connect the dots it is obvious that the dots were there for all to see and could have been connected. I would say that the deviation from standard security practices was intentional, but Podesta&#39;s password was password123 or some such nonsense. Who knows, our leaders may really be that incompetent. They haven&#39;t even made it to the minimum expectations to be employed in corporate America. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know what to make of two very different groups with nothing but vaguely similar beliefs in Marxist ideals working together. Many of the thoughts I have on the subject are almost too extreme to believe, but the evidence is almost unavoidable. None of it makes sense unless someone is lying about their objectives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell yeah! Keep it up! I&#39;ve been trying to get my guitar back from my friend. I loaned it to him so he could get better so we could make some killer tunes, but I haven&#39;t seen him in like 2 months now. It&#39;s all good. Been too busy with my kids to do much of anything these days. I&#39;ve been steering clear of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> since I quit. Honestly that place is becoming an embarassment and I&#39;m glad I stepped away from it. The current mods are just fucking the place all up, and when I offered friendly advice to one that I thought was okay, he basically spit in my face. So fuck them. Let them go down with the ship. I&#39;m all about objective reality, and half of the stuff that is on there these days is not really my style.  How has life been treating you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, just wanted to say great idea with this message! (I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s new anyway, unless I&#39;ve developed early onset Alzheimer&#39;s).</p>

<p>I personally have never had an issue with this, since I can&#39;t recall ever thinking an inappropriate post was stickied, but more transparency is nearly always a good thing. And hopefully it will cut down on the comments accusing single mods of stickying whatever they want.</p>

<p>p.s. As a side note, have you guys had any discussion regarding a possible text-only day? In the post it was mentioned, one of the mods said they hope they don&#39;t forget to bring it up, so I figured I&#39;d remind if it hasn&#39;t been brought up for discussion yet. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This really sounds like a CIA operation. They are the ones with the know how, friends in high places and unlimited budget. They also have no qualms with hacking our representatives either. </p>

<p>They were caught back in 2014 for hacking into senator computers  who sat on the senate intelligence committee. </p>

<p>They just so happened to be investigating them at the time. <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/world/senate-intelligence-commitee-cia-interrogation-report.html">Here is source</a></p>

<p>Imo it much more plausible they found something very damaging on the Dems and been using it as blackmail every since.</p>

<p>They (dems) could also very well behind the CIA leaks in an attempt to discredit them in the future and possibly broken up entirely. This would make Americans doubt wether or not the CIAs blackmail info is legit or not.</p>

<p>Reminds me of Hoover and his file containing dirt on important  officials with massive amounts of power. Whatever the case there is clearly a war being waged in Washington right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks!  I wish I was better with tech stuff.</p>

<p>This will sound super crazy and I could be mistaken.  That one with the archive is dated 2/3.  I am almost certain the original one with all the dead links mentioned a thumb drive and other info and was posted on 2/2.  I THOUGHT I remembered that in my head that a thumb drive was mentioned in original story but then couldn&#39;t find it in any of the other articles which was how I ended up running into these dead articles.  I started trying to search specific terms and then searched a different news story that I could see from one of the descriptions on one of the sites with a dead link and it had either a 2/1 or 2/2 date.  More odd, I was unable to come up with anything from google and only found the dead links on bing and DDG.
If you search only on 2/2 for &quot;capitol police&quot; computer on bing you get another dead one with some local tulsa site ( <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/government/ap/house-it-workers-targeted-in-investigation-by-capitol-police/article_11876995-e18c-54a0-8ef0-35808f03e2df.html">http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/government/ap/house-it-workers-targeted-in-investigation-by-capitol-police/article_11876995-e18c-54a0-8ef0-35808f03e2df.html</a>)
It makes me think there was something issued on 2/2 that got pulled somehow.  But I also look great with a tinfoil cap on.</p>

<p>Two diff summaries still produce gogle results, dunno if there is topic-specific motivation (ie, someone got mad) or the article to be removed from some but not other sites, or if it&#39;s a regular thing that some sites have evaporating AP articles (cost? Dunno).  Try each of these if you haven&#39;t drowned inthe last bunnie hole :)  </p>

<p>In 2013, Rep. Gregory Meeks, the crooked legislator from South Queens, was named as “one of the most corrupt members of Congress” for the second year in a row, but now curious minds are beginning to wonder will he retain the title this year?</p>

<p>The nine-term member of Congress from NY’s 5th Congressional District was slammed by a report issued by CREW, The Citizens For Responsibility And Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit organization “dedicated to promoting ethics and accountability in government and public life by targeting government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests.”</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2010/04/subpoena-issued-to-meeks-in-probe-035837">damning indictment</a> is divided into three annotated cases including:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first two links use CREW as a source and do not claim that Meeks is regarded as the most corrupt congressman. CREW also does not make this claim. He is more corrupt than most, but if you read CREW&#39;s reports then you will see that other congressmen are accused of more serious acts than Meeks.</p>

<p>As for the last link, this one actually does make the claim that he is widely regarded as the most corrupt congressman:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although he has plenty of competition, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) is generally regarded by watchdog groups as the most corrupt member of Congress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The source is the National Legal and Policy Center. This is a <strong>right leaning</strong> ethics watchdog. CREW is non-partisan. The NLPC has a vested interest in saying that the most corrupt congressman is a Democrat, even though Republican congressmen have been accused of more damaging things. Compare these three congressmen:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Gregory Meeks allegedly improperly accepted all-expense paid trips and gifts. Ok... But how did this <em>impact</em> his legislating? That&#39;s very important in determining how corrupt he is. (And by the way, he wasn&#39;t a part of the Allen Stanford Ponzi scheme as the NLPC seems to imply. They are purposefully being misleading)</p></li>
<li><p>David Rivera is being investigated for money laundering and tax evasion schemes. He allegedly cooked campaign books and funneled campaign funds to his friends and family. This is basically stealing from his donors.</p></li>
<li><p>David Vitter allegedly solicited prostitutes and attempted bribery of the US Secretary of Interior. &quot;According to the CREW report, Vitter told Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar that <em>he would block legislation granting the secretary&#39;s pay raise until the Department issued six permits for deepwater exploratory wells each month</em>.&quot; <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/congress-corrupt-list-2012-9#sen-david-vitter-r-la-6">Source</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How is improperly accepting gifts worse than stealing from donors or attempted bribery? In the latter 2 cases, the congressmen actually use their power to screw over people.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/congress-corrupt-list-2012-9">This Business Insider article</a> has a summary of some of CREW&#39;s findings, including pages about Vitter, Rivera, and Meeks.</p>

<p>The idea that Meeks is widely regarded as the most corrupt member of congress is not true. The NLPC is biased garbage.</p>

<p>Come on, I see your point, but isn&#39;t it cutting it a bit fine. Besides I would really have to say it depends on who gives the gifts rather than the size of the gift. </p>

<p>A meeting with a Middle Eastern sheik could be far more serious on the world and political stage than a million dollars bribe from an American business man. </p>

<p>No matter how you cut it, he is in the top 10 rotten politicians. I endeavor to root them all out one at a time. </p>

<p>That would be serious. But it would require the cooperation of many congressmen. Meeks, as an individual, doesn&#39;t have much sway in the party or congress.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Well, I don&#39;t know about top 10, but he&#39;s up there. He accepts many gifts (other congressmen have accepted gifts, but not to his degree it seems), but does this change how he votes or acts in an official capacity? I don&#39;t know, these watchdog groups seem to only focus on the accepting gifts part.</p>

What are the distributions of ethnicities(‘races’ as you love to call them) and cultists(‘religions’ as you love to call them) in the u.s. presently, and historically when all the “GREAT” times were happening?

Couldn&#39;t agree with you more!!🎯🎯🎯
Yes, the problem is immigrants come into our country - through our own good will - but instead of being grateful &amp; trying to understand, embrace, respect &amp; assimilate to our culture.....they immediately complain we are &quot;Intolerant&quot; of THEIR ways, their culture, their religion, &quot;Racist&quot; bc we don&#39;t give them everything they want , how they want it, and when they want it...on OUR DIME of course!🙄 They demand WE assimilate to THEIR culture. They disrespect our forefathers, laws, gather to protest, burn our flag, flip us off, tell us it&#39;s no longer &quot;our&quot; country...it&#39;s THEIR country now, &amp; wish &amp; plan for OUR demise.
The blatant disrespect immigrants show towards us is infuriating. I just cannot imagine myself behaving that way if I were allowed, by a people, to enter &amp; live in a country that&#39;s not mine, bc my living conditions are inadequate, receive free money that I didn&#39;t earn taken from SOMEONE ELSE who DID earn that money but whom it was taken away to be given to me, &amp; have free healthcare &amp; education and then turn around and &quot;thank&quot; those very same people by demanding THEY now accept my old country&#39;s customs &amp; laws over their own. 
Why would anyone think it&#39;s ok to take and take and take from a people &amp; exhaust their resources bc your country SUCKED....&amp; do nothing but COMPLAIN  about how &quot;MISTREATED&quot;!😳🙄 you feel, how you suffer from &quot;oppression&quot; 😳🙄, &quot;Racism&quot;😳🙄 &amp; &quot;bigotry&quot; 😳🙄....from the VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO OPENED THEIR OWN COUNTRY UP TO YOU, ALLOW YOU TO CO-EXIST WITH THEM, &amp; WHO PAY ALL OF YOUR EXPENSES WITH THE MONEY THEY WORKED FOR! 
And on top of that...we are lectured to by the Left that we need to be more &quot;accepting&quot;, more &quot;tolerant&quot;, more &quot;culturally sensitive&quot;, more &quot;accommodating to their cultural demands&quot;.
MORE!?? How can we possibly be MORE gracious!?
I think the lecture is being given to the wrong audience. 
We need to start demanding IMMIGRANTS to be more accepting, tolerant, culturally sensitive, &amp; accommodating of OUR cultural demands!
We need to start teaching immigrants to be GRATEFUL &amp; to THANK us for OUR SACRIFICE of our time, resources, land, money, &amp; opportunities. 
Immigrants need to learn to RESPECT us &amp; all that we have done FOR them. Just LETTING them into our country is more than enough. But we go on to bankroll them &amp; their CHILDREN for LIFE! Yet..it&#39;s never enough..they always want, expect, push for more....and we continue to accommodate...and WE NEED TO STOP &amp; demand THEY accommodate &amp; to be grateful for WHATEVER we decide to &quot;GIFT&quot; them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was anyone in the Awan family also employed by the DNC? Or were they only employed by Congress? I have read most (but not all) of the articles, and while they talk about &quot;access to DNC emails&quot;, none of the articles specifically answer whether they were also employed by the DNC.
Given the large number of Awan family supporters and their positions within the DNC, isn&#39;t it logical that they would also be offered jobs at the DNC? If DWS (and others) had high enough opinions of their work to justify the salary and security clearances, why would these same people hesitate to offer them DNC jobs in their IT section? I am not aware of any prohibition for a congressional IT worker to also be employed by the DNC. I also have not seen a situation where anyone related to the Awan family <em>ever</em> turned down a job offer.
If they were employed by the DNC, then they would probably also have had admin access to <em>everything</em> at the DNC. Logic would then dictate that they would need to be eliminated as suspects from the DNC data breach before any other suspects could be realistically considered.
Could they have been stupid enough to list DNC salary on bankruptcy filings? Is there any way to conclusively prove/disprove whether they were also employed by the DNC? I think if a researcher here could make this connection (and researchers here have made far more obscure connections) then that would completely destroy the &quot;russian hacking&quot; narrative. Could this be why the MSM is so hesitant to touch this case?
I apologize if this question has been answered already. I have read many (but not all) of the source documents in this thread, but I have yet to see one that conclusively answers whether anyone in this family was also employed by the DNC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry if I missed something, but can we prove that their access as an employee of DWS would give them root access to the entire DNC? It&#39;s logical that if they had <em>any</em> employment at the DNC, then they would use the same social engineering to grant themselves admin access to DNC servers. As employees of DWS, then all that proves (for now) is that they had the same access rights as DWS, which I doubt is admin-level access (why would someone as technically illiterate as DWS be automatically granted admin level access to DNC servers?)</p>

<p>I can&#39;t take anyone seriously who gets basic facts like that wrong. A two second google search can show anyone how that statement is factually inaccurate.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the time to debunk your super long post, but since you are wrong about such basic facts I have to assume the rest of your post is littered with inaccuracies and half truths.</p>

<p>Should we also discuss the fact that there is literally no evidence that they actually stole state secrets? Or that calling it a &quot;breach&quot; is, itself, a highly misleading statement, considering they were paid IT staff with approved access?</p>

<p>Wasserman Schultz’s assistant Rosalyn Kumar tells scheduler Anna Stolitzka: “[Nancy] Pelosi is doing [a] closed door meeting. No staff or anyone allowed. Kaitlyn come to Rayburn room and get her iPad for Imran.”</p>

<p>The smoking gun for me is the salaries these fuckers were getting.</p>

<p>It is almost executive level IT salaries for seemingly a bunch of sysadmins doing sysadmin work. Ask anyone in IT staffing biz if this makes sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imran, who started working for Wasserman Schultz in 2005, received $164,600 in 2016, with close to $20,000 of that coming from Wasserman Schultz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jamal, who started working as a staffer in 2014, was paid $157,350.12 in 2016. Abid, who started working in 2005, was paid $160,943 in 2016.</p>

<p>Unless you are a rockstar working at a well funded organisation you aren&#39;t making 160K as a sysadmin. This needs deeper looking into.</p>

<p>This is the most idiotic thing I&#39;ve read in reddit in days. He was referencing the media, which is in fact mostly left leaning. Take your bullshit Sean Hannity Fox News &quot;pull yourself up back your bootstraps&quot; mentality somewhere else. </p>

<p>&quot;Right, poor people are poor because they are lazy or have &quot;low value.&quot; It&#39;s not the greedy rich elite who&#39;s the problem, it&#39;s the tiny minority group of trans people wanting respect and dignity.

I don&#39;t even know what to say to you. Where have you been these last 18 months. Russian Collusion is STILL headline news...even though there&#39;s been NO PROOF as you say....even AFTER FBI has investigated, SP is investigating (&amp; keeps expanding. scope of investigation bc he CAN&#39;T find anything)...yet here we all are...in the Propaganda Present....1 year later....NO EVIDENCE...NO PROOF....NOTHING....yet still....the media is beating it like a f*cking dead horse.
So you can stop with the &quot;pretend&quot; outrage that someone could be upset that MSM is not covering a story THIS BIG bc they do not yet have &quot;CONCRETE PROOF&quot;! 🙄😂😂😂 
So...yeah...straight up 🙄 (I&#39;m taking a wild stab in the dark here...but based on how you write....you&#39;re a Black Democrat?🤔 amiright? 🎯😆</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True that. But neither can the constituents. The reason I&#39;m railing on this and the clinton server is these are huge crimes. Yes, I know the Republicans do corrupt this too, but nothing compares to these stories. If the Dems would do something to root out the evil in their party we could move on to new scandals. They just currently hold the crown as the biggest dirt bags. </p>

<p>Clean out the clinton machine and the old blood so we can move on to McCain and Graham. I got plenty of dirty on them destroying freedom, I just don&#39;t have time to write snout it with these other scandals going on </p>

<p>In short just admit hillary and Podesta are criminals and throw them in jail and we&#39;ll goo after some corrupt Republicans to say thanks. If we throw enough of these fools in prison on both sides we may be able to clean up the government. </p>

<p>This is a nonsensical statement, just my opinion.  There is a massive difference between defending the rights of refugees and religious minorities and supporting bloodthirsty despots bent on using religion as a means to power and domination over the weak.  </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a comment on anything else in the post but this one sentence, seemingly thrown in for no valid purpose other than opinion and slant.  If CNN is wrong for doing it, this post is too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with you, but as I got deeper in to the story I find ties to Hezbollah and some even deeper ties that I haven&#39;t written about for lack of proof. </p>

<p>The media ignores subjects and in many cases fails to cover subjects due to an ideological bent. The left&#39;s connection to Islam baffels me. Islam stands against everything the American left supports. I really don&#39;t understand the support other than their mutual hate for the United States&#39; ideals. </p>

<p>Which brings us back to the story, why would Dems, why would Debbie Wasserman Schultz support these Islamic spies. While I might have failed to express this in the post their is a connection that is obvious in the headlines every day. </p>

<p>I was in Rwanda and Guatemala in the 90&#39;s, Venezuela and Columbia around 2000. These folks screaming Marxism have no idea what their asking for. They are indolent coddled fools. They are only supporting Islam because of their similar views on a twisted Marxist utopia. It&#39;s a terrifying thought that they would join forces to subvert the nation to advance their goals. I read their books and papers, I understand what their objectives are, and I have to, as a matter of conscience, stand against their success. </p>

<p>The reason I mentioned the quote, but failed to elaborate on it because the mindset is important to understand the motives, but didn&#39;t want to get to involved with the larger problem and distract from the subject at hand. I probably should have left it out, but it is important to understand story in the context of the rest of current events. </p>

<p>&quot;Working With the Muslim Brotherhood&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Congresswoman Michele Bachmann recently accused Huma Abedin, aide to Hillary Clinton US Secretary of State, as being an infiltrated spy for the Muslim Brotherhood (MB). Bachmann says that the US government has been compromised by the MB and Abedin is working for “America’s demise.”</p>

<p>Bachmann pointed out that Abedin has “routine access to [Clinton] and policymaking.”</p>

<p>&quot;Unmasking the Brotherhood: Syria, Egypt, and Beyond&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the US-NATO sponsored war against the Assad government, the Muslim Brotherhood has emerged as the leading western-sanctioned force, the avant-garde of the imperialist assault.&quot;</p>

<p>“The people of Egypt are aware of the fact that the USA has stabbed Egypt in the back with the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi. It is nothing that Egypt will easily forget, or forgive”.</p>

<ul>
<li>Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah Al-Sisi, </li>
</ul>

<p>Once they took back Egypt from the Muslim Brotherhood and jailed Morsi.  Although, apparently the US and Egypt have already mended ties with Trump. </p>
