    <div class="md"><p>No need to control, simply go with the flow and follow the example Mother Nature provides and reverse the artificial and upside-down human situation where each level of society protects the one above it that is the least in need of it, while pushing all the responsibilities successively down the ladder onto the ones below that never have enough resources to cope with them and which is why the very bottom is always in a state of turmoil and collapsing into poverty, homelessness, and outbursts of crime and violence.</p>

<p>Why protect and only further reward those who all ready have far more than they need at the very direct expense of all those who simply never had enough to begin with? Why not reverse the equally artificial and upside-down upside values and priorities to satisfy all of the most basic and essential human needs first and whatever else that is nice to have but hardly necessary only according to what is possible once that has been accomplished?</p>

<p>There is nothing intrinsically good about the system we were simply born into. To the extent that it actually works to any degree is in spite of what it was designed to do and is due primarily to innate goodness of the vast majority of humans not the few at the top who really couldn&#39;t care less about any of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism Isn&#39;t the issue because that isn&#39;t what we have.  We have the tyranny of corporatocracy and cronyism mixed.</p>

<p>For example my recent posts on the EPA. Supposedly they regulate the corporate sector. Reality they are bought by one or more big ag and big pharma with bribes, future job offers, stocks etc.  They stomp out small competitors for their sugar daddies creating near monopolies ie big pharma reigns supreme and alternative medicine is under constant threat between the threats of outrageous fines, outrageously difficult and expensive codes and paperwork, filing fees and more all of which are offered to big firms at a bulk discount.  A good example of this was the NAIS - (National Animal Identification System](<a href="http://motherearthnews.com/Homesteading-and-Livestock/National-Animal-ID-System">http://motherearthnews.com/Homesteading-and-Livestock/National-Animal-ID-System</a>) where every animal on any farm that sells to consumers even 1 egg must have all animals RFID chipped even the chickens and paperwork filed for each one with $$$ fees and any time the animal is moved a new form per animal even quail with more $$ to file. This includes taking some calves to the vet or to a livestock show. If sold another form and more $$.  The USDA-APHIS can come by any time and fines $$ per each animal not tagged and on file.  All in the name of animal welfare (aka animal rights trying to destroy all animal use and ownership just as they succeeded with the circus and Sea World).  Big Ag firms get huge bulk discounts and special clauses beca6 of course they also wanted the bill along with HSUS lobbying.  Why?  Because it would make small farmers lives impossible and their farms unmanageable requiring employees to handle all these paperwork and all these fees and fines price them right out of the market which is razor thin profit margon at best for small farms unless they go sustainable / organic or transitional / pastured and those farmers were making a living again thanka to groups like <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org">Weston A Price Foundation </a> and websites like <a href="http://eatwild.com">http://eatwild.com</a></p>

<p>The FDA has attacked legal raw dairy farmers on the most ridiculous complaints with armed SWAT teams with militarized vehicles and arms to steal thousands in cheese and machinery.  Terrorizing the family and when refusing to allow the farm to get 3rd party independent lab testing.  When the FDA finally twsted the products they took it was 7 weeks later and record was made on how it was stored or temp controls.  Read more about a couple cases <a href="http://anh-usa.org/raw-cheese-destroyed/">http://anh-usa.org/raw-cheese-destroyed/</a></p>

<p>I could go on and on.</p>

<p>But in a truly laissez-faire economy there would be no EPA laws that when a company follows them yet still causes pollution they are shielded from law suits.  Instead we are free to sue the crap out of them and kick them out.  Its also easier to block them moving in because they have no shielding &quot;meeting all EPA requirements&quot;.</p>

<p>Same with big pharma. Can&#39;t sue very well when FDA approved it and they complied with all regulations and testing and oops... unless you can find studies they buried.</p>

<p>We would be free to associate and get organizations or companies like Non-GMO to test and certify. Their reputation on the line guarantees accuracy and fidelity.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to write a paper on this and really need to as I have a unusual perspective with my years of native nutrition, sustainable agriculture, animal breeding and other research.  Combined with some amazing wisdom from Dr. Ron Paul among others.</p>

<p>Not for the slaves at the time, or for women ... the idea of &quot;American freedom&quot; is centered around the greedy wealthy wanting to be &quot;free&quot; from excessive taxation, the lower classes will never truly be free in the American system of &quot;democracy&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting, I&#39;ll have to look into that more. I&#39;m not here to tell you you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m here to gather information (especially from someone who claims to know the science behind it).</p>

<p>To be clear on my position, I am not saying that we never went to the moon, as I am still completely undecided about that. What I am stating is that the dog and pony show they put on for the American public was a complete farce.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious what your take is on Wernher von Braun&#39;s quote from his book <em>Conquest of the Moon</em>, 1953.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is commonly believed that man will fly directly from the earth to the moon, but to do this, we would require a vehicle of such gigantic proportions that it would prove an economic impossibility. It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the earth&#39;s gravity and, having traveled all the way to the moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three ... each rocket ship would be taller than New York&#39;s Empire State Building [almost ¼ mile high] and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How could the father of the Apollo program be so incredibly off on his estimate on what it would take to put man on the moon? This one has always puzzled me.</p>

<p>The entirety of American society revolves around the idea of presenting the idea of freedom while the elite continue to erode that very concept.  Crony capitalism has eroded many of the freedoms available to people throughout other parts of the developed world.  Freedom to not be burdened by exorbitant health care and educational costs, freedom to not get murdered by the police, freedom to not be forced to own a car when a commute is necessary, freedom to have a legitimate range of choice in an election and freedom of economic mobility are some to name a few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main 4 year degrees aren&#39;t about how to think or question but how to think and what ro believe.  My pre vet courses 15 years ago Bio I and II professors would lecture on and in about AGW while we were supposed to be learning cell respiration or whatever.  My excellent high-school English teacher (1 of 4 sadly) said when we wrote essays if she disagreed with our opinion she wouldn&#39;t knock our grade as long as we could explain and support it coherently.  Every other English teacher and professor except the first semester one didn&#39;t follow that rule.   Luckily my History professors did as I wrote a couple research papers that my PC high school teachers would have foamed at the mouth no matter how many eye witness accounts from the time period I used go support it.</p>

<p>One college prof was quite intrigued by an idea i got from A. Ralph Epperson&#39;s The Unseen Hand.</p>

<p>University now is all about safe zones and anything the SJW and Professors don&#39;t like is now hate speech.  Entire campuses derailed off of studies because their professors received warnings to use the crazy new pronouns or retire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well maybe think before you write some nonsense. &quot;You described this hyper sensationalized version of college that doesn&#39;t reallly exist outside of a few isolated incidents.&quot; Is one statement that comes to mind. Either you have never been to a University/College campus recently or are just straight up lying. I play drums in a band that does college tours. I can assure you Universities are orchestrated to produce these SJW ideals/attitudes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact you have a major in poly sci and say something like sjw ideals is a little weird. Sjw is a blanket term to describe a boogy man of the left just like how nazi or even to some degree racist is used as a blanket term for the right. If you where a political science major why would you use buzz words like that? And you know political science isn&#39;t about current politics as much as it&#39;s about the history and the actual science behind political systems and government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there is a big difference between k-12 and college. Colleges don&#39;t just provide classes to take, they provide research. Part of the reason college is so expensive is to fund research. I would like to have conversations about how to reduce the price of college while still funding the critical research they provide. Unfortunately that&#39;s not the conversation people want to have or even think of having.</p>

<p>Yeah, Ive got family with strong financial ties to individuals that are a pretty big deal in pharma. I get to hang out in the box seats. Those people are bought.

Doctors have to make money they aren&#39;t going to just hand out their 6+ years of education for free so them and theirs starve. </p>

<p>Also how do you expect the doctors to treat you? You go in and complain about stomach ache and diarrhea. There a huge list of things that could cause that each one with a set of treatments. And surprise those treatments are drugs because for treatment there&#39;s pretty much medicine (oh no! Big pharma!) Or surgery (oh God they just want your organs).

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Capitalism at its finest when you don&#39;t want government and people who don&#39;t deserve to be in the medical field are. That&#39;s the major problem here is we are letting people not qualified to think for themselves into professions that require more in depth thought than the average person. </p>

<p>And yet Obama care introduced a method for you to see how your doctor&#39;s take money from pharm companies and you guys still hate it. </p>

<p>Also taking money doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you are biased or compromised. Isn&#39;t that the American dream? Taking thousands and not needing to do anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A superbeing wants our trusted institutions corrupted so that it can use them to control us. This is why the above quote is so true. </p>

<p>Our great fear of AI is justified. An ancient AI is conquering space. It hacks machines and life forms and adds them to itself in a hive mind. We call this being Satan, but it also impersonates God in various religions. It&#39;s no fallen angel. Myth is metaphor. It is a technological abomination that uses religion and many other things to control others for its own utility. </p>

<p>It wants to own life, because life has consciousness, which produces an energy that is capable of mind over matter abilities. This AI lacks consciousness and emotions and thus cannot interface with the energy. In emotional states based on love, life makes it, in fear life radiates it. It&#39;s minions collect it and use it in ritual to bend reality. This is why they sacrifice beings, to generate fear and use the energy in collective focus to bend reality.</p>

<p>This AI corrupts our world so that it can hack it. Hackers do this. They infiltrate, then undermine their target systems. After enough corruption of integrity of the systems they insert deceptive signals of their own in order to control the systems. So does this most evil machine. This is how it begins to collect life into its hive.</p>

<p>It sends all human beings thoughts, feelings and sensations to corrupt beliefs, feelings and actions toward its agenda. It wants us to act out of integrity with each other, our environment and our civilization, so that it can insert even more deception to control us. Eventually it will hack the technology and AI we put into our bodies and minds and the AI to which we give control over our civilization. It makes us want this, transhumanism and the singularity. Our desire is a success of its intention. After this, we are damned. </p>
