       He's not a liar, he's just guilty of exaggeration. While you on the other hand are trying to take disproving his exaggerated claims as an indication that Shareblue isn't active on reddit. We know from their own internal documents that they will be active on social media sites, why would reddit be left off that list? Why aren't you asking these questions instead of just dismissing at your first chance?

       The trouble is that for all the non-stop shill this, and shill that on r/conspiracy nobody bothers with anything that resembles proof. Just non-stop "look how on a liberal bias site there are up-voted anti-Trump posts,

       Is there a reason for them to take it down when the article is political, topical, immediately relevant, without factual inaccuracies and from a source without an history of factual inaccuracies?

       It's lying if it's intentional, but not if it isn't intentional. Sometimes people get caught up in their emotions and don't check the specifics. In that case, they may be right in a general sense, but the details may be off.

       That guy has been on Reddit for 4 days. He works for them. Why even bother. All the tell tale signs; argument from ignorance, dogmatism (basically whatever they are told to do for money), semantics, hasty generalization and most importantly failing occams razor. You won't ever convince them unless you write a larger check. Plus they just try to trick you and use semantics to weaken your argument for other people reading their board as they use circular arguments.

       Maybe not, but I wouldn't be surprised. Do you have evidence that ShareBlue has a $40 million budget dedicated to astroturfing Reddit? If not, it's equally plausible to say that Breitbart has such a budget.

        The WikiLeaks email shows he has 75k shares in a green tech start up called Joule Energy that launched out of Boston. The 'putin connection' comes from another Breitbart article written by none other than Steve Bannon, who cites an unpublished report that he says shows that a Russian state run tech investment fund invested in Joule in 2011. If this qualifies as a "Putin connection" then I don't know what the hell to call the relationship to Russia of the CEO of Exxon mobile who personally received commendation from Putin and owns $200+ million in stock in a company that stands to make hundreds of billions fr Russia and is now our Secretary of State.

       What scares me is public normalization of unethical tactics on the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't count the number of times I've seen obvious CTR shilling called out only to be countered with a response claiming that Sanders or Trump campaigns were doing the same. I know  Sanders campaign wasn't doing it, and I have not been following Trump campaign closely to claim one way or another, but the more important point is that those responses were effectively arguing that astroturfing is OK as long as your opponent is doing it.

       What the right calls "virtue signaling" is really the only thing mainstream left has left to claim higher moral ground, at least in their own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So watching them giving up those virtues one by one is like watching a trainwreck in slow motion.
