        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the hearings on Russia going on earlier comments by CrowdStrike are extremely suspect.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-penetrated-dnc-stole-opposition-research-on-trump/2016/06/14/cf006cb4-316e-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html?utm_term=.fc8fb8bbbdeb">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-penetrated-dnc-stole-opposition-research-on-trump/2016/06/14/cf006cb4-316e-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html?utm_term=.fc8fb8bbbdeb</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>CrowdStrike is not sure how the hackers got in. The firm suspects they may have targeted DNC employees with “spearphishing” emails. These are communications that appear legitimate — often made to look like they came from a colleague or someone trusted — but that contain links or attachments that when clicked on deploy malicious software that enables a hacker to gain access to a computer. “But we don’t have hard evidence,” Alperovitch said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hold on. So you&#39;re not sure how they got in, you believe it&#39;s by spearphishing campaigns but you don&#39;t have hard evidence? Seeing as CrowdStrike were the only ones who examined the DNC servers, they are the only ones who would have been able to find any evidence of such a breach but they claim not to have any hard evidence. That being said if the only people who could have found evidence didn&#39;t come up with any then why did the government release the Grizzly Steppe report specifically citing spearphishing as the method of infiltration when there&#39;s no hard evidence ? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf">https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia’s civilian and military intelligence services engaged in aggressive and sophisticated cyber-enabled operations targeting the U.S. government and its citizens. The U.S. Government refers to this activity as GRIZZLY STEPPE. These cyber operations included spearphishing campaigns targeting government organizations, critical infrastructure entities, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations, and theft of information from these organizations. This stolen information was later publicly released by third parties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it maybe because Grizzly Steppe has this disclaimer at the top basically saying none of this carries weight </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/xqoYS">https://imgur.com/a/xqoYS</a></p>

<p>So the CrowdStrike report has no hard evidence and Grizzly Steppe is based off of that report. Together they are the complete basis for the Russian hacking theory and we&#39;ve just seen that there&#39;s no evidence for any of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP why are you linking to the Washington Post while trying to make claims about CrowdStrike?</p>

<p>You can see their report online for yourself that directly contradicts the notion that CrowdStrike did not have any evidence </p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/">https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/</a></p>

<p>Where you&#39;ll see that they did identify the code used in the hacks</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The COZY BEAR intrusion relied primarily on the SeaDaddy implant developed in Python and compiled with py2exe and another Powershell backdoor with persistence accomplished via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) system, which allowed the adversary to launch malicious code automatically after a specified period of system uptime or on a specific schedule. The Powershell backdoor is ingenious in its simplicity and power. It consists of a single obfuscated command setup to run persistently, such as:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed by code</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s more</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This one-line powershell command, stored only in WMI database, establishes an encrypted connection to C2 and downloads additional powershell modules from it, executing them in memory. In theory, the additional modules can do virtually anything on the victim system. The encryption keys in the script were different on every system. Powershell version of credential theft tool MimiKatz was also used by the actors to facilitate credential acquisition for lateral movement purposes.</p>

<p>FANCY BEAR adversary used different tradecraft, deploying X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file transmission and keylogging. It was executed via rundll32 commands such as:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And once again, followed by more code. </p>

<p>All of this evidence was corroborated by other cybsersecurity firms and nearly the intelligence community.</p>

<p>And before anyone tries to move the goal posts by demanding the evidence that links this to Russia I&#39;ll outright say it now, I don&#39;t believe the public will ever truly get all of the details and facts so this evidence will likely never come.</p>

<p>However, to claim this lack of a smoking gun is proof that there was no Russian involvement is bullshit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? There&#39;s evidence of an intrusion yes. But they have no idea how they got in. There&#39;s no evidence that shows who they are and how they go in. End of story. What you&#39;ve shown is what they say is the evidence of an intrusion. Because like I pointed out they were the only ones to access the server so there&#39;s no way to prove that they actually found that code in the DNC system. Other tech firms have confirmed that the suggested evidence of an intrusion is accurate but that&#39;s still just corroborating what CrowdStrike says. Call it goal post moving if you want but my point hasn&#39;t changed. There&#39;s no evidence to support <em>their</em> claims. There&#39;s evidence to support the DNCs claim that they were hacked which you pointed out with that code, but there&#39;s no evidence to support <em>CrowdStrikes</em> claims.</p>

<p>I link to the WCIAshington Post because there was a direct quote from the CTO of CrowdStrike stating they had no hard evidence for their claims of attribution and method of attack. You say goal post moving I say you&#39;re trying to pull a nice strawman on me. It&#39;s interesting that you ignore the direct quote and it&#39;s context and revert back to pointing to evidence that a hack occurred. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well where&#39;s the evidence? The bottom line is they haven&#39;t shown any. And it doesn&#39;t matter if every computer expert in the world corroborates their claims if no one else has looked at the server. I&#39;m not contradicting myself at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is literally spelled out in CrowdStrike&#39;s assessment. You&#39;re saying there is no evidence when they clearly provide evidence. It just isn&#39;t &quot;hard&quot; evidence. Meaning they cannot say with 100% certainty but they can still make a determination on what likely happened. I don&#39;t know what you consider &quot;hard&quot; evidence. Note that the rep for CrowdStrike doesn&#39;t say they are retracting their findings.</p>

<p>It does matter if a lot of security experts corroborate it, if there is a general consensus among them why would you discount them? Because they didn&#39;t have physical access to the server?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s literally not spelled out. They lay out the evidence to show an intrusion and that&#39;s not what&#39;s in question I don&#39;t think anyone denies that the DNC was hacked. They provide no evidence to support any claims of attribution or methodology of the hack. The &quot;evidence&quot; provided could suggest many different perpetrators so it&#39;s not evidence of anything at all. The analogy that was floating around today was that it&#39;s the equivalent to finding a kalishnakov at a shooting and saying &quot;it was the Russians!&quot; It&#39;s not even soft evidence it&#39;s just straight up bullshit. </p>

<p>And yes because if CrowdStrike is the only one who saw the servers then we have to trust them that they are telling the truth about what they found. And it&#39;s already been shown that they are at least unreliable (Ukraine situation) and not to mention they have an extreme extreme financial conflict of interest.    </p>

I fully understand what their report says and there&#39;s not evidence. End of story. If there was they would be parading it in front of us. There is just flat out nothing that proves that it was anyone in particular. It&#39;s the equivalent of finding a kalishnakov at the scene of a shooting and saying &quot;it was the Russians!&quot;. </p>

<p>And both their investors and their board of directors are involved in funding the campaigns of people effected by the leaks, Clinton most notably but many more. From Warburg Pincus to Google Capital there&#39;s an extreme bias in the money that goes into CrowdStrike. And the DNC decided to hire them, and the DNC decided to deny the FBI access to the servers which was a massive miscarriage of justice. There should have been several parties that got a chance to examine it. There&#39;s no reason for them to do that besides the need to hide something. Can you give me a logical reason for denying the FBI access besides needing to hide something?also CrowdStrike has already been proven to incompetent and inaccurate see their Ukrainian artillery botched job </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give me a report of this detail and quality and I&#39;ll accept that as proof. This is a 56 page report documenting a Chinese hacking team and goes quite in depth in breaking down every step of the their process and the supporting data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s literally not spelled out. They lay out the evidence to show an intrusion and that&#39;s not what&#39;s in question I don&#39;t think anyone denies that the DNC was hacked. They provide no evidence to support any claims of attribution or methodology of the hack. The &quot;evidence&quot; provided could suggest many different perpetrators so it&#39;s not evidence of anything at all. The analogy that was floating around today was that it&#39;s the equivalent to finding a kalishnakov at a shooting and saying &quot;it was the Russians!&quot; It&#39;s not even soft evidence it&#39;s just straight up bullshit. </p>

<p>And yes because if CrowdStrike is the only one who saw the servers then we have to trust them that they are telling the truth about what they found. And it&#39;s already been shown that they are at least unreliable (Ukraine situation) and not to mention they have an extreme extreme financial conflict of interest.    </p>
