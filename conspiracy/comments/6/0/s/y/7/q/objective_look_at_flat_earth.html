<p>I&#39;ve given a good deal of consideration and attention to this topic..
In videos I see many FE believers conflicting with popular science to support their evidence of how it is physically possible. Although it is understandably the immediate concern of a skeptic, I would actually consider this:</p>

<p>Do the problems of self and the social problems of the world change because of the physical shape of the planet? I would imagine mankind would have the same value of conscious experience whether on a flat surface or a sphere..</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve seen a fair amount of FE presentations that associate the theory to creationist theory as well. Many of the videos end in biblical verses which throw me off a bit. Perhaps this explains the overarching philosophy that FE believers share. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes the social perspective of life changes. For one we all have the idea that we could get off this &quot;planet&quot; one day. Going to mars, etc, setting up habitats. Which is fairy tales, but could make people less likely to respect the earth we have. </p>

<p>Just like thinking you came from space dust does cause people to act more carelessly. If we were told that we don&#39;t know alot of things for sure and God is a big and very real possibility. I certainly believe people would behave differently. Not necessarily less crime but less government power and less military spending. Things would be different if we were told it was a flat earth. But that is just one part of it.</p>

<p>The other part of lying about the shape of the earth is now we have an agency that gets money for covert experiments and research. While they do nothing but produce CGI and get paid to develop robots they hope will take over the world. Look it up, nasa is in bed with google who owns robot companies. something dynamics can&#39;t remember off the top of my head. </p>

<p>So the social aspect of flat earth is not the whole story all though I think it is significant. </p>

<p>lying about flat earth is about stealing our money and controlling the outer ring of our earthly plane. which is Antarctica, which NASA controls. Also don&#39;t overlook the possibility that more land exists past Antarctica, since we can&#39;t go there.. how will we know? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On one hand if I consider the earth is flat and there is some sort of untold beauty beyond Antarctica I would want to be the first to go and see. Yet under the same premise whats beyond may just be so horrifying that I wish I never went..</p>

<p>Also I see your point on the value of the environment being a significant social reaction to the sphere model, but it seems like more a overall reaction to technocracy than it is to the individual(s). I&#39;d say we should have more belief in ourselves and each individual man to be as conscious as possible, and perhaps our experience of technology as a species is part of the ride</p>

<p>As far as NASA and evil corporations I yield to the fact that there is way too many people and too much materialism in the world. But ultimately I think most of these problems are centered around the conflict of self. Knowledge of self could be the key difference to change our modern perspective on technology so that it isn&#39;t robots taking over the world in the same way a hammer can be conceived and valued as a tool instead of a weapon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern mainstream science takes the complete reductivist attitude. Everything is reduced down to cold and impersonal happenstance. The entire universe is taught as being a cold, hostile place. You are taught to feel alone and afraid and vulnerable.  You are a insiginicant being floating on a rock through cold, empty, vast space. </p>

<p>Flat earth is about scienfic truth and realizing   the world as the realm that was created with intent and meaning. Nothing happens by coincidence. 
This realm is the work of the supreme creator.
For something to exist it must be created. And warmth and sympathy are inherent to creation.
A full acknowledgment and appreciation of the creation brings lovr and drives away all fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand the inherent flaw in your logic, that&#39;s pretty clear.</p>

<p>You are saying that in order for something to exist, it must be created. That is circular logic, because it implies that the &quot;creator&quot; must have been created, so you get an infinite stream of creators.</p>

<p>So, if you are comfortable with an infinite time scale, why not just accept that &quot;reality&quot; has always existed, without a creator? The &quot;creator&quot; theory is just a shoehorned extra step that is irrelevant.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry that you cannot understand logic, to be honest. It&#39;s probably why you are a creationist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, you probably know where I&#39;m going with this, but still.. </p>

<p>So the whole, &quot;you can&#39;t create something from nothing, everything MUST have come from something, therefore creationism&quot; falls apart almost instantly upon deeper examination.</p>

<p>If everything must be created, you have two options, and both of which are just eternal existence of <em>something.</em> Maybe you think the &quot;creator&quot; is eternal, or maybe you think there is an infinite line of creators stretching back in time ad infinitum. </p>

<p>But I would counter by saying, if you are comfortable with the idea that <em>something</em> has <strong>always</strong> existed, what is illogical about the idea that the &quot;always existing something&quot; is the multiverse itself, or in other words, reality itself.</p>

It has to explain nor only rain, earthquakes,  convection, star and planet formation, sand dune formations.
It has to falsify Newton and Einstien, and present mathmatical and empirical proofs that prove them wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does exactly debunk the flat earth theory because objects with large  gravity like the earth and other observable planets tend to form a ball because they collapse on themselves so that the force of gravity is balanced. But seriously, why don&#39;t you go to some physics forums or some place with people who have thoroughly studied physics, or just go take some physics course, or buy a physics book. There is no reason for the earth to be flat because we can observe that all the other planets are also round.</p>

<p>And can you even comprehend the size of this conspiracy? It would be absolutely enormous, it would mean that whole space travel is FAKE, all the launches that are done by MULTIPLE countries, all space programs, all satellites that engineers build, multiple companies who invest in satellites. You can also study astronomy and other space related sciences, these would also be fake. It&#39;s just simply impossible for this theory to be true. Why do you think no actual educated person has debunked the globe and got a nobel prize? Why are all the physicists &quot;ballers&quot;? Why is the flat earth theory mainly used by poorly educated or religious people who don&#39;t understand things like gravity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a case for explaining why would anyone hide the fact that the Earth is flat and not round, and make such a vast conspiracy. Like the other poster said , I like to question reality and am not FE myself.But, here it is:</p>

<p>If I&#39;d have to pick one reason, that would be that the flat earth theory would need a &#39;masterplan&#39; clutch to support it , thus strenghtening the belief in the existence of some &#39;God&#39;. The round earth would then be used by TPTB or the Devil , utilizing scientists to make up and further support with multiple advanced theories, as the tool to distance people from that so called God.</p>

<p>It could be doable, think about how much years have passed since burning of Giordano Bruno for his cosmological theories , deemed as &#39;heresy&#39;. It was in 1600. They had 417 years to make up the whole system of belief called Cosmology.</p>

<p>But, it would be the conspiracy so widespread, and with so many people supporting it, that I find it hard to believe in.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a lot of people (including scientists) just want to &#39;fit in&#39;. They would probably be ostracised and deemed &#39;crazy conspiracy theorist / mad scientist&#39; , if they would question the theory , and more importantly , the existing proofs for mainstream cosmos science.</p>

NO, its still considered a sucsess by both sides. Why?

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earth theory should not be condoned. This is a ridiculous notion that is often used to discredit real world theories that challange the narratives that have be propagated against the people.</p>

<p>Remember in the eyes of most, conspiracy theorist is a negative label.</p>

<p>You have to give credit to The Powers That Be (TPTB).
When someone challenges the given narrative, they are labeled &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, which in our society is just as bad as being called crazy. This isn&#39;t a recent phenomenon. Before modern governments, when religion had more control of societies (and still are in some regions) if you question the narrative you would be labelled a blasphemer or heretic.
Discrediting dissenters in this fashion, not only helps to quell resistance, it also marginizing the individuals as &quot;crazies&quot; in the eyes of society and allows the Established powers to control most of the masses. Since humans are such social animals, instinctually, a lot of people will instantly reject ideas and influences that are not &quot;accepted&quot; narrative, even if they agree with the anti-narratives, because they are afraid to be seen as conspiracy pariah.</p>

<p>Listen, since I am on this sub, I too love the fantasy and mental playground that can be found with &quot;fringe&quot; theories (i.e., ancient aliens, hollow earth, simulation theory, etc...), but the truth is that we are in serious times and serious questions need to be asked to find the scary answers.  For those of us that are red-pilled, we cannot be distracted or give TPTB ammo to discredit the truths we may help to uncover.  </p>
