       EDIT: This thread has been brigaded and the dramatic difference in the anti-state vs pro-socialism votes has flipped, putting pro socialist comments at the top. Make of that what you will.

      <p>
       Listen, Bernie Bros. I get that you're all about taking down evil wall street bankers, and evil corporations, and corruption, and finding the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in these comment sections there is so much Bernie praise still after he has been EXPOSED!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the answer to the problems we have today are answered by confiscation of wealth, and just "getting the right people in government" will fix it. What the fuck do you think the conspiracy is? It's you.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are using you to sell statism to keep you a slave. Wake the fuck up and read some Ron Paul. You think corporations aren't your friend by somehow government will be? Get over yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You bernie bros are the biggest phonies ever buying into statist propaganda just like TPTB in all sectors of life want you to. Get real.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to be a fucking nut job, but look at what statism does, it kills people. Don't bring that weak ass shit about Bernie in here, that guy is a fucking fraud.

       Hi, I live in Canada and a lot of what we do is socialist. Also many countries in Europe. Actually most modern democractic countries. Don't be afraid tho. It's really about recognizing that by contributing to something bigger than yourself, actually benefits yourself. Look beyond your borders. The US is kind of totally fucked so don't use that as a model to start. Cheers.

       Name a functioning state with a government that doesn't force it's citizens to do things, like... pay taxes, obey laws, and conform to social norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument that socialism is making people do these things "by force" isn't incorrect, but it's disingenuous because all forms of government that currently are functioning do the same thing.

       Why has the default position become "more government is good?"  I guess I envy you, in that you can place that much trust in yours.  But time and time again, in the US, we've been shown that we can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Super basic example would be "let's increase taxes by $100billion to pay for addiction treatment."  That sounds nice, and it very well might be a good idea.  Unfortunately, what ends up happening is that $100billion gets collected, and like $20billion gets spent on addiction treatment.  Pull that kind of stunt in almost every area of government, for longer than most of our parents have even been alive, and people rightfully become skeptical.  So unless/until I see
       <em>
        responsible
       </em>
       government within it's current scope, I'm going to resist any increase in its power.

       What are you talking about calling out my own people? Where did I say there is a form of government that is good? I specifically made an argument regarding socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why let me know you down voted the thread? Is there something ambitious or edgy there? Like, you agree with it but you still down voted?

       You know it's funny, I actually started to go back to edit the language to make it sound nicer and more palatable and then I thought who cares? Turns out, someone who hates the state cares. And would rather down vote the post so the message doesn't get heard, because the message wasn't delivered in the way you wanted.

       Why should I post not be allowed to target one system and have to cover all government? Especially on a sub that is has heavy influence by users who believe socialist doctrine? It's really funny to me that your entire argument is basically, "you weren't nice enough so I down voted you."

       A form of government that ensured health of all citizens, concentrating investment and innovation on technological advancement to improve the health, well-being of people and the planet, so we can forget about being tied to a work-debt-slavery system and can spend time leisurely and spiritually evolving - whilst banishing companies such as Apple from producing a new phone with some more megapixels for $500 more, and all other capitalist money-making enterprises that provide no real benefit for humanity outside of the biggest benefit of making themselves money, To provide free healthcare to all, free effective, ecologically sustainable public transport. All within the realms of human capability, but too much greed for that ever happen. In an ideal sense, there are ways in which governments could work for the good.

       in my opinion, they won't even let someone on the ballet that isn't controlled, bernie promised good things yes, so has trump though, and so has any other candadate, no one is going to tell us they are actually evil, it only comes out after time of being elected, that is just my opinion though, and we are all free to think on our own, i think we needa start from scratch, fuck the 3 parties we are allowed to vote for, we should be voting for an individual person for each role in gov

       Buying into this is being part of the conspiracy. There is no noble government. You are thinking of a utopian voluntary organization, one that doesn't use force to accomplish its goals. That wouldn't be a government.

       AnCom, too, right? Unfortunately, you can't have no state and socialism at the same time unless the redistribution of wealth is completely voluntary. In which case, it wouldn't be socialism. It would just be people giving each other stuff.

       By itself Socialism has nothing to do with redistribution of wealth.

       Socialism without government looks a lot like capitalism actually, except excess is the right of the people instead of profit for the individual.

       Most americans have a lot of trouble grasping the idea of worker owned companies being socialism.

       Imagine a libertarian state, where the function of the government is to enforce contracts only. Now imagine that state also has a constitution which states, among other things, that all corporations must participate in profit sharing with workers, or in other words, government mandated "worker owned" companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is merely a hypothetical, a thought experiment. But can you now understand what an AnSoc state might look like?

       Well said, and I agree. Right sub? Not really. But, for the lurkers (not so red pilled - but are pissed off) this hits the nail on the head. Go down enough rabbit holes, and self rule is the only solution. I'm a voluntaryist after all these damn rabbit holes. I've come a long way. Most of the Bernie bros are not even 25 (when the brain is fully developed) and many come from alright upbringings. Try coming from a family who fled Soviet Poland, because we had a bad habit of get assassinated for rocking the Communist/Socialist boat.....

       I'm all for helping people through tough times, but socialist programs are not the answer now.  Why? Because they are being used to control people.  Soros, Omidyar, the Open Government Partnership - spout attractive ideas, suck people in with them, and then hit them with a hammer when they turn the "philanthropy" into  profit-generating, venture capitalism.  These people swoop in with the promise of a "pretty world," and in every instance the real-life result is ugliness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I know about this, the more I see the gravity of what we're facing.  Interesting Jeff Rense interview with Meral, a German citizen - scary thing is the brainwashing she describes is identical to what we're facing here.

       You're wrong. It absolutely invalidates your original argument. If you have no alternative to offer, you are just bitching about the status quo. What kind of argument is that?

       Bullshit. If factory farming is the only option, even though it is "bad" it is necessary. If it's necessary, it can't be as bad as some liberals will claim.

       Yes, I understand that point, but you did not make such a claim. If you had said "All forms of government are a conspiracy to keep people trusting the State", then we would be in agreement that there is no alternative to offer. you are not making such an argument. You are singling out one particular form of government, and one specific politician who advocates for it.

       Because you are not backing up the claim with anything but your own personal bias. Me personally, I believe that all forms of government are a conspiracy against those who are not in government. I have a degree in political science, and studied the whys and hows of governments since Ancient Greece. Everyone wants some form of government for some selfish reason, even anarchists.

       My claim that socialism allows other people to control your money and the idea that is a good thing is a conspiracy stand on its own. I agree with everything else you said except anarchists don't want a form of government.

       sorry man you are just way off point. The problem isn't any ism's, its people. The greedy and power hungry will gravitate toward positions of power no matter the form of government. Its up to the people to make sure the greed and power grabbing stays in check. We have seen capitalism, socialism, and communism all fail in some form or another.

       That is... absurd. Corporations LOVE free markets, because they are then free from those pesky regulations.

       Socialism is how all governments work. It is a political spectrum and not a specific ideology. All governments are socialist in some form.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is socialist in the the risks of capitalism are a collective responsibility while the profits are privatized. This is backward to any humanistic social system, but it is socialism none the less - national socialism.

       Name a functioning state with a government that doesn't force it's citizens to do things, like... pay taxes, obey laws, and conform to social norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument that socialism is making people do these things "by force" isn't incorrect, but it's disingenuous because all forms of government that currently are functioning do the same thing.

       Your claiming that your OPINION is more valid than another because you have such and such degree.

       That is the definition or arguing from authority.    I don't acknowledge the authority of your poli sci degree.
