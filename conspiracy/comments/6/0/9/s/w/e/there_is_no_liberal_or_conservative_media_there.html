       I see a lot of comments and posts about CNN or FOX being either liberal or conservative. While there may be some instances in which one or the other will take a slight bias, in general, MSM feeds us garbage that TPTB want us to be fed.
They capture our attention with attacking immigrants, blaming terrorists (our Governments are the real terrorists), talking about unimportant social issues like whether or not a trans person can use the bathroom, while ignoring certain corporation malpractices or even encouraging us to support certain corporations.
Then we are fed with ads that fill our brains with even more garbage to feed into the consumerist society that is America.
If you watch closely to CNN or FOX, you will realize that the underlying message is the same: Obedience.
And they all discourage one thing: Civil Disobedience.

       "news" now means opinion. the bare bones who, what, when, where, how are almost impossible to disentangle, if you can even get them in the first place.

       Posts like these serve no purpose other than to undermine any truth in media, whilst you can argue media is flawed it is not entirely without merit.

       Eexactly, fox is hardly "conservative." If you really watch it's all acting, and its essentially a mockery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the message they are pushing is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Continue to try to discredit Trump, including making shit up i.e. not shaking hands with her
      </p>
      <p>
       Their ultimate goal continues to be to impeach Trump, and they need "democrats" elected in 2018, but again remember, both sides have been infected, so it will be hard to know who is a true patriot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newspapers across the United States have also been purchase by Gannett/USA Today, and they do the same thing.  Much less regional/local knews. Lots of pushed national opinion re: Trump is bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are currently actively pushing civil disobedience,  making urban communities less governable through "Grass roots" riots/pushing the media narrative of social unrest, trying to make the masses feel like impeaching Trump will save the world...

       They are all corporate media, and big corporations want tax breaks and deregulations. This is the reason the MSM is conservative, and even on the supposedly liberal MSNBC, there are things you can get canned for reporting on things the PTB don't like.

       (being right of socialists does not make her conservative).  #2 has some truth to it, but only insofar as their obvious preference for Hillary added credibility to Trump's narrative that mainstream press organizations were working to get Hillary elected, meaning their more blatant than usual partisan bias may have inadvertently helped Trump.

       Hillary was the conservative candidate in 2016. She wanted to maintain the status quo, that's literally textbook conservatism. It was Trump that claimed that he wanted to bring change. Progressive-minded folks don't like the change he offered, but he was the one demanding change regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just because Clinton labels herself a "liberal" or a "progressive" doesn't mean that her views actually match the people who use those labels. Single payer universal healthcare has majority support, for example, but Clinton was practically bragging about how it would "never ever come to pass". She IS conservative,
       <em>
        more so than the general population at least
       </em>
       . She's described herself in private to donors as being "center-left to center-right". That "center-right" she's talking about, that's her conservatism.

       The candidates (and the parties who nominated them) switched political philosophies because the Obama administration was the status quo?  Using that to claim she is conservative is a stretch,

       There are a few wonderful sources for alternative media in the US. The Intercept and Democracy Now! are two. Generally, I try to read news from several sources: a few mainstream, a few right leaning, and a few left leaning. That way you get a broad perspective on how a news story is beating treated. It sharpens your analytical skills and makes it easier to spot misleading information.

       I had to stop paying attention to Democracy Now after they called pizzagate a "debunked conspiracy theory". I liked the way they covered the news, especially the things that no one else was covering like the DAPL protests, but I've heard that they're also funded by Soros. The way they cover material seems to be pretty good for the most part, but please keep in mind that they're not above the fray. Use multiple sources to get your news, since even something like Democracy Now that appears to be super legitimate might be artificially keeping things from you too.

       Tyt definitely has its moments of exercising true liberalism, especially with its smaller shows/segments and interviews etc, but generally it does have a far more controlled narrative in regards to the main show presented by Cenk.

       democracynow is "left" but prone to DNC bandwagging whenever the demarcation between team blue and team red are at a fevered pitch, which robs them of objectivity and nuance. this is going on right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only true left media are counterpunch, jacobin, and the monthly review. the monthly review is the only unforgivingly materialist point of view, and thus is the most nuanced and objective, but also a little bit dense reading. (most people are materialists, they just don't know it). counterpunch has shown itself to be fighti g the hysteria better than jacobin.

       The social engineers handle stuff like the media narratives. They determine "what events are going to happen, when they're gonna happen, how it's gonna happen, how long Inbetween each specific event is carried out, with what "spin" will the narrative be portrayed to us, and what goals  are to be achieved with this campaign.
      </p>

       All of that is decided by a group of the most brilliant minds on planet earth who have sold their souls to this oligarchy. They know how our minds think, they create this "artificial habitat" that we all reside in. They engineer our popular culture and our society through the media, hence the term,

       It's not a conspiracy though. Capitalism is an economic system that when analyzed explains perfectly well why the ruling class behave the way it does. It's not a secret that capitalists want to maximize their profits even if it is at our expense. It's not a secret that it is in the best interests of capitalists to control government because it gives them an advantage. It's not a secret that the money capitalists make is by taking surplus value from our surplus labour, therefore class warfare is as clear as can be. It's not a secret that it is in the best interests of capitalists to control information, largely through media ownership, so they can spread their ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all seems conspiratorial, but a simple understanding of how capitalism works makes all of this pretty evident and expected.

       I said that it's a secret plan among a group of people to do something which is harmful. And profiting on war is harmful. Profiting from people being locked up in prison is harmful. Profiting from denying healthcare to sick people is harmful. Putting dollars ahead of people is harmful, and that's how capitalism works.
