        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now, this Vigilant Citizen article does a good job of giving the reader a good idea of what is going on. Katy Perry wants to buy a convent and the nuns at the place don&#39;t want her to be the owner because they think she&#39;s a witch... Now Katy might in fact be a witch but that is not why I am posting this. Something in the article caught my eye and if there is any connection could make her wanting to buy the property a little more sinister.</p>

<p>This property has a house adjoining the property, that the Manson family murdered in 1969, in Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. </p>

<p>&quot;The couple was stabbed dozens of times in a ritualistic matter. Leno LaBianca was given 14 puncture wounds with an ivory-handled, two-tined carving fork, which was left jutting out of his stomach. A steak knife was also planted in his throat. Manson’s followers wrote “Rise” and “Death to pigs” on the walls and “Healter Skelter” on the refrigerator door, all in LaBianca’s blood. These events occurred on the day following the infamous killing of Sharon Tate (Roman Polanski’s pregnant wife) by Manson’s “family”&quot;</p>

<p>Now now Ms. Perry seems to be playing with dark forces, she should know what she&#39;s falling for.</p>

<p>I would say her connection is of the MK Ultra variety and the race war her good friend Hillary Clinton seems to be all about. When Hillary lost the election she was calling for a revolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is, you are saying she has some sort of evil power or sinister purpose, which has something to do with her wanting a property that&#39;s next to the Manson murder house. You are basing your conspiracy on absolutely nothing, but making connections that are not there. She has a song called Rise, so you automatically think it has to do with her wanting to start a race war? Does her song Roar mean she wants to become a lion? My main point, is nothing in your post has anything to do with anything. Sounds like you would do well working for Breitbart or Infowars though, you are good at writing crazy headlines and putting in info that allows stupid people to make connections that are not there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea facts that are not related to your conclusion. That&#39;s why I said, does me driving by the place when I was a kid make me a witch? Because me doing that, has about as much connection as Katy Perry buying an old covenant that&#39;s next to the Manson mansion. Sure, it&#39;s easy to make those connections, when you are an 80 year old nun. &quot;She has been married and divorced before, clearly she&#39;s evil!&quot; Are you an 80 year old nun, cause you are talking like one. </p>

<p>Wait, now read this. Its very confusing. It does say Manson broke into a house here and tried to kill somebody. I dont know if they mean &#39;adjoining&#39; as in &#39;next to&#39; or that it is actualy partnof the tax parcel. Ill bet there is a county GIS site that would show us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, the grater conspiracy here is that Rome agreed for this to be a retirement community for all these nuns until they died, and then one by one removed each none so they could sell it to Katy Perry. </p>

<p>Beyond that conspiracy is the greater conspiracy, that the Catholic Church was ultimately destroyed by a complete infiltration of gay pedophiles, and whose crimes have basically depleted the papal purse, hence, most likely the need to sell the property. </p>

<p>And of course, the ultimate conspiracy, which is that the papal purse was essentially held by the Rothschilds.</p>
