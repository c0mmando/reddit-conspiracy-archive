        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ive been trying to find solid evidence of this, but am having a hard time (especially when using google.) </p>

<p>The best info I can find is that because of the treaty of 1213, in which all of Englands empire (including colonies) belongs to the vatican. And the treaty can only be broken by 2 people. The pope, and the leader of england.</p>

<p>Therefore US as a former colony belongs to the Vatican. Which is also the UN.(?)</p>

<p>This seems to be proven in the US constitution, but I can not seem to find where.</p>

<p>Also I get that we can not own land. We are mearly tennants unless you aquire a deed for allbland and air rights, which must be signed by a US president. ( I think the last ones were signed more than 200 years ago) and almost all are owned by banks now.</p>

<p>When searching &quot;Is US a corporation&quot; I get many sites saying it is, and they list various sources as proof to their claims. But I checked their sources, and just dont see any proof in them.</p>

<p>The first source given is &#39;Respublica v. Sweers 1 Dallas 43&#39; and that just seems to be about a guy forging how much fabric he bought. And basically removing the 1st number from all the documents he had. (Does that make sense?) Basically said he had 9 yards instead of 49. And all the other numbers including prices, and taxes he just scratched the first number out.</p>

<p>Second is &#39;Treaty of Commerce 8 Stat 116&#39; and I cant find anything on that. Plenty of sites using that as a source, but I can&#39;t actually find a verifiable version of the text. (I think that might be a huge peice of the puzzle, that is being hidden.)</p>

<p>The next reference is &#39;Treaty of Peace 8 stat 80&#39; Now this was a very interesting read. I recomend it to all of you. It was the peacy treaty between US and GB signed in Paris in 1783 by D. Hartley, John Adams, B. Franklin, and John Jay. </p>

<p>Some interesting things here. It only calls the US 13 states. And really details well the actual land that they consider US to be. Article 4 states that all creditors (intl bankers) shall not be hindered by ethier side in colecting their debts. Also states that British persons shall get their land back, and more interestingly also gives several restitutions to &quot;persons resident in districts in the possession on his Majesty&#39;s arms and who have not borne arms against the United States.&quot; Article 8 gives England navigation of the entire Mississippi river FOR EVER! </p>

<p>Article 9 is the real head scratcher though. It is a real nut scratcher of mixed up words. I need help with that one. They quote &quot;Provisional Articles&quot; but the link on that has a 404 error.</p>

<p>Still, I dont see any proof here that the US is a corporation.</p>

<p>Next source is &#39;IRS publication 6209&#39; which is updated, and also changed annualy. This is was way too much for me. It is basically all the IRS&#39; info. All the abbreviations, each department, lists and lists of changes. Just way too much. Pretty weak source. They should include the section, and sub section that the proof is in.</p>

<p>Last source I find is &#39;Articles of Association October 20, 1774&#39; which was written in response to the &quot;Intolerables Act&quot; the British government imposed on its subjects in the colonies. Basically a ban on products from Britain, and its other colonies. But making sure not to criticize the King himself, but express their unhappines with the current state of affairs. It also boycotted many other things including cock fighting, expensive plays, no purchasing of expensive clothes for funerals, and many more. Interestingly clauses also called for the ban of the slave trade, and SEVERENCE OF ALL ECONOMIC TIES WITH BRITIAN. Britian responded in 1775 with the failed &quot;New England Restraining Act&quot; which helped facillitate the revolutionary war. You can view a high res version of this document from the national archives at <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/6277397">https://catalog.archives.gov/id/6277397</a> but I dont see any proof still that makes the US a corporation.</p>

<p>So yeah. Anyone have better sources, or actual proof that the US is a corporation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>THE ORGANIC ACT of 1871</strong></p>

<p>“Formally An Act to provide a Government for the District of Columbia, is an Act of Congress that repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown and established a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia. Though Congress repealed the territorial government in 1874, the legislation was the first to create a single municipal government for the federal district”</p>

<p>The new government consisted of an appointed governor and 11-member council, a locally elected 22-member assembly, and a board of public works charged with modernizing the city.[7] The Seal of the District of Columbia features the date 1871, recognizing the year the District’s government was incorporated</p>

<p>….that created the (All Capital Letters) “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA” <strong>thereby creating a private U.S. corporation which is its own city-state of its own country</strong> with its:</p>

<p>Own mayor, police force, constitution, post office pays no taxes and is not beholden to any other country. Just like the City of London and the Vatican</p>

<p>The UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in all capitals, represents a fictitious corporation. Your birth certificate, drivers license, SSN, bank statements, are all written in capital letters, which means you have registered, submitted and/or applied to be a part of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, corporation as a fictitious character.</p>

<p>The UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is located in the District of Columbia. What is the District of Columbia and what are the other Districts? (Vatican, City of London)</p>

<p><strong>The Owners of the private corporation, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, are the City of London and the Vatican.</strong></p>

<p>When we pay taxes we “voluntarily” submit our tax returns to Washington, D.C. yet pay our taxes to the UNITED STATES TREASURY; A private corporation registered in Puerto Rico!</p>

<p>Henry Paulson, Timothy Geithner, and every treasury secretary since 1913 are appointed but not as cabinet members. The Secretary of the Treasury is as a corporate “governor” of what is known as “The Fund” or “The Bank” and several other international organizations. The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury is not sworn in and speaks no oath of loyalty or defense of the United States. The obligation of this secretary (governor) is to the International Monetary Fund, and World Bank. All employees of the IMF governor are paid by the Fund directly, or out of funds supplied to the Governor of the Fund specifically for that purpose. The IMF governor is not paid by the US government as he/she is not employed by that government.</p>

<p>The current President is the CEO of the foreign corporation, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, named Donald J. Trump.</p>

<p>The United States of America is written in small cap letters and represents the original constitution of America. One must not “join” the U.S. corporation if they wish to have the rights of “Free” people but by registering, submitting or applying, we are unwittingly joining the U.S corporation, which for most of us starts at our birth (see below).</p>

<p>Global Government Entities are corporations registered and incorporated in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in Washington, D.C.,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I met some guys in Los Angels who told me all about this... they lived in a massive house and had what looked to be a car lot in the back. There&#39;s no telling how many dollars in just cars alone. They explained to me how I could change my name to all capital letters - and write myself checks or basically withdraw the money the government saw me as being worth. He said in average life span I would generate a certain amount of money that the government used this equation to set a value in which the government would borrow money against  (or something like that)</p>

<p>Weird stuff. Needless to say I did not change my name... I wonder what came of those guys </p>

He discusses how you can lookup your American birth certificate serial number on the SEC and shows how to do it step-by-step. I don&#39;t have an American birth cert so I couldn&#39;t test it. I think if you search for the book title and add &quot;pdf&quot; you can find a free copy of it on the web. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re using the term &quot;corporation&quot; in strict, legal, sense, then no. Corporations are distinct legal entities that have to follow certain filing and reporting rules. For example, to form a corporation you have to file articles of incorporation that include, at least, the name of the corporation, and an agent for service of process. There has to be a board of directors that meet on a regular basis, and notice has to be given.  </p>

<p>There are, of course, lots of similarities between the corporate form and a Republican form of government. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful or accurate to say that the United States &quot;is a corporation,&quot; per say. </p>
