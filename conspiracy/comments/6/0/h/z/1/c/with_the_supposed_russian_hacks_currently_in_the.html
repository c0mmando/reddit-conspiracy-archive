       Yes, the possibility of a foreign government interfering in our elections is absolutely troublesome.  But in this current storm of Russia this and Russia that, I feel it's important to remind everyone what exactly these supposed Russian hacks uncovered:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "Off-the-record" correspondence with media personalities, including the reporters at CNN,[18][19][20] Politico, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post showing pretty blatant collusion with the HRC campaign;
       </li>
       <li>
        E-mail showing Huffington Post colluding with Clinton campaign staff while trying to appear neutral and unbias;
       </li>
       <li>
        Tons of DNC donor e-mails, showing fairly blatant pay to play quid-pro-quo;
       </li>
       <li>
        The DNC shitting on Bernie supporters and the Bernie campaign in general;
       </li>
       <li>
        Donna Brazile cheating and giving Hillary at least one question to the Presidential Debate against Donald Trump.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm sure there is more, but when we're seeing all of this "Russia" this and "Russia" that, lets not forget what all "Russia" uncovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's more, feel free to add.  If I'm off base, let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also don't forget: After the DNC was caught red handed, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepped down as the DNC chairwoman,
       <strong>
        the Clinton campaigned hired her.
       </strong>
       Then, the DNC put Donna Brazile (
       <strong>
        yes, the same Donna Brazile that cheated and gave Hillary at least one debate question
       </strong>
       ) as it's chairwoman, removing all doubt that the DNC is corrupt as we all thought it was.

       I never hear people talk about Tim Kaine. Clinton said in a book that Kaine would be a tertible VP and obama would lose if he picked him. He steps down as DNC chair, then DWS takes over and helps Clinton get the nomination. He becomes the VP candidate for Clinton. Seems like a reward for stepping down to help rig the primary.

       There's still no proof that the "noisy" hacks were Russian... They called it Russian because it had Russian digital "fingerprints," which is the whole aspect that is out of character for this particular episode... The fact that the information is secret keeps the public from knowing whether this is real at all...
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if the US sponsored coup in Ukraine is covered under "state secrets."
       <em>
        Nobody
       </em>
       in this hearing has questioned the legitimacy of the current Ukrainian regime, nor have they pointed out the obvious financial ties between various members and Ukrainian business interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this information could be declassified. This is why I believe that this is all political theater that ends in greater authoritarianism. Secret information undermines democracy. It keeps the public in the dark and afraid of whatever bogeyman the establishment tools choose for them. Mr. Orange could fix this, if he really wanted to.

       100% agree.  I don't believe it was Russian.  The DNC got caught so they threw up the "Russian" smoke screen.  You know how we know it's bullshit?  Because if they had real evidence to implicate the Russians we wouldn't stop seeing it on CNN and MSNBC, all.night.long.  But we haven't... which means they don't have shit.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think so too, but the 'Russian' smoke screen is directly aligned with  geostrategic thinking about preserving America as the world hegemon.   If you go back to 2008 and the Georgian war we were positioning to escalate with Russia.  Then the economic meltdown happened and the anti-Russia rhetoric died down.   Same year we had Nato state that Ukraine and George are poised for NATO membership.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jump forward a couple of years and we have the attempt to overthrow Syria over the claims of WMD's.  People forget that Putin published an article in the New York times basically telling the US, that it can't just go and overthrow countries it wants.  Go back and watch the news the next day... complete meltdown about someone telling the US what to do... a sign that we are no longer in the Unipolar world we inherited after the Cold War was over.
      </p>
      <p>
       We had the Ukrainian coup.  Tensions intensified after Crimea joins the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have the proxy war with Russia in Syria, where the policy of arming ISIS and other proxies was defeated by the Syria/Russia alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
       While all this was happening we have the attempted coup in Turkey, which turkey leadership blamed on US elements, and Gulen.  Turkey requested that he be extradited, and the US refused.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are seeing a realignment of Turkey with Russia, and distancing itself from NATO.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-referendum-nato-idUSKBN16M2OR">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the following developing... Russia-Turkey-Iran axis, and Russia-China axis.  The development of this economic zone, and further linking with the European markets would create an economic zone that would severely compromise US dominance in economic affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what the US planners fear, and are working so hard to prevent by pushing us with real conflict with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Israel had a long term strategy of expanding its borders so the interest appears to be mutual.
      </p>
      <p>
       To summarize, not only does the Russian narrative deflect of institutional corruption at home, it is sending signals to geostrategists.

       russia! TM isn't about trump. it isn't about hacks or election tampering. it is about laying the ground work to justify a hot war with a "real" country. it's one thing for americans to turn a blind eye to all the shit we do in podunk countries like syria. it is another for us to turn a blind eye about going to war with russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump's divissiveness is making the task easier because those who hate trump and want him gone want to believe the russia connection to confirm their dislike of him, their opinion of his delegitimacy, and to provide a legal pin upon which to hang their hopes of his ouster.
      </p>
      <p>
       if one is arguing whether the connection with russia and trump is real or not, you've already swolled the blue pill. it doesn't matter. it doesn't matter how the DNC emails got out. it doesn't even matter if russia did influence our election. what matter's is whether or not those who want a war with russia, get one.

       You nailed it! What escapes people is to ask a question What is the problem with Russia advocating for their interest with US politicians.  Or asked on a more general level is there something wrong with a foreign entity advocating for their interest with US politicians?  I don't think a simple answer of yes can be given.  If this advocacy is done in an open and transparent manner there is no issue.    So here I think the Trump camp dropped the ball, if there was some connection they should have just owned up to it and said so what?  Instead we have capitulation that it is somehow a violation of some principle to have diplomatic discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This however is a side note to your bigger point, that all of this does not really matter, what matter is whether those factions pushing us to a military conflict with Russia get it.

       Exactly.  Any time I hear anti-Russia sentiment, it's just the globalist warcry.  Something, scarily, that many Democrats are quick to take up arms on.

       I agree.  I don't believe this was a "Russian" hack at all -- but that's just me.  I think it's smoke and mirrors.  The DNC got caught, and so they're basically pointing fingers.  Notice how even though the intelligence communities supposedly all agree, no one can show us -- the public -- any hard evidence of a direct link.  It's all speculation.

       The official conspiracy theory of the US government is that Russia gave Wikileaks the material from democrats last year, at least according to the ODNI. Also, evidence for this claim is too super secret to share.
      </p>
      <p>
       The not-so-official conspiracy theory is that Wikileaks is a front for Russian intelligence, even though in theory it would be easier for Russia to take advantage of Wikileaks than to run it as a front. This more complicated conspiracy theory doesn't function any better as a theory than the official government one and doesn't have any better evidence supporting it.

       I don't understand why anyone is surprised that Democratic Party officials backed their most well known candidate, with a recognizable name, who led the polls wire to wire, instead of backing an Independent self-described Socialist who didn't join the party until it was convenient. Of course Hillary was going to get the full support of her party. Everyone knew that should would be the pick since she lost to Obama in '08. That's why Biden didn't even bother to run.

       I recall rushed articles claiming California had a bunch of Sanders votes that went uncounted, but then nothing came of them, and surely we'd know far more now if they'd been onto something-- looks like propaganda though. DNC head honchos/the CNN's of this world favored Clinton, no doubt about it. They fucked up, the party needs to wake up and realize that basic fact. However, I don't think it was
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       insidiously bad (no one's actual votes were changed, rigging is a hysterical word for what occurred) and I'll put a grand on every primary in history being full of such shenanigans, Dem or GOP, which maybe we'd know if we had access to thousands of campaign emails from any other campaign except this very one.

       Pre-Election polls also had Clinton beating Trump. Why would Hillary "rig" voting machines to beat Sanders and then throw the General Election? That is idiotic. A 12% discrepancy is meaningless and well within the margin of error for those polls.

       You're clearly missing the point.  Let me ELY5:
      </p>
      <p>
       An individual private citizen joins the Democratic Party.  They join expecting fair and honest dealings with said party.  In 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders runs in the DNC primary.  Many Democratic Party members support and vote for Mr. Sanders.  The elites running the DNC want Hillary to win, and they shit talk on Bernie, his supports (who are Democratic Party members expecting their party to operate fairly and respectfully of their wishes) and actively collude to secure Hillary Clinton the nomination.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it isn't about the DNC wanting a Democrat to win.  Either you're being purposefully obtuse, intellectually dishonest, or you just don't get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about the DNC shitting on
       <strong>
        <em>
         their own people
        </em>
       </strong>
       .  So yes.  How corrupt of them.  How scandalous.  How dishonest.  How shitty.

        How corrupt of the DEMOCRATIC national committee wanting a DEMOCRAT to win the election. BAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAH!

       You're clearly missing the point.  Let me ELY5:
      </p>
      <p>
       An individual private citizen joins the Democratic Party.  They join expecting fair and honest dealings with said party.  In 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders runs in the DNC primary.  Many Democratic Party members support and vote for Mr. Sanders.  The elites running the DNC want Hillary to win, and they shit talk on Bernie, his supports (who are Democratic Party members expecting their party to operate fairly and respectfully of their wishes) and actively collude to secure Hillary Clinton the nomination.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it isn't about the DNC wanting a Democrat to win.  Either you're being purposefully obtuse, intellectually dishonest, or you just don't get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about the DNC shitting on
       <strong>
        <em>
         their own people
        </em>
       </strong>
       .  So yes.  How corrupt of them.  How scandalous.  How dishonest.  How shitty.
