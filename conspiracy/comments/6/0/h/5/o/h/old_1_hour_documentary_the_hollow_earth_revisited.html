<p>Explains what <em>really</em> has been going on in Antarctica in the past, including Admiral Byrd&#39;s expedition and the <em>real</em> reason for this expedition, Earth&#39;s polar openings, the 3rd Reich, past civilizations, far advanced civilizations, religion, the spiritual evolution of humanity, chakra&#39;s, etc.</p>

<p>Apparently at or near the Antarctic entrance there is the city of New Berlin. New Berlin is a city founded during WW2, and is located <em>inside</em> the inner Earth. <strong>Start watching from 36:50 for this part.</strong> New Berlin has around 2 million population, they travel on Icelandic passports, and might even have a secret embassy in Washington.</p>

<p>As the title says, this is an old documentary. Although 720p it looks like VHS quality created in the 80s? 90s?</p>

<p>Oh and I should mention -- I found this same documentary was posted a year ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4akhms/the_hollow_earth_revisited_full_version/">on /r/conspiracy</a>, didn&#39;t get much attention, but is now even more relevant.....</p>

<p>Edit: Thought I&#39;d add the authors&#39; and speakers information found in the video:</p>

<ul>
<li>Authors: Prof. Jim Hurtak (JJ Hurtak); Virgil Armstrong (Ex CIA)</li>
<li>Other speakers: Vladimir Tarzisky (UFO Researcher); Randy Hastings; Ken Harsh</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit:</p>

<ul>
<li>The very interesting subject of <strong>photon belt</strong> starting from 48:40 - <a href="http://wtfdiam.stevenredhead.com/photonbelt.html">article</a></li>
<li>The illuminati - from 54:..</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>People, I think the <strong>photon belt</strong> entry is a huge phenomenon. Read the article I linked to. Save the info, print it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man I love the Antarctica/Hollow Earth threads coming back as of late, too much Flat Earth up in here sometimes</p>

<p><a href="http://imperialgermans.com/images/Antarctica%20underwater%20passageway%20to%20Agharta%20map.png">This</a> is from a map I posted in another thread thats related to this, it&#39;s supposedly part of a map that the Nazis used to enter the inner Earth, though I feel obliged to point out that the instructions point out the entrance at being 400m underwater, which wouldn&#39;t be possible unless the Germans had some kind of sub technology no one knows about. The translation of the top part is what I wanted to point out, because it lines up with what you were saying about it having a large population.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... I recommend, within the next 6 months with the powers of the extra formed commission to recruit in the Wehrmacht, Airforce, Imperial Navy and in the Units of the SS a careful and concealed selection of volunteers for the development of the new territories of the German Reich in New Swabia.
Leader, M. Bormann
The Fuehrer and Reichs Chancellor, the supreme commander of the armed forces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/OIfcvSd">Here</a> is a link to a high res picture of the full map, and if you look at <a href="http://imperialgermans.com/images/maphollowearth.png">this</a> section, it has a publish date of January 1944 according to the text at the bottom, which would mean the evacuations to New Berlin and New Swabia would&#39;ve been happening right around D-Day assuming they happened</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Printed for the Military Navy in an edition of 1300 copies at the special laboratory of the KZ Dachau. January 1944.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The official Nazi expedition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Swabia">New Swabia</a> happened a full five years before that map was printed. Seems a pretty big coincidence that all those Nazis disappeared to &quot;South America&quot; after WWII </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgNV_qRGHZI">This</a> is the closest thing I can find to a first hand source of the maps, they&#39;re supposedly KGB documents but I don&#39;t know much about what&#39;s going on in the video other than that because they&#39;re speaking Russian and it only has German subtitles</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the instructions are that big block of text on the <a href="http://imperialgermans.com/images/Third%20Reich%20Agharta%20map%20instructions.jpg">left</a>, this is the translation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DIVE AT THE POINT WITH THE COORDINATES: EXACT INTERSECTION: 68° SOUTHERN LATITUDE AND 1° EASTERN LATITUDE, AT A DEPTH OF 400 METERS.
The instructions should be followed strictly!</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Dive. From the point of diving with half drive, a starboard slant of 10° with a bow load inclination angle of 5°. Distance 188 nm (nautical miles). The allowed depth of 500 meters. (during the driving in the corridor the pressure on the ship’s hull during maneuvers is marginally.)</li>
<li>Emerge. Ballast with a stern trim, emerge in an angle of 23° with a portside slant position of 22°. 190 meters upwards. Distance 75,5 nm.</li>
<li>Difficult maneuver! Emerge. Ballast with a stern trim, emerging inclination angle of 41° Drive straight forward. 110 meters upwards, distance 21,5 nm. Afterwards a starboard slant position of 8° until you emerge on the surface of the cave. Distance 81 nm.</li>
<li>Drive on the surface of the cave with a starboard slant position of 8°. Distance 286 nm.
5., 6 Difficult maneuver! Dive. With a bow load, inclination angle of 45°. Until a depth of 240 meters, distance 60 nm. Afterwards with a portside slant position of 20°,at which the diving until 310 meters until the drive in the corridor is continued. After the mark of 310 meters is the diving to be proceeded with a port load capacity. Diving angle of 7° until 360 meters. Distance 70 nm. Further starboard slant position of 31° until a depth of 380 meters.</li>
<li>Dive. Port load, emergence angle of 22°. 199 Meters upwards with a portside slant position of 26°. Distance 43 nm.</li>
<li>Emerge. Stern trim. Emergence angle of 45°, always straight forward, until you breach the surface in Agharta. Distance 70 nm.</li>
<li>Drive to Agharta. Full speed ahead. Look straight forward, until the new light is put out. Changing of the magnetpoles. The movements of the compass needles and other meters are to be ignored.
(Further instructions are in pakage Nr. 3. Open first when you arrive in Agharta!)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the part that I was talking about, Nazi subs couldn&#39;t go to 400m at this time unless they had some sub tech we don&#39;t know about.</p>

<p><a href="http://imperialgermans.com/images/Asgard.png">This</a> is the circle on the left, <a href="http://imperialgermans.com/images/Liberia.png">this</a> is the circle on the right that are underneath the two parts that have a topographical view of Antarctica.</p>

<p>That huge stuff going on in the bottom left is a visual representation of the instructions that are given, the part that&#39;s going over the top being the Antarctic ice</p>
