<p>I deleted my Google account and hope others will do the same.  </p>

<p>They wanted my feedback - here it is:</p>

<p>&quot;Google is OUT OF CONTROL  You are amassing TONS of data on everyone for no reason other than fulfilling your globalist agenda.  If you cared about privacy, as you SAY you do, we would be opting-in to your plethora of services, not navigating a maze of opt-out options.&quot; (swearing removed)</p>

<p>EDIT:  I apologize for swearing - first time I&#39;ve ever done that online - but when I started going through everything they save - I was FURIOUS!  There were categories within categories!  It was time to give up convenience for dignity!  </p>

<p>WE HAVE TO INITIATE LEGISLATION TO STOP THIS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That article was written on April 1. Google changed their motto to &quot;Do the right thing&quot;, but still maintained the motto &quot;Don&#39;t Be Evil&quot; as the preface to their corporate code of conduct. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some Google alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bing search results remain mostly uncensored despite being owned by Microsoft.</p></li>
<li><p>SearX is an open source search engine. For those concerned about privacy, this is your best option.</p></li>
<li><p>MillionShort.com is a search engine that lets you prune the top 100, 1000, and 1,000,000 out of the search results. It&#39;s great for finding obscure websites and stuff that is censored by Google. I don&#39;t know a damn thing about their privacy stance, however.</p></li>
<li><p>If all else fails, you can make encrypted searches in Google by going to DuckDuckGo and typing !g before any keyword (&quot;!g Reddit&quot;).</p></li>

<p>Those with strong privacy concerns should probably stick to SearX.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much everything connects through Google, beyond even the obvious stuff. I don&#39;t know how you would begin to disconnect from them. Legislate against them? I mean, they&#39;re in bed with government and the intelligence community in particular. They&#39;re able to do things government can&#39;t, there&#39;s no way they&#39;d cut off that ally.</p>

<p>What Assange has to say on Google is interesting, particularly the when Google met Wikileaks article. He talks about it in retrospect, and it seems clear that head Google people there were with the State Department, and their role was to be the intermediary that translated the technical side of Wikileaks to the political knowledge of State.</p>

<p>A few links (there are plenty more):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m just thinking that this might be beyond legislation.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not going to legislate away the NSA, particularly not their black ops. Google is basically working as a contractor for the NSA and other intelligence agencies doing the things they legally cannot do themselves.</p>

<p>The problem with the intelligence communities and their contractors is that they pretty much have blackmail material on everyone. Even if that can&#39;t be used against the populace at large to stop them from protesting, it can be used against Congress to stop them from voting.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what the solution is. It&#39;s like a swarm of octopi, but each tentacle is a hydra.</p>

<p>I like yours as well, I just feel oligarpolis is something more people will need to look up in the dictionary, and thereby let it pass by them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I skimmed  through your comment history, and here’s what I learned:</p>

<p>We’ve lost jobs/industries, and the days of having a decent paying job with benefits for 40 years are gone.</p>

<p>Much of what passes for entertainment these days is sex-filled emptiness, and the MSM does not deserve our attention.</p>

<p>You don’t participate in Facebook</p>

<p>Local police forces are being militarized, and we have two judicial systems in this country – one for the haves and one for the have-nots.</p>

<p>Critical thinking skills and motivation to read are disappearing, and we are breeding complacency.</p>

<p>We must save the bees.</p>

<p>The nuclear family is facing extinction, and the “notion of unbreakable loyalty and devotion. While it certainly exists, is nowhere near as common as I would like.”</p>

<p>You appreciate history and craftsmanship.</p>

<p>“We&#39;re paying attention to the wrong politics. The face of it, the &quot;explosive&quot; headlines… which has little relevance. We need to pay attention to actual legislation and deals, not all of this back-n-forth that&#39;s there for our collective entertainment and divisiveness.”
We have a drug epidemic in this country “with people dying from too strong of a drug, or outright cut with other unknown poisons.”</p>

<p>You have technical and mechanical knowledge that you willingly share to help others.</p>

<p>Healthy diets and physical exercise are important, and we’ve become overly-reliant on medical/psychiatric labels and medications.</p>

<p>Legislation requiring genetic testing for employees needs to go</p>

<p>We have the right to own guns</p>

<p>Our country’s transportation infrastructure is deteriorating.</p>

<p>We over-emphasize the importance of material possessions and continue to buy even when we know they are manufactured by child labor.  </p>

<p>We need to focus on issues, not parties, “Give a young Democrat a few years; perhaps some money, a business, home ownership..and they&#39;ll become a Republican like magic.”  “There&#39;s no sides except the affluent VS. the 95% of the rest of us.”</p>

<p>The sub needs to stop using the word that sounds like krill.</p>

<p>Know what?  I absolutely agree with all of the above.  We are on the same page and should not let semantics divide us.  </p>

<p>I’m also sorry you lost your dearly-loved dog – The strong unspoken bond we share with them exceeds so many of the tenuous ties we experience with human beings.  I lost my cat several years ago – We ’’grew up” together.  I share your grief and hope you find peace.  Everything is a healing process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I see that.  At the same time, you&#39;re willing to talk about JFK, Antarctica, and other &quot;conspiracies,&quot; so I&#39;m not sure where your &quot;line is.&quot;  I do understand what you mean about the jargon - in several ways - 1)The words can mean different things to different people. 2)  We throw around words like &quot;globalist&quot; and, in doing so, end up diluting the word to the point where the user is labeled a &quot;kook.&quot; 3) On subs like this, we don&#39;t have the benefit of facial expressions, voice inflections, etc. and that adds to misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Your feedback was helpful bc I do not want people to disregard my message as coming from a &quot;kook.&quot;  For that aspect of it, I thank you.  </p>

<p>These subs can be difficult - they&#39;re one of the most effective ways to share info and meet some wonderful people.  At the same time (more so since the election,)  it&#39;s easy to make fast judgments that cause us to alienate people with whom we actually have a lot in common.  Similarly to the way you judged me a &quot;kook,&quot; I judged you as &quot;rude.&quot;  However, when I looked through your comments, I saw someone with views very similar to my own.  </p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s some real &quot;kook&quot; :-) for you - What about a sub where people who &quot;get into it&quot; on Reddit go to find even one area of common ground?   We all share <em>something</em> with everyone else - We need to start seeing that rather than the differences.  </p>

<p>So glad we &quot;talked.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I really don&#39;t have a line. I&#39;ll entertain just about any theory. How long I do so is dependent upon the presentation, the evidence of such, and if I could see myself taking further interest. I also consider, motivations/agenda, the user themselves, etc. Like many internet addicts, my time is precious, and I do not have the time to engage in obvious silliness. However, from what I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed, I get incredibly frustrated with how easily people swallow shit up, or by posters who expect just that. I do my best to challenge things, elevate standards, and try to prompt people to use some sense. It&#39;s like a hobby I suppose. I also hate to see people being exploited, so I sort of take personal issue there.</p>

<p>I doubt you&#39;ll ever find a sub that is in 100% agreement with your beliefs, values, or views on a wide range of subjects. As I recommended to someone last week, try <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a>. It&#39;s less like cowboy territory and more relaxed. I should be over there myself, actually. To be quite honest, I&#39;m about ready to leave folks here to there own devices. It&#39;s getting old, and I&#39;m getting too frustrated.</p>

<p>Apologies for earlier. I&#39;m sometimes overbearing in my methods.</p>
