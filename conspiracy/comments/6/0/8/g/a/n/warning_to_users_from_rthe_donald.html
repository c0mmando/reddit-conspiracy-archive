       The moderator team of r/The_Donald has become infested with shills who have a clear agenda of organizing the diverse minds of r/The_Donald; an agenda of turning pedes into the classic dumbed-down, binary, left-vs-right thinkers loved and needed by the PTB.
       <br/>
       I've spent a lot of time on that sub with many different accounts confirming this.
       <br/>
       With increasing consistency, my comments have been getting shadowbanned (even though pedes upvote them) whenever they remind pedes to keep thinking independently and not get duped into adopting the left-vs-right, divide &amp; conquer mentality.

       These are just tools in that are being used to achieve their PRIMARY objective - which is to weaken, neuter and disable America and Western Europe - the people that these Zionistas see as their primary competitors, and who stand in the way of achieving their dream of a worldwide EthnOligarchy.

       He's not wrong though. The "United States" of America was more akin to an alliance of independent states, rather than a single country. The idea was to spread power out as much as possible to avoid any sort of tyranny. With each administration we see the trend is to take away state powers and consolidate them near the top, seeding in a more and more permanent government in the deep state that runs the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is never talked about or even taught, that the founding fathers understood, the single most important requirement for non-tyrannical societies, be they local or global, is the balance of power. Every power needs another power to impede them or else they end up with total world control. And as idealistic as it may be to hope that these world rulers are benevolent, nothing about human history has suggested anything but the most sociopathic making it into the high reaches of power. Even if they are good rulers there, it is only a matter of time before someone takes them out or replaces them that are corrupt or incompetent enough to be manipulated. Even the wicked don't stand to benefit from total power as they live with targets on their backs even among their own, and will have to relinquish their power to someone with different ideals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore the single most important role you can have as a citizen of Earth is to act in a way as to maintain the balance or power and deter its concentration.

       Whereas Trump is Israel firster and Goldman Sachs seconder (Americans don't even make the list), it's not surprising that Trump shills share the same priorities.

       Most posts there are anti-Trump, but that's only because it's mainly liberal. It's good to see the viewpoint of the left, but if you look (deep, past the top comments which aren't usually that amazing) in the comments there is some good conversation. Of course, conservative opinions are more likely to be downvoted, but I've seen some great exchanges.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I haven't seen anyone banned for a political opinion, but I have seen people downvoted for them. Pretty normal in a subreddit that leans one way.

       While it might be right that there is worthwhile content buried in a thread, I feel like life is too short to spend it wading through bullshit just to try and tuck some cuck. Much respect to those who do go there to change minds but imo its a lost cause.

       Agreed - I just get downvoted into oblivion. Sometimes I make really well worded posts and I get 2 points. But I've been outright uncivil (even though the warn against it!) and I still haven't gotten banned.

       T_D is much more of an echo chamber because they destroy opposition, politics just drowns it out and down votes you. The effect is essentially the same though however - you have to get other portions of your news elsewhere. The main difference between T_D and politics is style of oppression.

       It's not the same though. Remember all those downvote are from people that read your comment, so your message is at least getting out there. In T_D you can't even express an opposing idea.  It's won't even be there to be read or downvote do.

       That is true but because the userbase is 95% Democrats you won't get another point of view, and if you express one you will be downvoted. It's just as much of an echo chamber as the other subs

       That's the point, there's no middle ground except perhaps here at conspiracy.  There's no room for nuance - i.e.: Hillary is a criminal, was working for Wall Street, did steal the election from Bernie,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       Trump works for Wall Street and is a horrible militarist but there's nothing to the Russia crap

       The problem with being one-sided is that it leaves a vacuum, no place with such a wide-reach for Trump supporters to freely discuss and critique policy. 
Recently, I noticed any comments against the administration's potential policing of marijuana seemed to quickly disappear on r/ TD. I've also read speculation that Trump's team may actually view the Donald sub to gauge public opinion. Well, with the increased removal of honest critique and dissenting views, his team won't find a true measure of what supporters think. One can support Trump and also be critical of some of his policy decisions. 
I've been disappointed to see that sub turning into an echo chamber.

       Great, so now he is responsible for what everyone he has hired says? Pretty sure Trump said marijuana should be a state issue. Sorry but it's quite dumb that you conflate Sessions with Trump.

       Not conflating Sessions with Trump. But, this one does fall under the umbrella of the Trump administration policy. 
Although this applies to many issues, with the MJ issue it would have been fantastic for their team to see that the majority of supporters (from comments I initially saw on the Donald) do not support Sessions views and prefer Trump to stand by his position on States rights.

       That's what r/ask_TheDonald is for. They mainly use that as recruiting / conversion grounds, but it allows you to ask questions without being labeled a concern troll or getting (shadow) banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made a post in T_D right before the election that said if Trump doesn't follow through and actually drain the swamp that he would be a political hack in my mind - and I got outright banned ("deported") for that one. I appealed it and they let me back in - but there isn't any room for it. They do it because everywhere else is a battle  ground. Ironically, its a safe space for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, r/ask_TheDonald is open to questions and conversation about his policies, but I imagine far fewer people go there.

       You can still post in r/politics with any point of view. If Trump supporters weren't so afraid of opposing points of view, maybe they could go to r/politics and have more say over there. Most prefer to stay in the T_D echo chamber so all that's left at r/politics is anti Trump people.

       I think I see what is going on. You think that the connections that have been made between t_d and the white house are because the white house plants things there? Newsflash: people post there and someone in the white house follows it. It's not the white house posting, numb nuts.

       Are they banning people who have been with the sub for a while or people who have just subbed and started supporting Trump? Either way kind of a dumb move. Discussion should be the top priority in political subs. And yes that means you too r/politics and r/news.

       Isn't that their crusade though? Pizzagate was what helped launch their sub. It's weird watching them turn on eachother. Wonder what it will do to their base in the long run.

       Has also began to censor voices of Trump supporters who criticize his decisions. I was just banned a few days ago, for "flair abuse" because I took a stance against Meals on Wheels budget cuts.... Ridiculous.

       They do this because they know there are shareblue and other shills on reddit who have no interest in dialogue. So they'd rather not deal with paid shills who have no convictions.

       WTF are you talking about? They want a curated space where they can share news and not have a bunch of brainwashed, paid lemmings going "durr your source isn't NYT so it's automatically false".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you see no problem with people being paid to promote certain ideas and facts many false, while questioning all sorts of proven stories to create dissent.  Doing that on your own is one thing; being part of a paid group is another. Please understand the difference.

       I understand the difference perfectly well. The point i am making is as moderators, it is their job to make sure paid shills are not on the sub HOWEVER, this does not mean they ban anyone and everyone who differs from their point of view, as they are currently doing. 
Sure that means they need to put in a bit of effort. BUT that's the point isn't it, if you are the mods of such a big subreddit, that comes with some responsibility.

       Or you can chuck everyone out under the guise of not sharing their levels of devotion. Nothing in the world is black and white.

       You see a problem when others do it and then justify doing it yourself. 
Now I know you will next say that it is your right to be the mirror image of 'shariablue' or whatever, but don't you realise to the moderates that you are now as reprehensible as they are? Is that what you all want to be known as?
It's the responsibility of the moderators to maintain a sub to the highest standards. It's the difference between maintaining a city or trash dump the site of a city.

       You seem to have missed my point completely. I agreed with you already and said paid Shills are bad. But you still haven't answered my question. Are you ok with being as biased as share blue? Just because you cannot and do not want to know the difference between legit dissent and paid shills?
I hope simpler English helps this time around.

       Yeah, reading the_Donald does not mean I'm as biased as the mods. I don't read the_Donald as if it were some inerrant text and all truthful. But I do go there to get some halfway decent information that isn't bullshit lies about Russia. Politics is nothing but shills reposting WaPo and NYT lies.

       Adrian Chen also tracked down "The Agency" in Russia, which was a state-run online troll farm where Russian citizens were paid shills on the internet. He wrote extensively how many of the accounts he followed shifted towards pro-Trump talking points during Trump's campaign.

       I think Trump marketed himself as such but none of his actions or even campaign promises are outside of the old  paradigm.  His campaign platform from the wall to repeal of Obamacare/ACA are pure GOP platform ideas. The wall got its start with WH Bush and section were built long before him.  Repeal Obamacare, again the GOP has been trying for the past 7 years.  I am not seeing anything outside of the ideas that have already existed for a long time in both parties. Even his cabinet/admin picks, while some are out of the ordinary they still are all in line with the GOP and tea party platform.

       Have to agree. Not one mention of troops in Syria "kicking ass on ISIS"....very odd. Not one mention of airstrikes yesterday. War is too controversial to talk about on that sub, too much risk of losing control of the narrative. They don't even see it.

       Why do people assume T_D is compromised. We have direct evidence of liberal shills, but as of yet, the best that could be argued against conservatives is that they are real people being puppeted without their knowledge. I think you've fallen for the age-old "blame them of what you are guilty of".

       Yes. I've noticed a considerable downgrade in the_d. One of the very first posts I made once Trump got elected was to please continue the inclusive attitude shown during the election (back when they were considered scrappy underdogs and welcomed pretty much everyone). Now it's back to being binary and I have no doubt there's an agenda. That said, it's still a very useful sub because people there are red-pilled more than most... especially
       <a href="/r/redacted">
        /r/redacted
       </a>
       which is entirely corporatized at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what is up with the "Islam is a cancer" shit? I'm all for more stringent immigration and a complete overhaul, but ISIS is a tool used by our own damn government. WE are the ones fomenting radicalization (or at least capitalizing on) an otherwise normal religion for political purposes. There are of course more primitive sects of the religion doing stupid shit like stoning, but if it was inherently violent, the world would be in massive trouble given its followers totaling in the billion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see the "hate Islam" as one such useful tool being deployed by whoever is modding the place. If they're pro-Israel zionists then I'm not at all surprised.

       Just wanted to add to the conversation that the_donald is usually one of my stops from the front page, through the news/world news, politics, Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton for Prison and then finally this sub before shutting it down.  Anyway, interesting that recently the_donalds front page has been showing a lot of anti-bernie Sanders articles.  Kinda ironic considering I don't see Trump having won without a ton of Bernie  supporters citing for Trump in the end.  Idk if they are trying to win over the Bernie Bros by proping up Donny as the true people's champ or what, but it really comes off as rather divisive and probably counter productive to any hope of Donny getting re-elected.  To be honest my grasp of politics is rather rudimentary so who knows.

       There was no candidate worse than Killary. She's a murderous psychopath and was the new chosen puppet of the PTB (CIA/Pentagon &amp; friends).

       I don't like Trump and I didn't vote for him (voted for Jill) but it appears that he's not in league with the CIA; in fact the CIA is involved in an effort to get him impeached.

       Yes, he completely sold us out and he had some very peculiar flaws even before that occurred. His primary flaw being that, even while trying to appeal primarily to progressives, he virtually never spoke out against the military invasions or the military budget (even though those are, by far, our most serious problems). In fact, he even talked about getting other countries in the region involved in the invasion so that the U.S. isn't doing everything on its own, which, as you may be aware, had been the plan of the CIA/Pentagon for years.

       If we have enough independent thinkers thinking in this world, then wars wouldn't be an issue in the first place. The problem is we have too many zealots and crazies that are too easily manipulated by the few who are most hungry for power and control. The real war being fought is the slow and gradual one over peoples' minds...making sure that the ratio of easily-manipulated : independent-thinkers never gets out of hand. That becomes a problem for those who seek to control.

       TD is a very dangerous cancer.  Shills being propped up by shills.  Posts pushing narratives with bots. The sheep fall in line without any critical thinking all the while accusing the other side of the shit they do.

      <p>
       Lately they have felt much more comfortable allowing their racism to shine.  Just scroll through.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy side of me believes that some big movers inside reddit have been able to infiltrate that sub and systematically continue to keep pushing the racial boundary further and further with the hope of getting it shut down.

       I feel like T_D's mission was completed on Nov 8 and since gen it's useless baggage.  Hillary was punished for her crap but now it's Trump's turn.

       It's not about money printing or trade deals.  That's sort of kind of a dispute between American centric globalists and European centric globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around 1900, big businesses started using government regulations to suppress competition and guarantee their wealth to a degree.  If they hadn't, we'd have seen a sort of retro futuristic world like Ayn Rand's by the 40s.  The industrial revolution ended when competition and thus entrepreneurship that affected big business ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Business now is a political enterprise.  It's about who you know and what you say and do that gets you access to resources.  For example, homesteading rules and the ability to sue polluters who pollute other private property would be enough to manage oil in the free market.  Instead we have an almost communism where the government mandates where and when oil can be drilled.  Only a few certain companies are approved to refine oil in certain licensed refineries.  It's New Deal goddamn American economic fascism.  Telling businesses and consumers what they can or can't sell and managing - not regulating - big important consequential industries.  Little ma and pa companies still have relative freedom.  But energy, agriculture, transportation, healthcare - yeah not even close to a free market.  America is more than we admit a socialist shithole in ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fed enables this.  There used to be 30 some odd banks in America 8 years ago and now there are like 4 major ones left.  Want a lot of money to open a multi-hundred million dollar thing which will be economically consequential?  What an environmental approval?  Want that healthcare law waiver so you can afford you employee health benefits program?  Better fucking hire SJWs for your Har department.  That's the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real politics in America occurs in smokey back rooms, and elections are a joke.  I thought Trump represented some exception to this.  Nope.  His Bannon/Breitbart bullshit about America's military and factories going back to 1955 is hardcore bullshit.  1955 America was
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       than the New Deal, but it was 66% of the way to the New Deal from 1922, and was a military corruption money wasting powerhouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing has been taken from "them".  Trump is begging Yellen to keep the pumps flowing so the economy doesn't collapse before 2020.  Good luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hope was that Trump would expose the true nature of the American system which is the necessary first step to real change.  But he's not going to do that.  Hillary won't ever go to jail.  It's a joke.

       You miss the big picture. Why are regulations and taxes heaped against America? If America was really in charge wouldn't the gold flow to her? It's not, and there's a reason. Check out Corbett China NWO episode. Very enlightening.

       I'd say that's likely the case. There's a lot of psychology and precision involved in the current effort. It's like a branch of the CIA showed up; the branch that's in charge of perpetuating the left-vs-right bullshit through the generations.

        Hate 'muslims'
        <br/>

       <li>
        Hate 'liberals'
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Love gas guzzling vehicles &amp; guns
        <br/>

        Praise capitalism and corporations

       It may appear as though I'm just describing a stereotypical 'Republican'. That's because I am. These shills are trying to make Trump supports believe that, because they supported someone who just happens to have run under the Republican banner, they must now adopt all these 'Republican' stereotypes. The shills are trying to  turns the 'alt-right' (a diverse bunch that includes many independent thinkers) in the classic, stereotypical 'Republican' because that's what they need to continue to use the left-vs-right, divide &amp; conquer play book they've been using for decades.

       I got banned for posting one critical concern over Trump...and I backed the guy. Now, I am concerned, deeply. The foreign policy and sabre rattling is getting out of hand and it looks like business as usual and worse. I'm thinking PCR is right and the Trump presidency is over. Now they'll just ride it out until they impeach or whack him.

       Yeh something about a place that doesn't allow any free thought, dissent, is hate filled, and motivated does seem dangerous. They'd be the recruiting ground for Trump Youth if it gets to that point

       Yeah, there were people on that sub from all across the political spectrum because of the shared interest in keeping Killary out of the White House. There's still is a fair amount of diversity but it is rapidly disappearing because of the shill moderators I mentioned. At the current rate the sub will be nothing but a new generation of violent, clueless Bush-era retards.

       Well based off what you have said I could also say the same for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Anyone who uses logic and common sense are down voted or comments get deleted that support Trump in this case depending on the situation, but as I have said criticize him when it is warranted, but not if it is unnecessary. This entire post could also be said as the same as you suggested as divide and conquer mentality. Telling people that moderators on another subreddit are "shills" and try to use logic thinking, but to dumb down others to believe a different point of view just because, but I am taking it as you suggested it can be seen both ways.

       It's getting better here. The T_D posse doesn't have as firm of a grip anymore. I've seen logic upvoted quite a bit lately, as well as some more interesting conspiracy posts that aren't just a rehash of the usual pro-Trump conspiracies.

       That's true, I actually never knew about that sub reddit until someone brought it up the other day though, they should be more considerate though. They are banning people left and right easily because they get alot of shills. They didn't even respond to my response to the ban.

       I doubt that. How can you think about anything critically by only looking at things from one side. Any inch of dissent is banned. Any accountability you might have for trump is called concern trolling and banned.

       The_Donald is for Trump supporters, what's wrong with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's great to have a moderated forum for purely pro-Trump messages. You think Trump supporters don't get out to other forums?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a home base, and most certainly should be a protected space for Trump supporters. If you want debate, go to AskTrumpSupporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       What a stupid "warning". Where is your outrage over forums that actually should be open for fair debate, politics, news, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not issue a warning to the StarWars forums, attention!! Star Trek fans aren't welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your logic is terrible, and your shill ad hominems are nothing more than projection.

       Because Trump supporters elected Trump for certain reasons and would stop being Trump supporters if those reasons don't get fulfilled.  The T_D mods are shaping the discussion to keep that from happening.  Outside of T_D, Trump is cancer and can't be discussed sincerely.  So by framing discussion within T_D to certain issues, you can have "two" sides to an issue but no meaningful debate.

       Go "debate" on AskTrumpSupporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread, and the idiotic replies are nothing more than a pathetic attempt to subvert the power of The_Donald, which is annihilating political opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The_Donald has been since its inception an unapologetic fan party for Donald Trump, not a forum for rational debate.

       Diverse minds?  They call their sub a 24/7 campaign rally for Trump and if you criticize anything Trump does you can get banned.  You can be diverse in the way you attack other politicians but if you criticize Trunp you are outta there... even mild criticism.. people got banned for asking about Trump's connection to Betsy Devos's brother (blackwater founder) and how that seems likely to be the reason he picked her for Education.  Go over there and ask how appointing Mitch McConnell's wife to a cabinet position helps "drain the swamp."  You'll be banned.  The sub was designed to be a circlejerk.  It wasn't designed to be a 2-sided conversation or a free marketplace of ideas.  Go there to praise kek, blow everything Trump does and share memes.  Don't go there to question the dear leader or have an honest discussion about whether or not Trump is draining the swamp.  The people who post there regularly have no interest in holding Trump accountable.  They are just there to justify anything he does.  It's like divine command... something you might not agree with or like if a different politician did it suddenly becomes good when Trump does it.

       I at least can handle an echo chamber that openly expresses itself as such. The liberal reddit groups seem more like wolves in sheep skins. The Donald is a farce that is openly believed in and it pisses the liberals off. It used to be a glorious echo chamber that touted itself as such. If that is the case, then what are you guys complaining about??? Of course you got banned because you assumed it was a regular political reddit. In their ridiculous antics at least there is a modicum of truth in the lie... liberals believe they never lie and think they are proclaiming truth.

       my last post was about it's a place you can say what you believe... that's not the case. I haven't touched t_d in months as I'm so past having any politic subs. all politic subs and others who are invested by politic shills are a cancer.

       Go "debate" on AskTrumpSupporters.

       This thread, and the idiotic replies are nothing more than a pathetic attempt to subvert the power of The_Donald, which is annihilating political opposition.

      <p>
       The_Donald has been since its inception an unapologetic fan party for Donald Trump, not a forum for rational debate.
