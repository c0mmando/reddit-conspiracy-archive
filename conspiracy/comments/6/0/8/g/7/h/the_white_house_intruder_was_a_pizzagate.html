        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A man has been discovered on YouTube, called Jonathan with a video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZtcUSz1hjY">&quot;Trump-Russia&quot; Dirty Dossier</a>, uploaded on Feb 26th 2017. In this video he speaks about how people he knew tried <strong>ganging up on him to partake in sexual abuse.</strong> The guy decided to look into these people and why they were after him and sent the material to the police, but they weren&#39;t interested.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhQ51gm3eyU">another video</a> on March 4 2017, the guy speaks about how his room mate in 2016 was a cyber-stalker/pedo/predator with strange tendencies he didn&#39;t realise till later on. He says he was unfortunately fooled into signing some life insurance scam through his family and that room mate of whom all didn&#39;t like him. Later in the year he noticed his family and room mate was <strong>planning to kill him</strong> after discovering a well-set out plan of how such was to happen which he began to compile together to later take legal action. <strong>He soon compiled enough, handing it in to the FBI &amp; police.</strong></p>

<p>He says his &quot;dossier&quot; then got flipped around and parts leaked to press with what seems to be a rewrite to make it sound like it was Trump of whom did all these actions, which he says was totally false. He says the dossier he had handed in, which included info from his &quot;creepy&quot; roommate mentioned the DNC. Videos, photos and text of a setup to sexual assault. This part doesn&#39;t exactly make sense, as he speaks about the Russian dossier as if it was about sexual activity but it barely mentions that - a possible sign there is more pages of the fake Russian dossier to come, or indeed a completely different one.</p>

<p>On March 8th, the same guy uploads a video called &quot;Introduction&quot; where he says he&#39;s the author of the dossier that has been in the news, showing a Californian photo ID <a href="https://youtu.be/BMuJFFZWn4o?t=15">0:15</a> to the camera with the name <strong>Jonathan Tran.</strong> He announces that he is in Washington DC saying he can&#39;t speak why hes coming out of hiding and ends the video there.</p>

<p>Fast forward two days to March 10th and the white house grounds was breached by a man called <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39311901"><strong>Jonathan Tran</strong></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan Tran, 26
Mr Tran, who comes from Milpitas, California, had reportedly been spotted &quot;looming around&quot; Washington&#39;s Pennsylvania Avenue, where the White House stands, nearly six hours before his arrest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jonathan from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKNidr8-8UHvZRhKrs8n08Q/">youtube channel</a> <strong>was the Jonathan who trespassed.</strong></p>

<p>You can view his court sketch photo <a href="http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/834/cpsprodpb/B915/production/_95118374_de27.jpg">here</a>, as seen in the media. Compare that to his selfie <a href="https://ibb.co/mCyyMF">here</a> discovered via his <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/103781783336878284437">Google+ youtube page.</a></p>

<p>Using &quot;search by image&quot; I discovered this <a href="https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/AS%3A279106097827875%401443555487865_l/Jonathan_Tran3.png">photo of him</a>, found also on his google+ page links to his <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Tran3">ResearchGate page</a> which points out he&#39;s from San Jose in Cali. Back to the video on YouTube and if you remember, he had a Californian photo ID <a href="https://youtu.be/BMuJFFZWn4o?t=15">0:15</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>One must wonder what information he had that we haven&#39;t yet had..</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man I watched his videos and...I wish they made any sense.</p>

<p>Spooky though.  This is the guy Trump called &quot;a troubled individual&quot;.  I&#39;d not heard he was a Pizzagater, but if Trump knew of Jonathan Tran enough to call him &quot;troubled&quot; - he must then know of Pizzagate?</p>

<p>Also how&#39;d he hang out for 15 freaking minutes on the White House lawn without being apprehended?</p>

<p>PS as I&#39;m watching this video I get a push notification that someone else has been arrested on the White House.</p>

<p>Um, experience with mentally ill people.</p>

<p>But, try me.  Name one mental illness that isn&#39;t exhibited in behavior?  Anxiety, depression, bi-polar, MS... those all can be recognized in a persons behavior, does not shape their beliefs.</p>

<p>Now, believing everything you are told may be a sign of low IQ. That&#39;s not really mental illness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So experience with mentally ill people has shown you that mental illness does not manifest in them delusional beliefs?</p>

<p>See you are twisting what we are talking about. I never said it doesn&#39;t manifest in behaviour. Not once. I said you are dead wrong in saying that it does not manifest in beliefs.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t have to shape their beliefs, but mental illness often does. Example would be almost every case of paranoid schizophrenia.</p>

<p>You named five.  They are all obvious by behavior.  Schizo, bipolar, etc... all of them are obvious by behavior.  You don&#39;t have to talk about their beliefs.  Sure, they do have delusions... but those disorders you can clearly see by behavior.  You can diagnose all of those based on behavior alone.  All have clear behavioral affects.</p>

<p>Someone can have odd beliefs, and it&#39;s not a mental illness or delusions.  But, someone can&#39;t be schizo and behave normally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can anyone watch this and take this guy seriously rather than first suspect mental illness? The way he speaks and his inability to actually communicate anything of value makes me highly suspicious of his mental state at this time...whether he&#39;s on drugs or it&#39;s just the way he is naturally.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t explain anything to the viewer about WHY his &quot;dossier&quot; regarding some people who wanted to fuck/kill him, personally, for whatever reason relates to the dossier about Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He says he was unfortunately fooled into signing some life insurance scam through his family and that room mate of whom all didn&#39;t like him. Later in the year he noticed his family and room mate was planning to kill him after discovering a well-set out plan of how such was to happen which he began to compile together to later take legal action.

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but when I read something like that my first instinct is either troll or schizophrenic. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve actually known schizophrenic people in my personal life and have heard similar things from them. Sure, it&#39;s <em>possible</em> this guy is actually telling the truth about something significant...but most likely he&#39;s not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy was on a list obviously, if he wasn&#39;t working directly for an agency or contractor. It&#39;s difficult-to-impossible to know which. But what we do know is that regardless of whether he&#39;s a shill or a so-called &#39;targeted individual&#39; (their terminology, not mine), is that they were watching him, and they knew he was going to jump the fence before he did it. </p>

<p>So why did they let him jump the fence? My guess is that they&#39;re trying to intimidate Trump. They&#39;re showing him some &#39;random guy&#39; off the street can hang out in the White House for a quarter of an hour and there&#39;s nothing that can stop that. Unless of course Trump puts his full trust and fealty before whichever agency is responsible for this. </p>

<p>The intrusion also serves the second, and possibly primary goal, of discrediting theories, and efforts to reveal, the horrific state crime of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanStasi/">&#39;Disruption,&#39;</a> or surveillance abuse. Because whether this character is an actual target, or merely a useful idiot, he is by all appearances a target.</p>
