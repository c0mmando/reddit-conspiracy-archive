       Hey guys! I just recently got into reddit (can't believe I didn't find myself dabbling in it sooner) so I'll understand if I don't get many comments because of skepticism. 
But I just don't know where to start with this project I'm going to be doing, I need some starting points so I'm wondering what the biggest events, pieces of information, any videos you watched etc. that was the turning point in your life and made you realize things were not what they seemed, and better yet, the thing you saw/heard of that made you want to do more research.
I want to compile research for beginners to open their eyes in an aesthetic manner. Thank you!

       Wow, I can only say welcome my friend. While I've always loved scouring the internet for info, once you learn how to "self-filter" the content in r/conspiracy you will never look back. A vast wealth of knowledge is here and you'll find yourself addicted to what you'll find everyday. The truth awaits and have fun

       I used to think chemtrails was a ridiculous conspiracy until I came across the Morisy FOIA request from Dugway Proving Grounds. Ive posted this a couple times
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go into these documents and search for aerosol or spray, you'll find that they have at the very least tested the tech. There's even some About VX spray.

       Worth noting that it's not 100 percent chemtrails, but it has gems like this:

       I personally think Area 51 is a limited hangout to distract from Dugway. If you look at it in Google Earth, you'll see its covered with things like
       <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/45/4d/e5/454de57266c3d10abcad05321d078638.jpg">

       </a>
       all over the place in varying shapes and sizes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dugway is also (somehow) related to FL, but that's a completely different pill.

       Remember the War Crimes Tribunal set up by the Soviets to punish those Japanese responsible for human experiments in Manchuria? No? That's probably because the US Government labeled them show trials pushing a Communist agenda while protecting the very people the Soviets wanted to prosecute. What records managed to survive came into the possession of US authorities in the years immediately following the war. Research including, but not limited to, the use of aerosolised chemical and biological weapons ended up at Dugway Proving Grounds. With the exception of the few low-level people the Soviets got their hands on, nobody was prosecuted and those responsible for some of the most horrific atrocities of WWII went on to become CEOs of pharmaceutical companies and one even became Japanese Minister of Health.

       Probably 9/11. I had doubts in my mind when it happened. Specifically the Pentagon attacks. I couldn't understand why there was no footage of the plane crashing into the most secure building on the planet because none of the cameras in the area were working. The fall of the twin towers totally looked like controlled demolitions to my (admittedly) naive 19 year old brain and the hole in the pentagon wall didn't look big enough for an aircraft. I said this to my friends who laughed and thought I was crazy, so I didn't say anything else. Then I found out about a film called Loose Change in 2007 in a copy of Empire magazine, it was just a little inch article on one of the pages talking about the film, saying it was available to watch online, so I watched it and my brain exploded. There is so much footage in that film taken from various news sources that I fail to understand how people could have missed it at the time.

       Wow thanks guys. You input will seriously contribute to opening some new eyes. 
I've been super busy since I posted, but I def have my work cut out for me now.
I'm excited to see what new info I'll find from these comments, I know quite a bit - which was my issue, I have been researching like - nonstop - for about a year and wish I would have kept on tab everything I discovered, but I didn't, so I had no idea where to start with it all for this project.
Figured it would be a good idea to see what helped wake other people up, so I'm not displaying some 'craziness' in a video that is suppose to reach the sleeping. If that makes sense.
