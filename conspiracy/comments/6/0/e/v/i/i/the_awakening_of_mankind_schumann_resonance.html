        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On 1/31/17, I observed that the Schumann Resonance had spiked to 30+ for several days. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/KUnqq">Proof</a> here.  Several days later, it had continued spiking and bursts has grown in intensity. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/UPAVh">Proof here</a>.</p>

<p>In 2014, it was considered noteworthy and out of the ordinary that the resonance measured energetic peaks (where the white areas extend to) of 24, and the graph looked <a href="http://imgur.com/a/KNaw2">like this</a>. This <a href="http://www.trinfinity8.com/why-is-earths-schumann-resonance-accelerating/">article</a> discusses how strange this was back then. In those good &#39;ol days, a spike to 9 Hz was considered abnormal. </p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.trinfinity8.com/why-is-earths-schumann-resonance-accelerating/">September 2015 article</a>, entitled &quot;Why Is Earth’s Schumann Resonance Accelerating?&quot; observed that, &quot;For many years this resonance frequency has hovered at a steady 7.83 Hz with only slight variations. In June 2014 that apparently changed. Monitors at the Russian Space Observing System showed a sudden spike in activity to around 8.5 Hz.</p>

<p>Since then, they have recorded days where the Schumann accelerated as fast as 16.5 Hz. (The graph is usually blue with some green, and no white.) At first they thought their equipment was malfunctioning, but later learned the data was accurate. Everyone was asking, what’s causing this intermittent spiking activity?&quot;</p>

<p>This brings us to modern day, and some truly bizarre measurements.</p>

<p>Just this month, on 3/12/17, <a href="http://imgur.com/xvZYJ4g">this burst of energy was recorded</a> and commented on on <a href="http://2012portal.blogspot.com/2017/03/taiwan-ascension-conference-report.html">Cobra&#39;s blog</a>. The 3/12/17 energy burst was confirmed (with a higher quality image) by another Redditor on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5z0r6t/the_schumann_resonance_was_off_the_charts_last/">this post</a>, with this <a href="http://imgur.com/FzPyRHA">proof</a> provided. As you can see, the period prior to 3/12 was an absolute lull in comparison.</p>

<p>And then we have this, the reason for my post today:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/vet281x">This is what the Schumann Resonance has looked like for 3/18/17 and 3/19/17, and the surrounding days.</a></p>

<p>Noteworthy about the recent S.R. spike on 3/18/17 is the fact that things were relatively &quot;normal&quot; prior to that day, and that there were two out of the ordinary bursts of energy recorded over the course of the 3/18 - 3/19 period.</p>

<p>When compared to 2014 data and information from January, one can see that not only has the resonance continued to rise and go off the charts since the end of January; the duration and intensity of the spikes has continued to increase.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in tracking the resonances yourself, <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsosrff.tsu.ru%2F&amp;edit-text=">this site</a> , which is an English translation, is where all of the info is from. There, you can view the data in real time. Click &quot;Schumann Resonances&quot; on the left sidebar to see the graphs shown above.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re so inclined, <a href="https://www.heartmath.org/research/global-coherence/gcms-live-data/">HeartMath.org</a> pulls a lot of data, including the Schumann Resonance, together into one page with other potentially related measurements, including those of the <a href="http://global-mind.org/gcpdot/">Global Consciousness Project</a>. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>So... why is any of this important, and why are you telling me this?</strong></p>

<p>Many have postulated that the Schumann Resonance - a measurement of the frequency of the electromagnetic field of the earth - is somehow connected to (and has an impact upon) human consciousness, and that we can both cause it to fluctuate as well as be effected intensely by its fluctuations.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances">Wikipedia article on the subject</a>, the Schumann Resonances &quot;are a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low frequency (ELF) portion of the Earth&#39;s electromagnetic field spectrum.&quot; Schumann resonances, the entry goes on to say, &quot;are global electromagnetic resonances, generated and excited by lightning discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth&#39;s surface and the ionosphere.&quot;</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.zmescience.com/other/feature-post/amazing-earth-facts/">article</a> states, &quot;The phenomenon was predicted mathematically by physicist Winfried Otto Schumann in 1952 and since confirmed by observations. Recently, C/NOFS, a satellite of the US Air Force carrying NASA’s Vector Electric Field Equipment has detected these waves at ranges of 400-800 km in space.&quot;</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, 50 years prior to scientist Schumann&#39;s work in the 1950&#39;s, during which he &quot;discovered&quot; the resonances, these frequencies had already been discovered by Nikola Tesla during his research in 1899-1900. Tesla&#39;s frequencies were based upon direct measurements of frequency introduced and propagated through the earth, rather than mirrored in the atmosphere. Both Tesla and Schumann, however, found that earth essentially functions as a massive planetary capacitor, storing and releasing electrical charge at specific intervals.  These pulses may be measured indirectly in our atmosphere within the Ionoshpere. </p>

<p>Our good friends at NASA say in this <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/schumann-resonance.html">article</a> that, &quot;While they&#39;d been predicted in 1952, Schumann resonances were first measured reliably in the early 1960s. Since then, scientists have discovered that variations in the resonances correspond to changes in the seasons, solar activity, activity in Earth&#39;s magnetic environment, in water aerosols in the atmosphere, and other Earth-bound phenomena.&quot;</p>

<p>It has been theorized and acknowledged by modern-day science that the earth&#39;s magnetic field, which is measured and represented as the Schumann Resonances - serves a protective function. In a <a href="http://sedonanomalies.weebly.com/schumann-resonance.html">Nexus Magazine article</a> from April-May 2003 author Iona Miller writes that, &quot;Since life began, the Earth has been surrounding and protecting all living things with a natural frequency pulsation of 7.83 Hz.&quot;</p>

<p>The 7.83 Hz measurement is important, simply because the Schumann Resonance has remained steady at this &quot;base&quot; measurement for years, rarely deviating from it. &quot;Such frequencies,&quot; Miller says, &quot;have wrapped earth’s life since its inception.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Normal daily variation,&quot; she says, &quot;ranges ± 0.5 Hertz.&quot; She acknowledges, however, that it is possible for the frequency to increase to as high as 43.2 Hz... and indeed it has.</p>

<p>The cause of the increase in the frequency remains a mystery. However, modern science acknowledges that these frequencies have a direct and powerful effect on the well-being of the living beings which habitate the earth. When the Schumann Resonance fluctuates, it can cause noticeable changes in the behavior, mood or physical and mental health of both humans and animals, should we (for whatever reason) be unable to match that frequency.</p>

<p>The &quot;primal,&quot; or &quot;base&quot; Schumann Resonance pulse, according to Miller, &quot;calibrates us and enhances our physical and mental well-being.&quot; That natural resonance, she says, &quot;helps us achieve our optimal brainwave states.&quot; Unfortunatly, as demonstrated in this <a href="http://imgur.com/RgqnQXi">image</a>, which illustrates the Schumann Resonance in relation to other commonly utilized frequencies, &quot;this atmosphere-to-human linkage, &quot; as Miller puts it, &quot;is disrupted by the electrosmog of today’s technology.&quot; </p>

<p>So not only do we have natural changes in the earth&#39;s frequency to contend with, but modern technology is getting in the way of our need for harmonization. There is <a href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/10-shocking-facts-health-dangers-wifi/">ample evidnece</a> that signals emitted by Wi-Fi enabled devices can cause insomnia by disrupting sleep cycles. </p>

<p>The above article mentions a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17548154">study</a> in which &quot;participants were exposed to the electromagnetic signals from real phones or no signal from fake phones. Those exposed to the electromagnetic radiation had a significantly more difficult time falling asleep and changes in brainwave patterns were observed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It’s been suggested that sleeping near a phone, in a home with Wi-Fi, or in an apartment building with many Wi-Fi signals can create chronic sleep problems as the constant bombardment of Wi-Fi pollution interferes with falling asleep and sleep patterns.&quot;</p>

<p>It gets worse.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.iamcured.com/blog/pemf-is-a-benefit-for-mankind/">this article</a>, &quot;If our bodies are blocked from natural exposure to these natural waves (the Schumann Resonances) (e.g., due to living and working in buildings constructed with concrete, steel and metal alloys, driving in cars on paved roads, and by the electro-pollution of ultra-high frequency radiations from cell phones, microwave ovens, wireless phone and computer networks, and radar/satellite signals, etc.) we are more susceptible to illness, loss of cell membrane integrity, compromised immunity, and depression. Recorded dips in the Earth’s Schumann resonances have had strong correlation to heart attacks, car accidents, and in a general increase in the death rate.&quot;</p>

<p>The 7.83 Hz - or &quot;base&quot; frequency of the earth, it&#39;s &quot;heartbeat,&quot; if you will - has been historically linked and corrleated to the human alpha brain frequency, which was also been measured at 7.83 Hz via EEG. In other words, the earth&#39;s natural resonances are correlated to human brainwave activity.  And whatever the frequency is, it&#39;s important we are in harmony with it.</p>

<p>According to the author of the aforementioned <a href="http://www.trinfinity8.com/why-is-earths-schumann-resonance-accelerating/">September 2015 article</a>, &quot;A 7.83 Hz frequency is an alpha/theta state,&quot; she goes to say. &quot;Relaxed, yet dreamy; sort of a neutral idling state waiting for something to happen. A 8.5 – 16.5 Hz frequency moves one out of the theta range into more of a full calmer alpha state with faster more alert beta frequencies starting to appear. (This correlates with slowly waking up cognitively). Since the Schumann Resonance has had sudden spikes between 12 – 16.5 Hz, I found this even more interesting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In Neurofeedback,&quot; the author reports, &quot;12-15 Hz is called Sensory-Motor Rhythm frequency (SMR). It is an ideal state of &#39;awakened calm.&#39; Our thought processes are clearer and more focused, yet we are still &#39;in the flow&#39; or &#39;in the know.&#39; In other words, Mother Earth is shifting her vibrational frequency and perhaps so are we. This may be one of many signs that we are awakening.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>The author above goes so far as to suggest that the earth is actively raising its vibration, and that this presents us with the choice: raise your vibration to match, or suffer the consequences.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever is happening,&quot; she says, &quot;it’s clear that this acceleration may make you feel more tired, exhausted, dizzy, depressed, and even strange as you raise your own frequencies to be more in tunes&quot; with the earth&#39;s.</p>

<p>It has already been established that human consciousness can affect our material world, and that a correlation exists between the Schumann Resonances and the data produced by the Global Consciousness Project.</p>

<p>Regarding the global consciousness and mankind&#39;s ability to impact its environment, take this September 2011 <a href="http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2011/09/06/9-11-and-global-consciousness/">National Geographic article</a> on the subject, entitled, &quot;9/11 and Global Consciousness.&quot;</p>

<p>It reads:</p>

<p>&quot;Chances are, you probably remember exactly what you were doing on the morning of September 11, 2001, at the moment when you first learned about the attack on the World Trade Center.  And if you were one of the millions who stared in horror at the television images of smoke billowing from the crippled towers, you undoubtedly can recall the intense, excruciatingly painful surge of grief and anger and sadness that you felt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You may be surprised, however, to learn that Princeton University researchers believe that so many people around the world were affected in the same way that their collective mental energy actually altered the operation of computers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Those findings, which have aroused some controversy in the scientific world, were produced by Princeton’s  Global Consciousness Project, whose goal is to determine whether, and if so to what extent, human consciousness—that is, our minds’ awareness of the world in which we exist—can synchronize and act coherently.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;I think the data are pretty much indisputably in support of that we do interconnect, we interact, we’re not isolated,&#39; the project’s director, Roger Nelson, explains in this video on the organization’s website. &#39;My consciousness, inside my skull, and yours, extend out into the world, and they intermix. We’re a little like neurons, in a giant brain, that we know nothing about.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Regarding 9/11, <a href="http://global-mind.org/gcpdot/">GCP</a> laboratory scientist Dean Radin predicted that if investigated, the GCP&#39;s variance on the date of 9/11 would show strong fluctuations: &quot;I’d predict something like ripples of high and low variance, as the emotional shocks continue to reverberate for days and weeks.&quot;</p>

<p>This <a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu/911formal.html">formal announcement</a> from the  regarding the 9/11 readings, offered <a href="http://imgur.com/vEZz2NX">this graphic</a> showing that their data recorders indeed displayed a marked deviation from &quot;random&quot; during the events of 9/11, with a crescendo following the 1st tower collapse, and a monumental shift following the collapse of the 2nd.</p>

<p>GCP&#39;s <a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu/911variance.html">9/11 variance summary</a> goes onto say of the results, &quot;It looks like a long, emphatic moment of feeling and knowing by a global consciousness. This <a href="http://imgur.com/MwRvrOy">piercing graphic cry</a> seems symbolic of the pain surrounding our slow and spasmodic struggle to become human. It is possible to envision a global consciousness that we may one day embrace, and that could embrace us all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If the <a href="http://imgur.com/nTiDxeZ">general picture of the graph</a> is liberally taken, it seems to show that there was a period of several days leading to and following the 11th during which the EGG data showed unusual behavior.&quot;</p>

<p>The Director of the GCP, Roger Nelson, in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RojTua3coto">YouTube video</a>, hosted on his own channel, entitled, &quot;Interconnected Mind and the Global Conciousness Project,&quot; opens with a Carl Sagan quote: &quot;We are a way forthe cosmos to know itself.&quot;</p>

<p>Nelson in the video, goes on to say, &quot;The GCP was designed to look at the possibility of humans when they&#39;re brought to common focus of attention by a disaster or celebration.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The data pretty much indisputably supports the fact that we do interact,&quot; Nelson says, &quot;We interact without isolated consciousness inside my skull. My consciousness - and yours - extend out into the world... we&#39;re a little bit like neurons in a giant brain which we know nothing about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Already,&quot; Nelson goes on to say, &quot;the evidence shows there&#39;s something that happens when very large groups of people come together.&quot; He goes on to say, &quot;Groups can come together, driven by a common emotion or experience, to form something new, a new entity or group consciousness.&quot;</p>

<p>My <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rezyw/humans_are_waking_up_for_first_time_in_recorded/">original post</a>, on this subject was popular, and ended up getting reposted elsewhere by many YouTube channels, and the Schumann Resonance began to be discussed in earnest, often in connection with odd feelings of jubilation or anxiety here on earth, or with bizarre signs in the sky, and other seemingly bizarre occurrences.</p>

<p>Though there is nothing close to a consensus on what it all means, or whether the rise in the Schumann Resonance has anything to do with these up&#39;s and down&#39;s, many are speculating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One can look at it that way, but even if God weren’t judging the bankers, the increase in the Schumann Resonance is an indicator of the raising and the increasing of the vibratory frequency of the entire solar system - and since that includes the energy and frequency of the planets and all the beings living on them, this means that the citizenry here on this planet will become (and already is becoming actually) more and more aware and less and less willing to continue taking unfairness.  More and more adept individuals will be born and will rise up to intelligently challenge the system in such a manner that the old guard, the old, bullying, manipulating status quo (similar to the horrid picture to the right) will be more and more difficult to continue.</p>

<p>It’s a long, slow process, and the real changes likely won’t really begin happening in our lifetime/generation…but the change is most definitely already happening and under way.</p>

<p>These are changes that are happening to the entire solar system - not just humans on planet Earth.</p>

<p>Scientists from the Ulysses mission have proven that sounds generated deep inside the Sun cause the Earth to shake and vibrate in sympathy. They have found that Earth’s magnetic field, atmosphere and terrestrial systems, all take part in this cosmic sing-along.</p>

<p>David Thomson and Louis Lanzerotti, team members of the HISCALE experiment, on board Ulysses, together with colleagues Frank Vernon, Marc Lessard and Lindsay Smith, present evidence that proves that Earth moves to the rhythm of the Sun. They show that distinct, isolated tones, predicted to be generated by pressure and gravity waves in the Sun, are present in a wide variety of terrestrial systems. </p>

<p>Just as planet Earth is influenced by the rhythm and movements of the sun, the entire solar system itself is ultimately even more influenced by its orbit with and around the sun&#39;s sister star - Sirius A - and its accompanying planets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you have just said here is right on. I have been trying to explain this very thing to those close me. It&#39;s a slow process, in some regards. The only rapid part of this whole thing might be that we see our very own systems collapse, and rather quickly. We will have a time of civil unrest, and possibly martial law. Nuclear fallout is likely, but it will be short and quick. Once its all over with, there will be a group of people who have made it beyond the third density of vibration. They will be inheriting this planet, and over time, they will be able to make themselves invisible to third density. This was recently, again, explained by a TRIO network of social memory complexes who are working together - they&#39;re known as Q&#39;uo. RA is one of the three who consists of Q&#39;uo. RA is still corresponding with the very same man (Jim) who brought to us RA in the 80&#39;s. They&#39;re still in correspondence. It&#39;s amazing. A few weeks ago, Jim asked more detailed questions about the &quot;harvest&quot; and we had incredibly long detailed replies. More clarification was offered. Apparently, it will take between 100-700 years for third density vehicles to completely die out. What remains is an evolutionary transformation that also reflects our spiritual transformation. So, souls who are prepared to inhabit fourth density vehicles here, will do so. It is said those who do not possess the vibration of pure love will and still have to learn to dissolve their egos will be transferred to another planet to continue the lessons of third density. </p>

<p>Often seems that way - yes.  However, I often go ahead and post things that I feel are the case and attempt to contribute to the overall awakening in whatever way that I can.  Like, for example, this particular OP itself.  Look what happened.  I posted what I did about yugas, and yes - there were of course a few posts by people who have no clue and came here to just troll, but I think it’s still a good thing that we discussed this information here because there are some people who will come across this OP and the information in it and it might open them up in a manner that wasn’t the case before.  In that sense, we did a good job because we contributed to others understanding new and better things.  I think that’s a good thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I walked into a den of wolves, I can see that much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah…but <em>you’re a wolf too, God dammit.</em></p>

<p>Think about it that way.  :)  We must be strong.  If we have the truth - or at least a certain aspect of it - then we must not fear those who might attempt to fight against that truth.</p>

<p>I knew when I posted what I initially posted that there would likely come some serious trolls.  Didn’t matter.  I still posted it because I feel strongly enough that at least some of the information that I have and that I impart is valid enough.</p>

<p>I’m not going to let others that try to talk against what I say keep me from speaking what I feel is the right thing.  Fuck that, and fuck anyone who wants to try to talk it down.  I certainly don’t know everything (by far), and I’m here to learn as much as possible from others who might know more - I’m here to defer to those who show that they know things too - but there are some things that I do feel confident in knowing as well, and for those who want to try to challenge those things?  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=come+at+me+bro&amp;amp;atb=v53-5__&amp;amp;iax=1&amp;amp;ia=images">Well…</a></p>

<p>Okay then, beautiful soul.  Know that there is a <em>lot</em> of hatred and animosity on this planet.  That’s just the way it is here.  Stay honest and stay humble, but stay strong and know that you KNOW what you know.  Always be willing to learn - know that there’s also a lot that you <em>don’t</em> know as well - but even though none of us are perfect, it doesn’t mean that we’re also not right about <em>some</em> things…and those things we’re right about?</p>

<p>Well God dammit we’re <em>right</em> about them.  I’m not gonna let just anybody try to tell me that what I know and feel is right <em>isn’t</em> right.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I actually don’t like arguing and getting upset and going back and forth with people.  However, I also don’t like bullies.  I <em>really</em> don’t like bullies.  And when I come across someone trying to unnecessarily badger down a point I or someone else made, I get pretty darn riled up.  I don’t take that shit.  :)</p>

<p>That may not be an incorrect point actually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recognize the purity in every person you can encounter - recognize you never lost it, and neither did they. Exercise faith that you possess this vibration of higher understanding/love, and so does every person who appears &quot;lost&quot; or unfamiliar to you.

<p>Do not listen to the people who are coming on here slamming RA. They are scared of it because its channeled information from a sixth density social memory complex.</p>

<p>Everything people are saying here lines up perfectly with the wisdom teachings from RA. David Wilcock himself comes from the social memory complex of RA, actually. So any one who has been studying David Wilcock may think about also studying the same material he and many others hold very dearly to their heards: that is of the RA Material. To this day, Jim, who is a physicist, still corresponds with this social memory complex. They discuss ascension all the time. And only from a service to others point of view. Those who &quot;HATE&quot; on RA, are probably very self-to-self oriented, and they are terrified of the light. That is a fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that can be either of negative polarity or positive. </p>

<p>But in essence, it is the next natural step that souls can/may take, if they so chose. Merging of our minds together is natural, and collaboration of consciousness is natural as well. Here in the third density, we have chosen soverignty, thinking that our cleverness has some how won us something. It never has, and it never will. It only has bought us intense distortion and a system of lies. Over time, when you blend with other consciousnesses around you - what can happen is a social memory complex can be formed over a long period of time. Think of merging energy fields who&#39;s patterns/vibration form to coalesce, merge, and combine. What&#39;s available to that group is their collective memory, experiences, and even full recollection of their past lives.. There are many social memory complexes helping to guide our planet right now. Some throw in a bit of polarity into the works, others are quite pure and would never claim to be &quot;GOD&quot;. They&#39;re merely elder brothers, existing in a higher dimensional format. Social memory complexes can be born in the density above us (fourth), or even fifth, and sixth. In exceedingly rare cases, apparently they can be born in our own format here in the third density of vibration.  RA is one from sixth, and the information is completely pure and does not play around with polarity/negativity. Nor are they trying to sell &quot;light&quot; to people in a deceptive package, as one person around here is suggesting. Though I can understand why this person has come to that conclusion and bitterly so - he is in my opinion, choosing a life of ego over one of union ship. I don&#39;t blame him. It can be tempting to damn the information to hell when we see the world hurt us and those around us. </p>

<p>All I can tell you is.. don&#39;t fear union ship with minds around you. Our egos truly deceive us on a moment to moment basis. To the point it has its own voice/guidance system. Its constantly telling us to attack others. To evolve in our consciousness, eventually the ego must be dissolved and union ship remembered - with this new remembrance comes our &quot;veil&quot; slowly melting away, which is the very thing that prevents us from remembering our past lives. </p>

<p>This is all very elementary information - but I think that giving that elementary information is necessary to start a basis of information. There was once a time where RA had to do this with Jim/Carla/Don, as well. </p>

<p>Stay safe in the times ahead. Love - </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The RA material can be downloaded for free (because Jim was never in on this for profit).. The material can also be purchased on Amazon or directly from LLResearch, but this is a serious organization. Not a bunch of occult psychos who are into channeling... RA came to them because a group of dedicated individuals could handle the vibration to create a narrow band contact into a realm much higher than your average channeled sources. This information is incredibly pure, as it comes form the sixth density. Much channeled information out there (That is a bit of dark/light) comes from fourth, and fifth. Sixth is a density that defies polarity and is incredibly pure. Pure love. Pure light. PURE information. UNTAINTED with all the lies of the ego, dualism, and all of that deception.. I can promise this.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like access to the RA material for free- just message me and I&#39;ll shoot you a link. Or you can purchase it from Amazon. There are five books. It will probably take a few months to finish the books. Once you&#39;re done with that education - you can continue to read wisdom from RA who is STILL enlightening the planet through Jim today. I know it sounds a little crazy... But again, I promise this is not your usual channeled material. This group does not self-proclaim themselves as God, and they are not ruled by EGO, nor do they teach others to live by ego - and they aren&#39;t into being &quot;masters of manifestation&quot;. Manifestation lessons are actually where Deception lies. RA only speaks/teaches the science of vibration/light. ONLY that. And nothing else. </p>

<p>Also, I would recommend calming down, ridding yourself of the hostility/poison, or its going to take you down. You sound very angry, and very upset. It&#39;s not a very good way to exist. Stop being angry at the world and people around you. You&#39;re clearly looking at people to snap at every chance you get. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, there is far more to this than you could ever imagine. And its more complicated than &quot;2012&quot;. Apparently, much actually did occur in 2012 vibrationally speaking. Many of us are well educated on this. It takes years of research to understand even a portion of what&#39;s going on out there.

    <div class="md"><p>I think its great to see you all talking about the right questions. I&#39;m also really excited to see that there are people who fully understand what is happening out there. That this ascension is real. The the planet ascending is real, and that the really the only question at hand right now is HOW LONG this will all take. According to RA (well, actually now Q&#39;uo), who is still speaking to us through Jim to this day (since the 80&#39;s), it will take anywhere from 100-700 years for the transformation to be totally complete. That said, there is still an opportunity for fourth density graduates to ascend into higher position, and even make their new density invisible to third while third lives out the remainder of their lives on this planet. That is great news. It gives all of us some hope that we might be one of the lucky few who has gotten our vibration in order to be part of this thing!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ra / Q&#39;uo is nothing more than a deceiving spirit doing the work of the father of lies.  There&#39;s enough truth in what he / it / they (<em>we are Legion, for we are many</em>) say to get you hooked into believing it&#39;s <em>all</em> truth.  Then it throws in a ton of information you <em>want</em> to believe is true, like concepts of reincarnation, the whole thing about space/time and time/space, that no one sits in hell for an eternity, that both left and right-hand paths (self-oriented and others-oriented) lead ultimately to the same 8th density state of Oneness / Christ consciousness (by the way, both left and right-handed paths are lies that make people feel like they have a choice in the matter), and that the only judgement for sin is that you end up spending a lifetime or two repeating the 3rd density or move to the 4th on a planet under the control of the &quot;Orion&quot; group.</p>

<p>The whole thing -- all of it -- is nothing more than demonic manipulation, channeling deceptive spirits, and denying everything about the true nature of God.  I was pulled into that mess for a long time, but now I can look back on it for what it really is: a small thread of the Great Deception beginning to blanket humanity, and prepare it for the ultimate rise of the final world dictator.  It will be brutal, bloody, and horrible.  You think you&#39;re on the &quot;light&quot; side, but you overlook the one simple fact that the &quot;light&quot; side and the &quot;dark&quot; side are of a single mind, with the same ultimate goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re actually quite wrong. Very wrong. RA never self-proclaimed such sickening things. Not once. One would actually have to read the material (in full, not cherry picking lines out) to know that, however. It pays to study. Not to project and make assumptions about something one knows nothing of.

    <div class="md"><p>As sick as it makes me feel to admit, I&#39;ve read each line of &quot;The Law of One,&quot; as well as every available channeling session on LLResearch.org.  Ra never proclaimed that the left / right hand paths are the same evil deceptions, and he / it never said &quot;We are Legion, for we are many.&quot;  Those were <em>my</em> interjections.  Ra / Q&#39;uo will never say these truths because they aren&#39;t part of the plan of deception to do so.</p>

<p>But the rest of it?  Repeating 3rd density, Oneness / Christ consciousness, space/time and time/space?  Yeah, those are pretty much the core of his/its lying dogma regarding the harvest of souls, the soul&#39;s progression through densities, and both evil and good will ultimately end up at the same place because &quot;it&#39;s impossible to be self-oriented after the 5th density, so the soul flips to others&#39;-oriented.&quot;  It&#39;s all, <em>all</em>, a load of nonsense that you&#39;ve bought into because it <em>makes you feel good.</em>  What&#39;s better than knowing your sin really has no impact in the end?  That when Jesus says, &quot;I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and no man enters into the Father&#39;s presence but by Me,&quot; you don&#39;t have to accept such exclusivity because we all end up at the same place?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware of how one of your gurus, Don Elkins, blew his head off after pretty much going insane.  How is that possible??  Wasn&#39;t he enlightened?  Didn&#39;t he have the peace of Ra&#39;s teachings?  The Adonai of every salutation?  Another one, Carla, died a very painful death after a long, drawn-out battle with cancer.  How was she not healed?  What was it about her that her spirit saw fit to die in such a manner?  Because -- after all, according to Ra -- we all choose our time and method of death.  I don&#39;t mean to sound flippant about either death, and I sincerely feel sadness for their families -- but the truth of the matter is that there was, and <em>is</em>, nothing special about what Ra vomits out <em>other than the deception it sews</em>.  And in the case of Don, the demonic oppression over him was simply too much for his mind to bear.  I&#39;ve seen this kind of thing dozens of times.</p>

<p>You think you&#39;re awake -- you think you know the truth and have answers no one else has.  The sad thing is that you&#39;re even more deceived than those who knowingly commit savage acts like child sacrifice, ritual rape, and demonic summoning simply because they know what they&#39;re doing, and you have no idea.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read all of it, and know it pretty much inside and out.  And while there is some truth to it, the overall picture it pains is nothing less than a massive, cunning, sinister deception.  And if you don&#39;t eventually see your way out of it, you&#39;re not going to like what happens when you die.  It&#39;s not <em>anything</em> like what the lying Ra / Q&#39;uo has led you to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on.  It&#39;s an intricate, carefully-woven delusion that sucks people into the whole &quot;new age&quot; movement, and then lets them believe they&#39;re actually making some choice for righteousness when they reject obvious evil.  It&#39;s all about making Truth relative, and relegating the Source of all Truth to some menial position of &quot;good guy prophet.&quot;</p>

<p>When people reject God&#39;s standard for good and evil -- the rule by which all things are objectively measured -- they lose the <em>ability</em> to choose righteousness in comparison to a perfect, just, holy Creator.  Satan is sinister, evil, prideful, arrogant, and conquered.  But he&#39;s also very, very smart, and has had an eternity to figure out ways to trick humanity.</p>

<p>Ra / Q&#39;uo is malevolently working on the same side as Lucifer himself -- and more descriptively, working <em>for</em> Lucifer.  Just you watch how much indignation I get for saying these things... </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And just who is the god this world?  We all know the answer to that one.  But Ra claims the god of this world is the &quot;evil&quot; Yahweh, who wrestled control of it away from the more benevolent gods of the &quot;golden age.&quot;  And that this Yahweh is about to be defeated, resulting in a new &quot;golden age&quot; of man.  How does this not simply scream, &quot;DECEPTION!!!&quot;?  Well, because:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply put, those who reject the Gospel in favor of anything else will be granted exactly what they desire.  And in the last of the last days, God will strengthen the delusion in their minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d love to offer this information - but clearly, a handful of people here are already freaking out by the mere mention of the name. They make FALSE claims that this social memory is demonic, deceiving, self-proclaiming themselves as God - this could NOT be any further from the truth. Very sad that people would be this lost. One would have to read the material in full, and also have direct connections to the social memory complex to know there is just no truth in that. </p>

<p>I stumbled onto this board from another more enlightened board - that was a mistake. I thought this was posted on our forum - not I see it wasn&#39;t. What a mistake even bringing it up. People here clearly are not ready for such material. </p>

<p>I can promise you it is pure information, they are not some group posing as beings of light. They truly ARE beings of light who are 100% in SERVICE to source field and universe around us, not pretending to be &quot;GOD&quot;. Never. Not once. </p>

<p>Any way.. I will take my leave and never return to these boards. BIG mistake. Very dim sighted individuals around here and its too much darkness for me to handle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is from a biblical perspective.  I was heavy into the new age stuff, including Ra&#39;s Law of One, for a long time.  I believe there&#39;s enough truth to sound legitimate to those who aren&#39;t hooked.  In retrospect, as a born-again Christian and a strong understanding of Scripture -- neither of which was the case when I was into this stuff -- I see how the Bible actually addresses all of it in many different places.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. [</em><em>2 Thes. 2:9-12</em><em>]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed.
 [</em><em>John 3:20</em><em>]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will be.  And if the Lord had not cut short the days, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days.  And then if anyone says to you, &#39;Look, here is the Christ!&#39; or &#39;Look, there he is!&#39; do not believe it.  For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect.  But be on guard; I have told you all things beforehand. [</em><em>Mark 13:19-23</em><em>]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 15So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds. [</em><em>2 Cor. 11:14-15</em><em>]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Not everyone who says to me, &#39;Lord, Lord,&#39; will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.  On that day many will say to me, &#39;Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?&#39;  And then will I declare to them, &#39;I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.&#39; [</em><em>Matthew 7:21-23</em><em>]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A good quote from one of the articles I list below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody likes to admit that he has been conned. But your Bible warns that Satan wants to con you out of your most precious possession. Do you recognize Satan&#39;s greatest deceptions—and how you can avoid them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are loathe to admit they need a savior, that God actually judges, that hell actually exists, and that the exclusive claims of Jesus Himself might be true.  But they&#39;re even more unable to admit they&#39;ve been fooled into believing something that isn&#39;t true -- especially when they&#39;ve believed in something so large-scale as the whole Ra deception.</p>

<p>Ra claims to be a group of entities that originally lived on Venus millions of years ago, and they&#39;ve now moved &quot;up the octaves&quot; to the 6th density where there isn&#39;t really a concept of &quot;self,&quot; but it&#39;s a group-consciousness.  I can now relate this to the follow passage of scripture:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit.  He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain,  for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him.  Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones.  And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him.  And crying out with a loud voice, he said, &quot;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.&quot;  For he was saying to him, &quot;Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!&quot;  And Jesus asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot; He replied, <strong><em>&quot;My name is Legion, for we are many.&quot;</em></strong>  And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country.  Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him, saying, &quot;Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.&quot;  So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the sea. [<strong>Mark 5:2-13</strong>]*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you read, and actually understand, what the scriptures are saying about the schemes of satan, all of this Ra stuff actually makes sense for what it really is.  Channeling is incredibly dangerous, and is explicitly forbidden in scripture.  You&#39;re opening yourself up and giving some unknown entity permission to literally enter your mind and control your words and actions.  This is disastrous for so many obvious reasons that I won&#39;t bother to list them all here.  Suffice it to say that, given the fact that Satan himself was the most beautiful and glorious (Lucifer = Light Bearer) of God&#39;s creations, and that he masquerades as an angel of light, there&#39;s no <em>possible</em> way to know whether what you&#39;re connecting with is benevolent or malevolent.  And given Ra&#39;s teaching material, he / it is 100% pure evil, perpetuating a strong delusion in the same manner as all the other channeling cults that have ever existed.</p>

<p>By the by, in reading contemporary accounts, you&#39;ll discover that both Mormonism and Islam started in the exact same manner:</p>

<ol>
<li>Random guy channels a spirit he thinks is benevolent.</li>
<li>Starts a cult.</li>
<li>Cult develops into accepted religion.</li>
<li>Said religion becomes notoriously hard to break free from.</li>
<li>Said religion mentions but denies the deity and atoning sacrifice of Christ.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be open to all that you say, if I myself hadn&#39;t been contacted. </p>

<p>I must repeat this to you. </p>

<p>You do not know anything about me. You know I have studied the RA Material. You may, if you&#39;d like, say to yourself &quot;Well, I know everything there is to know about everything concerning this person because that&#39;s all I need to know regarding who they are at the soul level&quot;.. I&#39;m sorry, but you do not know the depth of my being, nor do I of you.</p>

<p>I have consciousness abilities most do not, and I always have. I do not have to defend that. That&#39;s a blessing. I do not have to sit here and try to &quot;PROVE&quot; that to you. That&#39;s a blessing. You can go along your way, believe whatever you want to believe. Because I have been contacted and know a few things about my incarnational history, I can rest in that. I can rest in many things. You see, those who know actually silence what they know. I can point to the way, but that&#39;s all. I refuse to try to teach any one anything. Because ultimately, you already believe you&#39;ve &quot;won&quot;. </p>

<p>You think you&#39;ve &quot;WON&quot;, and that&#39;s all you care about. </p>

<p>You aren&#39;t interested in discussion, conversation, or hearing another side to any story other than your own. You sing the praises of your own song, and learning from another human being isn&#39;t of interest to you. Well done. Your ego is doing brilliantly in this world. Beautifully done. You&#39;re a survivor, man. </p>

<p>Stop trying to &quot;win&quot; me over. I already told you I will not battle this out with you. I&#39;m not interested in helping you. You can throw out 1,000 examples of how you arrived to the thought system you have - it makes no difference in what I know. I haven&#39;t even shared what I know, for that matter. You see, I guard and preserve that part of myself.  </p>

<p>Nope, I don&#39;t believe that at all.  The only thing I know about you is what you yourself have shared.  And then I can derive a few things, like the fact that you are an honest, kind, generous person who has nothing but the best intentions at heart.  You don&#39;t choose to adhere to the things that entities like Ra say because you&#39;re evil -- quite the opposite.  That&#39;s the point of it -- to capture good-hearted people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have consciousness abilities most do not, and I always have. I do not have to defend that. That&#39;s a blessing. I do not have to sit here and try to &quot;PROVE&quot; that to you. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t need to prove anything to me, and I totally believe you when you say you possess spiritual gifts.  I simply take you at your word for that, and have no intention of denying the veracity of your claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because I have been contacted and know a few things about my incarnational history, I can rest in that. I can rest in many things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I, too, have seen things from my &quot;past lives,&quot; and it all felt very, very, real.  Just as real as anything I experience in the present -- and even more real in that there was a spiritual understanding present that wasn&#39;t there when I was &quot;living&quot; those past events.  But, at least in my case, I now know that they were very elaborate, very convincing false experiences.  I understand now how much of a role I played in falling into and believe the lie that the enemy wanted me to believe.</p>

<p>Additionally, I&#39;ve traveled through time and space through astral projection, I&#39;ve moved my consciousness outside my body and been able to experience physical events -- real-time -- happening apart from where I physically was, I&#39;ve interacted with non-physical beings in physical ways, I&#39;ve communicated with those beings in that impossible-to-describe way where pure thought without any language is exchanged, I&#39;ve had accurate visions of the future, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Not every spiritual ability is a deception.  Most are, as you say, a blessing.  God made us as spiritual beings in a physical world.  I would go so far as to argue that you&#39;re wrong when you say that most people don&#39;t have them -- every person does, but not every person develops them.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m now much more careful about how I use my ability, when I use them, under what circumstances, and -- above all -- I only ever use them as guided by the Spirit of the Lord.  Otherwise, I&#39;m no different than what the underground calls a &quot;sorcerer,&quot; in the actual sense of the word.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think you&#39;ve &quot;WON&quot;, and that&#39;s all you care about.  You aren&#39;t interested in discussion, conversation, or hearing another side to any story other than your own. You sing the praises of your own song, and learning from another human being isn&#39;t of interest to you. Well done. Your ego is doing brilliantly in this world. Beautifully done. You&#39;re a survivor, man. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now how is it that you can falsely accuse me of assuming to know everything about you, yet turn around and claim to know what&#39;s in my own heart?  Is it simple cognitive dissonance that allows you to accuse someone of a crime, and then commit that very same crime against them?</p>

<p>You honestly have me all wrong.  I love discussions, I love conversations, and I crave the ability to speak about spiritual things.  I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve &quot;won&quot; anything, nor am I interested in &quot;winning.&quot;  You and I both know that &quot;winning&quot; a spiritual argument is completely counter-productive, and actually counts as a loss.</p>

<p>I strongly urge you to consider <em>why</em> your defenses have been so strongly raised by my simple challenges to your beliefs.  As a human being, I have a right to challenge your beliefs, and you have a right to challenge mine.  But I don&#39;t have the right to treat you with anything other than the respect due to someone made in the image of God, and nor do you.  Nowhere in any of my replies have I disrespected you or your person.  I <em>have</em> called out your <em>beliefs</em> for what I believe them to be -- an unfortunate, strong, evil deception.</p>

<p>But as for you?  Like I said, you&#39;re doing what you believe to be the right thing, and only want to do what is actually right, good, and just.  Nothing I&#39;ve said to you attacks you as a person, but I do -- and will -- continue to attack the belief that Ra / Q&#39;uo is benevolent, good, and true.  If you refuse to offer the same courtesy to me, that&#39;s fine -- but don&#39;t be a hypocrite while doing so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop trying to &quot;win&quot; me over. I already told you I will not battle this out with you. I&#39;m not interested in helping you. You can throw out 1,000 examples of how you arrived to the thought system you have - it makes no difference in what I know. I haven&#39;t even shared what I know, for that matter. You see, I guard and preserve that part of myself. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I care not for &quot;winning.&quot;  There is no winning when there&#39;s an argument about this kind of thing.  I don&#39;t have any interest in doing battle, and I don&#39;t care to share my full testimony nor to hear yours.  You can guard and protect yourself all you wish, but the truth will <em>always</em> hurt you when you unwittingly stand in such strong opposition to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually WOULD care to hear your testimony.. But not if you&#39;re not interested in sharing experiences or hearing from another person who has equal consciousness abilities to you. Everything you described I have gone through most of my life, relating to consciousness gifts. People who think they&#39;re 100% sure about everything are not people one can have a conversation with. And, you don&#39;t seem very open to hearing from any one else about this. You appear to have made up your mind. As for you craving spiritual discussion - so do I. I rarely can find any one who is capable of digging very deeply into these topics. The fact you have read, in your words, &quot;every word&quot; of the RA material is intriguing. But I think you should remain open to the fact you could be wrong concerning your final conclusion about their social memory complex. Wrong about them being part of the Luciferian thought system. </p>

<p>You brought up Don killing himself, and Carla dying of cancer. Yes, I have some thoughts about that. But it&#39;s not as if I&#39;m going to get into a long winded intense discussion about all of this on a public platform. That&#39;s tacky and it&#39;s actually irresponsible on both of our parts. It only flairs the ego on both sides of the table.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hostility?  You mean <em>truth</em>?</p>

<p>Psychotic hatred?  How is anything I&#39;ve said interpreted as hate?  Unless you&#39;re of the mind that if I disagree with you, then I must hate you -- which couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.  I wouldn&#39;t bother posting anything, allowing you to end up in eternal damnation, if <em>love</em> wasn&#39;t involved.  I know you don&#39;t have the ability to see that at the moment, but you might one day.  And even if you never do, I know I at least tried, and that your soul isn&#39;t on my hands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most channeled information IS a mix of lies/deception. THIS ONE IS NOT.... There are many lying entities out there, but RA is not one of them. I will defend RA to the ends of the earth. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes Ra so special that his material is legitmate?  How is what he says any different than any other channeling cult in existence?  How could you possibly know, even if you&#39;ve personally channeled him a thousand times?  Lies feel <em>great</em> when that&#39;s their intent.  Do you trust your own feelings?  Have you been allowed to see some spiritual reality?  Because if so, remember you&#39;ve seen only exactly what he wants you to see, and your personal feelings count for nothing in terms of the eternal position of your soul.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have NO IDEA who I am. No clue at all. Don&#39;t even try guessing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I honestly could care less who you are.  The only thing I know about you is that you&#39;re lost in the false belief of demonic teachings, and that&#39;s really the only thing that matters to me.  You could be the President, the Pope, or the guy down the street -- you are no better and no worse than I am, and your status and affiliation has no bearing on God&#39;s view of you.  In His sight, you&#39;re just as sinful as I am.  But you don&#39;t have the knowledge of the Savior He sent to die for your sins, and that&#39;s the only difference between us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will defend RA to the ends of the earth.  I repeat. I will defend their social memory complex to the ends of the earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why?  Because you&#39;ve invested so much of yourself into it that it&#39;s the only worldview you can possible imagine?  Because you&#39;re incapable of admitting to yourself that you might have been deceived for years?  That the idea that you&#39;ve given everything of yourself to a lie is painful to imagine?  I get it -- I totally get that.  I&#39;ve been there, and upsetting your worldview is an absolutely terrible experience.  But would you risk <em>your eternity</em> for the sake of your own comfort?  Do you trust Ra / Q&#39;uo so much that you place not only your life, but your very soul in his hands?  Clearly, my words have hit a nerve -- you should consider that later on when you&#39;ve had time to clear your mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not reply to this message. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t get to have the last word and demand my silence.  It doesn&#39;t work that way.</p>

<p>One says we already are in the better Yuga, one says it&#39;s still shitty for 70 years, one says 50 but it&#39;s ok because we&#39;re already in the transition phase and the 50 year mark is just the ending point/true beginning of a new age so these next few years are gonna be the cool shit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t say this is incorrect, but this doesn’t go against the progression of the cycles themselves.  As I said elsewhere on here, the real changes won’t really take place for another few generations, so we won’t really feel them in our lifetimes likely.  Why is that?  Well, because these changes have to do with the cycles of the binary star system that we live in with Sirius A - i.e. The North Star.  The sun and Sirius A are in orbit around one another.  The relative proximities in their orbits around one another dictate the age/cycle/yuga we’re in.  They were previously at their aphelion points - i.e. the furthest away from one another in their orbits.  Because of this, each star and the planets around them were at their lowest points of collective energy.  That’s why things were/have been in such darkness in the entire solar system overall.  The stars are said to be past that aphelion point, however, and are now making their way back toward one another.</p>

<p>That some estimates say improvements will occur <em>now</em>, and others say 25, 50, or even 100 more years from now is really small potatoes compared to the stellar cycles we’re dealing with here.  Things <em>are</em> in fact improving, and the reason for that has to do with an increase in the collective energy of the solar system coming from the sun getting closer to its sister star.  Both star systems are beginning to share in their mutual electro-magneto-gravitic energies - very much like two magnets coming together:  The closer they get, the more powerful is their collective influence.</p>

<p>Same thing’s happening here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then behind all those, is that this idea was popularized very recently, by one dude who claimed that, back when the last age was ending, the Indian mystics had made a mystake in their calculations, leading them to believe that the cycle of the Yugas was 300,000 years (which apparently is still the consensus worldwide), whereas his better mystic math came out to 24,000 years, which just so happens to place us at &quot;coming out of shitty into pretty good times but still not like blow-your-mind-levels for another 2500 years&quot; Yuga.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Good point.  However, the fact of the matter is that we are already witnessing an increase in the overall abilities of many humans that have been born as of late.  If you pay attention, you will see that there simply are more humans that have more amazing talents at much younger ages now than before.  This is indicative of an increase in energetic signature overall, and it is not specific or unique to the human species alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just seems weird and all over the place..</p>

<p>I would not disagree with this, sir.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The creation and existence of the internet itself can be said to be a manifestation of that very increasing of our collective energies as well - an indication of this rise in energy we’ve been referring to here.  The internet and the increasing global connectivity and potentialization that it has made possible on a planetary scale can itself be said to be an indicative manifestation of this increasing energetic influence due to the shift from one yugic cycle to the next more evolved one.</p>

<p>In other words, the internet alone can be looked upon as being not so much the cause of the increasing abilities being witnessed globally as much as a further manifestation of the shift itself.  It is yet another result of the increasing abilities witnessed that have come from the yugic shift.  In other words, the internet and the increasing talents both are manifesting in tandem - one aiding and complementing the other - but neither are necessarily solely responsible for the other.</p>

<p>The internet alone isn’t responsible for the increasing intelligence and abilities themselves.  It - <em>along with</em> the increasing intelligence and abilities - is just a another manifestation of the changing age/cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every revolution has had this sort of thing. Once you remove the bad people, who will be viewed as one of the good people? If you are truly a moral realist, then you&#39;ll realize that once you remove the bad people perceivably in charge, the problem just doesn&#39;t go away. There are more bad people out there, perhaps even more powerful ones. So say you manage to round up ALL of the bad people, and murder them all in every city square in the world where bad people reside. Does that really make you and your ilk good? You wiped out all of the scum from the earth, and can now have a nice planet. That&#39;s one hell of a burden to bare. Nevermind the Salem Witch Trial-esque manipulatory blame game to have bad people frame/blame actual good people into being perceived as one of the bad ones. This is far from a cut and dry situation, and we are only talking about the logistics of the situation. Imagine the emotional strife and perhaps consciousness impact this would have on you and/or the world&#39;s population. From a logistical perspective, to carry it out successfully, in full, is an abject impossibility. The chance for infiltration by bad people into the good people camp is too high, let alone the threat of power lust polluting the minds of the good people who get to assume power, if a similar rule of law is followed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wheeeeeeeee! This is amazing.</p>

<p>I know this is related to ascension. Why else, are we all feeling such highs sometimes? I know the last few days I definitely was riding on high vibration.. And you know what? It felt AMAZING.. I also have been feeling all the vibration/tingling that every one speaks of. We&#39;re ascending every one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this incredible enlightened post. Your citations/links are very much appreciated. I feel very lucky and blessed to have you here educating me on the Schumann resonance. It means a lot to me.. Thank you.</p>

<p>I have been paying much attention to ascension, but havn&#39;t had any of this brought to my attention until the last few days. Your post was incredibly useful in proving to me this is actually happening. And it perfectly lines up with what I&quot;m going through/feeling. </p>

<p>For the last year, I have had waves of vibration come over my body.. So strong, that it almost paralyses my body. It feels like getting dunked in a hot tub, and your cells feel the sizzling, deep deep sizzling effect - and yet you don&#39;t feel the heat. It&#39;s remarkable. I am guessing this is a sensation many here have also felt?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are. Good observation. Anything you have to say only reflects your own sickening state of mind. As you attack others, you give away what a lost little boy you actually are on the inside. Get help before its too late. Quit running from the purity of heart within.

Okay lets start here: Who is it thats been running around spewing comments about mania? Is it me or you. Its you. What you are feeling and experiencing is mania. I called you out on that. And its cringy to read, for a person grounded with both feet on the ground. Its cringy A.F mate. Secondly: who are you to comment about me?? I have literally zero posts on here. Well some, but virtually zero. So you know nothing about me- other than the fact that I called you out on your mania. Yet, you go on to talk about how I dont trust myself. And that I am rotten and disgusting. Projecting much ?? I think you are the one who needs to look in the mirror. Not me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re lost. And I refuse to deal with your ignorance. Your hateful/hostile replies are poison. You have no idea of what you speak, and I seriously worry for the community as you are trying to scare them away from one of the most beautiful sources of information to reach this planet. RA is not demonic, but you clearly are. I pity you. Move away from me, and stay away. I am reporting this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The RA material can be downloaded for free (because Jim was never in on this for profit).. The material can also be purchased on Amazon or directly from LLResearch, but this is a serious organization. Not a bunch of occult psychos who are into channeling... RA came to them because a group of dedicated individuals could handle the vibration to create a narrow band contact into a realm much higher than your average channeled sources. This information is incredibly pure, as it comes form the sixth density. Much channeled information out there (That is a bit of dark/light) comes from fourth, and fifth. Sixth is a density that defies polarity and is incredibly pure. Pure love. Pure light. PURE information. UNTAINTED with all the lies of the ego, dualism, and all of that deception.. I can promise this.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like access to the RA material for free- just message me and I&#39;ll shoot you a link. Or you can purchase it from Amazon. There are five books. It will probably take a few months to finish the books. Once you&#39;re done with that education - you can continue to read wisdom from RA who is STILL enlightening the planet through Jim today. I know it sounds a little crazy... But again, I promise this is not your usual channeled material. This group does not self-proclaim themselves as God, and they are not ruled by EGO, nor do they teach others to live by ego - and they aren&#39;t into being &quot;masters of manifestation&quot;. Manifestation lessons are actually where Deception lies. RA only speaks/teaches the science of vibration/light. ONLY that. And nothing else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are. Good observation. Anything you have to say only reflects your own sickening state of mind. As you attack others, you give away what a lost little boy you actually are on the inside. Get help before its too late. Quit running from the purity of heart within. You don&#39;t trust yourself, and so you look out at your world and believe every one is at rotten, disgusting, and nasty as you. Guess what, they aren&#39;t like you. And you aren&#39;t even like you, but you think you are. Quit running. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds about right enough.  This here, however, is very deep, very heavy information that A) is itself subject to changes here and there as things actually manifest and materialize, and B) most people still stuck in a mainstream mindset will very much not understand at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have made up your mind. </p>

<p>I keep telling you - what is there to discuss???</p>

<p>I&#39;m unsure why you keep trying? Why are you trying? While you rant away, and I do mean rant in its highest form; you are 100% convinced that you have it all figured out.</p>

<p>You win. That&#39;s what you want to hear, am I right? You want to know you won. You win. Doesn&#39;t that feel good now? </p>

<p>I have no interest in debating, or winning. I believe in collaboration, and I believe in conversation. Not battling it out on a public platform. You&#39;re in the game of humiliation, degradation, and condensation. I will not meet you there. Nor will I battle with you on this topic. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, you have not hit a nerve. But you are welcome to rest in that belief that you have. I&#39;m sure its a fun power trip. You are addicted to your ego - and that&#39;s about all I can see. It&#39;s blinding. So blinding that I will no longer be pulled into your tornado of insanity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, it depends upon the direction you&#39;re going.  If you move from the Kali, the cycle goes:</p>

<p>Kali, Dvapara, Tetra, Satya</p>

<p>If you move from the Satya, however, the cycle goes:</p>

<p>Satya, Tetra, Dvapara, Kali.</p>

<p>Given that we&#39;re moving from the Kali perspective, it&#39;s the Dvapara that&#39;s next.</p>

<p>I agree.  I&#39;m not perfect by far, and I can be a seriously raging asshole often enough, but as much as I can, I try to be kind and encouraging and peaceful in as many situations as possible.</p>

<p>Have a great day, dear.  :)</p>
