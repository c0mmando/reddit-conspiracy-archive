<p>(Insert various nonsense about Russia here)</p>

<p>(Insert common political slander here)</p>

<p>For the record, I&#39;ve never been a Trump supporter. In fact, I&#39;ve never been an anyone supporter. I have however been watching a very, very concentrated effort to usurp and undermine this new presidency. </p>

<p>That&#39;s coming from somewhere, and my gut is telling me that for some reason, he poses a threat to a lot of really powerful, really bad people, and they&#39;re the ones pushing the narrative against him.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s all keep a clear head here. Just because you&#39;re against Trump does not mean you can&#39;t take a step back and try to see what&#39;s really going on, and who&#39;s controlling the flow of information. The old saying goes &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot;, but that isn&#39;t true; sometimes, the enemy of your enemy, is also your enemy. </p>

<p>I&#39;d have to ask myself, who do I consider a bigger threat? A public figure in a position of power, or a non-public figure in a position of power?   </p>

<p>The answer to that is pretty easy. What can a person accomplish when they&#39;re being watched by the public, and what can they accomplish when they&#39;re not being watched by the public? </p>

<p>And to the accounts I see posting headlines like the one I posted, yet doing so without jest, you&#39;re one of two people: the kind who&#39;s gotten emotional and hasn&#39;t let themselves step back and look at things outside of partisan politics, or, you&#39;re part of the effort to usurp and undermine. And if you&#39;re the latter reading this, that&#39;s going to work on some of us, but it isn&#39;t going to work on enough of us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the record, I&#39;ve never been a Trump supporter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been several posts submitted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> recently, exactly like yours from people claiming to be &quot;a disillusioned Trump supporter&quot;. It is fairly evident these posts are made by people who have always opposed Trump, and they are trying to add &quot;legitimacy&quot; to their posts by claiming otherwise. Most people on this sub are tired of this dishonest, agenda-driven bullshit.</p>

<p>In future, erstwhile Trump supporters who claim a damascene conversion has led them to see the error of their ways, will need to provide some actual evidence that they supported Trump.</p>

<p>This sub attracts Trump supporters because they love conspiracy and taking down the deep state. </p>

<p>They&#39;re certain Trump is an outsider, so the deep state is conspiring to take him down. And they don&#39;t like it. So they come here. It&#39;s pretty straightforward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. I only found this sub when there were so few places to actually find information regarding HRC&#39;s crimes, conspiracies, and investigations (FBI investigation, leaks, etc), and <em>anyone</em> anywhere talking about it, or allowed to talk about it. The Donald, r/HillaryForPrison, and r/conspiracy were the only places, on all of reddit spreading the truth and not suppressing it. Now I can&#39;t get enough of this place, regardless of politics.</p>

<p>Most people here, and many of us Trump voters (including the_Donald frequenters) understand who is really the threat: the people behind the curtain, who hate Trump and the American people alike, who own the media, The Deep State, etc. </p>

<p>Sorry, but that&#39;s total bullshit.  Should I remind you that there are 320 MILLION americans?  Of course I don&#39;t know the names of the EXPERTS that <em>should</em> head these things, (if we lived in a society that made sense that is), because I am not an expert in those fields.  Stop apologizing for such things.  The fact that Ben Carson and Rick Perry were given any position at all is laughable bullshit when there are people who have worked their entire lives in those fields.  </p>

<p>No biggy though, right?  &quot;Well, heck of a job Brownie!&quot;  it certainly wasn&#39;t a problem when Katrina hit, that the head of Emergency Management the Bush (Dubya) appointed had led the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Brown"><strong>International Arabian Horse Association</strong></a>.  Yeah, he put a HORSE EXPERT in charge of emergency management, and that is why Katrina was such a colossal failure on every level, and many more people, you know, died, americans, than needed to.  So yeah, these things are important unless your view of the world is one of a child in charge of a dollhouse.</p>

<p>I am on board with criticizing the US&#39;s war mongering. Criticize who we attack, and for what reasons. We&#39;re clearly way too militant as a nation. But just &quot;using drones&quot; isn&#39;t a problem in my book. </p>

<p>Think of it this way.....you&#39;re locked in your room for more than 60 years and you&#39;re supposed to make a living. How could you? </p>

<p>That&#39;s what&#39;s happened to N. Korea since the Armistice. Embargoed. Sanctioned. Cut off from the world game of commerce and trade. </p>

<p>Fortunately, in this go around, China has stepped up and said the only real resolution to the N. Korea issue is discussion and talks. In other words, China said don&#39;t attack N. Korea, talk to them. That&#39;s what Trump is supposed to be about, rather than pushing forward with the Zionist PNAC agenda of conquering the world for Israel. It&#39;s more than bad enough Trump is fighting on the side of ISIS in Syria....and allowing Israel to bomb Syrian and pro Syrian forces. What kind of a Jew is he?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might be onto something with that.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s a lot of us waking up very quickly these days. </p>

<p>Now, I personally am all for a unified world. Just not under a hierarchical structure. There can&#39;t be a top or bottom any more. As a species, we need to begin to work together, of our own individual accord. As it stands, we&#39;re not unified, and we&#39;re not working with one another. We do what we&#39;re told is &quot;right&quot; under the threat of punishment. Odd thing is, the people who tell us what is &quot;right&quot;, and stand to punish us, often don&#39;t have to adhere to the same rules, so that system clearly isn&#39;t going to get us anywhere beyond where we already are. </p>

<p>So what will it take for us to determine for ourselves what is &quot;right&quot;, and hold ourselves accountable to make that a reality? How are we going to free ourselves from hierarchy and unify as a species?</p>

<p>My best guess is, it&#39;s going to take a lot, a lot of individual, personal, introspection and development. I need to fully understand why I treat people poorly, or badly, I need to understand why I get angry, or controlling, and I need to grow past that towards being a loving, selfless individual who will see everyone around him as an equal, and a part of himself.</p>

<p>Because when I learn how to do that, I&#39;ll be able to help the people around me do the same thing. And maybe in a few hundred years, or even a thousand, the idea that we need threats of violence to keep us in line will be as ridiculous as it was to sacrifice people to the sun god for a good harvest of corn. </p>

<p>We humans have a lot of potential. </p>

<p>Where did I say that&#39;s a bad thing?  The fact that you accused the OP of making &quot;blatantly false statements&quot; and said people were tired of &quot;this dishonest, agenda-driven bullshit&quot; because you didn&#39;t understand his post is what is actually troubling.</p>

<p>That removing posts at the mere mention of somebody being &quot;anti-Trump&quot; without reading the entire post is incredibly odd?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for the other poster but it is absolutely suspicious that a thread where a user states they&#39;re anti-Trump draws heat from the mods to the point where they&#39;ll delete the post. </p>

<p>Of course, we all know if this thread was anti-Hilary you would have never reacted that way. Very suspicious. </p>

The ultra rich, billionaire class fighting amongst themselves to get a better place at the trough. Hillary is a criminal, Trump is a fraudster and a criminal. The political and economic system is rigged against ordinary people. The only choice we get is which exploitative, lying, freeloader we trust less than the other.</p>

And, until he actually does something anti establishment, I&#39;m just going to assume he&#39;s one of them. I mean, if Trump really was going to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; they would never let him become president. They would just cheat like they did to Bernie Sanders</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got ripped for voting for him and saying let&#39;s just wait and see how it unfolds. Everyone on here must be the first to predict and claim they were right all along etc. </p>

<p>Watching it unfold it&#39;s clear that he&#39;s authorized by the system to be there. He did some good things but none of them are permanent or institutionalized. He is supporting the Ryan healthcare plan which is really bad and he fired Flynn, the main guy who was promoting the pedo crackdown. </p>

<p>I think most of the commotion is meant to lead us to think the system is against him and he is John Wayne. </p>

<p>They always like to give us a John Wayne hero to worship from time to time. I think he will do a lot of good things but also a lot of bad things, meanwhile, the agenda marches on no matter who is in office. </p>
