        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In listening to the <a href="http://swordandscale.com/sword-and-scale-episode-5/">Sword and Scale</a> episode about Johnny Gosch, I couldn&#39;t help but think that the events surrounding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations">Franklin child prostitution ring</a> in the 1980s, young school children and teens in &quot;middle America&quot; being pimped out to important figures, sounds an awful lot like the plot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7d0Lm_31BE">Twin Peaks</a> (1990). Drug running, child sex trafficking, the occult and occult imagery, upstanding citizens and prominent public figures not being who they really appear to be, and a dark, seedy underbelly hidden beneath our everyday world, are themes of both Twin Peaks and the Franklin child prostitution incident. I&#39;m not sure if David Lynch took inspiration from the story. Is anyone aware of anyone looking at the similarities between the two, or at Lynch&#39;s use of occult imagery or interest in the occult?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for bringing this up, I&#39;m going to check out your links. I have always loved Twin Peaks and Lynch&#39;s movies. </p>

<p>Keep in mind Lynch&#39;s daughter says it&#39;s not true and that a lot of the old actors from the original series were brought back for the new series that comes out in a couple months and this particular actor was not invited to be in the new series so he may be bitter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did some looking and according to Anderson he couldn&#39;t get the money he wanted so negotiations failed. He didn&#39;t seem to have negative things to say about Lynch before that.</p>

<p>He has made a lot of posts on Facebook about how the &quot;Jewish mob&quot; ruined his career and how he gets sexually harassed a lot by gay men cause of his stature. He&#39;s made posts like that for years apparently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  I recall reading a bunch about him when Carnivale was on and he seemed like a very intelligent and rather down to earth person.  I don&#39;t recall him in much of anything after that, so I can guess that lack of work can make a person bitter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lynch plays with a lot of these occult themes in his works. He&#39;s also a big proponent of the Transcendental Meditation cult in Hollywood.</p>

<p>Michael Anderson recently accused Lynch of drawing inspiration for the show&#39;s plot from his own personal life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I THOUGHT THE SAME THING!!! It happened when I realized that one of the most used songs in the Franklin coverup doc from discovery Channel in 1990 is then used as a staple song in Twin Peaks. Lynch must have seen it and been referencing it. I can&#39;t imagine another reason for them sharing a soundtrack and subject matter. He wants people to know of the occult aspect to all of this high up human trafficking shit. I&#39;m pretty sure u can even here the song in some of the sword and scale slips.
Thanks for bringing it up OP!</p>
