        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi all.  First, let me say that I&#39;m &quot;awake&quot; to lots of things.  Been awake for about 1 to 2 years. And &quot;fully awake&quot; for a few months.</p>

<p>I&#39;m older and don&#39;t hide my IP address when searching and reading things either.  So I know they know everything I do.  But, I&#39;m just awake. I don&#39;t do anything about it, except chat with you all. Meaning, I don&#39;t make blogs or youtube videos to spread the word, etc.  I&#39;m just a reader and a chatter.</p>

<p>Yesterday I got an automated call from Comcast (I have my landline phone, t.v. cable and internet through them). The call was calling to confirm my service appointment for today.</p>

<p>Well, I hadn&#39;t called for service. So I stayed on the line, talked with a real person and canceled it. I told her I never requested service. She actually confirmed that she didn&#39;t see where I requested service, but that it had been scheduled. Well, I told her to cancel.</p>

<p>Today, I get a call from the Comcast technician that he is &quot;on his way&quot;. I told him not to come. I told him it was a mistake and that I told them yesterday.</p>

<p>After we hung up, 5 minutes later a woman from Comcast calls me. I told her the same thing.  At this point, I was getting a little aggravated.  She said I had been scheduled to get a new box (I&#39;m assuming she meant router or maybe cable t.v. box).  Well, I told her no, I didn&#39;t want anything new because everything was working fine.  I told her I never ordered anything new.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m wondering about all this. Am I being too paranoid?</p>

<p>Please be honest with me. You will not hurt my feelings.  :-)</p>

<p>Personally, I would find their persistence to give me a service that I never requested and they have no record of a request and have repeatedly cancelled/denied wanting to be involved in abnormally aggressive, and therefore suspicious.</p>

<p>Obviously though, it could be nothing.  But if the situation has unfolded the way you&#39;ve stated, I find it perfectly rationale to have alarms going off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! It happened exactly as I said. And yes, they seemed abnormally persistent.</p>

<p>I can understand the technician guy not getting the cancel notice from yesterday. I was okay with all that (when he called and said he was on his way). But when, 5 minutes later, a woman from Comcast called, that is what bothered me and made me suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A VPN is a program that &quot;encrypts&quot; the data you send over the internet. Basically it hides what you send over the internet. Think of it like sending coded messages, so that only the sender and receiver know what was said, but nobody else knows what it was.</p>

<p>PrivateInternetAccess is a company that sells a VPN for 6.95 a month. TorGuard is another company that does this, but for 9.99 a month. These two companies don&#39;t store any information about what you do, but some other companies do. Some even sell the data. <a href="https://thatoneprivacysite.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/vpn-comic-welcome-compressed.jpg">This comic is a good representation of it.</a></p>

<p>Basically you would download their VPN program, login with your account, and then connect to the VPN by right clicking on their red icon and selecting the location nearest to you on the bottom right of your screen. If you need help setting it up you can probably ask their support.</p>

<p>TorGuard: <a href="https://torguard.net/">https://torguard.net/</a></p>

<p>PIA: <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/</a></p>

<p>While I don&#39;t use it all the time, it sounds like you would want to. If you end up getting private internet access, <a href="http://prntscr.com/en7quk">make sure to tick/select all the check boxes inside the box I marked in red.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t know what to say specifically.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had similar problems using Bell. I paid my bill in cash. I had to go to three different locations before I could and then they gave e a hard time. </p>

<p>They cut off my service a few days later. I called and they said I hadn&#39;t paid, so I read off the receipt and they reinstated it. A couple hours later, they cut it off again. Same. Called, read off receipt. </p>

<p>They then charged me for overdue fees and reinstating my service twice. Over $100. I said fuck this, too much hassle. </p>

<p>Never paid. When I called, they said they had no service notice to reconnect and each is 45 plus tax.</p>

<p>Basically, any service &quot;mistake&quot; they can charge you for, they will. </p>

<p>The issue that is similar to yours is the inability for the service person to make adjustments to the system. Somehow, a person can put &quot;paid&quot;, but the system can overturn it several times.</p>

<p>Similar that a person can cancel the service call, but the system doesn&#39;t care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be some kind of glitch...the normal kind...not the matrix kind.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, they seemed quite eager to get inside your home.  Like you said, they mailed you new equipment six months ago.  Saved having to pay someone to come out and install it.  Why would they want to spring for the money now?  Definitely odd.  </p>

<p>Then again, we all might be feeling a little paranoid after Vault 7.  I threw caution to the wind and got a gmail account the other night so I could subscribe to some YouTube channels and when Google (gmail) called to verify my phone and give me a code the area code from their call was 202.  ACK!  Wouldn&#39;t you know it Google has offices in Washington D.C..  So convenient for them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, after Vault 7 I realize everything I do is being watched. Well, let&#39;s be honest, we always suspected this was true. But with Vault 7, we now have proof it is true.</p>

<p>Yes, they did seem very persistent to get into my home - which was odd.</p>

<p>Like I said, 6 months ago they mailed me a new router/modem with instructions how to hook it up, and instructions to mail the old one back to them. I actually called them before I did it all (just to make sure it was legit). And I figured it was, because my old router/modem was really old and having problems.</p>

<p>Like you said, they mailed it and that saved them lots of money (no technicians going to homes).</p>

<p>Of course, my incident the other day could be nothing. Could just be a mix up. Then again....makes you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! It happened exactly as I said. And yes, they seemed abnormally persistent.</p>

<p>I can understand the technician guy not getting the cancel notice from yesterday. I was okay with all that (when he called and said he was on his way). But when, 5 minutes later, a woman from Comcast called, that is what bothered me and made me suspicious.</p>

<p>Glad to know you see this too.</p>
