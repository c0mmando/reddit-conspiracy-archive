       Hi all.  First, let me say that I'm "awake" to lots of things.  Been awake for about 1 to 2 years. And "fully awake" for a few months.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm older and don't hide my IP address when searching and reading things either.  So I know they know everything I do.  But, I'm just awake. I don't do anything about it, except chat with you all. Meaning, I don't make blogs or youtube videos to spread the word, etc.  I'm just a reader and a chatter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday I got an automated call from Comcast (I have my landline phone, t.v. cable and internet through them). The call was calling to confirm my service appointment for today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I hadn't called for service. So I stayed on the line, talked with a real person and canceled it. I told her I never requested service. She actually confirmed that she didn't see where I requested service, but that it had been scheduled. Well, I told her to cancel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, I get a call from the Comcast technician that he is "on his way". I told him not to come. I told him it was a mistake and that I told them yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       After we hung up, 5 minutes later a woman from Comcast calls me. I told her the same thing.  At this point, I was getting a little aggravated.  She said I had been scheduled to get a new box (I'm assuming she meant router or maybe cable t.v. box).  Well, I told her no, I didn't want anything new because everything was working fine.  I told her I never ordered anything new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm wondering about all this. Am I being too paranoid?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please be honest with me. You will not hurt my feelings.  :-)

       Fair enough. Good for you being awake. I've tried having conversations with my grandparents about the world at large and they are very closed minded. They consume Fox News like its going out of style.

       I thank God for the internet every day!  Because of the internet, I "woke up" and realized we are constantly being lied to.  When you find this out later in life, it really angers you!

       My husband is 50% woken up. He doesn't want to be fully awake.  I can't understand people like that! I want to be "more awake"!  :-)

       Personally, I would find their persistence to give me a service that I never requested and they have no record of a request and have repeatedly cancelled/denied wanting to be involved in abnormally aggressive, and therefore suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously though, it could be nothing.  But if the situation has unfolded the way you've stated, I find it perfectly rationale to have alarms going off.

       Yes! It happened exactly as I said. And yes, they seemed abnormally persistent.

       I can understand the technician guy not getting the cancel notice from yesterday. I was okay with all that (when he called and said he was on his way). But when, 5 minutes later, a woman from Comcast called, that is what bothered me and made me suspicious.

       Okay, I still use aol email. So that means I have no clue what you mean.  I'm sure I need to do this, but you will have to be more specific with me.  Talk to me like I'm less than 5 years old (because I think even a 5 year old probably knows more about technology/computers than I do)! LOL!

       A VPN is a program that "encrypts" the data you send over the internet. Basically it hides what you send over the internet. Think of it like sending coded messages, so that only the sender and receiver know what was said, but nobody else knows what it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       PrivateInternetAccess is a company that sells a VPN for 6.95 a month. TorGuard is another company that does this, but for 9.99 a month. These two companies don't store any information about what you do, but some other companies do. Some even sell the data.
       <a href="https://thatoneprivacysite.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/vpn-comic-welcome-compressed.jpg">
        This comic is a good representation of it.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically you would download their VPN program, login with your account, and then connect to the VPN by right clicking on their red icon and selecting the location nearest to you on the bottom right of your screen. If you need help setting it up you can probably ask their support.
      </p>
      <p>
       TorGuard:

      <p>
       While I don't use it all the time, it sounds like you would want to. If you end up getting private internet access,

       Thank you so much! Also, thank you for not making fun of me for not knowing all this! I really appreciate it!

       I don't send anything (like emails) that I need hidden. Like I said, I just research and read (about stuff we aren't supposed to know, obviously).  :-)
      </p>
      <p>
       So to me, I'm a low threat to them. I'm awake, but I really don't do anything about it (meaning, I'm not on youtube spreading the word with videos, etc.).

       This is probably nothing, I've had similar experiences with TWC in the past where they did something similar because they claimed I had a bad cable box that they could detect on their end and had scheduled a tech to come out and replace it.  Guy came out, gave me a new box. Possibly could be the same situation on your end as well. I doubt there's anything nefarious going on here so no worries.

       Don't know what to say specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had similar problems using Bell. I paid my bill in cash. I had to go to three different locations before I could and then they gave e a hard time.
      </p>
      <p>
       They cut off my service a few days later. I called and they said I hadn't paid, so I read off the receipt and they reinstated it. A couple hours later, they cut it off again. Same. Called, read off receipt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They then charged me for overdue fees and reinstating my service twice. Over $100. I said fuck this, too much hassle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never paid. When I called, they said they had no service notice to reconnect and each is 45 plus tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, any service "mistake" they can charge you for, they will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if I was targeted because I paid cash, or if you were for posting here.

       It since become legally required in Canada. And is legally required in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue that is similar to yours is the inability for the service person to make adjustments to the system. Somehow, a person can put "paid", but the system can overturn it several times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar that a person can cancel the service call, but the system doesn't care.

       Do you have a very common name? It could just be that a person with a similar name called to make a service call, but even then they usually ask for the account number.

       They did send me a new modem/router 6 months ago. They mailed it to me (with a letter of explanation). I hooked it up and mailed my old one back to them.  So it couldn't be that, since I just got a new one 6 months ago.  (That was before I fully "woke up" too.)

       I don't suppose you could get the model number off your router? This is all highly suspicious.

       Could be some kind of glitch...the normal kind...not the matrix kind.

       On the other hand, they seemed quite eager to get inside your home.  Like you said, they mailed you new equipment six months ago.  Saved having to pay someone to come out and install it.  Why would they want to spring for the money now?  Definitely odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, we all might be feeling a little paranoid after Vault 7.  I threw caution to the wind and got a gmail account the other night so I could subscribe to some YouTube channels and when Google (gmail) called to verify my phone and give me a code the area code from their call was 202.  ACK!  Wouldn't you know it Google has offices in Washington D.C..  So convenient for them!

       Yes, after Vault 7 I realize everything I do is being watched. Well, let's be honest, we always suspected this was true. But with Vault 7, we now have proof it is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, they did seem very persistent to get into my home - which was odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, 6 months ago they mailed me a new router/modem with instructions how to hook it up, and instructions to mail the old one back to them. I actually called them before I did it all (just to make sure it was legit). And I figured it was, because my old router/modem was really old and having problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you said, they mailed it and that saved them lots of money (no technicians going to homes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, my incident the other day could be nothing. Could just be a mix up. Then again....makes you think.

       Just listened to landline messages from last week - A caller from Spectrum(new entity name for time warner here) asked for me by name, asking when he could come by to change out my cable box - I don't have cable &amp; don't use spectrum -

       maybe it was just a cleverly disguised sales call, but i thought of your post.

       Yes! It happened exactly as I said. And yes, they seemed abnormally persistent.

       I can understand the technician guy not getting the cancel notice from yesterday. I was okay with all that (when he called and said he was on his way). But when, 5 minutes later, a woman from Comcast called, that is what bothered me and made me suspicious.
