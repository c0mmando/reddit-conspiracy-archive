      <p>
       We have recently seen the media deepthroating and propping up former presidents (Bush and Bush senior) with the super bowl and several television appearances, their libraries and awards and honors...
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to understand, they do this to some degree with ALL the former presidents after they retire. It is important to maintain the image of the US President as a courageous, and patriotic "Everyman", and with all the recent stuff going on (leaks,
       <strong>
        pizzagate
       </strong>
       , 9/11 truth picking up steam), George W is in some DEEP shit, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If he goes down, or if any individual president is subject to criminal trials, the whole system goes down! The president is the elites squeaky clean "front man". If Bush were subjected to a federal investigation or Trial, it would really speed up the awakening process. Imagine if people found out their government did 9/11? Or that there was even a NEW investigation into it? Red pill city...
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       He's wanted for war crimes in several countries. They are just going on the offensive here, trying to beat us to the punch, prop up this guys image before the Pizzagate or 9/11 stuff starts to really become a mainstream accepted belief. They need to instill a trust and allegiance to George W within the American Public, so that nobody questions his character and they will be able to blow off the accusations as "hog wash" or "conspiracy".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "George w bush? Yea I just saw him on Ellen! I love his paintings. Now I'll admit, I never really agreed with the guys presidential policies, and he was a very radical president. But I respect him as a person, and he has a great sense of humor. I REALLY doubt that he is involved in the plotting of 9/11 sweetheart...and DEFINITELY not a child abusers ring"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what they want from us ^ And some people really DO think bush is like the cool grandpa or some shit...They WANT to desperately believe that. In reality, the guy is likely a sexual sadist, former drunk, and just an all around war criminal who just so happens to also be a socially awkward and disgusting person...
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the whole point. And they're gonna do it with EVERYONE; Biden (the memes), Trump, Clinton, you name it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect they are more worried about Pizzagate and 9/11 truth breaking. Their plugs won't hold water for much longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, THATS why you're seeing presidents and politicians being frantically painted in a positive light by the media recently. fuck these clowns, keep exposing them.

       This is funny because the other day mother in law, who is a housewife wife to the max. Called us and began talking about how Bush was painting and how it helps him meditate, and how she's going to try it now that she saw it helped him. It was insane the way they can just put ideas in our heads. 
I didn't say anything to her but all her kids are Woke AF, now. They see what the media does.

       Also, whitewashing them is so damn easy now, with MSM's characterization of Trump. He's a mob-connected scammer, for sure, and anyone that didn't knew that was asleep the past 30 years. But right now media has pinned him as the antichrist at best, and a pee drinker at worst, and his family has the gall to order cuts so old folk will starve as they eat lobster... And the short memory and plain ignorance of the re-twiteering public does the rest, since it's the first time in 'merican history that scamming kleptocrats have stiffed us all.

       Compared to the orange bucket of shit, of course grampa Bush or Barack O'Drone look good. As long as you swallow the glop vomited by media.

       All these presidents have had us bickering and fighting each other.  Because as long as we're fighting each other we're not paying attention to the global corporations using our collective resources to maintain dominance.  It's pretty hilarious to see the Trumpbots try to pretend he's somehow different just because he says so.

       Agreed. The reason I think trump is so important in particular is because he is a symbol of racial divide and hate in the country. And entire political party views him And his supporters as evil people. Honestly, the stage has been set for the two sides to clash. The tension is building between the classes. They're engineering is to fight each OTHER, and not the people who are really in control.

       I agree somewhat, but I don't think their goal is an actual widespread violent fight.  I don't see how that is useful to them.  Population control maybe, but there are more controllable ways to achieve that goal.  I think if there was anything close to a civil war it would be quickly quelled  by the media first and by martial law second.

       It's not a fight they want buddy, they just need to divide us so we cannot band together and overthrow them. We are weak divided, they know how powerful and unstoppable we are if we become well organized. So they play us off against one another with trivial issues (race, gender, sex, ect.) classic divide and conquer.

       Oliver Stone's Untold History of the United States really makes LBJ look like a dick swinging troglodyte. I think pretty much the only positive impression I had was that he at least seemed to understand the ramifications of nuclear warfare and opposed his Chiefs of Staff constantly wanting to nuke everything, but even then he came off as much more of a warmonger than I'd previously thought. Just coming out of school all you'd think about when it came to him was his Great Society and all that...

       Bush. Saw a Wikileaks post about it. Unfortunately can't find it again though.  But basically Bush fired people who could expose and used pedo stuff to control people who would expose 9/11. Two conspiracy birds with one stone.

       The post was removed because of the misleading title I believe. It wasn't anything exposed by anyone, a left wing conspiracy journalist sent a random person at stratfor his article about how bush was covering up a pedo ring(it didnt even say who the recipient was, and there wasn't a reply). So it was included in leaked wikileaks emails, but nothing about that made the story more true, and his article that was pasted in the email has existed in the public eye for 10 years.

       Maybe not eye opening stuff to you or me, but you have to take into consideration that there are tons of lurkers on this sub at all times. You'll notice I broke this down in a very rudimentary way for a reason. I want this message to appeal to people who have yet to delve deeply into the rabbit hole. It serves a purpose, and it's just generally good to get a sense or feel that were all on the same page sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And heck, sometimes it just feels good to write what you're thinking about. "

       This is the way I see things unfolding, does anybody else out there feel like this sometimes?",

       Great post.

       Also dovetailed into this bullshit is the American faux monarchy. Who the hell thinks the same family sequentially elected to the White House is at all any kind of a good idea? Why should Hillary even have been eligible to run for the presidency if she was essentially acting shadow secretary of state while her
       <em>
        husband
       </em>
       was the president? Likewise Michelle Obama. I'm seeing rumblings of a M. Obama- E. Warren 2020 ticket, and people are eating that shit up. Are you fucking kidding me? We had eight fucking years of the Clintons and another eight of the Obamas. Do not try to tell me that these wives had no political input into their husband's administrations. Another four to eight years of the same family? Chelsea? Malia? What is wrong with voters? Same thing with the Bushes - at one (albeit brief) point in the last electoral process, it was lining up to be a Bush v Clinton race
       <strong>
        again
       </strong>
       . What is this shit? Keeping all the shady business in the families to minimize exposure and maximize profit? Are Americans really this stupid?

       Dunbar's number deals with the number of people one can maintain stable social relationships with. I don't think memorizing certain aspects about celebrities is really the same thing.

       It's the same thing to your primitive monkey brain, unfortunately. People feel like they know these celebrities, because they are constantly getting glimpses into their lives across a span of years. I could go on and on about why this is so psychologically unhealthy... but I recommend doing your own research and drawing your own conclusions.

       That's actually a really interesting point. I feel that there's something 'off' about the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xxgRUyzgs0">
        cult of personality
       </a>
       that dominates our celebrity and political scene, and I'm wondering if there have been any decent studies done on mental health aspects (self-esteem/worth, confidence, empathy, etc.)  for individuals who are heavily into celebrity cultures.

       This is why I ignore celebrity gossip.  I want my "150 people" to be a practical menagerie of real people I care about and fictional characters salient to my writing.

       it's funny, but true - any time you give your trust to the rich and powerful, they will later monetize it or get more power from your trust.  that's how they got to be rich and powerful in the first place.

       If people start thinking this way, tptb will just provide people with a new puppet not necessarily from their favorite families. People will think he's a outsider, their savior. Trump got elected this way and guess what? Nothing changed. Whatever the family name, the same agenda continues.

       Be good if you could make memes of these assholes saying dumb shits they said or did then post them in the comments section of these posts. maybe just saying how you think they are a nice guy and you like their choice in tie then link your meme inconspicuously so it doesn't get instaremoved,  say someone is getting a bush or obama woody clicks it for a fap and gets reminded who they really were.

       The onset of Bush's return to "hey I could grab a drink with this guy" persona created by the MSM was so sudden and obvious in agenda (apart from his book).

       In 2008 then house speaker Nancy Pelosi called Bush

        "A total failure."

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Even though I disagreed with President Bush profoundly on the war in Iraq, and what cold be worse than that? We worked very much together on so many issues. We passed the biggest energy bill in the history of our country, a stimulus bill relating to refundable tax credits for poor people, a very progressive legislation. We did a number of things together, including the dreaded TARP, which his members abandoned him on."

       i have given up on popularity but for some reason it is still satisfying to get 5 upvotes and know i made a connection despite/in spite of the noise.

       one day the signal to noise may get too huge....i have long thought a site needs to be created like reddit but without any commercial interest, maybe thats 4chan idk.

       I think the adoption of the word "statism" could be one of the more important shifts out there. Terms like "liberal" have become derogatory even though very few that are labeled as such hold truly "liberal" views. Just as importantly, this behavior is not limited to a single group, even though it IS applied differently depending.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is random happenstance or "luck." The psychology behind these things is as basic and simple as it is powerful.

       Associate someone like Bush with "wholesome America," and those connections start to take shape
       <em>
        physically

       whether we like it or not. Using that technique, it can be used (and has recently) to induce what is essentially mass hysteria.

       I'm a republican and I'll admit we didn't send our best with Bush. BUT, connection him to PizzaGate and not mentioning the Clintons or Obamas in that same connection is just plain stupid. They are ALL a part of the behind-the-curtain shit that no one knows about. In fact, the Bush clans shady issues have more to do with oil, arms and shadow government leadership than the massive pedophile ring becoming apparent.

       This is what my friend tried telling me the other day. He shut up fast when I told him to look into Google trends of "Biden" as a search term, and general interest in Biden.

       Maybe in your circles, man, but back in October 2015 - for example - Biden's favorability among Democrats was at 85%. With adults in general it was 49%. Democrats had always viewed his favorably, but it had really begun to climb and a great many people wanted him to run for president.

       Just because you say it's so, doesn't make it so; Joe Biden has never been a reviled figure on the left, that's for certain. Nor to reddit in general. He was more popular than either Bernie Sanders or Clinton when the last election was just beginning. He certainly hasn't lost much favorability over the last while, either.

       Your statement that a year ago reddit in general thought of Biden as a creepy pervert is false. Only two demographics have consistently loathed Joe Biden: Republicans and (to a lesser degree) conservatives. The insinuation that America at large had their opinion of Biden changed from "creepy pervert" to goofy uncle via memewarfare is predicated upon the false notion that the bulk of people ever considered him anything like a creepy pervert. Despite right-wing memes to the contrary, that was always the definition of a fringe notion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Joe Biden memes have existed since at least his "this is a big fucking deal" comment, if not before then.

       It comes down to perspective. What I saw and read was most people thought he was a creepy dude perving on a little girl. You can quote percentages and statistics all you want, that doesn't mean what I saw and read didn't happen. The bidenbro sub came about and now people's thoughts of him, and how they perceive him, have changed. Exactly what op is talking about.

       There could be a lot of a reasons why many people found Biden likable or - perhaps - you've got cause and effect partially mixed up, because even before the surge he received from that he was still very popular among most demographics and not viewed too unfavorably by any save conservatives and Republicans. Either way, though, Biden's image has not been rehabilitated by r/bidenbros - the implications, no the blatant statements this OP has made that the majority of reddit found him creepy and pervy are total bullshit, pulled out of thin are, unsubstantiated, not backed up by the data, etc. More nonsense to create the narrative that right-wing thought is popular thought, that the right-wing is the silent majority, when they're no majority at all, etc.

       what they were actually doing was probably some quazi-religious fuckery in mesopotamia or some dumb shit? some irrelevant historical bullshit to do with the ottoman empire and really wanting to back to IRAQ for some reason? they have a lot of kings and princes and shit around that general zone and as a rule historical English corporations are some feudal cum colonial shit bestowed by a literal vatican bestowed monarchy. maybe the arc of the covenant is like a football or something dumb like that. maybe if you touch it you grow wings and the romnry family can fly around around like x-men who cares

       I'm surprised that this is still repeated.  The dossier originated from Christopher Steele and it's incredibly easy to find this information.  True or not, it did not originate on 4chan.

       Part of the reason, in my opinion, is that it's acceptable to give in to confirmation bias when consuming media.  People will read stories and sources that espouse ideals that they share.  The whole "dossier originated on 4chan" bullshit is the perfect example of this.  If you read or watch any news that attempts actual journalism, then this was widely reported.  The only places that I've seen the "dossier originated on 4 chan" story were alt-right sites.

       Great post. This is one of those cases where the exception proves the rule, the exception being Jimmy Carter. Does Carter get any love from the war obsessed neo-liberal establishment? They barely even acknowledge his existence.

       It's really strange to me how supposedly commercial channels like CNN and FOX and NBC have time for all the propaganda segments, although maybe at this point they just get more money directly from the pentagon than the could get from their shit reporting.  Actually, that's probably it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone needs to learn the word 'hagiography' and watch out for it.  It's basically the History channel's incessant WW2 coverage of Patton and Eisenhower, as if it happened yesterday.

       Anything that makes America look like a super great, idk, Big Brother, even if it is the weakest plotted bs in the world like American Sniper or Hurt Locker, or hammy 60 minute commercials for the Navy Seals, get 2 thumbs up, a pile of money, a bag of chips and an award.

       It's all one big club for rich and powerful cocksuckers and Donald Trump will gladly join them right after he's out of office. You think Clinton and Trump hate each other? It's all a facade. They'll all be in a room together, Bill will be getting blown by his young groupies and Trump will be getting blown by big tittied Russian imports while they all laugh about how they fooled us into thinking we had a choice.

       I think your analysis is overly complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occham's Razor demands a simpler explanation.  How about this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The media has a side, generally supports whoever is "more left."
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        They make a lot of big stink about scandal, etc, whenever the "wrong side" is in power.  But they don't mean it-- it's not ethics or morals or belief, it's purely tactics.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        After the "wrong side" is out of power, they don't need the tactics any more, and they're removed.  New tactics may demand treating the out-of-power guy like he was a saint.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The whole thing is purely marketing and advertising to reach a goal.  Ethics, morality, and belief don't even factor in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ten years ago, the "left goal" needed Bush to be Hitler.  Now they need Trump to be Hitler.  Previous guy is out of power so he no longer
       <em>
        needs
       </em>
       to be Hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since no morals, ethics, or belief are involved, the tactics can switch to a sort of pretend objectivity to make it look like all previous guys on the "other team" were decent fellows, and it's only this new guy who really alarms everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR; By painting Bush as a decent fellow now, they can fool a small (but significant, I guess?) minority of people into thinking they're not crying wolf over and over again.

       Why do we even need elected officials. We pretend to vote for the best candidates but deep down we all know these a-holes don't represent us. We pretend to e do our civic duty by voting but the state rep or us Rep or senator they represent whom even funds their next reelection campaign not little ol you and me. Why do even need a representative government?  I think with the technologies we have today, we should be able to vote directly for any proposals or bills. Just adding another reality spin to our reality show government.

       Good post. I'm sick of all the people who are supposedly supporting Trump like he's gonna be the one to break open the cabal and change things for the better. The amount of folk going give him a chance he might do something and before you know it another four years will have passed and we'll still all be slaves forced to work to make a few already rich people richer.

       I'm late to comment on this but I had to say that the recent comments on posts which were making observations about good old W made me want to barf.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a very noticeable pattern of this type of comment "Yeah, didn't really love him while he was in office but he seems like a cool guy to have a beer with...."
      </p>
      <p>
       If it had been once or maybe twice I wouldn't have noticed but I kept seeing it on at least a dozen or so different threads here on conspiracy.  Very suspect.

       Holy shit... I was out drinking yesterday, and Someone brought up George Bush, and I said "yea I don't agree with his politics, but I could have a beer with that guy" but like I hate George Bush, I always have, when did I suddenly change my mind? It's like I subconsciously bought into this man sentiment change... fucking weird.
