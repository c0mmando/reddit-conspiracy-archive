        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recent work by physicists including Dmitri Krioukov, reported in a journal Nature’s Scientific Reports. To quote: The “Universe may be growing in the same way as a giant brain — with the electrical firing between brain cells ‘mirrored’ by the shape of expanding galaxies.” Looking at simulations of galaxy interconnections in the early universe and neuron interconnections makes it virtually impossible to tell them apart.</p>

<p>And think about it, what are the 2 things we still don&#39;t know a lot about, yet we think about them the most? The Universe and the Mind. What if it&#39;s all the same? There are literally no arguments against this theory.</p>

<p>I know this may sound stupid, but once I was tripping on LSD I really started to think about stuff, and every thought and everything I imagined, looked at, thought of everything was branching into my mind. I saw everything coming into my mind like I was the universe, I am sorry if this doesn&#39;t make sense but it is really hard to explain. But it all made sense to me. So I started looking into this a lot more and found out so much similarities between our mind and the universe that it&#39;s actually creepy.</p>

<p>&quot;The mind is infinite, just like the universe.&quot;</p>

<p>There are so much similarities between our mind and the universe that they seem impossible to tell apart. So I ask you again, What if our mind is the universe?</p>

<p>“There is obviously only one alternative, namely the unification of minds or consciousness... In truth there is only one mind.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The belief in aging is not as absolute as it seems. Yes our blueprint involves aging, but the deterioration of the body as we age is very strongly held belief. It&#39;s almost held so tightly it&#39;s automatically assumed you get old and fall apart.  This is like I said very strongly held.</p>

<p>I have been playing with this belief for many years and have convinced myself I am getting stronger and more youthful in energy as I age. And at forty now I am in the best shape of my life and am full of energy, more so than when I was younger.</p>

<p>Try this out, our beliefs do influence perception, this is taken for granted but this can also be manipulated. It&#39;s not absolute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good, in dreams our physical boundaries are loosened, allowing us to do things outside of the constraints of the belief systems that promote the blueprint of physical reality. Awake we all collectively agree on the blueprint which is why people aren&#39;t flying around, but in dreams we do fly, or rather aren&#39;t bound by the belief of gravity. Yes gravity is a physical belief. Our perception is the glue, our beliefs are the components that influence perception.</p>

<p>Buts it&#39;s not that we are a hive mind, or that our universe is solely a byproduct of a group consciousness. Each one of us has the ability to suspend belief, at times, and move into a personal experience.of an alternative reality. This is just one way of saying we each create our own personal universe. For the most part we all agree on the same type of universe but we each I individually project our own reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this the only absolute truth that we are able to say exists with certainty. That is, only absolute truth is that &quot;I&quot; exist and experience things. And this does not include our toughts, emotions, becuase these are easilly changed with drugs and whatnot (this is the whole ego). I am only able to say that I exist, and only as a point that is having experiences.</p>

<p>I am unable to ever say with certainty that other people around me also exist in same manner as me. They could easily be entities i have conjured up or infact real objects that lack the point that I can say for sure that is myself. They could be objects that perfectly immitate what i percieve is what characterises myself. </p>

<p>This is exactly what the term &quot;zombie&quot; originally meant and why it was conjured up by Greek philosophers.</p>

<p>As i said, this is the only absolute truth and it is amazing to realise, but i dont see how this is fruitful to any other discussion and realization of the &quot;world&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll copy and paste something I posted in here just yesterday to another user who PMed me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I understand (again, at least abstractly) that everything is all one, and that as per that unity, there’s really nothing to fear or be super antagonistic toward. I’ve had dreams where I experienced a collective consciousness with many different individuals in one room - experiences where I was literally everyone, everyone was Me, and we were all each other. Everyone all had their own individual thoughts separate from one another and unique onto themselves, but there was also a greater self that was a facet of <em>all</em> identities in the room, and in such a manner that greater identity could pop in and out of literally anyone in the room and be anyone and everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some individuals naturally have greatly developed psionic abilities and it serves as a window that allows a strong connection and a unity between them and much of what they’re in this type of contact with.  Most of the connection that we have with one another is so suppressed that it’s simply not felt on a conscious level, but it’s definitely still there.  Heck, one can see this deep etheric tie alone in the fact that if two females spend enough time with one another, their menstrual cycles become locked and in sync with one another independent of any conscious effort or volition on the part of the two people.</p>

<p>The catch in all of this, of course, is that here on this planet and during this time/age/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">yuga</a>, much of our awareness and abilities have in fact been greatly stifled.  We have been significantly dumbed down as a species and have almost entirely forgotten our collective unity and abilities.  As a result, the overwhelming majority of us live almost exclusively in the world of our <em>very</em> limited physical senses and have become convinced that this is in fact all there is to perception.  Nothing more.  In becoming convinced of this, we have also come to feel ourselves entirely isolated from one another and without thinking, have taken totally for granted the (false) idea that we are not connected with everyone and everything around us.</p>

<p>I could say much more, but will stop here in the interest of not giving you <em>too</em> much to read.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all very interesting, it doesn&#39;t mean much until any of this stuff can be demonstrated though.

<p>That you are under the impression that it hasn’t already been demonstrated over and over again throughout history by all kinds of different people under all kinds of different circumstances, experimental and otherwise, is a great and unfortunate indication of just powerful the influence of suppression is on this planet - a suppression that makes sure and keeps most people entirely in the dark with regard to the reality of the phenomena.</p>

<p>And what I stated previously isn’t “Hinduised”.  It’s Hindu.  There’s no “derivative” being applied.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I can.  And I already did.  Perhaps you’re looking to depend upon the trusty MSM “fake news” media for more “authoritative” information, however.  I have that too.  However, you’d have to properly discern and understand what I already stated above first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>History repeats itself because, collectively, our thought structure -- and, thus, belief system.. conscious and unconscious -- repeats itself. Our thoughts are cyclical day in and day out until we die because the mysticism of existence has been veiled. </p>

<p>Our true creative power gives us the ability to create the world around us with thought and belief. Consequently, because most people (at least where I&#39;m from) believe that Revelations will come true and that God is okay with unfathomable darkness overcoming our planet, it will in fact come true before any of this darkness subsides. We are creating our reality which gives tptb the ability to enjoy it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s more important to be spending time looking inward and bettering your own self than spending too much time learning about conspiracies that exist outside of our selves. By fixing your self, you fix the world and society hugely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mine is that there&#39;s levels of organisms, and there&#39;s no way to distinguish which is the individual. A blood cell is a unique organism. It consumes resources to stay alive, it reproduces, it produces waste, and it is part of a system that supports it. The system attacks threats to the system, as well as threats to the blood cell. The blood cell transports resources to support the system.</p>

<p>A person is very similar. He consumes resources, produces waste, and reproduces. He is part of a system, likely part of many systems, such as the nation state or religion. These systems will attack any threat to the system, and will attack certain threats to the man. In return, the man will work to transport resources to serve the system.</p>

<p>So my question to OP is, if the mind is infinite, what about a single brain cell? A neuron? A region of the brain? And what about the collective minds of an entire system? What if thinking is not meant to be done in isolation? What if it is a communal exercise? A man locked in aan empty room will suffer severe mental impairment even if his nutritional needs are taken care of. What if one brain is only a cell in a collective brain, an organism that we are all a part of but cannot observe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be thinking the inverse of what some scientists are thinking. The idea is that the universe is created for observers, that it can&#39;t BE without someone to comprehend it (to some degree). </p>

<p>This further paves way to the hologram theory that the universe is a hologram that our minds just comprehend and translate into colours, textures, smells, sounds, and tastes. This can be seen in quantum mechanics with wave-particle duality. Electrons which are known to have a mass behave both as waves and particles depending on how they are observed, the same goes for light and other EM waves. </p>

<p>So you could say our mind creates the universe around us. But it certainly isn&#39;t THE universe. </p>

For an example, only you know what you can see and remember and think, and before you were born there was nothing to remember, see, or think. It&#39;s reasonable to think the universe revolves around you, since you cannot prove that I can see and remember and think, and that I don&#39;t blip out of existence when I&#39;m not being observed by you. </p>

<p>Furthermore, you can only observe a miniscule amount of the universe. In order for your mind and the universe to be equal would you not have to observe it all.</p>

<p>If we say that the human race does have unique viewpoints and consciousness, and that I can exist AND you can exist both with viewpoints of reality. 7 billion humans together may give a realitively detailed experience of the Earth&#39;s surface, but under the sea and to Pluto we have little grasp on what&#39;s going on - only vague ideas and theories. As for our observable universe we are barely scrapping the surface. </p>

<p>If there are aliens that we share our consciousness with as well to give us an understanding boost, no matter how advanced a civilisation, the likely hood of exploring and understanding and mapping and experiencing an entire universe is incredibly unlikely. Especially when the universe&#39;s expansion rate is accelerating. It&#39;s a losing fight.</p>

<p>To conclude, a collective mind to equate to the universe sounds romantic and poetic but requires the collective mind to observe the entire universe which is impossible. However, an observer can influence the universe around them as shown by quantum mechanics. So you could say our minds create an understanding of the universe around us and influence it to some degree, but our minds certainly aren&#39;t THE universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your perspective, I could just be a figment of your mind&#39;s imagination, and you&#39;re choosing to further give me life by replying to me. What I was trying to convey is that I can never be in your brain and experience the world as you experience it, and vice versa. It&#39;s the old debate of: Do we perceive colours the same way? (Is my Red the same as your Red) but with a reality-perspective spin on the argument.</p>

<p>How can our minds be one, if we don&#39;t know if we don&#39;t know if the other minds we experience are truly real?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there is the &quot;little&quot; mind (ego mind) that has preferences, biased perceptions based upon past experiences and created judgements about everything it perceives. And then there is the &quot;big&quot; mind (the One Mind) that the theory is referring to. The ego mind <em>thinks</em> it&#39;s separate from the One Mind, but in reality it&#39;s the preferences/judgements of the ego mind that create this illusion of separateness. Oneness of minds doesn&#39;t mean we all think/perceive identically, it means our minds are all connected in such a way that certain information is just known (when we choose to connect to that greater awareness). I highly recommend looking into the Akashic field and stuff like that.</p>

The oneness of minds aspect would be more like many different ingredients to make one big recipe, rather than what you are infering that I meant hive mindness, which would be akin to a large number of the same ingredient. Akashic field sounds interesting though, if not a little archaic, thanks for the heads up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Each of us is the mind. The mind is the &#39;me&#39;. Sadly, the majority of humanity believes devoutly that they are the &#39;me&#39;, aka the mind, aka the thought structure. </p>

<p>What people haven&#39;t realized, for the most part, is that each of us has thoughts but prior to each thought sits the awareness of it. Prior to everything experienced is the awareness of it.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, what each of us is and always has been is the awareness of our individual experience. &#39;The Knower&#39; of our life, if you will, which perpetually sits in silence as it observes all that there is. As a matter of fact, it literally is the silence within us. No thought can really know or understand what each of us is because thought comes out of awareness itself. </p>

<p>Want freedom? Die before you die. In this moment, have the courage to take a look back at your entire life and see that all you&#39;ve ever been is the awareness of all of it. The screen of existence that sits silently and just.. is. </p>

<p>Now, the trippy aspect: that awareness is also the universe. Our lives are the experiential manifestation of the universe living an experience of itself, as itself. </p>

<p>Our personal lives are illusory in nature. Our personal lives are seen through an egoic structure which is self-centered in it&#39;s nature. But we&#39;re going through an awakening period in which that ego structure is being seen through and let go of.</p>

<p>That&#39;s true liberty. Becoming who you really are by seeing through the whole &#39;game&#39; and letting go of the illusory &#39;me&#39;. It&#39;s ironic that when you let your self die, the real you finally recognizes itself. And yet, you&#39;ve been the real you the entire time but you just haven&#39;t noticed it because of all the noise tptb have thrown into our experience.</p>

<p>Everything is a big holofractal light simulation, with interacting systems off all sizes exchanging information in an every, self-expanding, feedback loop.</p>

<p>“if a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?”</p>

<p>We need interacting fields and interference waves to create reality and matter out of the perfect fractal structure of infinite energy lying beneath it all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept that an observer generates the reality in which the event occurs, such as sound emission by the falling tree, assumes an isolation of the frame of reference relative to the event. That is, all interactions in the system, the air molecules for instance, the birds in the neighboring tree, the microbial life all around and in the tree and so on, can all be considered frames of reference - “observers” - experiencing the event from different perspectives. Is there a mechanism in which the relationship of reference frames generates a collective behavior that eventually evolves to a self-awareness state?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there is the &quot;little&quot; mind (ego mind) that has preferences, biased perceptions based upon past experiences and created judgements about everything it perceives. And then there is the &quot;big&quot; mind (the One Mind) that the theory is referring to. The ego mind <em>thinks</em> it&#39;s separate from the One Mind, but in reality it&#39;s the preferences/judgements of the ego mind that create this illusion of separateness. Oneness of minds doesn&#39;t mean we all think/perceive identically, it means our minds are all connected in such a way that certain information is just known (when we choose to connect to that greater awareness). I highly recommend looking into the Akashic field and stuff like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bible says sun &amp; moon are &quot;great lights&quot; within our earths dome. More recently, Nikola Tesla seemed to suggest the same. Masonic symbolism would seem to support the same for what that&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>If Sun and Moon were within a dome ceiling of our earth (e.g. not a bazillion miles away or however many it is this year) that sure would change the way most people would think about this thread. </p>

<p>People might wonder why we&#39;re here and what the purpose is...in the same way they wonder how they can lose weight. </p>
