       Something is definately close to hit the fan with Neil Det Tyson &amp; co are wasting their breath debunking flat earth theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never figured why Phil Nye would waste time debating creationists, but it is starting to make sense now - Their own version of the world, the universe and our own history is crumbling. So what better way to distract us than focus our attention on ridiculing something even further from the truth?

       It's just more dumbing down. They once actually taught us things. Now their efforts to debunk are actually creating more flat earthers. People who would never consider such bullshit are now thinking about it. And some are questioning the real science but not with real ammunition.

       People might be better knowing that arguing against something actually energizes it more than just ignoring it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it again it could be coordinated and planned to keep people talking about it, because it keeps the conversation off of real disclosures. It's a controlled argument... a proxy argument. This is the kind of meme that Tavistock Institute cooks up.

       What better way to keep the population distracted from decades of ET contact and a Secret Space Program using advanced technology funded by trillions stolen from taxpayers.

       Exactly! Like why does it upset people the way it does? I think it touches on something much deeper. Most want reality to be exactly as they see it. They leave little room for the occult. It's worrisome. It's how we all ended up being ruled over in the first place

       I get upset seeing FE posts because, even though I enjoy talking about "off the wall" theories, the lack of logic seen in those posts actually hurts me. If they are real people(not paid), it actually makes me worried about humanity.

       I could fly a 3 stage rocket with a gopro up high enough to record the curvature of earth and it would be called fake by some of these people. I don't have that kind of money to throw around at it though. I would rather fly an airplane through the chemtrails with a device attached to collect samples and test for barium and aluminum.

       It is claimed that ships disappear over the horizon due to curvature, so it shouldn't take that much altitude to see curvature right? Yet NOBODY has ever recorded curvature with a NON-fisheye lens camera.

      <p>
       Humanity HAS been that deceived, and that is why Flat Earthers are spreading their information like wildfire to help wake people up to the deception.

       I'm not selling anything here btw, I just hope to compel you (and others) to do your own research.

       If there's anything I've learned in my years as a researcher it's that the more ridiculed something is by the mainstream, the more truth there probably is behind it. And few things are more ridiculed than Flat Earth.

       You still believe what the mainstream news tells you?!
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you just from looking at some simple gematria of this story that it is totally scripted.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Adam Cudworth" in the English Ordinal system equals 131 (13 and 11x3=33)
      </p>
      <p>
       "Nottingham University" in the English Reduction system equals 103 ... another 13.
      </p>
      <p>
       Altitude of 33,592m ... another 33
      </p>
      <p>
       From "Ombersley, Worcs" in the English Reduction system equals 66... 66 is another big occult number (as in, 66/99 as above so below) and as it happens the article was published on September 9th (9/9... or 99).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't know what the heck I'm talking about re: 13, 33, 66, etc then I suggest you research those numbers and their connection to freemasonry.

       I know full well who controls the media. You do realize that because some media is faked or manipulated doesn't mean that the entirety of the news is fake right? Or do you consider every piece of journalism ever to be fake?

       I'm not making any generalizations here, but as someone who has studied the news media for several years - including the numerical language (i.e gemetria) that they use to code their fake stories with, I can tell you that the story you posted is fake.

       If the Earth was a ball you should be able to see curvature from ground level, but that is not the case. For example, the NY city skyline should not be perfectly visible 60 miles away.

       "8 inches per mile" is a LINEAR drop, and thus that formula is NOT applicable to a ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual formula for curvature on a ball is "8inches per mile SQUARED". You can see a full derivation of that formula from first principles using Pythagoras Theorem and Taylor Series in the link I posted above.

       the exact details of most of this sub's "known conspiracies." The round earth is something that we can observe (first-hand) and in several different ways. In history (16th century to present), we also have
       <em>

       This is the trap that the OP has fallen into. I see more posts in this sub complaining about Flat Earth posts than I see actual Flat Earth posts. The people who post FE stuff could be shills (but not necessarily), but it is the hysterical response to those posts that makes their strategy effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like a post you see in this sub, just ignore it, or downvote it and MOVE ON. Find a post which actually interests you, and engage with it by making constructive comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accusing someone of shilling, or trying to shame somebody for entertaining a conspiracy which (you think) is off-the-wall makes you no better than somebody shaming you for believing 9/11 was an inside job. It doesn't help change their mind, and causes a great deal of friction that the mods have to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you cannot conceive how anybody could believe in Flat Earth, does NOT mean they are a shill. Is your smug "Globe Earth" theory so rock-solid, bearing in mind quantum physicists are seriously entertaining the idea that our "reality" is merely a simulated universe, possibly just one tier of many generations of Russian-doll-like simulated universes?
      </p>
      <p>
       The internecine warfare that surrounds a controversial subject really harms the sub, and Pizzagate (or "Putin hacked the election") is a better example than Flat Earth, because opinion is more divided as to whether it is a real conspiracy or not.

       I don't buy this one bit.  Every FE thread is just snarky comments and downvotes.  It's like looking at r/politics.  If people cannot accept they do not know where they are or who they are, they cannot be helped.  They are still half asleep.  I don't know if the Earth is flat or round or concave or hollow and neither does anyone else.  If you want to hedge your bet on blind faith that you just
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       your true existence, be my guest, but if you ask me that's the truly foolish path to take.  Give me FE theory, ME, Breakaway civs, the backside of the moon, Antarctica, DUMBs all of it and lets fucking talk about it.  Because that's when you start asking the real questions, the questions about who we are and where we are, which is ultimately where the rabbit hole leads.  Don't take the path of the fool, you simply do not know anything about your existence and it may very well be intentional

       You can know for yourself if you live near a sea-port where you can watch the ships heading in/out. Google search "ship over the horizon" for the best illustration of Earth's roundness. I have observed this phenomenon first-hand (served on a Navy ship). The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but it is round af. It might be flattish near the poles and fatter at the equator (kinda make sense when you think of centrifugal force). Just trying to help... If we can't agree on basics like this, we will always need the overclass to arbitrate our differences...

       I think the earth is round but I have no idea it's true shape.  I think it's ridiculous that in the last 6 months this sub has turned into "nothing to see here nothing to discuss, dont think critically just accept what you have been told" ...A massive 180.  It's important for us to get back to discussing our true existence and who we are and what we are.  If FE upsets people how are they ever going to accept bigger truths when they are unveiled?  We have been deceived for a long long time.  To me there is a strong chance humans have been around for 500k+ years.  There is a strong chance WE built the moon, that we are among the stars.  There is a strong chance there was a great biblical flood and 99% of humans were eradicated in a single afternoon.  There is probably a breakaway civ, maybe even in the hollow earth...All these things we used to discuss are now off limits, and the change is very recent and very sudden in this community.  In about 6 months time we have crossed almost every topic but politics off our list...It's a fucking shame

       We agree that the world is round(ish). 'nuff said. I think that it is important support the truth in conversation.

      <p>
       I am inclined to agree with you about the 500k years of human presence and the possible hollow/artificial nature of the moon. Just the same, we need to be able to agree on physically observable phenomena (like the fact of the roundish earth on which we live). The other things that you mention are theories and possibilities. We
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that the Earth is roundish, even if it's a digital simulation. let's empower our fellows with real information with which to build a worldview.

       I believe in a whole wide range of conspiracy but FE is clearly designed to take advantage of non critical thinkers we have known without doubt for thousands of years the earth is round. Is it hollow? I see that as a real thing to spend some time debating but FE is easily debunked on your own in your backyard with a model rocket and a camera (without a wide angle lens.)

       At a certain height above the ground, you can see the curve of the earth.  Having hovered at and above those heights (3500 ft AGL) prior to conducting static line jumps out of a UH-1 Huey I can confirm the earth is in fact round.  When you descend you are taught to look at the horizon.  The reason they teach you this is so you don't run away from the ground as you see it rushing towards you.  I did this multiple times and always saw the same thing.....an obviously curved horizon line indicating the earth is round.  in fact, the first time I saw it I and others who had never seen this before stated out loud:  well, I guess that puts the flat earth theory to rest.

       I would hazard a guess that everyone defending the globe in this thread believes that the sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth.

       However, they don't believe that because of having proved it for themselves - they have simply placed their complete trust in what other people ("scientists") have told them is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the absence of ANY actual scientific proof (and by "scientific" I mean proof that is observable, repeatable, and measurable, according to the scientific method), this can only be called one thing: blind faith.

       The ball earth theory is literally a religion and these people that go out of there way to try and defend it are looking sillier every single day.  The way that they get so defensive and upset shows that they know on some level their reality is based purely on faith from authority figures and not from their objective research,experiments or logic.

       You are calling Einstein a known liar also Galileo also Newton  all of these genius men you are literally calling liars when they are the basis for a great deal of the science responsible for the knowledge of the universe but I'm sure you know better than men who literally spent their whole lives studying things you obviously can't even understand.

       Einstein, Newton, and Galileo were all freemasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newton was massively into the occult and was part of founding the Royal Society which has strong ties to the Vatican. So much for this "science" not being a religious establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Einstein's mentor was Georges Lemaitre - a jesuit catholic priest who also invented the Big Bang theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, all these scumbags work for the Jesuits and Vatican, not to help mankind.

       Do you also believe computers are magic?
      </p>
      <p>
       I take it you dont have an electron microscope so its not like you have seen an electron move through a gate. Im also sure you have never seen a CPU shuffle around those electrons so how can we verify that they actually work.

       Leedskalnin was an interesting guy, building Coral Castle was a huge undertaking but nothing magical about it. Heres an image of CC being built by Ed

       He did it the old fashioned way by using his brain. Now building a castle is cool but not as cool as telling people that he used magnetic magics to do so. He sold admission to the place, at the very least the guy is an asshole who (re)discovered a way that completely flies in the face of modern science and he used it to build a tourist attraction...

       I get it and Im sure there are as of yet undiscovered ways of manipulating our fundamental forces but Mr Leedskalnin is not the one to put on this pedestal. Its pretty clear he didnt use magic.

       The Flat Earth movement IS controlled, but it doesn't make it untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a First class Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering* and have analyzed the Flat Earth for 2 years, and I've come to the logical conclusion that the Earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vladimir Lenin once said "the best way to control your opposition is to lead it yourself"... and this is true for the Flat Earth movement, given that all the so-called "leaders" of the movement Eric Dubay and Matt Boylan are both disinformation agents (90% truth, 10% lies), not to mention the comical "Flat Earth Society" which is there simply to misrepresent the Flat Earth to ward off those who only casually glance at the subject.
      </p>

       Thanks for showing an interest. My research is documented
       <a href="https://thenarrowgateweb.com/2016/10/14/table-of-contents/">
        here
       </a>
       .

      <p>
       Articles #16-24 and 27 deal with Flat Earth. You will certainly find it useful to read earlier posts too as everything is presented as a coherent narrative, particularly post 1 and 12-14.
      </p>
      <p>
       For your reference here is a short description of each of the posts I've completed so far on flat earth:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Mathematical analysis of nature (building off work in posts #1 and posts 13+14, which I recommend reading first) to derive the Flat Earth model using Phi, sacred geometry, magnetism, and vector equilibrium - a model which matches the cosmological model of all ancient cultures.
       </li>
       <li>
        NASA lies (including moon landing and plenty of photoshop)
       </li>
       <li>
        Curvature maths (including full mathematical derivation) and an explanation of how perspective works.
       </li>
       <li>
        Everything about the movement of the sun and moon
       </li>
       <li>
        Spinning ball debunked, including coriolis, doppler effect, and more.
21-22. Two-part post on Antarctica, flights in the southern hemisphere, and the education (i.e. indoctrination) system
       </li>
       <li>
        The Royal Society, Gravity, and relativity debunked
       </li>
       <li>
        Thorough debunking of the space lie
       </li>
       <li>
        Analysis of what the stars are and how they move on Flat Earth.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I have plenty more in the pipeline too, including explaining exactly what "gravity" really is, using electromagnetism and field modalities (i.e. the stuff Nikola Tesla knew about).
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate that it may be a lot of information to take in, so do let me know if you have any questions as I'm more than happy to help point you in the right direction. :)

       Nope, no questions. I won't change your mind clearly but you definitely haven't changed mine. A lot of your math has incorrect assumptions where you work already basing your math off a flat earth. The rest of this is a long winded government 8th grade level conspiracy theory that because they've lied before, they must be lying about the Earth being round. You (ironically) try to say the math of Newton and Einstein is made up, yet use it to prove your theory.

       That said, it would be more conducive to intellectual debate if you could provide specific examples of where you think that I have made incorrect assumptions. Can you do that?

       As for Newton and Einstein, I showed in my 23rd article - using words out of Newton's own mouth as well as logic by Tesla, that the theory of gravity is flawed.

       Flawed doesn't mean incorrect. It can mean there's still more to learn. The Wright brothers built a flawed airplane, but it was still an airplane.

       But off my limited reading and the top of my head. Your isosceles triangle prediction takes no account for the fact the "bottom" of your triangle is curved. You assume it's flat. We don't see light completely perpendicular and in straight lines because of the atmospheres well known ability to bend and refract light (particularly waters). And you assume in your centripetal force experiment the earth is straight up and down, what happens if you tilt it? You also don't talk about how if the solar system is moving, couldn't those forces felt by a rotating earth be offset? Like you go on to explain with the doppleganger efffect.

       ... And you know what, Isaac Newton himself agrees with me, as this excerpt from his letter to Richard Bentley shows:
      </p>
      <p>
       "That gravity should be innate inherent &amp; {essential} to matter so that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of any thing else by &amp; through which their action or force {may} be conveyed from one to another IS TO ME SO GREAT AN ABSURDITY that I beleive no man who has in philosophical matters any competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it."

       And really? On TV? No, I know from the plethora of peer reviewed science journals that exist. Peer review that isn't part of your MSM "calculus was invented by a secret society" theory. Which is kind of ironic, don't you think? You tear down one theory claiming it is false, only to give your own theory you claim is true. Because that's what we are arguing, theories. Things not proven because nobody has sent a satellite directly into the sun to prove its distance.

       This is not an assumption. I do that because there is zero MEASURABLE curvature. Derive the curvature formula for yourself (8in x miles squared) and see for yourself - it is not hard to do.

       What I find ridiculous is that you are willing to believe in things that define your very existence (where am I, who am I, where did I come from) based on absolutely NOTHING that you yourself can prove. THAT is what is ridiculous.

       This is the trap that the OP has fallen into. I see more posts in this sub complaining about Flat Earth posts than I see actual Flat Earth posts. The people who post FE stuff could be shills (but not necessarily), but it is the hysterical response to those posts that makes their strategy effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like a post you see in this sub, just ignore it, or downvote it and MOVE ON. Find a post which actually interests you, and engage with it by making constructive comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accusing someone of shilling, or trying to shame somebody for entertaining a conspiracy which (you think) is off-the-wall makes you no better than somebody shaming you for believing 9/11 was an inside job. It doesn't help change their mind, and causes a great deal of friction that the mods have to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you cannot conceive how anybody could believe in Flat Earth, does NOT mean they are a shill. Is your smug "Globe Earth" theory so rock-solid, bearing in mind quantum physicists are seriously entertaining the idea that our "reality" is merely a simulated universe, possibly just one tier of many generations of Russian-doll-like simulated universes?
      </p>
      <p>
       The internecine warfare that surrounds a controversial subject really harms the sub, and Pizzagate (or "Putin hacked the election") is a better example than Flat Earth, because opinion is more divided as to whether it is a real conspiracy or not.

       Einstein, Newton, and Galileo were all freemasons.

       Newton was massively into the occult and was part of founding the Royal Society which has strong ties to the Vatican. So much for this "science" not being a religious establishment.

       Einstein's mentor was Georges Lemaitre - a jesuit catholic priest who also invented the Big Bang theory.
