       Edit: by the way, the term 'wiretap' is being used loosely. Trump was not wiretapped in the strict traditional sense. Think more along the lines of Vault 7 techniques.
      </p>
      <h1>
       1. Russia
      </h1>
      <p>
       They must give the American people the impression that they believe Russia is up to no good, and that they are conducting an objective, thorough investigation. They are now commanding the attention. The media and (more importantly) the remainder of the politically conscious American population minus Trump's base are now committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conclusion of the investigation will be that there are no objectionable links between Trump and Russia, nor did Russian hackers materially rig the election -- which is the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Russian hackers did do along with four other foreign powers, however,  was penetrate Clinton's private server. They found hard evidence of criminality on that server and they were in a position to leak that evidence to the American public as a deterrent against war should Hillary have won the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was Hillary who was deeply compromised.  If she had won, it would have been a national security disaster as Russia would have leaked the info on her  with the aim of inciting uprising and preventing war -- her and NATO's response to which would be total war on Russia.   This is why patriots within the FBI and NSA needed to ensure her loss, aside from the fact that she was already generally unlikable and viewed as corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They -- patriots within our own intelligence apparatus, not the Russians -- leaked intel to Trump's campaign to give him an edge, they leaked intel non-transparently online and via independent media, and they also leaked disinformation to pro-Hillary reporters to get them focused on red herrings. And then of course there was Comey's Oct 28th surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Trump in office, we are not going to war against Russia -- nor should we, since the war on Russia was part of a broader plan for globalized hegemony.
      </p>
      <h1>
       2. Wiretapping
      </h1>
      <p>
       Comey and Rogers are telling the literal truth: "our agencies do not have information that supports Trump's tweets." That is true and it is perfectly consistent with the fact that they know Trump was wiretapped. What is critically important is that they are also telling the truth when they say that such wiretapping would be a criminal act. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it is rogue elements of the CIA who have that information, and it is rogue elements of the CIA who committed the crime. This is why Vault 7 was timed to be released before the hearing. Rogers and Comey's respective agencies had better not have information on it, or questions about the complicity of those agencies would naturally arise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note what has been accomplished though: the population is now fully committed to the premise that such wiretapping would be a serious crime if it were done. They are now prepared to find out who did it, and thus it will be a logically inescapable conclusion that the culprit is a criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statement "there is no information in my agency that supports the content of Trump's tweet" is logically consistent with the statement "I, Rogers, have evidence that Trump was wiretapped spied upon illegally under the direction of Brennan and Obama."
      </p>
      <p>
       Rogers, in his position within the NSA, was likely somewhat aware of what these CIA elements were doing, and he relayed the information to Trump during the campaign, knowing that Trump would soon occupy the office of presidency.  (I.e., he was doing the right thing, and likely saving his ass in the process. The same might be true of Comey, which would explain Oct 28 and Trump's keeping him on as Director.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The conclusion will be that rogue elements of the CIA -- possibly under the direction of Brennan and Obama -- were engaged in a high crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pretext for flushing out the CIA will be established in coordination with the results of the hearing, the investigation, and further leaks from Vault 7.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Footnote
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to avoid mistakes when you observe everything that is going on, just keep three propositions in mind: (1) Trump and his team are exceptionally smart, and their competence in persuasion techniques is unparalleled; (2) a revolution occurred such that the highest players were dethroned; and (3) revolutions need the popular support of the people to begin successful purges in the final phases, otherwise they are perceived as external tyrannies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understanding those three propositions will allow you to place things in the appropriate context. We are now in the lead up to the purge, which means it is time for condition (3) to be satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is false that Trump took to Twitter and said things which he knows cannot be proven and it is false that Comey and Rogers were involved in the criminal wiretapping. Far from it, Comey and Rogers are part of the revolutionary force. (Comey may have had to join via coercion and blackmail, but that is a separate and more speculative issue we can save for another time.)
      </p>
      <p>
       They now have popular support and the media is committed to the results of the hearing and investigation. The findings that will soon be made public will result in draining the swamp with much fanfare and support of most of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's tweets yesterday morning about "fake news" and his rally were timed in coordination with the hearing in the following manner. First, Trump's staff released his schedule to communicate that Trump does not have a hand in the hearing and the process is unfolding without his influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, Trump's tweets and rally communicated to the base an assurance that the swamp will soon be drained. This was to compensate for any despondency during the head fake.  What the hearing achieved yesterday was a head fake to draw media detractors and the American population in and commit them to the results. When the results are released, criminal columns within the CIA and the broader deep state will be crushed with much fanfare and popular support, making it a robust and successful post-revolutionary purge.

       Even if true, that is all consistent with Comey doing the right thing now. None of the content of OP requires belief that he is a good person. He could be corrupt, or downright evil, and still do the right thing due to coercive measures. In fact if we assume he is evil, it might be all the more reason he is now doing the right thing, as information pertaining to whatever he did could now be the leverage used to contain and steer him.

       His October surprise confuses me in the context of everything else he's done and said. So, I am on the fence as well. I mean prior to that he was apparently helping Clinton. Then he torpedoes her out of nowhere. That was the moment she lost imo.

       She wasn't the first and she won't be the last either. Having ISIS killing other radical groups is just good business. The Taliban wasn't an issue because we gave them helicopter killing missiles, they were became a problem when they fucked with the CIA dope connection.

       He dislikes the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       This goes back to 1883 when Giuliani filed a 65-count criminal indictment on a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Rich">
        fraudster named Mark Rich
       </a>
       for things like income tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and trading with Iran during the oil embargo. Mark Rich fled to Switzerland and evaded arrest. Bill Clinton granted Rich a
       <em>
        full
       </em>
       pardon. Comey later performed a full investigation on the legality of this pardon and has been very wary of the Clintons ever since.

       I don't consider playing both sides of the street as being a "good guy". The law is the law and "ignorance of the law is no excuse" as I'm sure you've heard long before now. What HRC did was a crime, plain and simple. When the head of the freaking FBI says he wouldn't recommend charges because she didn't
       <em>
        intend
       </em>
       to break the law, that is complete and utter nonsense. This isn't a case where there are any extenuating circumstances that might have excused or minimized it or that anyone could say there was no harm done as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       HRC was directly responsible for the safety and security of every embassy's staff and that included the security and confidentiality of her and the State department's communications with them and theirs with her and State department. She also used the very same email system for
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       of her own personal and private affairs. Who does that? It's one thing for close relatives to perhaps know and use your work email to contact you if they can't get a hold of you any other way or it's an emergency of some kind but to use that for all your private and personal communications as well your work? Look at the utter nonsense of her having to go through everything to sort out what was presumably strictly personal and not work related that she didn't want to hand anything over until she had time to remove them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her work related communications were all government property not hers and she was responsible for safeguarding that property by following the standard operating procedures that were in place to insure the integrity and continuity of that property which she completely and quite deliberately failed to do. Her personal convenience doesn't and never should have superseded the responsibilities of the job she was entrusted to carry out according to all the established procedures she was supposed to know better than anyone else as the head of the department she was in charge of.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Not only must Justice be done, it must also be seen to be done." Comey failed on both of those counts insofar as that goes. If he was a man of integrity he would have put his job on line instead of dissembling and dodging his own sworn duty to uphold and enforce the law if the DOJ tried to block him.

       "No" while under oath implies "I know this to be false."
      </p>
      <p>
       Not knowing something (not being aware of something) is not the same as knowing something is definitively false. There's plenty of weasel-words being thrown around in hearings like this but that's not one of them, it's just being careful with the phrasing he uses.

       I agree. It's really just a more specific and accurate phrase when accuracy can be the difference between sleeping at home in bed or in a cell.

       It seems like I'm the one with proof(because the proof is a search showing you we are posted about constantly there) and you have willful ignorance in place of yours. I don't care how many subscribers they have, your the only one bringing that up oddly. My claim is that they brigade, and that is a fact.

       You either don't know how to use Reddit or your lying. I just pulled my laptop out to verify. If you're having trouble with it, you can easily do the search yourself, if that isn't too hard for you.

       That is because he can only state the evidence but he cannot prosecute. The DoJ prosecutes, and the DoJ at that time was corrupt to the core and generating harsh pushback against Comey. He did everything up to the point of recommendation of prosecution.

       This guy fucks. Your conclusion actually is near what I've been thinking. Comey's choice of word is really odd. One part in yesterday's hearing caught a lot of people's attention. Comey made a point of saying that the

       were very LOUD in their hacking. a.k.a. leaving traces (à la CIA)

       Just remaining optimistic until something happens that convinces me nothing will be done.. I wish she was rotting in a cell. However, I do doubt something happens to Clinton, but I think we will see some low level arrests and the deconstruction of their corrupt system they set up. Or I hope.

       Ten of Trumps personal hires have been exposed within the last month. More than four have resigned over being exposed, one of them committed a felony by lying to the FBI, another lied to the public dozens of times, and our president also lied to the public about his affairs with Russia.

       Tell me, how is this 'Russia stuff' manufactured? This is the most resignations we've seen in the history of American politics, and you guys just want to move back on to Clinton or what? Do you even realize how much me and you and the rest of the public don't know about this whole situation?

       They have been investigating and as has repeatedly been said, found no evidence of collusion. I guess you can argue that Clapper was kept out of the loop, or is just lying again but it doesn't make sense for him to help Trump by saying there was no evidence of collusion when he was still in the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, strange that they didn't use any of this information to help them win the election.

       I want a list of who you're talking about and what they did to get fired, or forced to resign. I would venture a guess that most of it is bullshit just like the Session thing. Totally open to new information though.

       I think the new administration is being smart not going after the Clintons.  I honestly believe this country would fall into civil war if one of the first things done by a new President was to quickly prosecute their political rival.  Maybe down the road it will happen, but I'm not holding out hope.

        What's happened in the last 2 months that the federal court system can't add another case?

      <p>
       Nothing. But there are multiple ways to go after Clinton and maybe a special prosecutor right off the bat isn't a good way to go. He could very well be building a case as we speak for RICO charges on more than just Clinton. Regardless, something like that needs his undivided attention and he needs to heel the CIA/NSA/FBI so he is not fighting 4 people at once.
      </p>

       Just sit back and watch the show, maybe we'll get 8 years out of it.

       And why wouldn't he?  Loretta Lynch was saying publicly she would 100% take the recommendation of the FBI.  His recommdation was no reasonable prosecutor would take the case.

       If she said she would 100% take the recommendation of the FBI, then she obviously knew what the result of that statement from Comey would be. Comey also stated that no
       <em>
        reasonable
       </em>
       prosecutor would take the case, which is true. Think of the body count of people who tried to take down the Clintons, and also the fact that even if they did manage to prosecute, the DOJ could give a very light sentence, or Obama could have even pardoned her. There is also the fact that the server is very small in comparison to the crimes of the Clinton Foundation, and that it would be much smarter to go after the big fish, like FBIanon stated.

       If they allow a corrupt DOJ to do the investigation, not only is Comey going to get tossed out, they can then clear Clinton of wrongdoing and it will all go away. It was smarter not to recommend indictment.

       Don't forget the context. She said this the same day that she took an impromptu meeting with Bill Clinton in her private plane. A move so openly corrupt that it still shocks me that the public largely didn't seem to care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever happened in the meeting is vital to understanding the conclusion of the investigation. Also remember that the Foundation investigation is still underway as far as we know.

       no such thing as bad press, especially in a popularity contest, he was
       <em>
        propped up
       </em>
       by constant msm coverage, not struggling against it.  You're claiming he's swimming up a waterfall, you're looking upside down, hes really getting carried downstream by the current.

       His cronies are ballsy businessmen or wealthy bankers, not necessarily the wisest men we have ever seen though. We will see how his move to the presidency will be to his brand.  My guess is that after he is done the Trump (tm) name will be in the shitter much like the toothbrush mustache was after WWII.

       Here's an older but I like to think accurate comment of mine:
      </p>
      <p>
       "His strategy is to have his strategy misunderstood.
His hair. His simplistic vocabulary. It makes people think he is a buffoon, they get arrogant and then they lose.
I can't believe how effective this has been."
      </p>
      <p>
       OP also followed that statement up with "and their competence in persuasion techniques is unparalleled". That's true. Everything you hear from Trump is straight out of all of the best marketing/sales/influence books.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a British Lefty (though I guess more libertarian these days) and though I dislike much of Trump's policy I think his strategy and tactics have been amazing. What's so amazing is how oblivious people are too it.

       I also noticed conspicuously that the only thin he denied was that he had information that
       <em>
        Obama

       had ordered wiretapping. When it came to questions about whether there was wiretapping and who might have ordered it he stuck with the old "I can't answer that" response.

       Well, and there was a wire tap on Trump Tower, but not for Trump:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ABC’s Good Morning America reported on Tuesday that the FBI ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower as part of the investigation into the money laundering operation that later resulted in the indictment of more than 30 people tied to Russian organized crime. Tokhtakhounov escaped arrest, and remains a fugitive from the law as of this writing.

       It's really starting to sound like Comey was denying that Obama ordered any surveillance. The more I hear about this the more it seems like the FBI had plenty of reason to be listening to goings on at Trump Tower.

       If you are really interested, look up Intercepted - The Intercept podcast hosted by Jeremy Scahill. This last episode he interviewd Snowden at SXSW and Snowden shares exactly how it can easily (almost certainly) happen, legally and with the proper plausible deniability.

       But that's exactly what I said. He said that Obama never ordered any wiretapping and that Trump's claims were false. He never stated that wiretapping didn't take place or that Obama couldn't have heard about it, or that someone affiliated with Obama ordered it.

       Whaaaaat? I'm not the only Comey fanboy in the world? Crazy! I watched all 5 hours of the hearing yesterday... Wasn't the most exciting thing in the world... and I knew it wouldn't be... I knew he'd be full of a whole bunch of "No comment." Something would be fishy if he wasn't... I've stuck with Comey for a good long while as he's pissed off both sides of the political spectrum... I guess that is one of the benefits of being fairly non-partisan.

Clandestine fifth column activities can involve acts of sabotage, disinformation, or espionage executed within defense lines by secret sympathizers with an external force.

       I don't have your faith in Comey. At first I thought he was just a bumbling bureaucrat getting by on offering favors to those in power. His background connections with the Clintons suggests this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm thinking he is the most rogue agent in the game. Anything he does is for himself and power. I would say he's dug himself in like a tick on a mangy dog and is just daring anyone to touch him. Figure head power is one thing. Having the power to control the figure heads is godlike. I'm beginning to think he's channeled J Edgar Hoover and making himself impossible to get rid of. That's the only way I can explain the laughable charades he's been pulling in public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, Nixon wanted to remove Hoover but was scared of the consequences.

       Yes. Not sure what motivates Comey but power seems to be it. He is not a boy scout. His decision not to prosecute Hillary, IMO, is because he thought then that she would win and he wants curry favor with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lost too yesterday was Comey's admission that he broke protocol in not informing senior congressional last year about the counter-intel investigation on Trump and the he made the decision himself due to sensitivity of the matter. He breaks rules &amp; laws because depending on what HE thinks is right. That's unacceptable.

       It reminds me of the rumor that M. Gorbachev let Russia fail since the KGB was to powerful to control. My hope is there is some animosity in the various intelligence arms and they get tired of his power. I'd love to sit back with my popcorn and watch the FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland, etc get into a good old power struggle.

       Interesting post.  It will be hard for many people to take your 3 point stance in a unbiased fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched while waiting in a hotel lobby so I couldn't hear or watch it completely.  What little I did watch and hear -  I got this feeling indirect messages were being shared by Comey.  For example: he made the comment that "Russia acted loudly."  Why would Russia act loudly? Was it really Russia acting loudly or the CIA or some other government acting as Russia and making it obvious?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did anyone else get that vibe?
      </p>
      <p>
       The questioning about counter-intel notifications I couldn't hear very well but Comey looked uncomfortable and seemed to be elaborating on reasons more so than usual.  I will have to go back and watch again.

       That's the biggest thing for me right now leading me to believe that the Russian connection was faked. It just makes no sense how one of the largest conspiracies in the modern era would be so goddamn obvious. You couldn't write a plot that is easier to spoon-feed the masses. For this narritive to be accepted, you have to acknowledge that the Russian Intel agencies are completely fucking incompetent, but at the same time ended up being successful in their mission. It reeks of "wmds in Iraq."

       i don't think the real purpose of all of this ZOMG RUSSIA!!! has anything to do with a belief that russia has done anything to us or that trump is putin's manchurian candidate on the verge of the "resign or be prosecuted for treason" ultimatum.
      </p>
      <p>
       i no longer believe trump is in danger about it at all, other than the initial freak out because he actually won. if he was a manchurian candidate it was for the clinton faction, which included every major neocon in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is an indisputable fact that he ran on bill clinton's advice and was promoted by hillary clinton and the press as the "pied piper" candidate. the pied piper not just for the republican base that voted for him overwhelmingly in the primaries as intended, but also for moderate republicans and all dems, esp the true left--the big bad wolf working in tandem with bernie sanders' the lovable sheep dog to ensure the election of the neoconservative mafia.
      </p>
      <p>
       clinton, the democrats, the republicans, bernie, and every republican candidate but trump early on, ignored the truely damaging emails--those grudgingly released by the state dept under threat of contempt of court and obstruction of justice--and trump didn't press the issue about them. in fact, everyone continues to ingnore them, including trump, to focus on the "DNC hack" emails exclusively, which only revealed that the DNC played dirty pool with bernie, in other words, politics as usual. even this sub has forgotten about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       if russia was trying to interfere it would have been by having judicial watch, vice, and the ny times file FOIA requests 2-3 years before the election, and having bribed the federal judges overseeing the FOIA cases to continuely rule in favor of the plaintiffs, because those emails are the ones that would/should have actually effected the outcome. but theybwere almost compleyely ignored by everyone but sanders supporters, who forgot about them after the DNC emails came to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       the neocons have wanted to destroy russia since they first siezed power in reagan's cabinet in 1980. the founding fathers of neoconservatism, dick cheney and donald rumsfeld, while serving in his cabinet, had this crazy idea, a literally insane idea, that nuclear war with the USSR was winnable and that threat of global thermo nuclear war was being wasted as a deterent and should be used as threat. their actions, esp the pershing missile crisis of 1982-1983 and the 1983 ABLE ARCHER war game almost ended the world just before thanksgiving nov 1983. the world was closer to annihilation then, than ever before or since, even during the cuban missle crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       after the berlin wall fell and the USSR fell apart, neocons had no more purpose than NATO did. it took them 27 years to be able to publically start their crusade against russia again. behind closed doors this has been going on for at least 5 years, probablly since 1989 tbh.
      </p>
      <p>
       millenials have no concept of the nuclear threat, their response is a resounding "meh." their indifference very well may march us all off a cliff. they care more about pink pussy hats and tribalism than the literal end of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       baby boomers had grown up believing that you could survive a nuclear blast by ducking and covering under their school desks. they had been programmed from birth to hate and fear russians. their original programming has lain dormant since 1989 until now--they've been triggered. and they are vicious, hateful old bastards, same as it ever was. they always hate somebody. they always have to have a boogeyman, now they've got two--trump and their old nemesis, russia.

       the only generation that lived in terror of nuclear war and who had no illusions that nuclear war was survivable was my generation, genX. we were traumatized from elementary school through college. we grew up debating whether it was best to be incinerated or take cover. the tv miniseries that aired in nov 1983, "the day after," settled the debate--pray for incineration. i was 11 yrs old at the time. if you look at the opinions being raised from tucker carlson to glen greenwald, both genX, we see this as insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       we're the only generation taking the threat seriously, the only one freaking out about it, the only one refusing to play our role  in the shit show going on right now, in which trump is playing his part, either as an idiot savant or on purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is all happening to gin up american blood lust for war with russia. the intense partisanship is working--the more you hate trump, the more you hate russia. the more you hate trump, the more you want russia to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       the architects behind this played the long game, and it seems to be paying off.
      </p>
      <p>
       just to show how much genX is refusing to be manipulated, here's this--it isn't about the russia thing, but it makes the point beautifully. you can't steotype us, we are immune propaganda:

       according to the sterotype, this author is the last person who should be making this point. so far i've not seen a single millenial or boomer of the author's persuasion not live up (or down) to their sterotype.
      </p>
      <p>
       anywho ~TL;DR: this is about a war 30 years in the making, not the dog and pony show. this is about manipulating and triggering you, not about trump. this is about the most serious issue today, disguised as much a do about, about nothing. if you are even talki g about the dog and pony show, you've already bought into the narrative.

       said it best. GenXer here. I and pretty much everyone I associate with either A) see the bullshit on both sides, with regard to russia, wikileaks, hillary, trump, DNC, et al; or B) do not follow, comment on, listen to, talk about, or associate with anything politically related except for legalization of cannabis, which both sides whole heartedly agree with the Colorado approach to.

        if russia was trying to interfere it would have been by having judicial watch, vice, and the ny times file FOIA requests 2-3 years before the election, and having bribed the federal judges overseeing the FOIA cases to continuely rule in favor of the plaintiffs, because those emails are the ones that would/should have actually effected the outcome. but theybwere almost compleyely ignored by everyone but sanders supporters, who forgot about them after the DNC emails came to light.

       I think you severely overestimate Russia's capabilities here.

       The rest I absolutely agree with. Baby boomers seem to actually support war with Russia through the cognitive dissonance of actually having to fight a war. The idea that the US and Russia could improve relations is completely anathema to them, they cannot even comprehend a world where Russia is not The Enemy of the US. It's like a comic book superhero who needs an archnemesis. This war build up started well before Trump. When Clinton was Secretary she was constantly pushing Obama to be "tougher on Russia" and her and the neocons were trying to force "boots on the ground" in Syria, knowing it would lead to direct confrontation with Russia and increase global tensions. She even went as far as to call out Obama publicly even after she was no longer secretary.

      <p>
       The sanctions have crippled Russia's economy and for what? Yet even discussion about removing them sends the establishment into a rage, and has become another target for them to attack Trump on. They are dead set on destroying Russia and starting conflict. Obama mobilized an unprecedented military buildup on the Western border of Russia, including tactical nuclear weapons and missile defense systems. Russia responded to 2010 troop buildups by moving their own nuclear weapons in as well. Many people are still totally oblivious to just how close we came to nuclear conflict as recently as 2010 - not cold war close, but the highest tensions of this young century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily the Syrian War has calmed, and despite all the outrage around Trump, the world has been surprisingly... calm. No major terrorism, the Arab spring has essentially passed, the Syrian war is winding down, the pacific has been quiet... And know its all eyes on Trump. I honestly have no idea how this will turn out though.

       No we didn't.  The reason people of our generation feared the Russians is because we knew they could annihilate the US population.  The duck and cover films meant to assure the public we could survive, but few believed it.  I remember the Cuban Missile Crisis and the day we kids were in the yard when the air raid sirens were tested and we were worried.  Everyone was, and we believed the world could come to an end.

       Doesn't change the fact that the Cold War was a farce and based on propaganda used as an excuse to build up military arsenals.  People forget the Cold War turned hot all the time, it just wasn't in the US or Russia, but they certainly caused it.  It's far more likely that a CIA agent would have a beer and swap stories with a KGB counterpart in a bar rather than have a spy movie shootout lol.  The manufactured hatred and bellicosity was a show for the proles.

       Agreed. I think we will later see more evidence that FBIAnon was telling the truth that there was an internal power struggle going on. It's much more likely that the CIA was working against trump while the FBI was working against Hillary. Or that specific agents went rogue in these actions, working against the wishes of their organizations.

       Victurus Libertas has published a few interviews lately that claim to be from FBI Anon (

       ).  They were written in very much the same poetic and sparse style of the original Q and A's, and considering the high quality of regular VL interviewees (Field McConnell, Robert David Steele) and the corroboration of other Pentagon/DHS insiders, I would say they (the FBI Anon VL interviews) are the real deal.

       Comey definitely chooses his words carefully and it can be difficult to decipher where he really stands. There have also been few indictments while he has been at the FBI, and his past is also somewhat controversial.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't particularly impressed with him at the hearing, he was purposefully remaining vague and really did not say much new information.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have made claims similar to OP's for the past year, and so far we have not seen anything to support them. That does not mean that they are not true, but at this point there is really nothing any of us can do but wait and see what happens. Unfortunately, that likely means at least several more months of relentless shilling on reddit and MSM speculating about this investigation while the rest of us get few answers. At this point we know the CIA is not on our side, and I doubt the NSA is. The coming months will test the FBI on where it stands and where its loyalties are.

       Actual evidence of collusion. We've only been seeing evidence of meetings. You know, like what most politicians do with other politicians, so let me know when you have
       <em>

       Because it would be the biggest blunder in our Defense, ever. To believe none of our intelligence agencies could find any connections despite its arsenal of state-of-the-art spying technology means either there is literally no money to track, or Trump and Russia made untraceable, non-binding agreements. The latter would technically be illegal but impossible to prove.

       While I don't believe that Russia was actively influencing our elections, Putin is by no means a good guy. And... Fuck Trump. I genuinely believe that they (Russia), don't want a global conflict.  I believe it because the primary reason Putin cited was they can't afford it.  I believe that.  They have very little to gain (from the cost perspective), from a military conflict.  Putin is smarter than that.  We're doing an excellent job of destroying ourselves from within and never interrupt your adversary when they're making critical mistakes.
      </p>

       We should expect them to use our weakness' against us in the future. Why wouldn't they? The self inflicted damage we've done to our reputation and standing in the world makes us a weak and easy target. They have more to gain from a political conflict than a military one.

       Some of this post may be true, such as the tension between nationalist NSA/FBI and globalist CIA. But sorry to interrupt your nonsensical textual orgasm at the end of the post but Trump is not interested in draining the swamp. In fact he even laughed at how it managed to become a meme in his campaign and how he decided to roll with it. Trump is a tool, either he will be used by TPTB to exact their plan or he will be used by us to win our freedom. But don't get it twisted, the man is out for himself and if we don't take care of him once the deep state is taken out he'll build his own damn authoritarian swamp under our noses.

       Excuse the rest of the video and focus on the uncut Iowa rally clip from 1:20 on. He doesn't take drain the swamp seriously, and it's quite sad (Sad!) that you still do even though this has been known for a while. He's a tool, an agent of chaos (or Kek), and either the chaos consumes the deep state or us. But let's be rational here, he's on his own team not on any of ours.

       You can see what you want to see but to me he was clearly laughing at the whole idea of it. This is why he's had no problem giving high ranking positions to so many former employees of the vampire squid Goldman Sachs and performs fellatio on Israel every chance he gets.

       He was laughing at the imagery, -- but then after the people's response, even he started to believe in
       <em>
        the imagery
       </em>
       .

       Your other points are definitely worth noting, but it also doesn't warrant alarms just yet. Throwing out banks and Israel is a tad too extreme this early in the term. It really seems silly to use any of this to discredit his presidency so early in office. But I guess like you said, we'll see what we want to see.

       I agree, it is early so we'll have to wait and see. I want to believe he's as much of a "conspiracy theorist" as his past woke af statements make him out to be. But the deep state is powerful and manipulative, and he's an old man who's mental faculties are clearly beginning to fail him. Can't help but be a bit skeptical :)

       I pretty much agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at what Comey throughout the election and up to the present, it seems to me that he is just straddling the line. He MUST remain impartial so that the investigations have legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched the entire thing yesterday and NOTHING he said hurts Trump or helps the Democrats. The only thing emphatically stated as illegal yesterday was the leak with regards to Flynn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying the evidence doesn't support the tweets is obvious. Of course Obama himself didn't wiretap Trump and would have never overtly made the request.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying they are investigating Russian connections is also something we know. We also know there is no evidence of collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey is being impartial here and will follow the evidence.

       Trump is not intelligent enough to pull something like this off, he has been caught multiple times already regurgitating bs he sees on Fox New and Breitbart as fact, only to offer up 0 evidence for his claims.

       Who, Trump? There are a lot of reasons, and I don't think I could do the question justice on my phone. However, I'd say that the media, leaks, his opponents, economic inequality, general dissatisfaction with the government, promises to drain the swamp and a ton of other lies handed him the whitehouse. This is an absurdly incomplete answer though, so I can elaborate as necessary.

       Conflating verbal ability with intelligence is not something I would advise. Verbal communication is just one facet of intelligence, not saying he is a genius, but clearly someone who is able to grow and manage multi-million (or billion?) companies must be able to have some kind of a brain on their head.

       Klondike, right. Would add that Trump is highly articulate. He tones down the ability during rallies. It is intentional.
      </p>
      <p>
       See for example (entirely off the cuff and unscripted):
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rksd80-FCAw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rksd80-FCAw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       His use of terms like 'special' and 'tremendous' and 'great' is a conditioning technique to appeal to the listener's values. Everybody has a different definition of what those values are because they are sufficiently blank. This allows Trump to be associated with whatever the listener's imagination assigns to those value terms.

       The only people he is "persuading" are the 24 percent of the population that voted for him, and not even all of them.  He has a historically incompetent and corrupt administration, stacked with Goldman Sachs and other Wall St crooks, looking to give giant handouts to the defense industry, all at the expense of the common man.  He has done nothing to promote any form of personal freedom or autonomy, and his relationship with the truth is a joke.  Who is he persuading right now with his historically bad presidency, exactly?

       he were vastly smarter than you. Consider what might be true if he is only doing exactly what he is told to do. Consider that Dick Cheney is running his administration. What would Dick Cheney be up to with a puppet president? Wouldnt it be in Dick Cheney's interest to get you focused on Russia?

       I agree that it isn't crystal clear talk or anything, but you have to distinguish between not being able to verbalize himself fully (his biggest thing is throwing stuff out randomly without context) and being stupid. You could at least get the other "nuclear" quote that was 10x worse.

       If you read some of Trump's candid admissions, you will find him talking about creating the persona that a given audience expects to perceive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at footage of his development and investing discussions, you'll see the persona there is radically divergent from the campaign persona.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creating personas for a given occasion is among the first range of techniques learned by students of influence and psychiatric conditioning. Trump's execution resembles that of a clinically trained hypnotist with multiple PhDs in behavioral psychology and linguistics. It's unsurprising; he has been practicing it for more than  30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes no effort to believe, based on his campaign rhetoric, that Trump is an incompetent buffoon. Think about why it is so easy for you to arrive at that belief. And think of the power that comes with being underestimated.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I have said here is enough to point you in the right direction if you'd like to broaden your research and confirm. The rest is up to you.

       You would have to be an idiot to not understand that Trump and his team are incredibly good at this.  His campaign and win alone will be studied for decades, and when 90% of what the media throws at him gets thrown back in their face and discredits them even further in the process, I would say he's doing a pretty good job so far.  The oafish, brash and bumbling personality is a carefully crafted image that is half real and half a show to have his opponents expose their hand, make himself look even better, and create a discussion about something - high-level surveillance of politicians, the Deep State overreach, his tax returns and the refugee situation in Europe being prime examples.  These are all threads leading to bigger and crazier revelations that will come later.  Trump and his team are playing 43D chess right now.

       Im not buying the Russian narrative but thinking Trump is going to "drain the swamp" after seeing the people he chose for his administration is just insane. Like the same people that crashed the economy and made a fortune destroying the earth suddenly give a shit about anyone but themselves now that they're in office.

       At the end of the day, both sides are evil.  I was genuinely scared at the possibility of either person becoming president.  Each side has its own brand of corruption and its own selfish agenda.  It's sad because I'm having a real hard time finding anyone who I genuinely believe to be a good person in this whole debacle.

       All of those participating in the Kabuki theater yesterday know that the NSA collects everything. Everything. It's a matter of knowing what you're looking for (times, dates, phone numbers etc) to get what you need. There is no need for a warrant for those willing to break ethical and legal lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's either they're all scared of IC because they all have counter-intel files or they don't want the fact that NSA collects everything be  reported on more than it already has.

       Nobody asked about Wikileaks revelation that CIA has tools to spoof hacks (which cyber experts have been saying all along); that if the CIA could do that, how can the IC be sure the DNC/Podesta hacks were done by the Russians?

       Rule of thumb: Don't trust anybody in government. The FBI/CIA probably has open counter-intel files on all of them, which means they're all blackmailable.

       So here is my question for you: Do you think Comey did not recommend prosecution against Hillary because he had to save his ass for this, more critical, moment that he and elements of the Trump campaign were anticipating?
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to believe he is a good guy, because if so he can be a valuable asset. You make a compelling argument, and I guess we will see soon.
