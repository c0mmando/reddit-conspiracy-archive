        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This isn&#39;t really a conspiracy theory, just something more of a mind-fuck. Every living human on this planet/world/reality is experiencing reality and the world through their eyes, their perspective. The common sense says that we exist because the world exist. But imo, the world exists because WE exist. I see the world through my eyes, and you do too and every person reading this. So when we die, the world dies with us. I know in actual reality, the world doesn&#39;t stop or end when one individual dies. But it does, in relation to that individual&#39;s perspective. When I die, there&#39;s no world anymore. Because the world and reality is being perceived by ME at this moment. Same goes for all of you. </p>

<p>This may sound stupid but it really fucks up my mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That could be explained with DMT. It&#39;s a drug but also something your mind generates when you are dreaming or having a near death experience or pronounced dead for some minutes.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t share the story because of how crazy it sounds. I mean you guys might believe it. But I&#39;m not sharing the story. I&#39;m scared it will get me offed somehow again. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, I believe there are several dimensions of the same person. And a death in one dimension transfers you to the consciousness of another. Like your not really awake in the other dimensions, just existing.</p>

<p>Or that if it&#39;s not your time to die but you are killed, something will be changed in your past so that you are not killed, but it will cause a butterfly affect or Mandela affect.</p>

<p>Things that I noticed that made me think I have been killed was a stark change after a day that something crazy happened. So something happened, I woke up I. A place with no recollection of about an 8 hour period, I was not on drugs but the situation I was in, I was likely to have been murdered.</p>

<p>The license plates in my state were different since that day. And I asked people about the &quot;old&quot; license plates and they tell me that they never existed. The reason why this is so glaring in my mind is when I went to pick out my new car, I actually compared license plates on the back of the car at the dealer ship. </p>

<p>But apparently those license plates never existed, ever.</p>

<p>And then two people who are close to me jobs have changed. one has a different job, and one the actual building that they go to is in a different city. Same job, the whole place is in a different location.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You never die you leave your body behind and shift conscienceness to another dimension and wake up there its seamless and you never suspect a thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have always wondered about this aspect of reality.  Suspected that maybe the world is just a huge simulation where everyone and everything is not real except you.  Like being born with VR gear on your whole life.  When your world ends, so does the rest of the simulation.</p>

<p>But have encountered bits and pieces of my world fragmented into different forms than before sometimes.  Like weird dejevue where some people and things in your life are slightly different than before.  Can remember events like when I was a Sophomore in highschool my girlfriend and I got into a t-bone car accident on the way to homecoming.  I was in the in the passenger seat when she turned left where a car was headed right at my door at around 55mph.  I remember the car spinning around like a top all over the intersection.  Somehow I escaped without a scratch.  No pain, cuts or anything.  The door was completely smashed inward about 3 feet.  I had leaned over toward the driver before impact.  Luckily, we were in a 1970&#39;s tank station wagon.  The weird part about all that is I don&#39;t remember the ambulance drivers talking to me or performing any standard tests on me or my girlfriend.  Remember seeing them put the other car&#39;s drivers in the ambulances.  We were driven to the dance in some other people&#39;s car who was there.  Can&#39;t recall where or who this person was or why they volunteered to drive us.  Dropped us off at the dance.  Don&#39;t think we ever mentioned it to our parents either for some reason.</p>

<p>Have had other event in my life where I thought I was having a panic attack or dying, but then waking up the next morning everything normal.  Will notice weird things like pictures on the wall hanging in different places than before or the green sweater my mom knitted me Christmas was now red. Could have sworn it was green.  My mom would confirm that no it was always red.  Don&#39;t think my wife and mom are pranking me.  Weird shit like that.</p>

<p>Kinda reminds me of the TNG episode where Worf is constantly shifting into different dimension timelines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>reminds me of a kerouac line:</p>

<p>&quot;the world didn&#39;t exist before I was born but it will exist after I die.&quot; or something like that.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re missing the existence of artifacts you create, be they physical or less tangible like memories in others or books you wrote, etc. Your &quot;perspective&quot;, albeit imperfectly as only you truly experience your &quot;perspective&quot;, then lives on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This dimension and the &quot;Astral Afterlife&quot; is connected to it are both Holographic Projections. Both exist inside a &quot;Matrix&quot;. The human body and everything around you are actually &quot;Holograms&quot;. The good news is that the expansion of &quot;Infinite Thought&quot; and the ability to actually &quot;Project/Manifest&quot; your own reality are incredible skills you have that are mostly dormant. But can and will be your salvation...</p>
