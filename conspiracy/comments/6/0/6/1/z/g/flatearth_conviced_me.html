<p>No, I&#39;m accusing you of promoting a troll sub :)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modest research can reveal that tides are not adequately explained by universal gravitation - and that the concept thereof is preposterous and completely unproven.</p>

<p>A little more in depth research will show you that all the astral phenomenon you spoke of and countless more are better explained by the flat earth model - and that the heliocentric model requires faith in abstractions and once again is not independently verifiable - hence revealing that it is not actual science.  You cannot execute the scientific method and end up with earth as a spinning ball.</p>

<p>Water droplets forming little balls has more to do with surface tension than the shape of the earth as well - hope this helps you with your research.</p>

<p>I thought that might be your answer, I seriously doubt you&#39;d even understand the principles behind it TBH. I did my research 20 years ago mate and no amount of shoddy youtube videos by people without a basic understanding of rudimentary astronomy or physics is going to change that now. The pre 16th century seafaring cultures had a better understanding of the planet than any flat earther as any cursory study of the Portolan maps of Piri Reis or Oranteus Finnaeus will confirm. Their maps were supposedly based on far older sources and contain reasonably accurate Latitude <em>and Longtitude</em> markings. You are literally being more uninformed than people from the Dark Ages.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a spinning, rotating earth  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like all the spherical rotating planets, several of which are easily visible to anyone with a decent telescope, like me?</p>

<p>FYI I was banned for asking a simple question not trolling, which confirms to me which one of us is a troll <em>on that sub</em>. I hope you get a good laugh out of making morons look moronic but it&#39;s not much of a challenge.  </p>

<p>The terrifying alternative is you actually believe this absolute brainless horseshit which just makes me a little sad that humanity has fallen so deep into idiocracy so soon.  </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t reply further, you lost before you even started typing.</p>

<p>First, I have to address that the two sentences you&#39;re trying to string together are separate ideas.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I think flat earth theory is ridiculous.</p></li>
<li><p>From a purely logical perspective, being fully convinced by one video of random quotes and no sources is a bit ridiculous.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Secondly, as it&#39;s by far accepted by science and even easily personally demonstrable, I&#39;d be far more interested in your specific reasons you think the flat earth is real.</p>

<p>because a theory is accepted by the community at large does not make it true. you are appealing to popular opinion, which is a logical fallacy.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>well, there are many reasons. For example, using today&#39;s high powered lasers and cameras you can do your own experiments to see that the supposed curvature that should be there based on the globe earth model is simply not there. </p>

<p>On a globe model, the Earth is said to curve 8 inches per mile. An average human standing at sea level could see only 3 miles before the earth curves away from their view.
the curve should be visible quite easily...but it is not.
There is no curve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should watch Bill Gaede&#39;s series &quot;Einstein&#39;s Idiots&quot;...it highlights the irrationality of modern science in relation to the nature of the universe. Modern scientists have substituted mathematics in place of physics in an attempt to validate their claims. </p>

<p>The problem with this is that mathematics is a DESCRIPTIVE language, not an EXPLANATORY one. There is a key distinction between describing something and explaining something. When you base your entire model of the universe on things that have not been thoroughly explained, you&#39;re doing a huge disservice to the field of science.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take gravity for example. Contemporary science uses Einstein&#39;s general relativity theory (a mathematical equation) to describe gravity, but no one has ever been able to actually explain how gravity exists. What properties of space and time allow them to be bent or curved by mass? Height? Width? Depth? Breadth? Neither space nor time possess any of these properties. Alternatively, how is mass able to bend or curve something that has no physical properties? </p>

<p>These elementary questions have still not been answered, yet contemporary science knows for sure gravity exists and governs the nature of our universe. Gravity is the pillar that props up the notion of the heliocentric model of the universe. Flat-earth proponents should not be attempting to get people to believe in flat earth. They should be attempting to get people to ask the right questions about the world around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re still presenting an irrational argument. How does gravity cause the frame dragging effect while simultaneously being a product of the curving of spacetime?</p>

<p>According to the theory of relativity, gravity is what we experience due to the curving of spacetime e.g. a &quot;product&quot; of curved spacetime. How then is gravity CAUSING the curving of spacetime? Are you insinuating that gravity is both the cause and effect of curved spacetime? That seems a bit irrational to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s where the misunderstanding is happening. Gravity <em>isn&#39;t</em> caused by the curvature of spacetime. Mass-energy is what causes the curvature of spacetime. The curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present in that bulk. </p>

<p>There are many relativistic theories of gravity and Einstein&#39;s is one of the simplest. Newton&#39;s original theory states that the partial double derivative in x and y of the gravitational potential is equal to to 4pi<em>G</em>mass. That however is not relativistic beacuse it is simply a simplification of general relativity. </p>

<p>So saying gravity is caused by the curvature of spacetime is wrong. Saying that the curvature of spacetime is caused by energy that permeates it is more correct (but not fully because one sentence doesn&#39;t describe the entire theory).</p>

<p>The frame dragging leads directly into the derivation of the Lorentz frame shifting and the gamma factor, which is used in different metrics to describe spacetime. </p>

<p>THere is no one particular spacetime metric since metrics are simply systems of measurement, like polar coordinates vs Cartesian coordinates. </p>
