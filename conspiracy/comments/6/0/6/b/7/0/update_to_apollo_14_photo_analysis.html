       Take a look at the flag at 23:58 in that
       <a href="https://youtu.be/awti0Di5OHE?t=23m56s">
        video from Apollo 14
       </a>
       that you linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flag starts waving BEFORE he moves. He is standing absolutely still for the picture, and the flag is completely still for a long time until suddenly unmotivated it moves.

       Nice find. I'm still trying to work out exactly how it was done, but I'd have to guess it involved some type of vacuum/chamber

       47:07 ship spins around three times then stops on a dime. So fake. In space it would just keep turning. No visible rocket boosters or anything forcing the spin to stop.

       Here's something to consider: Apollo 8 is claimed to be the first circumlunar voyage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was also the first manned Saturn V mission, the first time the Apollo spacecraft had been through the Van Allen belts and the first time any living thing had been sent through the Van Allen belts. Moreover, this was only the third Saturn V rocket launch - and the second Saturn V launch had severe problems with pogo vibration.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the Mercury program, which was to put man into Earth orbit, they used monkeys, dogs, etc... as test subjects first to see if it was safe for humans. Why didn't they do this for Apollo 8 - as the Van Allen belts and outside Earth's magnetosphere are immensely more dangerous than low-Earth orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, why didn't they send the Apollo spacecraft through the Van Allen belts before this point. How did NASA know that the spacecrafts computers would work after being sent through an area of such high electrical interference?

       There's some interesting takes on Space exploration in Conversation with Nostradamus (this excerpt is from Vol 1 page 141 - decoded 411):
      </p>
      <p>
       Nostradamus reported that many of the so-called "unmanned" flights actually contained astronauts who died or were lost in space during unsuccessful missions. These accidents were never made public for obvious reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       "He says that back in the early seventies when Russia and America were trying to outdo each other in regards to accomplishments
in space flights, particularly manned space flights, Russia embarked upon an ambitious project. They decided that since they had not been successful in having a manned flight to the moon, in the
process of trying to salve their hurt pride they reasoned that they
would do something better and not worry about the moon. They
attempted to send a manned flight to Venus. He says that when they did this, contact was broken for a period of time and the ship was presumed to be lost or destroyed. At the last minute, communication was reestablished just before the ship burned up in the atmosphere of Venus."
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the clues I've found so far - my hunch is there's far more and this stuff is just the tip of the iceberg. Trying to get to a place where I can dig into this stuff, but as I've mentioned several times my "domestic" situation is literally a nightmare right now. Thanks for the share though. I had heard rumors we possibly received help from the Roswell or other aliens with anti-radiation technology, but I've yet to even open that door of inquiry.
