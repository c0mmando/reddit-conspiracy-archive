       Edit: to be clear, flat-earthers believe the moon is simply going further away, so it should always be getting smaller because of perspective. Yet when it gets to the point where it should be at its smallest it can appear, from our perspective, to be at it's largest.

       Lol. I love me a good conspiracy so I dug deep into this one. Every one of it's "proofs" aren't proofs at all just logical fallacies, a lot of the evidence it uses to support it is speculation, and I keep coming up with my own "proofs" to debunk it by just observing the world around me.

       I've got a simple question for you. The theory of relativity posits that mass bends the "fabric" of spacetime, in turn producing "ripples" across the universe which we experience as gravitational waves. This "bending" of spacetime is also what causes astronomical bodies to orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what exactly are the properties of space and time that allow them to be bent by mass? Height? Width? Depth? Breadth? Alternatively, according to our laws of physics, how is mass able to bend or curve something that has no physical properties?

       The fact is, although we do have accurate methods of measuring relativity . (time, space , mass) it gets thrown out then window when quantum mechanics get involved. Even the act of measuring and quantifying (heh) attributes, has massive ramifications  and changes the very nature of what you're trying to do in the first place....

       I'm not a physicist, I couldn't tell you.  But I can tell you that I disagree with some of the theory of relativity.  And at the quantum level it just completely breaks down.  I think FTL travel is possible.  I think dark matter plays a bigger role in our univers than people think.

       Space-time is an all encompassing dimension, it is what mass exists in not an object in and of itself. To say mass has no affect on that in which it exists seems a little silly, even to a layman like me.

       You're absolutely correct. H, W, &amp; D are all physical properties, and both space and time lack these properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for mass to bend or curve space-time, there must be a precondition. Space and time must posses physical properties in order for them to be physically acted upon. I think we can both agree that neither space not time possess any physical properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your last two sentences are very interesting to me and I think they speak to the irrationality of some of contemporary sciences modern theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       You concede the point that space-time is not a physical object, yet inexplicably believe it can be physically affected by mass. That is very peculiar to me. It seems silly to you to believe mass has no effect on that in which it exists, but it is irrational to me to believe that space-time doesn't adhere to the laws of physics.

       I am no astrophysicist either, but what causes concern for me is that the individuals who are astrophysicists have no explanation for this either.

       If something as paramount as gravity cannot be adequately explained by asking elementary questions, is it rational to base the entire model of our universe on this?

       Would you say magnatism has physical properties?

       Space-time does adhere to the laws of physics because the concept of space-time was born of physics. Physical objects exist in space time.  Physics has to consider space-time because without it physics would not exist.

       Drewcifer419, we have not sufficiently resolved the issue of space-time, so it is irresponsible of us to attempt to shift the subject to magnetism. Once we resolve the issue of spacetime, I would be happy to discuss magnetism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to disagree with you here. I don't believe space-time was born of physics; if it were, there would be an adequate physics based explanation as to how mass bends or curves something that has no physical properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory of relativity espouses that space-time is a fabric e.g. a physical medium that can be acted upon. Now, what exactly is the fabric of space-time composed of? Space &amp; time? That would be a circular definition, and is not adequate in defining the composition of space-time. Is it composed of higgs boson particles? Gravitons? Dark matter? None of these entities have actually been observed in the real world and only exist in theory. The heliocentric model of the universe is utterly dependent on the theory of relativity, yet we are unable to adequately explain how exactly space-time is manipulated. That is something I unfortunately cannot overlook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure I understand your illustration. Regardless of the dynamics of the relationship between the paint and the canvas, it is unquestionable that the canvas has physical properties. It can be seen, felt, smelled, even tasted if you were so inclined to experience that. The canvas has length, width, height, texture, etc. all qualitative physical properties meaning it can be physically acted upon. These, nor any other physical properties, are not present in space-time, so it is irrational to say that it can be physically acted upon.

       There is a physics based explanation as to why matter bends space-time. Are you a physicist? Because I am certainly not. And I don't think either of us would be able to understand the complex mathematics that make up that explanation.

       That's the thing. Mathematics, no matter how complex and esoteric, doesn't EXPLAIN things. By it's very nature, it can't because it's a descriptive language. There is a key distinction between describing something and explaining something.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need mathematics to explain gene mutation or photosynthesis or electromagnetic induction. Each are complex linear processes that can be easily explained using real world terms. These are physics based explanations with no need for complex mathematical formulas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why you keep mention us being lied to. I never even alluded to the notion of us being lied to, you introduced that into the discussion. All I'm doing is scrutinizing the information we've been given and critically assessing its validity. I for one can't accept the notion that something as important as the nature of our universe can only be understood by a select group of people in an esoteric language they created (because mathematics is a language), but you've made it apparent that you can accept that. I respect your rights to have faith in your belief system, and as long as you are happy in your beliefs that's all that matters.

       that's not even the question to be asking, the real question is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the earth is traveling through space, via our own solar system, and as we're told we're expanding outwards as is all things in the universe, how would it or could it be possible that the stars are in the exact same spots, that they haven't fluctuated or moved from each other?
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramids of Giza is the best example, still to this day they line up perfectly with Orion, if everything is traveling through space, subject to gravity and 'random' events in space, then how did something humans supposedly built around 2589 and 2504 BC, still show alignment with stars that are 240-1300 light years away?

       To me it doesn't make sense, change in constelations/stars may not be visible in a human lifetime, but from 2500 BC till now, 2017, and no visible change?

       Almost all the stars we see with the naked eye are within our own galaxy. The expansion of the universe doesn't affect the position of stars being affected by the gravity within our galaxy.

       which again, doesn't explain things. How is it they're still in position, even if they're within our own galaxy and traveling at the same speed? Do objects in space not interact with each other? does gravity not pull to large objects together, how is it that everything is seemingly frozen in place by gravity, yet at the same time being pulled together under gravity? The more I think about it, the more I research it the more it makes less and less sense.

       Of course they do, that's exactly why they act in such a predictable way.

      <p>
       They're not really static in space. They're moving as they're affected by gravity of other objects and the Milky Way itself. It's only from out perspective that they seem so static and frozen in place.

       Whoa whoa, we freaking revolve around the center of the galaxy every 230 million years? That actually seems short, that means the dinosaurs were in a completely different part of the galaxy. Strange to think about it. If we had time machines we would have to account for galactic positioning of our star to reach our planet maybe?

       I've realized that contemporary science doesn't really explain a lot about the universe. Check out Bill Gaede's YouTube series, Einstein's Idiots. You'll realize that some of the most elementary inquiries into modern science cause many of it's foundational theories to fall apart.

       The universe is billons of years old, plenty of time for some galaxies to become stable and relatively predictable.  Our galaxy has had plenty of time to stabalize.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at modern astronomy, they've found forming galaxies, solar systems, and planets that are not yet stable, and are unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, light travels an unimaginable distance to get to us so events may have already occured that we didn't expect but, we can't measure them yet because the light hasn't reached us.

       I'm pretty sure the holes in the pyramids match up to where the stars would have been when built, but to get them to line up modern astronomers had to calculate where there stars wpuld uave been back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is to say, as far as I'm aware, they don't line up today. Because of the precession of the earth.  Which debunks flat-earth.

       From what I understand differences apparent size of the moon come down almost entirely to miscalculations based on the functioning of our visual system. When the moon is low on the horizon it is visually near to distant/ large objects so our brain tells us it must be big. In the expanse of the sky it is just a light in darkness. Not sure but I also seem to remember hearing that our brains have a bias to perceive red/ orange things as closer than blue/ white things. I think if you use some kind of consistent measurement from the ground you would find little if any change

       The moon is also not in a perfect orbit, so at times it is indeed closer to the earth than at others.  And depending on atmospheric conditions, it can appear larger on the horizon at times as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides any of that, if the earth were flat and the moon (or sun) were simply going away from us, it would be getting smaller until we couldn't see it, not just dip below the horizon.

       Exactly my point. Flat-earthers say the moon only looks like it's drpping below the horizon because of perspective. But if that were the case the moon would shrink away, not look larger from our "perspective."

       Except that the moon being larger on the horizon is simply an optical illusion.  Measuring the diameter with a camera is easy enough and demonstrates that it's effectively the same size whether it's above or on the horizon.
