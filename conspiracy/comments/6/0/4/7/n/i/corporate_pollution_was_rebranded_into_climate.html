    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent the last few years saying exactly this to anyone who will listen.  Global warming is a red herring designed to distract from large scale, industrial pollution.  Both sides of the debate are controlled: the pro-camp seeks cap &amp; trade policies which are massive corporate giveaways to the worst systemic polluters as well as Wall Street trading firms.  The anti-camp wants to limit public scrutiny of dirty corporate practices so they can continue to degrade the environment in their search for profits.  </p>

<p>Please join me over on <a href="/r/NoCorporations">/r/NoCorporations</a> to discuss these and other issues, a sub dedicated to raising awareness of corporate malfeasance, and exploring the systemic impacts corporations have on human health, the environment, our culture, and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corporations probably have some kind of place. But their role and power needs to be greatly diminished. I think cooperatives are a good business model that should be encouraged. There are actually quite a few huge successful ones. I believe there is a conspiracy to never mention them as it is a real danger to the powers that be, power. </p>

<p>Look at the greenbay packers as an example. Their ownership style works. Keeps them generally decent. Has kept them where they belong, etc. That ownership style has been banned now. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re half right - there&#39;s a massive market being created in climate change management i.e. adaptation, right now. But that doesn&#39;t make climate change any less real.

    <div class="md"><p>It does, though. Getting a million cars off the road by increasing use of public transit, bicycles, and pedestrian paths requires changing the behavior of a million people on an individual level and it can have a profound effect on a city&#39;s air quality, for example. Individual behavior writ large determines buying trends which dictate the behavior of markets, etc. Our actions are not without consequences in the bigger picture; we can choose to buy fuel-efficient vehicles from more environmentally friendly companies when we need vehicles, use and support public transit, etc... or we can add smokestacks to our trucks and roll coal.

    <div class="md"><p>No. When they are talking about &quot;climate change&quot; they are specifically talking about the climate change from chemicals like CO2 (Methane, etc.) which trap heat in the atmosphere. This is an inherently difficult subject. If you BURN something to create energy that people can use, the BEST possible outcome is CO2 + H2O. Pollution is almost anything else, even in the &quot;cleanest&quot; forms CO, O3 etc. which naturally occur in the same reactions (Hydrocarbon + heat &gt; H2O + CO2 + CO + O2...). Saying that increasing CO2 emissions is problematic gets basically everyone, who understands chemistry and wants to make money off of burning stuff, upset (that&#39;s a LOT of people, maybe enough to even deny science).<br/>
Unfortunately, CO2 does not have a BORDER WALL, CO2 does not pay tariffs, neither do rising sea levels, so the CO2 made elsewhere just goes wherever the fuck it wants (although America, and products produced for America, creates the vast majority of it), so, no country by itself can control it. And there&#39;s no good free market benefit to removing it from our atmosphere, so it&#39;s only going to keep getting worse until people start having to wear personal protective gear to combat it (or some larger industrial problem that I&#39;m unintentionally neglecting), or a world government with real power is introduced, or the price of CO2 goes up enough so that people start farming it from the atmosphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! Climate change is just a product of the problem which is air pollution. Not enough people take &quot;climate change&quot; and &quot;global warming&quot; seriously. There&#39;s too much room for argument about the earth being &quot;still cold in some places so global warming can&#39;t be true&quot;,  and &quot;climate change has always happened.&quot; You will never change the minds of the people who think that way.</p>

<p>But is we simply rephrase and say air pollution is THE problem, I think people would take it more serious and understand it better. How can you deny it when some cities I  China basically shut down at times when pollution is too bad and in most urban cities all over the world you can see a layer of smog. </p>
