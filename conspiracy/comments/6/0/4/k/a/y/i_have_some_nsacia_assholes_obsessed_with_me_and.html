<p>Yeah, well I have some assholes like that in my life, but they&#39;re cia/nsa scumbags, and they won&#39;t leave me the fuck alone. I&#39;m going to leave the USA to try to escape their creepy stalker line of sight, or whatever.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not mental issues, yes, it&#39;s real, and super annoying. No the cops and fbi won&#39;t do a fucking thing. I just wish my god damn passport would get here already so that I could leave and hopefully get the fuck off of this continent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure it happens, and is very difficult to talk about because of the craziness of their methods(by design).</p>

<p>But most of the people I see online claiming this kind of harassment aren&#39;t trying to rationalize the weirdness and make huge jumps to even weirder conclusions. Often violently so.</p>

<p>It can never be dismissed, because gang stalking is real, and is designed to make the stalked feel alone or insane.</p>

<p>But I think the 2-3 people posting lately, claiming to be gang stalked, might just be paranoid.</p>

<p>There is the real problem. This guy feels the failings in his life can&#39;t be his own fault, so he has concocted and entire CIA conspiracy to explain them.</p>

<p>The problem is he has threatened violence because of his delusions.</p>

<p>This is exactly the kind of guy that gets a gun and goes on a killing spree. We should <em>not</em> be encouraging him.</p>

What makes you think your passport will be given to you?  Even if you left the country, if they are dedicating manpower to harass you here, they will harass you anywhere.</p>

<p>The only way to deal with this gang stalking is to confront your gang stalkers on a personal level (non-violent, well tempered).</p>

<p>Watch this - it will make you feel better, shows you aren&#39;t alone, and offers some solutions: <a href="https://youtu.be/jNjTG9g1fWU">https://youtu.be/jNjTG9g1fWU</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>about mid 2015, it started with these simple minded, loser pricks making terrorist-related comment replies to me on reddit and at the time voat.co (I visited that site for a while at launch.)</p>

<p>Everything got worse from there. They&#39;ve destroyed my life, on purpose. They&#39;ve tried to kill me, seriously. They kept failing, as they&#39;re failures in life. See, someone can be in the cia, or whatever, not because they are &quot;the best&quot;, but because daddy or brother worked there first, I figure.</p>

<p>They can make the &quot;clicks&quot; (magnetic waves moving metal against a surface to make a tap sound) anywhere. Any cars, any houses, all over the USA. It&#39;s impressive, kind of, but pointlessly used on me. See, they have a bloated budget, and loser mother fuckers working for them, and a few of these pathetic scum, who are ruining the New United States, have become obsessed with me, for some reason. </p>

<p>Eh, maybe they want my cock? Maybe they&#39;re aliens, who want my juicy human cock. Eh, I&#39;m just fucking around now and blowing off steam. It&#39;s just so god damn frustrating.</p>

<p>I&#39;m literally leaving my wife of 16 years, taking my dog, and moving to a new continent and having to learn a new language and culture at the age of thirty-fucking-five, because of these inept pricks.</p>

<p>They&#39;re all out to get him for no reason whatsoever, but this guy is not suffering from paranoid delusions because he says so!</p>

<p>And if he has to kill some people to prove it, he seems perfectly willing to do so.</p>

<p>It seems to me this guy will be on the news soon enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You probably shouldn&#39;t say that, considering OP said he was going to kill whoever is responsible. I admit I used to enjoy reading these posts because I do feel it&#39;s possible that not all mental illness is in fact mental illness - but once OP started talking about killing shit got too real. </p>

<p>Because of the frequencies of his postings across multiple accounts, and the rising urgency of them, this feels like a either a bored and dedicated LARPer, or a setup to see if conspiracy theorists on Reddit will egg on the next mass shooter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry OP, I liked listening to your story and thought about it from time to time but this rise in violent thoughts on your part is extremely concerning. Let&#39;s say you ARE being gangstalked for the sake of things...that doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t end up killing innocent people who you THINK are responsible. If they are so good at what they do, don&#39;t you think they would be good at framing people as well? Don&#39;t these people sound like people who, oh I don&#39;t know, want you to go insane and kill people?   I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s mental illness or gangstalking by the CIA....please, just don&#39;t harm anybody.</p>
