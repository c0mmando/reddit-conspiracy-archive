       The following is an excerpt from my latest project, part 2 of my skeptic's guide to vaccines. The citations here are from published scientific articles:
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most dangerous aspects about the pertussis vaccine (and most other vaccines) is that it's causing the pathogen to
       <em>
        evolve
       </em>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23406868">
        Pertussis resurgence: waning immunity and pathogen adaptation - two sides of the same coin.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        However, significant changes in B. pertussis populations have been observed after the introduction of vaccinations, suggesting a role for pathogen adaptation in the persistence and resurgence of pertussis. These changes include antigenic divergence with vaccine strains and increased production of pertussis toxin.
       </p>
       <p>
        We propose these adaptations of B. pertussis have decreased the period in which pertussis vaccines are effective and thus enhanced the waning of immunity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Pertussis vaccine failures are due to
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22529282">
        genetic changes in pertussis strains and poor efficacy
       </a>
       , not because too many people are unvaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the acellular pertussis vaccine (DtaP) replaced the whole cell pertussis vaccines (DTP) in the 1990s, the World Health Organization created an official standard method to define cases of pertussis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new definition was excessively restrictive, requiring laboratory confirmation and at least 21 days of paroxysmal cough. As a result, legitimate cases of pertussis were eliminated and the efficacy of the vaccine was artificially inflated.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003418">
         The universal use of pertussis vaccines has been associated with genetic changes
        </a>
        in circulating B. pertussis strains...with DTaP vaccines, genetic change should be a major concern regarding vaccine efficacy.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The fact that populations of B. pertussis may have evolved to circumvent the immune responses elicited by vaccination and to alter their virulence levels raises a number of questions concerning the design and use of future vaccines.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not only is the pertussis vaccine ineffective and dangerous, it's contributing to strain replacement: Other pertussis-causing pathogens are filling the void left by the strain targeted by the vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccine science is flawed, and the pertussis vaccine is absolutely no exception.

       If you take L-Lysine at the start of a chicken pox or shingles infection, you will stop it in its tracks. But big pharma does not want people knowing that their vaccines are not necessary.

       Vaccinating everyone causes a different reaction. It becomes an evolutionary pressure that forces viruses to evolve.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Pertussis, there is a related pathogen that causes the same condition (whooping cough) that not only is not prevented by the vaccine, but is made worse by the vaccine. You actually become
       <em>
        more

       likely to suffer severe consequences from B. Parapertussis if you have been vaccinated against B. Pertussis.

       Vaccines aren't the same as antibiotics. Viruses should, whenever possible be totally eradicated ala smallpox. That will only happen with widespread use. Ring vaccination and the like you speak of during outbreaks wouldn't work.

       Then why have vaccines eradicated things like smallpox? The problem is people in third world countries have been refusing vaccines which allows for the viruses to exist in the wild. If there is a concerted worldwide effort to eradicate a virus, then you can end them, like smallpox

       It isn't the same, a bacteria and an virus are totally different and don't become virulent the same way. Antibiotic resistance is caused by improper use of antibiotics, such as not finishing an entire course of them.

       While you are right about antibiotic resistance, the use of vaccines still changes the ecosystem. It leaves open space available for more lethal versions of the virus, not covered by the vaccine, to proliferate. And that is exactly what we are seeing with pertussis.
      </p>
      <p>
       You end up with "superbugs" because you killed off the one strain keeping the more vicious ones in check.

       Pertussis is a bacteria, first off. Second, because it is a particularly contagious disease that is endemic to many other parts of the world it is unlikely that without a large scale effort to vaccinate the entire population of the planet in a quick fashion you would likely lose the resistance garnered from a vaccinate for pertussis because it before everyone could be inoculated-- so it isn't feasible.
      </p>
      <p>
       However you do not even have to give your baby a pertussis vaccine because you can get it yourself, a full grown person in your third trimester and pass on the antibodies to your child in the same way the rest of your antibodies are passed on.

       While all vaccines do cause an ecological gap, that is filled by other bacteria (this is well know and studied science, btw) not all of the gaps left are filled with more vicious organisms. It depends on a number of factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with pertussis, that is exactly what the US is facing right now. People within the scientific community are coming forward with regards to the pertussis vaccine specifically. And no one is claiming pertussis is a virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, obviously the concern is with babies and young children. No one is sayjng that is not the focus in vaccinating for pertussis. Problem is, more and more healthy children are dying of pertussis because they are contracting the more lethal strain that is not covered by the vaccine. And cases of the more vicious pertussis is growing in the US because of the pertussis vaccine. To fix this issue, either they need to develop a vaccine that includes the other strain (because the even less prevalent strains outside of the two top strains are not any more dangerous than the most predominant strain that we have the vaccine for), or they need to stop the current vaccine as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because we have modern medicine now does not mean it cannot be made better. If we refuse to recognize problems within our current system, meds and vaccines, we will never advance as a society. This should be common sense.

       I mean, they're literally different. Like polio is an enterovirus and Guillain-Barre is generally caused by infections. Polio has different serotypes within enterovirus as well, something Guillain-Barre isn't even considered a part of.

       GBS and AFP have been documented to be caused by vaccinations. Fucking with the immune system isn't inherently wrong. It isn't inherently right either. It's experimental and it should be branded as such.

       GBS isn't that poorly understood. What GBS attacks is widely known, that is why it has 4 subtypes. Nearly 75% of GBS is caused by a respiratory infection or some sort of gastrointestinal caused by c. jejuni bacteria.

       AFP isn't only seen with GBS and Polio though. It is a symptom, and it is only considered Acute Flaccid Paralysis when it is, obviously acute, so it can come on slowly as well.

       That doesn't make vaccines inherently bad. The risk of getting vaccinated is generally considered to be less than the disease that that they inoculate against though. By that logic you would also be against Aspirin because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, or going into a warzone without being vaccinated for small pox or anthrax. The risks are seen as less than the actual thing it treats. No one claims vaccines are 100% safe.

      <p>
       I suppose that is true, but by that token are you also against the use of things to boost one's immune system? What about something like guaifenesin that works as an expectorant and treats chest congestion?
      </p>
      <p>
       All you are really doing is giving your immune system something it can use to develop antibodies on its own either by exposing it to a dead version of the pathogen or an attenuated one. Vaccination in and of itself isn't what I would see as the issue. Perhaps what is contained in a vaccine, but I don't know of any ingredients off the top of my head that have been identified to cause GBS for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you feel similar if we were to return to using serum-based vaccines? What if we were using pox from cowpox to vaccinate for smallpox still?

       It depends on the type of virus.  Pertussis is similar to the flu virus in that it mutates very quickly.  That is why influenza is probably the most successful virus of all time, it mutates so quickly that it will likely never be eradicated.  The truth is we are having pertussis outbreaks all the time in almost entirely vaccinated populations, but they don't make the news, the only outbreaks that make the news are the ones that infect a higher than usual amount of unvaccinated.  It would be extremely hard to eliminate the wild population of pertussis, but the first step would be to demand a more effective vaccine from manufacturers.

       Anecdotes dont mean much. The fact remains that scientific study on dtap shows that it is highly ineffective, doesnt address the mutating nature of pertussis, and is associated with ahigh degree of adverse events. The solution isnt to stop vaccinating, its to force the manufacturer to formulate something better. People have developed a docile, complacent stance towards vaccines in spite of the science; which is great for the manufacturers because it means they dont have to invest in r&amp;d.

       Excellent job explaining the difference between being anti-vax and those who question the safety measures being taken by the big pharmaceutical companies. Of course medicine always has side effects. However when everyone is forced to get the same injections, it should be a top priority among medical professionals to make sure that they are safe for EVERYONE who receives them, not just the majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have to pay millions and millions out to families because you forced them to get a vaccine and that vaccine caused permanent damage to them, the situation needs to be reevaluated and a lot of money needs to go towards research that aims to: 
A. Confirm all ingredients are safe and of quality.
B. Justify that the only reason that a company would have for using an ingredient that turns out to cause any amount of harm isn't just because it is the cheapest option. 
C. Look into the possibility that not everyone's body is capable of handling a vaccine, and confirm that those individuals or their parents know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       People aren't labeled crazy when they question a certain medication's safety, it's bizarre to me why people would do this to those who ask the same questions about vaccines.

       Problem is that child likely contracted the other, more lethal predominant strain of pertussis. That's what they don't tell people. The vaccine covers the non lethal to healthy persons pertussis. This leaves the vaccinated child open to the more lethal one, the one that causes serious damage that lasts years. The vaccine would not have helped that child.

       You shouldn't always place your trust in doctors.  Always get a second or third opinion if something doesn't feel right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a documentary that I watched about kids getting over-medicated.  One kid stood out because he was a rambunctious youth with clueless parents.  The doctor prescribed something to calm him down because the parents didn't know how to handle him.  This caused side effects, so they needed more medication to handle the side effects.  And that caused more, needing more to correct it.  The parents absolutely loved their child, they just didn't know what they were doing to they trusted their doctor.  I think they finally took the kid off of medication in his teens, but by then his development was pretty messed up.  I felt really sorry for the kid because he seemed to develop quite a few problems from the medication, and I felt sorry for the parents because they didn't realize the damage they had done to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I'm firmly on the side of vaccines being good for the population.

       What I really don't believe in is all of this mental/behavioral health stuff and the medical cocktails used to diagnose and treat them. Depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADD, etc. I do believe in various levels of those "discriptors' but not the blase' way things are thrown around, nor the medical cocktails to treat them. How often can we go to the front page of this very site and see people moaning about depression. Here's a cure: Turn off all of your screens, go outside, and do something physical..regularly.

       I would never put my kids on all the shit doctors hand out for that stuff.

       Vaccines, IMO, save lives and is a completely different argument than all of this "big bad pharma" stuff.

       People turn to pills for an easy fix, not realizing that simply getting a better diet and engaging in the world around them can help tremendously.  As you said, going outside and getting regular physical activity can be beneficial to the average person.  Personally I've been curious about whether or not there's a behavioral component to the bacteria in our intestines, changing how we think and act by releasing chemicals and such to encourage/discourage us from ingesting certain foods.

       I am a firm believer in that. Science has yet to fully figure out the correlation, but it exists. I've had gastrointestinal before. That system in the body is a very fickle thing. Think about it though; we can't really feed billions of people all of the best, nutritious food. That's why everything contains simple carbohydrates, fats and corn. I mean we could feed them, potentially, but not the way things are currently set up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, consider what humans are instinctually designed to do. It's not to sit in an office building all day, then go home to park ourselves in front of another screen. At some point, people start feeling goofy and can't explain why. Mental health professionals will  assure us that it's an inherent "chemical imbalance" that one just either has or doesn't--then proceeds to hand out pills, most often making things worse.

       Well, chemical depression is usually caused by bad bacteria in the intestines which break down the body's ability to turn l-tryptophan into 5HTP, which then turns into serotonin.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can bandaid the depression by just taking 5HTP. Or you can fix the gut and move out of depression.

       Well, big pharma that we know is intentionally making money off of not treating illness but masking symptoms and putting people on unnecessary drugs. These same people make vaccines and I am not inclined to think that the same company doing nefarious acts in one end, is not doing them in their other profit maker (vaccines).

       Have you ever asked a doctor if they know for certain what is inside the vaccine they are injecting you with? All you will get is a blank stare because there is no answer. The doctor takes it out of the package and sticks you with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doctors are merely conduits of Big Pharma. They perscribe what they are told to perscribe and stop prescribing what they are told to stop. Many have spent their entire lives in school, never holding a job before becomming a doctor. All they know is to put blind faith into institutions they serve. In reality, they know less about medicine than the average person who is willing to keep an open mind, research and question everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason this is such a hard conspiracy to get behind is because it is scary for many to consider the possibility that blindly trusting doctos may not be such a good idea.

       Does anyone ever conside that the sheer amount of vaccines may be the problem? At what point is it too much foreign material to introduce into the body of a young person? Right now we are at 50 vaccinations before age six. Would 100 be too much? 300? 1000?

       Me too, because I'm not a scientist, nor a doctor. Unsure why you'd expect people to be able to effectively decipher all of that. Again, I'll trust scientists to do this. This is quite different that placing an inherent trust in the media, for example, to disseminate valid information.

       My daughter got her first DTaP  at 6 months old (delayed due to insurance reasons). It almost killed her. The doctor offered no explanation to the severe adverse reaction. Months later, other vaccinations did not affect her in the same way. I moved to Texas several years later, and had to explain things to her new doctor. He told me that if she was exposed to the Whooping Cough virus, whether she got it or not, that the vaccine would be more likely to cause adverse events. I had never even heard that before (and have done extensive research).

       It's very possible that your daughter is seronegative to one or more of the viruses in the vaccine. Seronegative means that the person lacks the gene needed to create the antibody to fight the virus. Essentially, the vaccine will give the person the disease without being able to have the proper immune response. I would ask your doctor if this could be the case for your daughter. My daughter and I are seronegative to chickenpox, shingles and mono.

       Great post, and all very true. Also, even if vaccinated, you can still get pertussis, but you just won't have as severe symptoms. So people are walking around spreading pertussis to vulnerable populations, because they don't even know to stay away from them because they're sick. Which can actually make the recommendation of "condoning" (where they recommend parents and family members of a new baby do) very dangerous. Since you can still be infected despite vaccination, that's also why pertussis will never be eliminated by vaccination. In nearly all the recent outbreaks in schools, over 90 percent of the kids that got infected were fully vaccinated.

       Well, the current vaccination does not cover all predominant types of pertussis, only one strain. This is causing a boom in a more lethal strain of pertussis which is not covered by the vaccine.

       One of the comments on the post read as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Like these people read just a small amount of info then stopped and never again researched the subject."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I find it funny that someone who has likely done little or no research into the issue is criticizing people for doing little or no research. Anyone who has actually taken the time to research vaccines will tell you that there's A LOT of conflicting information coming from medical professionals. I'm not just talking about that one guy who faked his studies. I'm talking about conflicting statements like "Oh there's no mercury in vaccines. There's Thermerisol." "Oh the amount of Thermerisol in the vaccines is "deemed safe" yet here's a study showing that the PPM considered dangerous is above the PPM found in the vaccines."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the whole "Herd Immunity" belief. Then there are mothers autistically screeching over the internet about how these diseases just wait in the air to infect you, then your non-vaccinated kids endanger their vaccinated kids. Like many have mentioned before, where do you think the Pertussis the kid got came from? Oh, you know, someone exposed to a vaccinated child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccinated children shed live viral cells after vaccination (In the case of the MMR vaccine) which causes non-vaccinated children to catch Measles, Mumps, or Rubella. Pertussis is the same way, except the vaccine masks the symptoms. So someone thinks they have a simple cold or malaise when they actually have Pertussis, because the vaccine masks the symptoms. They handle their kid, niece or nephew as a baby and boom.
      </p>
      <p>
       These diseases don't just wait in the wings like batman to infect those succulent, vulnerable unvaccinated children. When you study outbreaks of diseases we vaccinate for, almost always, the origin of the outbreak was contact with a vaccinated child by an unvaccinated child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another topic is the effectiveness of memory b cells when they are produced by an artificial immune response (vaccine) versus a live immun response (live virus). The vaccine-stimulated immune response has a lower lifetime than a live immune response.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again, I find it ironic that those who do no research and just take a doctors word for it will fault others who have come to different conclusions based on their own research. Passive-aggressive responses like "You know, because they are smarter than a doctor" really don't help. Doctors are wrong. A lot. Not to mention, pediatricians and general practitioners are sort of the bottom of the medical barrel. Granted, they know a great deal more about medicine than the common person. However, they don't know everything, and they often have to refer patients out to specialists who actually know what they're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole "Don't be stupid and do the right thing" appeal to emotion is fallacious, and is only a tool to try and shame parents into making decisions that they may disagree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree with that at all.

       I got the whooping cough last year from a kid that had been vaccinated, and she gave it to me and at least 3 kids that I know of. One of them had it for months and months.
      </p>
      <p>
       This vaccine is really nasty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution is simple. Mega dose Vitamin C. Don't take this particular vaccine. Don't give it to children. It may be a bad vacc, or it may be that there are just some bad batches but either way it's completely unneeded anyway, when the solution is Vitamin C.

       There are many 'mainstream' beliefs that are shoved in our faces day in and day out through different sources of videos, media and culture. Its no different than any status quo and vaccines to me stand out loud and clear that they are certainlly hiding something about them through the amount of controversy behind them. And the simple fact if you speak up about not trusting these companies 100% you are suddenly hit with a 'label' like 'anti vaxxer' and everyone looks at you like you're an idiot. You're not allowed to have a different opinion and that to me is a massive red flag and a dead give away that this science is bunch of bullshit.

       Thank you!

       The pertussis vaccine is one that it known to be bad for society collectively. There is biodiversity within all of these strains. Pertussis has two predominant strains; one is not considered lethal to healthy individuals. The other is considered deadly to both sick and healthy persons as well. Guess which one they have the vaccine for.... the non-lethal one.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you reduce the amount of one strain within an ecosystem, another takes its place, becoming more prevalent.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why we are seeing a rise in deaths from pertussis. The news usually fails to mention that the outbreak involved mostly vaccinated children. And that they died from the pertussis strain NOT covered by the vaccine. The worst part is that they use this as a scare tactic to get people to vaccinate more.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you eradicate one organism from an ecosystem, it simply leaves room for another thing to grow in its place.

       Doing gods work. Vaccines are one of the most effective branches of the eugenics movement and medical industrial complex. For everyone saying this doesn't matter because they don't want their kid getting sick I'll remind you that children eaten by bears have 100% immunity to all disease and even aging. Being eaten by a bear is a medical miracle and you're an idiot if you don't feed your children to bears. Unless feeding your kids to bears is harmful but I haven't seen a study saying it is.

       And it doesn't concern you that the widespread vaccination of healthy kids might actually be leading to Pertussis becoming
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       deadly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines as a form of infection control can work wonders. Vaccinating those people around an outbreak can stop the spread of the disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccinating everyone causes a different reaction. It becomes an evolutionary pressure that forces viruses to evolve.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Pertussis, there is a related pathogen that causes the same condition (whooping cough) that not only is not prevented by the vaccine, but is made worse by the vaccine. You actually become
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       likely to suffer severe consequences from B. Parapertussis if you have been vaccinated against B. Pertussis.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how the overuse of antibiotics has lead to "superbugs" that are resistant to antibiotics? It's the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Used sparingly and where needed, vaccination is a godsend. Overused for profit, it could actually be the death of us.

       Anecdotes dont mean much. The fact remains that scientific study on dtap shows that it is highly ineffective, doesnt address the mutating nature of pertussis, and is associated with ahigh degree of adverse events. The solution isnt to stop vaccinating, its to force the manufacturer to formulate something better. People have developed a docile, complacent stance towards vaccines in spite of the science; which is great for the manufacturers because it means they dont have to invest in r&amp;d.

       Problem is that child likely contracted the other, more lethal predominant strain of pertussis. That's what they don't tell people. The vaccine covers the non lethal to healthy persons pertussis. This leaves the vaccinated child open to the more lethal one, the one that causes serious damage that lasts years. The vaccine would not have helped that child.

       If you take L-Lysine at the start of a chicken pox or shingles infection, you will stop it in its tracks. But big pharma does not want people knowing that their vaccines are not necessary.
