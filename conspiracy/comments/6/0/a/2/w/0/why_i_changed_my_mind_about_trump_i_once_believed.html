        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Remember when Trump said he wasn&#39;t going to take a salary? He just accepted his second paycheck.</p>

<p>Remember when he said Mexico was going to pay for the wall? He has asked Congress to appropriate the $25 billion of taxpayer money to cover costs.</p>

<p>Remember when he said he wasn&#39;t going to go on vacation or play golf? 5 of the last 7 weekends he went on vacation and played golf, costing taxpayers $11.1 million.</p>

<p>Remember when he said he was going to use American steel to build these dangerous pipelines? Russian steel arrived last week for the Keystone Pipeline XL.</p>

<p>Remember when he said he wasn&#39;t going to cut social security and Medicare? The Republican bill does just this.</p>

<p>Remember when he said that nobody on his campaign had any communications with the Russian government? 7 of his people have now admitted they spoke and/or met with Russian officials, after they lied and got caught.</p>

<p>Remember when he said he was going to divest from his businesses? He changed his mind.</p>

<p>Remember when he said he was going to release his tax returns? He changed his mind.</p>

<p>Remember when he said he was going to drain the swamp of Washington insiders? His cabinet is filled with lobbyists, oil and Wall Street executives.</p>

<p>Remember when he said would defeat ISIS in 30 days? He doesn&#39;t have a plan. But his administration just mistakenly bombed a mosque in Syria killing 57 innocent people who were in the act of peacefully praying instead of the intended target. Not to mention the botched raid that killed a serviceman and little children he ordered and didn&#39;t even have the respect to disrupt his dinner to oversee.</p>

<p>Remember when he said that the Obamacare replacement would cover more people at lower cost? The AHCA that the GOP and 45 are now pushing; they now admit will cover fewer people at a higher cost.</p>

<p>Refutation:</p>

<p>Legally he has to accept the salary, why didn&#39;t OP explain this?  Perhaps OP doesn&#39;t know or perhaps OP doesn&#39;t care.</p>

<p>The fact that no accountability has been set up to prove that he is donating his salary is an absurd argument because there is zero precidence for there to be an accountability report on donating the presidential salary.</p>

<p>IMHO this is just more MSM spin doctoring anything and everything they can to paint Trump in a bad light.</p>

<p>The anti-trump people are going to spin everything Trump does in a negative way.  And the pro Trump people inversely will spin everything in a positive way.</p>

<p>The truth lay somewhere in the middle.  The article I posted shows that Trump is doing a working vacation. Which isn&#39;t the worst way to get rid of the boring stately arrangements of the past.  But it does contradict his statements during the campaign.  One has to decide for themselves how they feel about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>American Steel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The presidential directive requires &quot;all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States, including portions of pipelines, use materials and equipment produced in the United States, to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/keystone-pipeline-american-steel-trumps-repeated-promises/story%3Fid%3D45898255">https://www.google.com/amp/abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/keystone-pipeline-american-steel-trumps-repeated-promises/story%3Fid%3D45898255</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The way that executive order is written … it’s specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired. And since this one is already currently under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, it would be hard to go back,&quot; White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters aboard Air Force One. &quot;But I know that everything moving forward would fall under that executive order.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So while Trump&#39;s rhetoric is exaggerated, his executive order is clear and sets the stage for all future purchases of steel in relation to these pipelines to be American steel while simultaneously allowing these companies to use the steel they have already purchased.</p>

<p>When you really start to look into this propaganda you can see the spin jobs come into focus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. The list has some valid points. I was never a Trump fan. But I REALLY did not want Hillary to win. Currently, I am still happy with the results of the election, under the premise it had to be one of the two. </p>

<p>But Trump supporters really need to wake up. You have to hold your chosen politician accountable. The list OP posted, regardless if OP is a shill or not, is something to take seriously. At this point, it&#39;s starting to look like many Trump supporters are hitting the koolaid as hard as Obama supporters were his first campaign. These politicians cannot hold godlike status. They are human. They will make mistakes. They will be wrong. But they need to be held accountable by their own supporters too for any good to result. </p>

<p>We need to stop with this us Vs. them mentality.  It&#39;s become so strong it is making us blind to reality. </p>

<p>And honestly, no true r/conspiracy subscriber should be blindly loving a politician or govt branch. That just makes no sense. I thought our tin foil hats prevented such a thing. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any confidence in this economy is founded on unstable ground.  Seriously, it could not be more clear.  People are throwing their money in the stock market because trump promised to slash corporate taxes.  This will result in corporations posting record profits in the coming quarters.  But this is obviously unsustainable, and there will be a crash in the future to correct.  You can only cut so many corners.  None of trumps policies actually address the true problems of the economy, only the symptoms, and all his policies mostly benefit the already wealthy.</p>

I kinda have been tuning out all the anti-trump propaganda because it was all &quot;thou doth protest too much&quot; kinda shit, and I wanted to give him a fair shake. We hadn&#39;t really had any time with him in office to evaluate him, and yet had a massive narrative push describing what seemed like years of malfeasance. On top of that, we had the obviously fabricated russian narrative discrediting criticism of Trump.</p>

<p>But I think we&#39;ve had enough time to start evaluating what we really have here. If the retarded shill team would just stfu for a month here so some real red blooded humans could discuss this subject, that&#39;d be great.</p>

<p>I stopped caring because I can&#39;t provide any proof that isn&#39;t &quot;lying MSM&quot; all i can say is read the bill Trump said he was 100% behind for healthcare-- it does the opposite of what he said. Look at the budget, he appropriated our money for it. Those are the most primary sources I have off the top of my head</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed! It&#39;s good to see another voice of reason. Now I realize I was manipulated by Russian agents and fake news for most of the election cycle. </p>

<p>The MSM and alternative media parroted vague lines about email servers and &quot;shady&quot; foundations to build up distrust for Secretary Clinton. She&#39;s a lifelong public servant. </p>

<p>Meanwhile they whitewashed everything in Trump&#39;s past and gave his very real scandals and misdeeds the bare minimum of airtime. </p>

<p>He will face impeachment after the investigation into his Russian ties. Those close to him are already falling. It can&#39;t come quickly enough.</p>

<p>I actually thought he&#39;d help the middle class. I&#39;m voting Dem from now on. Democrats are the only non establishment bastion remaining that will align policy with public interest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you not see how dismissive it is to blame sexism for criticism or dislike of Hillary, and why that dismissiveness would anger the people who you are essentially implying are too stupid to see past their own sexism and that their reasons for disliking Hillary therefore must be illegitimate?</p>

<p>This is why blaming bigoted beliefs for dislike or criticism is not persuasive (and is perhaps dissuasive) to people who are open to the possibility of legitimate reasons for criticism (aka open-minded).  When you dismiss criticism as being motivated by bigoted beliefs, implying that it cannot be legitimate, you out yourself as someone who is close-minded.  You are relying on speculation regarding possible motivations for disliking Hillary, without thinking critically about whether there are reasons to dislike Hillary that could have merit.</p>

<p>So you anger the person you are directly dismissive of, and you suggest to others that you are close-minded.  This is not a recipe for persuasive argument.</p>

<p>Seriously? You think he was going to make Mexico write him a cheque to pay for the wall? Are you 12? Any intelligent person knows he meant Mexico will pay for the wall over time, ie through taxes and tariffs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember when he said he wasn&#39;t going to go on vacation or play golf? 5 of the last 7 weekends he went on vacation and played golf, costing taxpayers $11.1 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump is spending weekends at Trump Tower and Mar-a-lago because the White House is compromised, as evidenced by his communications being constantly leaked to the media and multiple cases of people breaching the outer fence to try and get to him. It isn&#39;t just Trump going to Mar-a-Lago, it is his advisors and staff. They are generally working with a few days off thrown in as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>costing taxpayers $11.1 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, so with the billions he has saved on the Air Force One and F-35 programs, national debt being down by billions, taxpayers are still on the winning end, no?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>harder than you think huh? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I vote for social issues rather than economy, I thought this country was capitalist so funny they think their government can fix it for them without communism. People may call me stupid for doing so but I know our currency is fiat backed by nothing more than incredibly well equipped and funded military. Also our &quot;stability&quot; in the world gives our money value. So I&#39;m going to try to vote in people who will give us more and more freedoms. I know &quot;free country&quot; right?</p>

<p>I wanted Sanders. Now you may think Hillary &quot;stole the nomination&quot; from him but this country forgot it was capitalist again. Bernie spent his career as an Independent and Clinton spent her career helping Democrats. Bernie doesn&#39;t &quot;deserve&quot; the Democrat nomination but rather should have had the courage to run Independently as he always has because he&#39;s more socialist than Democrats ever were. Democrat establishment has a right to put whoever they want as their nominee for president. Primary votes are a suggestion box. They are not entitled to your vote come election day. People chose and Donald&#39;s president.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve long said that I&#39;m going to vote logically, but secretly hope Donald became president to destroy the world. Ah, him implicating the U.K in his spy schemes was just icing on my destruction cake. I wonder if the world will band together as Allies against the evil Axis... of America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you not see how dismissive it is to blame sexism for criticism or dislike of Hillary, and why that dismissiveness would anger the people who you are essentially implying are too stupid to see past their own sexism and that their reasons for disliking Hillary therefore must be illegitimate?</p>

<p>This is why blaming bigoted beliefs for dislike or criticism is not persuasive (and is perhaps dissuasive) to people who are open to the possibility of legitimate reasons for criticism (aka open-minded).  When you dismiss criticism as being motivated by bigoted beliefs, implying that it cannot be legitimate, you out yourself as someone who is close-minded.  You are relying on speculation regarding possible motivations for disliking Hillary, without thinking critically about whether there are reasons to dislike Hillary that could have merit.</p>

<p>So you anger the person you are directly dismissive of, and you suggest to others that you are close-minded.  This is not a recipe for persuasive argument.</p>
