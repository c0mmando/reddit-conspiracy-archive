       It's really weird - all of the really logical arguments against FE seem to get downvoted hard. I think it is the ultimate disinfo campaign - trying to make us doubt that which is proven, in order to fracture any sense of common ground on this sub.

       This is a conspiracy though? All I ever see on this sub are posts about Trump and the media. I thought my post was legit and would jiggle this subs recent narrative a little bit.

       I used to upvote the flat earth stuff, even though I felt it wasn't reasonable, on those grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it has been pushed past my patience. Pushed far enough, and without anything approaching rational argument, for me to believe it is an organized disinfo campaign designed to make us look stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       This narrative push suspiciously coincided with the initial look into the podesta emails. I'm not entertaining it any more.

       necessarily that's targeted, nor do I think it's an "organized" campaign. I think it's mostly fueled by trolls making fun of scientifically illiterate people. If it were organized, there would be at least a little consistency in the proposed theories of how basic things like solar and lunar cycles work in this flat earth scenario, and there really isn't. Half a dozen sites give half a dozen mutually-contradictory (but equally illogical) explanations for what's 'really' going on. Nope, it's a handful of schizophrenics and a lot of trolls, and a small following of people without the background in science and logic to see through the crap.

       if it were true, it would be the ultimate conspiracy. Think about how many people would have to be involved and in the know, from how many countries, and going how far back in history. If the difficulty of keeping secrets is enough grounds for many to accept the official narrative on JFK, how much harder is it to believe that the entire combined space programs of the US, Russia, China, and every other country with a space program, plus all the more recent civilian space companies like SpaceX, plus historical figures like Galileo and Copernicus, have been orchestrating an increasingly elaborate conspiracy since around 300BC? The whole thing is a farce, and it makes almost any other wild conspiracy theory you could care to name seem downright probable by comparison.

       Flat Earth is poison bait being laid out in this sub from time to time. Down vote this shit and move on. It's meant to make r/conspiracy look like looneyville.

      <p>
       The very same people who are pushing this nonsense will be the ones to write the articles of how reddits  r/conspiracy actually believe that the earth is flat...if they believe that...it's no wonder they believe the WTC towers were Controlled Demolition on 9/11.

       You're talking about a group of people who accept without reservation that every single thing nasa has ever done has been part of an incredibly elaborate hoax where the payoff is - I'm not sure exactly. I've heard "tricking people into believing in science instead of god so we'll all go to hell" put out there, but dunno if that was real or poe. Somehow, I don't think any amount of youtube videos are going to persuade them to change their opinion - ironic, since most of them formed that opinion based on nothing BUT youtube videos...

       Your post is important, but not for the reason you may think.  Awhile back, perhaps in science class, you were told that water drains clockwise/counter-clockwise depending on which hemisphere you are in.
      </p>
      <p>
       You took this as fact.  So much so, that you chose a Youtube video that was unscientific at best to prove your point.  Did you even do a simple Google search?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your post points out how sheep simply "know" the truth.  The truth is so obvious that they can simply state an obvious "truth".  Game over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you're asking how a flat Earther explains this effect.  A much better question would be in regard to the spin of a hurricane.  However, the assumption would have to be is that the direction of spin is related to the shape of the Earth.   That is open to debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not convinced of either the globe or flat Earth model.  For many reasons, I believe there is more evidence on the flat side.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flat Earth side has really sought to educate themselves.  The globe side not so much. I am looking forward to a well thought out globe set of proofs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're in the conspiracy subreddit.  You'll have to do better than a rickety tub in the jungle.  Be careful, most people become flat Earthers by trying to debunk it.

       The article you posted is fine but I have seen for myself that every single time water is drained here in the U.K., it will spin clockwise and every video I have seen that shows the same action in the Southern Hemisphere, it will spin anti-clockwise. Surely it's not just a coincidence?

       From what I've looked at, the water drain direction hasn't been proven one way or the other.  Therefore, I don't see it as requiring an explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say they proved the water drain direction.  You would then need to investigate why.  It isn't necessarily a flat vs globe explanation.

       I've read quite a bit about flat earth and have yet to come across even one single piece of credible evidence to suggest the world is flat. My personal experience has been that flat earthers tend to be very scientifically illiterate and fail to understand the concepts behind the evidence for a globe earth.

       I would like to invite you to point me towards some evidence that you, personally, find to be very compelling in support of flat earth.

       To add to what people already said:
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're looking to debunk the FE in every way possible, starting from the assumption it is round, you've already lost the debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's far to many people out there who have the assumption we have proof the Earth is round, cuz you know, seasons, coriolis effect, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       When in reality, none of those things are exclusive to a round Earth. The assumption that Earth couldn't be flat because seasons exist, for example, is completely ridiculous, and yet it's in this manner a majority of people validate their ball-earth model belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've invested 300+ hours on this subject in particular (rough guess) and I've seen numerous fair points pass for the flat earth theory. Things which don't make sense on a ball-earth, yet those largely get ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm don't know the shape of the Earth, but the blind scepiticism by people who (wrongly) belief science has it already figured out is definitely irritating.

       Nobody knows any truth, mostly because even our best instruments are limited. Your eyes only see a tiny part of the overall electromagnetic spectrum, your ears only hear a certain frequency range, all of your senses are limited. Yet we assume that which we perceive to be the totality of existence. Yet even in this limited space there are things we cannot perceive that exist, and interact with what we can perceive. Even our own consciousness is largely hidden from us.

       It's a concave earth. We're standing on the inside of a sphere and there are other spheres within and without. As above so below. Check out cellular cosmogony. You can also find depictions of the universe being represented by spheres within spheres in old Hebrew/Aramaic texts like the Zohar. There's also an art piece displayed around the the world called spheres within spheres which I'm sure is related.

       You might even find a guy named Lord Steven Christ on YouTube that explains this model in detail. The first thought anyone has is "this guy is a quack", well, he might be to some degree, but he's also an occultist and made a pact with a demon for knowledge. In exchange he had to proclaim himself Christ and urge others to get his Mark of the Beast tattoo.

       Flat Earth is poison bait being laid out in this sub from time to time. Down vote this shit and move on. It's meant to make r/conspiracy look like looneyville.

      <p>
       The very same people who are pushing this nonsense will be the ones to write the articles of how reddits  r/conspiracy actually believe that the earth is flat...if they believe that...it's no wonder they believe the WTC towers were Controlled Demolition on 9/11.
