<p>For my area, a lot of inmates have died under mysterious circumstances at the jail in the next county over. All were young, many in their 20s, and had no prior medical condition. The coroner reports attribute the deaths to &quot;natural causes.&quot; In one case, the inmate&#39;s family was denied visiting rights under the guise of an administration error, only to find out later he was already dead and the authorities were stalling for time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Ravenna OH near a National Guard training facility.  It was built as a WWII bombs and ammunitions testing and storage facility and is about 21,000 acres of land. In 1966 there was an 86 mile police chase with a UFO that went all through ravenna and all the way into PA after that with sitings and descriptions from multiple officers and civilians who spotted it throughout the day. It seemed as though at many points in the chase the UFO would stop and wait for them to catch up just to keep going with them. The Air Force scrambled jets but they were too fast as the UFO slowed down to stay near the cars. Officials later redacted the fact that jets were scrambled although there are papers to prove as much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Same goes for this area. There was a story in the news here about a high school female that met two dudes that worked on the nearby helicopter training base. They invited her to go on-base with them, and she accepted. Her body was later found mutilated in a nearby wooded area on the base, and the two men were caught. Local rumor was it had something to do with a satanic ritual and/or sacrifice. Masons are well established in this area too. My town itself is very small yet there are 3 separate lodges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great question! Goldman does have the money (in the form of their customers money, they are a back) but instead of using their customers money to generate returns they are using taxpayers money to generate returns. That way when (not if) the construction costs end up being more than first estimated the taxpayers money will once again be used to cover the overages. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just another blatant example of the US/NV  government and laws being used as a vehicle to generate corporate profits </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The law allowing this tax very specifically states that we are responsible for a specific dollar amount ($750M) and the taxpayer money cannot exceed that. So hopefully, if it goes over, BoA and Davis will actually foot the bill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s it. I didn&#39;t say it was an especially interesting conspiracy. But how they had handled this with secret board meetings, and unelected officials making the decisions with our tax money, all who are in the casino industry&#39;s pockets. It is shady af. I don&#39;t have anything specific to point anyone at, but if you look into a few of the articles about this transaction it will be easy to see why us natives are pissed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in bucks County and we have a lot of bizarre history involving the Rosicrucian order. In Upper Black Eddy, the order built 3 large pyramids that the public isn&#39;t allowed near. I did find a video on YouTube of someone managed to walk up to one without being chased off, and what&#39;s inside is even stranger. Just outside of Bucks County is the cave of Kelpius, located in Roxborough. Kelpius is thought to be the first Rosicrucian to come to America, and led a sect of something like 40 monk Templars. The order was based around Kelpius&#39; strange machines and magical practices. </p>

<p>We also have 2 buried treasure legends in Bucks County, but that&#39;s not exactly a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Oh, and Ringing Rocks, which is a large field of anomalous stones, that literally ring like a bell when hit. The conspiracy part is that it&#39;s always been a ufo Hotspot, dating back to colonial times. </p>

The older buildings are really cool ruins, def worth a google, but anyway.  The school operated as a place for trouble makers and kids that basically were thrown aside.  The conspiracy that I have found about it was that some kids were taken from there and sold across the US/World into a pedo sex ring, this was from the 40-70s IIRC, there are some small message boards and groups on FB about it.    </p>

Tiny houses, tiny chairs, &amp; tiny beds, the whole village miniaturized. I&#39;ve went to search for it multiple times with no success. I know many people who claim to have seen the village &amp; looked inside of windows &amp; saw a miniature version of everything, but no one has ever provided evidence for its existence. It&#39;s pretty weird, almost everyone knows what Haunchyville is here, but only handful truly claim to have seen it firsthand. Just thought I&#39;d share for anyone who cares.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live near the NY state capitol.  I&#39;m not sure about conspiracy theories but a lot of shady things happen when you mix powerful NYC folks with a small capitol city such as Albany.  There is A LOT of corruption, particularly with union driven construction projects, payoffs for favors, collusion, etc...  Couple that with gobs of money that comes near here for the horse racing industry and you&#39;ve got a party.  </p>

<p>Should make note that because of the gambling interest in the area and it&#39;s close proximity to NYC there was and probably still is heavy mob ties.  </p>

<p>There was a quadruple homicide near a local mall on busy road not that long ago.  You&#39;d think that the first reported quadruple homicide within a municipality which has an average violent crime rate 87% below national average would garner some steadfast crime investigation.  No, unsolved.  Word around the campfire is that it was some asian mob angry over a debt.</p>

<p>Albany is a funny place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm... there was a hamburger/hotdog place that was supposed to open up in a vacant building... turns out the guy in charge was a heroin trafficker and went to jail before renovations were complete... that was over a year ago, but his Wifi signal is still coming out of the building... which is now the home to an Italian place that certainly doesn&#39;t get enough business to stay open for long... and installed a bunch of really teched out surveillance and security. I&#39;m guessing it a front for heroin trafficking. </p>

<p>And something weird is going on at a decommissioned Navy airbase... I think the Navy dumped a bunch of hazardous materials in the woods decades ago which are contaminating the groundwater. I ventured out there a few summers ago and ran into a bunch of out of state guys that were with the EPA... and they had no fuckin&#39; sense of humor at all... I dunno if all EPA guys are like that, but it was really strange and they had some pre-printed explanation pamphlet to hand me in case some weirdo like me found them in the woods in the middle of nowhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a throwaway because it involves a family member and my main account is known.</p>

<p>My local government is corrupt severely, I&#39;m talking sex, drugs, and using their power to their advantage against the law. I know this because someone in my family worked in the court house and other government buildings. The DA and some of the higher up people are cocaine users and have hotel sex parties, like cocaine fueled orgy sex parties. My family member is a female and was solicited for sex by the DA on many occasions, which she accepted and I&#39;m pretty sure is part of the reason she got in so deep (not just the DA either, several other officials). Another is she was going to law school to become a lawyer and I think they saw something in her that could help them. She&#39;s seen shit I could only describe as something I&#39;ve seen in movies. We&#39;re also pretty sure the DA is collaborating with drug leaders to lock up their little guys as scapegoats so they stay in business and the law gets their busts. Let&#39;s just say she told me Christmas parties include some odd guests, and drug sweeps happen 3 months after it every year. Always 30 people taken in, sometimes 32 or 33. I almost always know someone in the line-up every year (it&#39;s a pretty small historical town compared to others), and it&#39;s like they find the dumbest people they can to run drugs for them which makes sense.</p>

<p>Get this. She recently left law school because she decided it wasn&#39;t for her and she wanted to continue her current job within the courthouse. Well she no longer has her job, and the DA or any other of her &quot;friends&quot; won&#39;t so much as answer a text, and if they do it&#39;s literally one word. She&#39;s been entirely cut out of the circle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheers man! </p>

<p>You&#39;re definitely not missing out on much.  It&#39;s unfortunate to see the stranglehold on the economy here.  The amount of pollution in the Irving cities is allegedly akin to a couple packs of cigarettes a day.  I had a teacher in high school who taught us about the Irving family in a critical manner,  including their ties to Saudi Arabia.  He also had people who visited Saudi Arabia in to the class to speak about the civil rights atrocities. </p>

<p>I like to think it was so we as fresh, young minds would put it together and effect change as he was a teacher who taught how to think not what to think, but I was the only counter culturist in the class so I think I was the only one to pick up on it.  It was a rather affluent community that the school was located but I was bussed in from the surrounding countryside to attend that high school.  </p>

<p>Kudos on picking up that it was NB though.  Hope you&#39;re doing better wherever you&#39;re at. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its quite common in my home town for people in council houses to illegally sublet them out per room to desperate families. For example, there was one case of a woman who had been allocated a council house but she actually lived abroad and she&#39;d rented out each room to family members and friends for an extortionate amount of money. She was caught out and they pulled around 25 people out of a tiny 2 bed house. That one actually did make local papers, so everybody knew about it, but its common to find busts like this happening with immigration showing up in parts of town in the middle of the night to &quot;flush out&quot; houses. I guess it does count as a conspiracy because there are rumours that the local authorities know that this kind of thing happens all the time but they sit on it, as long as the &quot;Tenants&quot; keep themselves to themselves and they pay their rent on time they are happy to ignore it. The only really step in if there&#39;s a health and safety problem or the house is unfit for living. Also related, There is an old branch of Woolworths which is now a cash &amp; carry and rumours around town is that there have been people living there since it became a cash and carry and its been one for 8 years now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Maricopa County, AZ, the superior court judges were in collusion with Sherrif Joe arpaio to rule certain ways on Dui appeals cases in order to put more people away. Local PD allows video evidence to &quot;expire&quot; meanwhile while defense judges are requesting it every week. They then say they never got the requests and they cannot provide the evidence as videos were automatically deleted by the program. This was deemed unconstitutional in the Youngblood vs Arizona case that went up to the US Supreme Court, yet the judges will still convict. Upon appealing the unconstitutional condition, the appeals courts decide not to hear the case and slap you with extra time in tent city because &quot;the appeals court has longer minimum sentences&quot; </p>

<p>Source: my dui case. Served 8 extra days in tent city for showing the Maricopa County superior court that the local PD deleted evidence that would have proven my innocence. </p>

<p>Sorry, still a little salty. </p>

In the 80s it was used by a satanic cult and the tunnels were covered in pornographic images. In 2010, a teenager went missing in the area and he supposedly researched the base just before. He was never found and the entrances to the tunnels below have been sealed. </p>

<p>Me and a few friends visited it last summer. The buildings above ground are still accessible, though they&#39;re pretty much empty. </p>

<p>Not really a conspiracy but it&#39;s still a very weird and interesting series of events. The base is called RAF Bempton for anyone interested in learning more.  There&#39;s videos on YouTube/ pictures on the web of people exploring the tunnels before they were sealed. The &#39;artwork&#39; is seriously fucked up.</p>

There have been so many instances that I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s not a coincidence. These bars don&#39;t sit on a pier (like ocean-side areas, for instance). I&#39;ve been around said areas and heavily intoxicated at times. Doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, things off the top of my head. Because I can, and because r/Con is 80% CTR astroturf. Some are true, some are not. Names and people are changed to protect the guilty. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mayor ran for office to clear his debts to the Odessian mafia. During his run for office he had Russia prostitutes (they could not speak any english, just showed up to cheer in Cowboy hats) act as his election crew. He lasted 1 term, during which all the major infrastructure contracts were broken with local SME&#39;s and given to a large conglomerate run out of Cypress. This is a city of (x)mm people so his activity was not a small event. On his last day in office he changed the by-laws and gave himself 2 million acres of land right beside an Olympic Park where the IOC previously zoned it as &quot;natural habitat&quot; during the Olympics. 2 days after leaving office he sold half a city park to Russian banked developers who are now facing lawsuits for building McMansions on the side of a escarpment, of which 7 mansions have fallen into the river. 
His son is now running for Federal office.</p></li>
<li><p>During the 1980&#39;s the Chief of Police was the related to the local chapter head of the Hells Angels. Hells Angels were the largest property tax payers in the city as well as the second largest charity providers (Shriner days were hilarious), so everyone was cool with this. Police actively told people they would not enforce certain sectors of down-town lest they be fired for &quot;internal affairs&quot;. When the Koreans and Italians started to move in, gang wars started and the City had to &quot;clean up&quot; the biker problem. The biker gangs are still reliable informants and friends to the city to this day. </p></li>
<li><p>The largest sex brothel is being run out of a condo complex owned by the Consulate of China&#39;s local Foreign Affairs Officer. You can find some of the Staffers &quot;Friends&quot; on the local Backpage. A far cry from the old 007 movies. </p></li>
<li><p>A famous gold mining fraud (now a movie) was a front for the Italian mafia, run out of Vancouver. To this day the 3 brokerages are known fronts for Italian/French dark money. One guy faked his death and now lives in Hong Kong as a consultant. He rolled on the mob backed institutional investors and was allowed to &quot;vanish&quot;. He still pays his dues to the local geology society. </p></li>
<li><p>Two of the richest men in the city met their wives when they were sex workers. The pimp is now a judge on the court bench. </p></li>
<li><p>The local state police force (yes the entire Detective and Gang Crime Units) was arrested for moonlighting to rich oligarchs and using police databases for personal side-jobs.</p></li>
<li><p>A Triad branch was caught trying to bribe a sitting SEC commissioner with 4 hockey bags full of fresh (as in uncut from the US Treasury) $100 bills to allow them to continue building condo&#39;s in a major city. The sting operation was more interested in how they got uncut bills out of the USA.  </p></li>
<li><p>A local native village was a Illuminati sacrificial site from 1830 to 1960, local state police identified half the missing children from native schools likely ended up in this bone pit. Every year a Crown Royal (various countries) just happens to visit the site and stay there for 2 or 3 days around the Summer Solace. </p></li>
<li><p>When the Canadian Government ordered the Avro program destroyed the KGB paid local Russian/Estonian agents to smuggle parts out which became the basis of the MiG-23/25. Every 4 or 14 years a new part is &quot;donated&quot; to the local aerospace museum from somebody who wants to remain anon. Rumor has it there is a 80% complete Avro Aero disassembled somewhere in State. </p>

<ol>
<li>The first leader of the Conservative movement in this State came from a family of notorious cattle rustlers. His family was a main shipper for the Chicago mob during prohibition. He keeps a tommy gun on his ranch as a prop for the story. To this day, their family is involved in &quot;odd-lot&quot; cattle sales to Montana.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Before he was arrested, Al Capone purchased large (large estate tracts) of land outside of Moose Jaw in Canada. There are stories going back to 1970 of local scavengers finding old US mint coins along the old riverbed. Many believe Capone hid his stash amid old freehold farmsteads. </p></li>
<li><p>The KGB would send agents as Orthodox priests to scout and recruit in local villages. When state police got wise they would vanish, leaving behind their kit in the Parish who in turn would donate them to the local CIA/Counter-intelligence branches. Many Orthodox churches survived as &quot;honey pots&quot; long after their children moved away. </p></li>
<li><p>In the late 1990&#39;s Federal government started targeting local crime prevention. As a part of this there was a required violent crime quota which required each year less capital offenses and homeless people to be documented then the previous year. After serious debate, the national council of Mayors decided to draw lots amid themselves and agreed to send all their homeless and violent criminals to 1 or 2 major cities. Those city mayors agreed to &quot;quarterback&quot; civic programs so long as the other mayors endorsed him. Subsequently, 3 cities saw over the 1990 to 2001 period a 200% increase in homeless cases and a spike in violent crime arrests, well above the national average. When 1 mayor went whistleblower he said &quot;we got the idea from the Americans&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>The local oligarch hangouts were all financed on city land, gifted to the clubs in exchange for bailouts of the city coffers, which were paid for by using off the books slush funds.</p></li>
<li><p>The largest payer of highway tolls is the Drug Runners going into the USA. Its easier to pay a &quot;tip&quot; and the toll then be pulled over for cargo inspection. </p></li>
<li><p>A former State Governor saw that an Aspestos Class Action Lawsuit was going to win based on Judge &amp; public opinion so They fired the DA and appointed their Husband to be the DA, despite having no experience in this field as a JD. The case favored the State and the Govenor &amp; the SO pocked the money. They have yet to be prosecuted to this day and are hiding out of country.</p></li>
<li><p>A sitting member of government is the largest slum land lord and crystal meth dealer in the state. When his town burned down, over $100 million in cash went up in smoke, that is why he went back to check on his city that day with a trailer hitched to his truck. Nice guy, but he&#39;s literally Walter White. </p></li>
<li><p>More then 1 former Head of State was on the Chinese or KGB payroll. It was not even a secret, you just knew your report was going to be photocopied and sent back to Beijing. It got so bad in the 1970&#39;s the CIA and US Government just stopped asking this NATO ally for insight until the entire government was turned over. </p></li>
<li><p>NHL and NBA games are not fixed per-se, but like Wrestling or UFC the fights are scheduled for maximum &quot;story arc&quot; potential. Every season the league reviews the salary cap, which teams are best to present in a Sports &quot;package&quot; of highlight clips to ESPN/FOX and narratives are crafted. Every major sports star since Wayne Gretzky has been stage managed. No player will ever admit they took a &quot;dive&quot; to allow a star forward to score a Hat-Trick, but no player will also waive their NHLPA pension to whistleblow the system. Its the same in the NBA. </p></li>
<li><p>Nearly every environmental foundation in this country is a money laundering scheme for a major offshore family or country. Ask your favorite institute to present their NGO financial statements and you will figure it out. No auditor, no disclosed bank accounts, no disclosed consultant contracts. But plenty of left-wing government Directors on their Board and plenty of paid protestors with $100/sign photo-ops.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Same goes for this area. There was a story in the news here about a high school female that met two dudes that worked on the nearby helicopter training base. They invited her to go on-base with them, and she accepted. Her body was later found mutilated in a nearby wooded area on the base, and the two men were caught. Local rumor was it had something to do with a satanic ritual and/or sacrifice. Masons are well established in this area too. My town itself is very small yet there are 3 separate lodges.</p>
