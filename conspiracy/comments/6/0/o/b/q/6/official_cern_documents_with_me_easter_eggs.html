<p>Note, at the very bottom of the page, you can download a PDF guide—this is what I&#39;m referencing.

<p>Proof? Or scientists &quot;having fun&quot; again? Seeing this and realizing very few people have covered it is making me a little sick to my stomach, let&#39;s stop fighting over memories and keep our eyes on the evil... These are sick people we&#39;re dealing with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, then, in all seriousness... Do you not notice increased skepticism in these subreddits? Increased downvoting despite sub owners saying it&#39;s been disabled? I&#39;m on subreddits to discuss further things we believe in, not debate whether or not they&#39;re theoretically possible. I had those debates years ago...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, within the last month I have noticed increased skepticism on many subreddits.</p>

<p>In my opinion, if you don&#39;t believe in the ME, then don&#39;t go to that subreddit. Common sense.</p>

<p>There are plenty of subreddits that I don&#39;t agree with. I just don&#39;t go on them. I leave them alone.  Like I said, common sense and common courtesy.</p>

<p>Wish other people practiced that.</p>

<p>the ME connection makes me think of a guest on THC podcast who, among other very out there statements, said they use the LHC to create restore points in time just in case things don&#39;t go according to plan. Maybe the ME is related to that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, there&#39;s an entire theory based on their intentional manipulation of these data points to change very specific points in our timeline!

    <div class="md"><p>His name is David Marshall. Link to podcast below.</p>

<p>IMO, he&#39;s either off some meds, an avid larper, or a disenfranchised comic book writer. In the episode, he claims to be some kind messiah to the cabal and also takes credit for writing numerous pop hits of the past 20 years.</p>

<p>The episode focuses on cloning centers (obviously). The basic premise is the cabal have a bunch of underground bases they operate in cahoots with the vrill (another word for hollow earth lizard people). In these facilities, among other things, they store cloned versions of people, ranging from celebrities to just random folks. They then sadistically debauch and take advantage these clones during weird &quot;we control the world so, fuck it&quot; parties.</p>

<p>Where it really gets weird is the metaphysics of it all. He says if you&#39;re cloned, they can pull your consciousness into the clone while you&#39;re sleeping. Until then, your clone is pretty much just a doll without a consciousness. So, there&#39;s a part (consciousness) of you that can be manipulated through material processes (the machine that pulls you into the clone) that is in itself immaterial (or else your clones would have consciousness without you getting pulled into them).</p>

<p>In his time as a conscious clone, while his real body is sleeping, he has written numerous hit pop songs, rejected an offer to be the cabal&#39;s little christ figure, and got shot through the stomach by Vladimir Putin with a gattling proton beam fun (no shit). </p>

<p>so take it for what it&#39;s worth... like I said, makes for a great comic book story but it takes quite a suspension of disbelief to take him seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oooooh yea I did listen to that one too. I was talking about the one with Anthony Patch, this one <a href="http://thehighersidechats.com/anthony-patch-cern-the-portal-to-saturn-interview/">http://thehighersidechats.com/anthony-patch-cern-the-portal-to-saturn-interview/</a> which was super interesting and I know he&#39;s a smart dude, I just don&#39;t know enough to really judge any of it.</p>

<p>Donald Marshall is one of those who I really cannot tell if he&#39;s just completely off his rocker, looking for attention, or maybe even slightly legit. I want to just write him off as nuts but a lot of what he says is so circulated that it is very intriguing if nothing else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea. I think keeping most of this stuff at infotainment length until proven otherwise is a good way to keep yourself functional when entertaining all the possibilities the conspiracy world does. Imagine the world Donald Marshall lives in if this is true. I mean it&#39;s a great, terrifying story. It reminds me of Wanted and, in a lesser sense, the Invisibles. </p>

<p>But PGate should get you more than just thinking. The big three industries are guns, drugs, and human trafficking. We know governments profit from the first two. Why not the third?</p>

That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been more a lurker than anything but since the absolute batshit-insanity that&#39;s been going on since the election along, with Pgate (I&#39;m a former foster kid so yea, it&#39;s a little bit personal) I&#39;m at that point where I just want to talk about everything lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually referencing those who believe they&#39;re manipulating points in data, the &quot;restore&quot; points yoko refers to, not physical points, however, CERN itself has a terrifying physical setup (but then again it&#39;s physics!) AND there are many conspiracies out there that believe there are global grids underground amplifying this to no end. I absolutely believe there&#39;s enough out there to be true—to some extent anyway. </p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a lot of truth in what you both shared. To me, this is spiritual warfare and metaphysics is the key to understanding it all. I believe in aliens, but I don’t think this has anything to do with them. This is light vs dark, good vs evil, heaven vs hell—in a scientific view that takes into account more than just the physics we&#39;ve limited ourselves with in this reality.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a religious person, though I was raised that way, but I am incredibly spiritual and I know without a shadow of a doubt that when we start to expand our mind and spirit, we push the limits of our physical existence. I believe many of us (even if you haven&#39;t realized it), possess this awareness and ability to see beyond limitations formally set, we question, we grow, we become more powerful. </p>

<p>(hear me out, I&#39;m not JUST a crazy hippie)</p>

<p>Ever since I started to focus on spiritual growth through meditation, yoga and various types of sound healing, and explore metaphysics and energy work (which I only did in an attempt to center myself and calm my crazy ass), my mind has grown in ways I never imagined and there&#39;s a physical change of being &quot;lighter&quot; (hard to describe until you experience) that&#39;s a result of changing the vibration of your being. Ascending to a higher level, if you will (I&#39;m coming back to this!). </p>

<p>Little intuitive things, like thinking about a person and having them call me five seconds later, start to happen ALL THE TIME. My dreams are changing, and while I won’t go into too much because I’m still figuring it out, it’s making me think we absolutely do get to do this all over again when we die. Abundance, creativity and opportunity flows, as long as you start to quiet your mind and listen to your true subconscious. I even now posses the physical ability to control energy flow through my body (Reiki) in very profound ways—things I would have rolled my eyes at or laughed at 5 years ago. Seriously. I was a hater. We are all connected.</p>

<p>While I don’t have these experiences, I have very close friends who have grown to the point they see spirits (or parallel dimensions?), have regular conversations during mediation with ascended masters and their workers and receive messages that are incredibly helpful to the people they are working with/close to. Intelligent, sane, incredibly successful individuals.    </p>

<p>And if the good ones exist in the light we play with, it’s easy to think there’s a dark side, yes?</p>

<p>Remember… Intelligent, sane, successful individuals.   </p>

<p>Anyway, the point of the hippie ramble is that there absolutely is a missing element to our calculations of &quot;reality&quot; and it&#39;s something that&#39;s easy for you to comprehend once you start breaking down those old walls. </p>

<p>I was always a fan of the superstring and bosonic theories, so for me it’s easy to believe that we have way more dimensions than we know to be reality. Plus, you know, space and time. Which, in quantum physics, the continuum is not always continuous.... Time is relative. Yada, yada, yada. </p>

<p>Now, with the belief in all of this behind me (which honestly all came before I heavily bought into any conspiracy), the idea of raising our collective vibrations to a higher level and “ascending” into a slightly higher parallel dimension isn’t all that crazy. Those of us who are “lightworkers” want to ascend, even if it’s not conscious, we’re driven to do so. It’s a high. I believed we were shifting in global consciousness long before I believed the Illuminati were real.</p>

<p>Metaphysics has all of our answers, spirituality has the control and I believe our collective conscious is keeping time. &quot;They&quot; know this, way better than most humans. </p>

<p>The Illuminati… I don’t believe they’re from space, but I do believe that they’re a large, elite group that holds ancient knowledge, long lost to the rest of the human race. Maybe knowledge that came from space, who knows? </p>

<p>But as of late, I do believe they are purely evil, with the intention of bringing back the return of the Anti-Christ (yup, never thought I would say that, do your eye roll, it’s cool—I understand). They turned this into a spiritual battle, they want to keep us down here and bring the rest of them up. </p>

<p>And that’s where CERN comes in. Let’s go on and rip tiny little black holes into our dimension over and over and over again…. SHIVA is out front of the facility for god’s sake. </p>

<p>I think the scientists at CERN are fucking with us, but I don’t think changes in our reality are 100% from them. I think the corporate, people and entertainment-based ones certainly are, but I think there are other shifts in our reality (like anatomy) that are from the natural global shift that was already occurring. The Mandela Effect is a distraction from the real thing. </p>

<p>Anyway, I think the entire point of this post was meant to be you might enjoy looking into Carolyn Hamlett—she&#39;s an ex-Illuminati with a similar story to the ones above, though she was trained in her psychic abilities and told she was going to help spread the word of Jesus... She speaks of cloning, pedophilia, human testing, but all as she of course eventually realized, was for the return of the Anti-Christ. She somehow got out and now spends her time sharing her story. They’ve tried to kill her, but so far she’s still around:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGEYloihE9g&amp;amp;t=509s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGEYloihE9g&amp;amp;t=509s</a></p>

<p>When you consider the bizarre, ritualistic shit happening at CERN (you all have seen the opening ceremony IN FULL of the Gotthard Tunnel, right?!):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW5gklIKcDg&amp;amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW5gklIKcDg&amp;amp;t=2s</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt... One way or another, CERN knows and they’re in.</p>

<p>And this is all without REALLY going into Illuminati, because I feel like I don&#39;t have to do that in here. Everyone might wanna start strengthening their mind/spirit games. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oooooh yea I did listen to that one too. I was talking about the one with Anthony Patch, this one <a href="http://thehighersidechats.com/anthony-patch-cern-the-portal-to-saturn-interview/">http://thehighersidechats.com/anthony-patch-cern-the-portal-to-saturn-interview/</a> which was super interesting and I know he&#39;s a smart dude, I just don&#39;t know enough to really judge any of it.</p>

<p>Donald Marshall is one of those who I really cannot tell if he&#39;s just completely off his rocker, looking for attention, or maybe even slightly legit. I want to just write him off as nuts but a lot of what he says is so circulated that it is very intriguing if nothing else.</p>

<p>Hold on I only read the first part of your comment and it&#39;s been a while since I listened to that one lol so I&#39;m going back to finish... </p>
