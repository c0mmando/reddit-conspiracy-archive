    <div class="md"><p>Snowden wasn&#39;t an analyst and as such did not have the ability to target people. His SID, NSA&#39;s username essentially,  would not have given him access to those tools.  If he had he would have had an auditor who would have seen the targeting. Analysts and those auditors are low level people who are there because they think they are doing good and most of them are doing good since NSA is a foreign intelligence agency. Unfortunately, they are using tools that can be used for very bad things.  The people at the top are responsible for this.  They are the evil ones.  If a report was created from these conversations it would be searchable by anyone with access to NSAnet.  If the conversations were reportable it would have been reported.  There are shops within NSA per country or area of interest. Those shops have linguists, reporters, and analysts.  If they found a conversation with Flynn&#39;s number it would have been a huge deal within that shop. Not to mention, Flynn&#39;s number would have been on a huge list of numbers known to be US persons&#39; numbers that are flagged as such since he was who he was.  </p>

<p>TLDR: If Flynn&#39;s conversations were recorded and translated and reported and then leaked, it was done at very high levels and probably outside of normal procedures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I read his statement he is saying not only did he have the tools to wiretap anyone, the oversight in place was not working and he can operate as he pleases.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve explained to you that he definitely did NOT have the authority to target someone.  NSA is a DoD agency. It is mostly military and ex military.  Probably upwards of 95%.  They take the law seriously and quite frankly are scared to accidentally do something to violate it because of how much they have been threatened with punishment if they do. (Threatened is too harsh of a word but I couldn&#39;t think of a better one).  </p>

<p>Snowden, because of his role, would not know about how the oversight/auditing works.  I don&#39;t know why he is lying about this, but he is lying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for every agency, but he&#39;s right. I did intel and oversight for the army and I was alerted constantly if anything was out of place. Also Snowden was basically an IT guy, he would not have had the access to do anything he claims he could have. He could login to make sure the system worked right but even with a SID, he needs further logins for other platforms within the computer which he would not have had.</p>
</div>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">n/a</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/MetalFace127.html">MetalFace127</a> 2017-03-21</p>
    <div class="md"><p>We start to delve into a lot of speculation at this point.  I don&#39;t doubt that you received alerts if something was out of place.  I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if somewhere in the army you had a counterpart who was just doing a shitty job/didn&#39;t care about these alerts/didn&#39;t follow up on them/ simply didn&#39;t organize their system in a way that these alerts came in. I think most people in the armed forces would be willing to admit they aren&#39;t exactly models of efficiency and good management.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve met many ethically questionable people.  Its not hard for me to think that a person like this would take advantage of holes in a system for their own advantage. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-surveillance-watchdog-idUSBRE98Q14G20130927">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-surveillance-watchdog-idUSBRE98Q14G20130927</a>  </p>

<p>Secondly, I have a lot more faith that the army has has a system of oversight in place that is more thorough and effective than what the NSA does.  I think the difference goes to the core nature of these two institutions.  The NSA operates almost entirely on a classified level. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to learn an analyst in the NSA has more &quot;freedom to work&quot; than a similar analyst in another agency. The less review, the greater the potential for abuse. While the army has a huge amount of classified information, the army also has clearer lines of accountability both, internally and to the people/government. </p>

<p>Lastly I think you can see the failure of any accountability/ oversight inside the NSA in the simple fact that Snowden was able to steal the huge amounts of information.  We know this for a fact.  He should not have been able to do this yet he was.  A clear and gigantic failure of whatever policy/practice they had in place.  I don&#39;t think its a stretch to think there were other failures, including supervising wiretaps were being done appropriately as Snowden is alleging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Air Force intel here and I completely agree, obviously specifics can&#39;t be discussed but we avoided incidental collection on Americans like the plague, and as you most likely did as well, we were required to sign an intelligence oversight statement every year reminding us that it was highly illegal to knowingly/intentionally collect on U.S persons.... ( for what I did there was absolutely no exceptions to this, but obviously there are exceptions here, as the NSA director explains there are exceptions to this, but that&#39;s when due process comes into play) </p>

<p>As far as Snowden goes I&#39;m in the middle, I understand the value of a population knowing what their government is capable of, i mean it can be argued that part of the intent of the 2nd amendment was to ensure that we the people had the ability to resist an out of control govt, and classified capabilities give the government an unfair advantage, but Snowden was also just an IT guy that left out a whole lot of the context in the information he released, for example in his documentary citizenfour he personally discussed a program that i personally used regularly, he never mentioned how it was actually being used in the real world but did go on about the philosophical/moral problems regarding how someone could illegally use it. </p>

<p>To me if felt like someone was <em>leaking</em> proof that police use guns because guns can be used to kill innocent people, which is all &quot;true&quot;, police do use guns and guns can be used to killed innocent people but it&#39;s misrepresenting both guns and police to leave out how police are actually using them and allowing/not clarifying misconceptions that stem from a very limited information </p>

<p>I once worked in telecom and I got the impression that a lot of the domestic spying equipment was farmed out to foreign corporations, with lots of contractors.</p>

<p>Basically this puts up a layer of &#39;abstraction&#39; between the agencies doing the illegal spying on American citizens. Because they&#39;re not actually doing it; it&#39;s all farmed out. So the companies that would be found culpable wouldn&#39;t be American companies or American intelligence agencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;This was in summer of 2004, one of the papers I HELD IN MY HAND was to wiretap a bunch of numbers associated with a 40-some year old wannabe Senator from Illinois. You wouldn&#39;t happen to know where that guy lives right now would you? It&#39;s a BIG WHITE HOUSE in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>That&#39;s who they went after, and that&#39;s the President of the United States now.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for every agency, but he&#39;s right. I did intel and oversight for the army and I was alerted constantly if anything was out of place. Also Snowden was basically an IT guy, he would not have had the access to do anything he claims he could have. He could login to make sure the system worked right but even with a SID, he needs further logins for other platforms within the computer which he would not have had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We start to delve into a lot of speculation at this point.  I don&#39;t doubt that you received alerts if something was out of place.  I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if somewhere in the army you had a counterpart who was just doing a shitty job/didn&#39;t care about these alerts/didn&#39;t follow up on them/ simply didn&#39;t organize their system in a way that these alerts came in. I think most people in the armed forces would be willing to admit they aren&#39;t exactly models of efficiency and good management.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve met many ethically questionable people.  Its not hard for me to think that a person like this would take advantage of holes in a system for their own advantage. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-surveillance-watchdog-idUSBRE98Q14G20130927">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-surveillance-watchdog-idUSBRE98Q14G20130927</a>  </p>

<p>Secondly, I have a lot more faith that the army has has a system of oversight in place that is more thorough and effective than what the NSA does.  I think the difference goes to the core nature of these two institutions.  The NSA operates almost entirely on a classified level. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to learn an analyst in the NSA has more &quot;freedom to work&quot; than a similar analyst in another agency. The less review, the greater the potential for abuse. While the army has a huge amount of classified information, the army also has clearer lines of accountability both, internally and to the people/government. </p>

<p>Lastly I think you can see the failure of any accountability/ oversight inside the NSA in the simple fact that Snowden was able to steal the huge amounts of information.  We know this for a fact.  He should not have been able to do this yet he was.  A clear and gigantic failure of whatever policy/practice they had in place.  I don&#39;t think its a stretch to think there were other failures, including supervising wiretaps were being done appropriately as Snowden is alleging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Air Force intel here and I completely agree, obviously specifics can&#39;t be discussed but we avoided incidental collection on Americans like the plague, and as you most likely did as well, we were required to sign an intelligence oversight statement every year reminding us that it was highly illegal to knowingly/intentionally collect on U.S persons.... ( for what I did there was absolutely no exceptions to this, but obviously there are exceptions here, as the NSA director explains there are exceptions to this, but that&#39;s when due process comes into play) </p>

<p>As far as Snowden goes I&#39;m in the middle, I understand the value of a population knowing what their government is capable of, i mean it can be argued that part of the intent of the 2nd amendment was to ensure that we the people had the ability to resist an out of control govt, and classified capabilities give the government an unfair advantage, but Snowden was also just an IT guy that left out a whole lot of the context in the information he released, for example in his documentary citizenfour he personally discussed a program that i personally used regularly, he never mentioned how it was actually being used in the real world but did go on about the philosophical/moral problems regarding how someone could illegally use it. </p>

<p>To me if felt like someone was <em>leaking</em> proof that police use guns because guns can be used to kill innocent people, which is all &quot;true&quot;, police do use guns and guns can be used to killed innocent people but it&#39;s misrepresenting both guns and police to leave out how police are actually using them and allowing/not clarifying misconceptions that stem from a very limited information </p>
