<p>These multi-dimensional beings can communicate with us, without our knowledge. This is how we learned about the theory of evolution and many other scientific breakthroughs. </p>

<p><strong>However</strong> on parasitic vampires: He believes Globalists are satan-worshippers, and rather than furthering humanity through inter-dimensional beings, they are learning how to corrupt and destroy the human race through channeling satan, who may also exist inter-dimensionally. He believes they are absorbing the essence of children through sacrifices and pedophilia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want the truth, it is this: the earth is flat and there is an impenetrable firmament above us. Space is a science fiction concept and operation fishbowl proved to the elites that this is indeed the case. Aliens were known prior to the 1800s as demons. Demons operate on an interdimensional basis, between the Earth realm and the underworld. New Age channelers report aliens are communicating with them a grand plan for human transcendence to reach the next level of evolution of consciousness, just as the Luciferian doctrine promises its adherents. Every secret society follows this same doctrine towards a New World Order, but only those at the top understand they are worshiping Lucifer. This push with UFOs and aliens by scientists, Hollywood and even presidents on latenight TV shows are programming us for a fake alien invasion of sorts in order to convince us to engage in the final stage that will convince a great many to surrender to the &#39;beast system&#39;.</p>

<p>The satanic religion of the secret societies controlling the world involve sacrifice, organ harvesting, pedophilia and mind control, which is what Alex Jones was alluding to. He dropped a massive red pill that was too big to swallow for 95%+ of his listeners and it was only the tip of the iceberg. </p>

Art is our primary language, but very few of us learn to speak with it. The world is anatomical, made up of rational and dynamic components.

<p>The Federal Reserve is a very powerful banking cartel. I get it. They print counterfeits, to keep you indentured. But do you understand the petrodollar? It&#39;s the reason we bully every oil rich nation in the world. If we lose control of the global oil supply, the central banks are powerless, because our fiat currency means nothing unless we force the world to run its engines on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I <em>am</em> trying to make belief in vampires and reptile people seem absurd, yes. It&#39;s sad that I even have to address such a silly topic at all.</p>

<p>My proof that intelligence agencies use these topics as distractions is that we just had several huge leaks come out, and people are <em>still</em> talking about vampires. To me that&#39;s very suggestive of someone trying to disrupt our efforts at investigating those leaks. I hope I&#39;m not the only one who has noticed all the brigading and forum sliding happening lately. You&#39;ve read Glenn Greenwald&#39;s JTRIG article, right? It confirms these tactics.</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: <strong>(1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets;</strong> and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How often do you even hear about vampires man. Or reptilians? Those two topics probably consist of 1% of this sub. Yes we know that bankers and cartels are bad, but at some point you have to start realizing that these &quot;greedy businessmen&quot; are probably in contact with extraterrestrial beings and or supernatural forces.

<p>But I figured r/conspiracy would have to have some diehard Alex Jones fans that are woked to this theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in the same way that there are organisms that eat shit, there are organisms (I use that term loosely) that feed on certain types of &quot;energy&quot; (auric fields, I dunno, does anybody?). this is the impression that I get from taking LSD hundreds of times and interacting with what can only be described as inter-dimensional entities, some of em good, some of em real bad. I may also just be crazy, but after doing some research, its apparently a pretty common experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so since no one is giving you what you asked for, what he is saying is that our 3rd dimensional reality exists very close in frequency (? For lack of a better term) to the lower astral realms, or archontic realms. What many religous talk about as hell. Everything in our reality puts out digital waveform information that is picked up by our senses and interpreted by our minds. We essentially eat waveform information that is holographic because the brain processes the waveform info into a dense physical reality that is actually holographic and not solid in nature. Same with the archons or &quot;psychic vampires&quot; except they eat waveform information of lower frequencies, this is an oversimplification. One level higher above ours where matter is no longer solid we have the lower astral realms. The archons have manipulated humanity from the inception of our current history  (after the last major cataclysm 11,600 years ago). Manipulated our rna and dna in order for us to experience reality at a lower state of collective awareness which makes us easily manipulatable by the archons. </p>

<p>The elites worship the archons and do their bidding. They sacrifice animals, children and mass amounts of humans because this causes a shift in consciousness to the lower frequencies especially if the event is witnessed by many people (9/11 for example).  This is what the archons feed off of, being &quot;psychic vampires&quot;. Read The Perception Deception by David Icke for a LOT more info. Is it true? I have no fucking idea but the elites are definitely up to some shady shit and it doesn&#39;t look like their ideologies fit in to the standard view of the physical world being the end all be all of conscious existence. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done my heroic dose of shrooms and I&#39;ve seen &quot;the matrix&quot;. It&#39;s an illusion. Nothing compared to learning to paint. Art is our primary language, but very few of us learn to speak with it. The world is anatomical, made up of rational and dynamic components. If it&#39;s not growing, it&#39;s dying and if it&#39;s not alive it&#39;s eroding.</p>

<p>We&#39;re both lost causes on the shape of the earth. Unless there&#39;s evidence you&#39;d find acceptable. </p>

<p>The Federal Reserve is a very powerful banking cartel. I get it. They print counterfeits, to keep you indentured. But do you understand the petrodollar? It&#39;s the reason we bully every oil rich nation in the world. If we lose control of the global oil supply, the central banks are powerless, because our fiat currency means nothing unless we force the world to run its engines on it.</p>
