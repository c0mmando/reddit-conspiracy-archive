       It's Tony Podesta's 72nd Birthday. Can you guess what the birthday party theme is?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes of course, "PIZZA PARTY"
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the guests include Amrita &amp; Ashok Mahbubani, who's foundation works with the Clinton Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you guess where? Haiti. Of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now after a splendid Podesta Pizza party, Ashok emails Podesta and thanks him and says:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Attached are pictures that capture some of the spirit of the evening - at a couple of different levels.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       One picture: Tony Podesta cutting cake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second picture: Ashok seated next to a life size cutout version of Pope Francis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Folks, I'm no conspiracy theorist, well, yes I am. But I think we will be graced by some Pope Francis leaks very soon. Considering a laptop was "stolen" today containing info on Clinton and Pope Francis. And considering the church's not so sparkling record, I am certain today's laptop theft is a background story for the coming leaks. The circumstances around the stolen laptop scream false flag. Brace yourselves.

       It's a false flag. It's orchestrated. There probably isn't any useful information on the laptop. Look at the circumstances:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Laptop stolen
SS agent then goes and tells the media the contents of the laptop (this is unbelievable and signals they were pushing a narrative)
SS agent says there is Clinton email files, Pope Francis files, and Trump floor plans
Media cannot resist a negative Trump story so they publish this everywhere and inadvertently also prime the public that Clinton email files and Pope Francis files were stolen
The media has taken the bait and laid the backstory for the coming leaks on Clinton and the Pope
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Trump floor plan was added so it wouldn't look like a false flag. As in he was hurt by this too.

       Cryptome has published a whole hell of a lot of Trump Tower floor plans and blueprints in the past... it would be interesting if the same floor plans are the ones that "oh noes got leaked"... already in the wild... just not well known by the public... so no real damage.

       Scare tactics... maybe even encouragement for an assassination attempt... they have also posted on their website a whole bunch of pictures of Trump's security detail in a wide variety of settings... closeups of earpieces... weapons... vehicles... Sketchy collection of stuff... From VX nerve gas to K9 units.

       That was kind of what I picked up on as well.  Didn't want to go there with it though....  Does Cryptome have a political agenda?  I first learned about them in reference to the first guccifer (now THERE'S a fascinating subject I wish there was more discussion about).

       Yeah.. if you check out their twitterfeed it is just non-stop anti-Trump memes pretty much... custom made "grown up" memes... but memes nonetheless... I'd be worried if it didn't appear that no one gives enough of a fuck about them to even leave a comment on any of their tweets.

       Cryptome and Julian Assange used to be buds, but ended up having a tiff a long while back.

       Did not know this. Definitely makes sense now. This is exactly why the media plastered this laptop story everywhere, as a scare tactic against Trump and his family and hoping to fan the flame for an assassination. Little did they know they were being played.

       I'm not sure if I missed any developments in the case in the last 8 hours since I talked about it before... but my gut says the laptop is GPS tracked and the SS dropped some hints via a few purposefully "loose lips" to goad someone into stealing it so they can trace the chain of evidence from physical theft to publication and bust everyone along the line that might be guilty.

       The WH has been doing some weird things to catch leakers. A week or two ago on /pol/ someone came on telling us they were an insider and that a news story would drop at 12pm the next day and advised us trend #morefakenews right after it dropped. Sure enough, a fake story came out about an "insider" having a document showing Trump sending in a crazy number of the national guard to deport illegal immigrants. It turns out he passed memos around to people he thought were leakers with different numbers of national guards in these memos, to see who would leak it.

       Look at the first picture sent as an attachment... the one named... 20151025_191141_resized.jpg... Zoom... Enhance... check check out he hand in the foreground... bandaids on the bulk of the pinky... just like John Podesta's "Spirit Cooking" ritualistic cutting... Gotta just be a coincidence right?

       The spirit cooking instructions say to cut the middle finger of the left hand. SO... probably not. Good eye, though.

       Yeah but I'm sure you've seen the pictures of Podestas hands... one pinky is totally butchered... and the other one is pretty scarred as well... Spirit Cooking is prolly like Scientology... you get the newbie shit for free on YouTube then once yer fully invested they bring out the "higher learning" techniques for the devout.
