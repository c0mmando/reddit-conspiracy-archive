        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know some &#39;conspirators&#39; don&#39;t believe this <em>could</em> happen, but we should at least consider this as a possibility. So much is happening now, it&#39;s easy to <em>ignore</em> the &quot;extra&quot; SHTF being hidden.</p>

<p>&quot;Employers could impose hefty penalties on employees who decline to participate in genetic testing as part of workplace wellness programs if a bill approved by a U.S. House committee this week becomes law.</p>

<p>In general, employers don&#39;t have that power under existing federal laws, which protect genetic privacy and nondiscrimination. But a bill passed Wednesday by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce would allow employers to get around those obstacles if the information is collected as part of a workplace wellness program.</p>

<p>Such programs — which offer workers a variety of carrots and sticks to monitor and improve their health, such as lowering cholesterol — have become increasingly popular with companies. Some offer discounts on health insurance to employees who complete health-risk assessments. Others might charge people more for smoking. Under the Affordable Care Act, employers are allowed to discount health insurance premiums by up to 30 percent — and in some cases 50 percent — for employees who voluntarily participate in a wellness program where they&#39;re required to meet certain health targets.</p>

<p>The bill is under review by other House committees and still must be considered by the Senate. But it has already faced strong criticism from a broad array of groups, as well as House Democrats. In a letter sent to the committee earlier this week, nearly 70 organizations— representing consumer, health and medical advocacy groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, AARP, March of Dimes and the National Women&#39;s Law Center — said the legislation, if enacted, would undermine basic privacy provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act and the 2008 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).</p>

<p>Congress passed GINA to prohibit discrimination by health insurers and employers based on the information that people carry in their genes. There is an exception that allows for employees to provide that information as part of voluntary wellness programs. But the law states that employee participation must be entirely voluntary, with no incentives for providing the data or penalties for not providing it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the employer mandates participation in their wellness program and considers genetic testing integral to that participation, then I suppose you could lose your job if you refused.  They could also make non-wellness participants pay higher premiums or make employer insurance available to only those who participate.  </p>

<p>If this is Rep. Foxx&#39;s (R-NC) best solution to decreasing medical costs, perhaps she should also sponsor a bill requiring Congressional members to undergo intelligence testing.  Something tells me that would kill two &quot;bills&quot; with one stone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They just want everyone&#39;s DNA on file. No big deal folks right? We are just monitoring your health for you so we can tell you whats best for you.</p>

<p>Our rights are crumbling away so fast I almost believe they are trying to incite a violent revolution. And my faith in trump is almost gone. He can veto shit like this but doesn&#39;t. I just don&#39;t know where we go from here. How can we stop the plan that has been put in motion. It feels like war is coming and trump will be the &quot;bad guy&quot; to reinstate the draft because of some shit reason such as &quot;We really found the real bad guys this time lets get them&quot;.</p>

<p>Some corruption arrests would play into the theory of buying credibility to only fuck us harder down the road. If it shows any sign of being a limited hangout I might just go full on prepper style and stockpile enough food and supplies to run a small community for when shit hits the  fan.</p>

<p>He can&#39;t just veto everything. Do you know how a Presidential veto works?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Article I, section 7 of the Constitution grants the President the authority to veto legislation passed by Congress. This authority is one of the most significant tools the President can employ to prevent the passage of legislation.</p>
