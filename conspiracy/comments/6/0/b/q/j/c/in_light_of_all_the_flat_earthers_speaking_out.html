       If the Earth is flat, everything we understand about space, the sun, the moon, stars, etc. Is no longer valid and all of the science/math behind those things is false. If we truly live on a flat Earth surrounded by a bubble, it would mean someone HAD to have put the bubble there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a Flat Earther (Earth is definitely hollow as is every planet) but I think Flat Earth Theory argues that there are no other planets (even though you can get a telescope and see them yourself) and that's all part of the conspiracy to hide God

       That's a possibility but you can determine curvature by measuring the distance between you and a mountain, calculate versus altitude and determine if the earth is curved based on how much of the mountain you can see. Or see ships on the horizon drop below it. Otherwise with a telescope you could see them forever.

       i get that. and honestly i think im on another type of "idea".... i mean our eyes are convex right? so wouldn't our reality have a lense distortion of some sorts? and as u moved away from the flat earth it begins to curve and form a sphere? just spouting haha

       IF the earth was flat, it would have pretty big implications for humanity. Perhaps it's these implications they keep hidden on a ball Earth. Lay-lines on a flat earth map, compared to them on a round earth.

       It's to hide God from man. Flat Earth has a lot of history in religion. Every Flat Earther that I've asked this question has told me its another trick by the devil to get you to doubt God's existence and buy into science. If the Earth is flat and we have a huge firmament surrounding us, it becomes much easier to accept the idea of God.

       It's getting more exposure so more people fall for it. You CANNOT EVER reason with a flat earther. No amount of evidence or photographs or videos or the fact the stars in different hemispheres or the fact you can circumnavigate the globe right now matter to them. To them earth is flat even though the original earth shape conspiracy was to keep it flat by corrupt religious leaders who wanted to keep people uneducated to stay in power.

       round earth is known to anyone who has been on a ship at sea, guess that's not too many of us, anymore... Also known to anyone who has circumnavigated the globe... on a flat earth, this would be impossible, no?

       there are a multitude of reasons, here are some of my favorites. Let's say the earth isn't what they say, maybe not flat earth, but reality itself isn't as we're taught, why?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're in a simulation and there is an artificial boundary that was set within the simulation, what we know as the North/South poles, if people knew that we were sims, or at least part of a simulation, that would fundamentally change life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth has been around so so much longer than the round earth, and as much as people want to say we have satellite photos proving the earth is round, the truth is every single one of those photos is created via CGI, None of us have ever seen a Raw picture of our planet. If it is flat earth, that plays into what God, religion, tells us about our earth, that it is fixed and unmoveable, that there is a firmament and waters above. If it's true, that the world is flat and that there is a barrier that is unseeable to the eye but physically impassable, it would show definitely once and for all, without doubt, that there was/is a creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all leads us into dangerous territory, why, if there is a firmament, did the government literally slam nuke after nuke into it? what were they hoping to achieve, could that have killed/ended everything, why would the government have spent billions upon billions on a space program, when in 'reality' it would have been a psyop program.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are SO many reasons to lie and keep it secret, if only just to stop people from giving up on governments and society as it is now, if we knew this was a simulation, or that there was a definitive creator and our 'leaders' have been intentionally spitting in the creator's eye, would people stand idly by? would they support it, even with all the lies and manipulation that's been pulled on us all.

       You're asking the right questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does seem silly to
       <em>
        intentionally
       </em>
       create a flat Earth conspiracy. And yet here we are in a world where some people believe the world is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was intent, I could imagine the idea behind it being that humans aren't going to be allowed to elevate until everyone is on the same page. As long as humans are out there believing in a flat Earth, all humans are classified as primitive non-sentient beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       But... in reality... it's more likely the conspiracy took hold incidently and organically. Because why not? Why wouldn't having thrown as much shit to the wall as possible, that
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of it may stick? It just happens to be flat Earth, it could have just as easily been Two Moons or Atlantis.
