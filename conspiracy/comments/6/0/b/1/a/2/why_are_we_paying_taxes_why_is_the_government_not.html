        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you look at this forum or any other forum, you can see the political debate raging on.  We&#39;re fighting, arguing, debating on shit that doesnt fix any of the problems, it turns out to be, youre a shill, democrat, bot, republican response shit storm.  I saw this thread posted somewhere else with a very simple IDEA to prove that no one in the US government has our interest at heart and there is an &quot;IDEA&quot; that can fix it.  That IDEA is a space elevator.  Before you guys go off on your rant about the government wont pay us to live here, theres already proof with the State of Alaska</p>

<p>Heres the idea/simple plan for people to think about</p>

<p>The US government has the capacity to do the following:</p>

<p>Year 1-2: build space elevator
Year 3:</p>

<p>(1) deploy enough solar panels to produce $20 trillion worth of power per year
(2) retrieve several asteroids with tens of trillions of minerals</p>

<p>Year 4:</p>

<p>Pay off solar panel purchase, space elevator purchase, and now have $20T income stream from power generation alone</p>

<p>With funds from selling asteroid mineral wealth, begin paying for the terraforming of Mars </p>

<p>Year 5: </p>

<p>(1) With new $20T income stream, taxes are cut to 0% across the board, national debt is paid off
(2) Orbital rings are deployed on Moon and Mars, the beginning of terraforming process on Mars</p>

<p>Year 6:</p>

<p>(1) having paid the national debt off with power generation income stream, government can now afford to issue $25,000 checks to each American every year while maintaining current spending and spending an additional $25,000 per person on infrastructure
(2) A vast array of projects on Earth are initiated including NAWAPA while the orbital ring system is expanded to a global hyperloop transportation grid</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>The point being, we have the technological ability to be living in what is practically a post-scarcity economic utopia within 8 years. This stuff is all easy, off the shelf technology.</p>

<p>What the SJWs and the alt-right have in common is that they both recognize something is deeply wrong in the world. Society is broken. Your regime is cheating you and denying your rightful future.</p>

<p>The question is will you allow this to continue, will you be placated by a daddy promising to keep you safe from CIA sponsored terrorism - or will you demand actual good governance? </p>

<p>No one who can go from the wretchedness of today to walking on a terraformed Mars 7 or 8 years hence will have time to entertain the ramblings of a SJW. But, everyone knows deep down they are being denied their future. And they will turn, increasingly so, to anyone who lashes out at the regime if this future does not materialize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we are not able to build space elevator yet or mine asteroids affordably.  That you call it easy, off the shelf technology is laughable.  Not only that, but if they managed to bring tens of trillions of dollars worth of material back from an asteroid, they would not be able to put it all on the market and sell it at once like you propose without flooding the market and tanking the prices of the materials.  </p>

<p>Even if somehow they were able to do all of that, they would not in any way be able to do things like terraform mars or build orbital rings on the timeframes you are talking about, regardless of how much money they threw at the problem.  Even if they had infinite money, they would not accomplish these things in that timeframe.  Absolutely ridiculous/misinformed.</p>

<p>Weve had the ability to build a space elevator since we sent the first rocket into space.  Think about it besides what the media tells you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I might not have a degree yet, but I&#39;m at least studying mechanical engineering right now, and your post actually gave me heart palpitations. </p>

<p>The space elevator is something of an engineering curiosity, because while it&#39;s a novel idea of getting things into orbit without burning fuel, we just don&#39;t have advanced enough materials to build something that tall without it collapsing or making it too expensive or material intensive. You know how it&#39;s a big deal whenever a city gets to claim it has the new tallest skyscraper? That&#39;s because it&#39;s a huge feat of design to make something that tall. It&#39;s not this big secret coverup, otherwise, every city out there would be trying to get their hands on this magic super strong alloy or polymer that can support buildings that large. It&#39;s just not reasonably possible to fund or build right now. </p>

<p>As far as asteroid mining goes, NASA <em>does</em> have plans to bring an asteroid back for mining, but it&#39;s decades out. A lot of problems have to be solved first:
- You would need to be able to land/anchor on to one in the first place, something that&#39;s never been done before</p>

<ul>
<li><p>New tools have to be made that can mine ore in little to no gravity </p></li>
<li><p>You need a large ship that can transport enough ore back to make it profitable like you&#39;re claiming, which means a new type of rocket has to be funded, designed and built, unlike any we&#39;ve made before</p></li>
<li><p>All of this needs to be justified to a board of directors if it&#39;s a private company, or in NASA&#39;s case, the government, which takes time and money to approve. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So for all of these reasons, it&#39;s really just not feasible to build an elevator or mine asteroids in that time frame you gave. There&#39;s just too many new things that need to be built and implemented, and that takes time. Even if we had a miracle material we could make a space elevator out of, it has to be approved in congress (if it&#39;s a government project), contracted, designed, built and so on, and then you have to consider the time frames for getting ready to mine asteroids too!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont understand the lack of imagination or creativity of people today.</p>

<p>These are GOOD PROBLEMS to have.  I would have these problems on designing solutions to new exciting things that will benefit everyone then continue reading about negativity of the lastest Trump Tweet or the Failed Healthcare or Marijuana Legalization issue</p>

<p>It does not need to be approved by Congress... The President could ask congress, The President could sign an executive order for the money or the building of it,  or if he/she didnt get the money that way, The president could send armed marines into the Fed and ask for a check.  These are simple problems if you learn to think outside the box of what is going on</p>

<p>Stop with the limiting beliefs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I appreciate all the ways we could fund this, but you do realize the design issues with what you&#39;re saying, right?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have the infrastructure to do this yet. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible, but for God&#39;s sake, just google the design challenges involved in building a tether for the space elevator. Really, do ten minutes of research on the tether issue for the space elevator, not only is it fascinating, but it&#39;s an excellent example of only one of the design challenges in the way of the space elevator that make it simply impossible to build at the moment. Not to mention, if something that large had a structural failure and collapsed, it would devastate an area the size of Texas, I think it was.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to limit beliefs, but you have to understand there are reasons this hadn&#39;t been funded to build. Even if the president marched into the fed with an army of marines, got money, got a company to build it, the project would stop there. The space elevator just can&#39;t be constructed yet within a reasonable amount of time or money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t build a 300km space elevator...</p>

<p>Maybe you should learn a bit more about how a space elevator works before you start telling everyone we can build one in 2 years.  A space elevator needs to be longer than 36,000 km in order to pass the point of geosynchronous orbit (and a bit further to have a counter weight).</p>

<p>If you think you can make a space elevator in 2 years and only 300km long, please please please publish your plans.  If you&#39;re that much smarter than everyone else who&#39;s working on the problem, we need your input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention, the attractiveness of a space elevator as a terrorism or wartime target would make it extremely difficult to protect.  If one country suddenly had a $20 trillion-dollar revenue stream, you can bet the resulting destabilization of the world economy would be significant enough to produce extraordinary animosity.</p>

<p>On a pure engineering level, I am given to understand that space elevators are not possible without the ability to produce multiple-miles-long nanotubes.</p>

The sheer volume of air and water needed for so many people? It would not be an easy endeavor - yet it would be one of the easiest challenges such a project would face. Even a space elevator - we&#39;re so far from a structurally sound space elevator, and it would have to be sound. A failed space elevator could have serious consequences for a lot of people, depending on the design. Such a thing is still very speculative and theoretical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How dare you! How dare you, sir. Are you implying that the reason why my rocket didn&#39;t work is because I was too stupid to follow the instructions? I&#39;ll have you know that I&#39;m excellent at following instructions. I put together an Ikea dresser and it still stands today, even though one of the drawers won&#39;t fully close. But that&#39;s because Ikea is made by incompetent communists. I did my best as an American. Are you an American? It&#39;s people like you that are the reason we&#39;ll never build a space elevator. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to have to tell you to fuck off after reading War and Peace, an important novel you&#39;ve probably never read. I&#39;ve read 100 pages today, which is further in a book than I&#39;ve ever read in one day before. That&#39;s a personal best, and I&#39;ve accomplished it purely to spite you! It&#39;s called personal enrichment. You should really try it sometime, especially if you&#39;re stressed. I know I am. I suggest any of the novels on this list. They&#39;re all classics! </p>
