        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not willing to accept RT or NPR as propaganda, and if anything, NPR is closer.  Both are funded by their respective governments, and both claim to be independent from government.  RT is a reputable news sight pretty much everywhere but the US.  But when they started to have anti-Obama stories, it became Russia propaganda. Ben Swann used to be an anchor for RT, and I respect his journalistic integrity over most in MSM today.  Their stories seem to be journalism, and I find it harder to notice a slant in their stories than say Fox News or CNN.      </p>

<p>Flynn receiving $$$ from RT might be suspect, but I&#39;d like to get a full and accurate account of general standard operating procedures.  When MSM only focuses on Trump side and doesn&#39;t factor in all sides, it makes it impossible for me to know if Flynn receiving cash from RT is even an anomaly.  The Clinton speeches around uranium deal seem much more nefarious.  The MSM still doesn&#39;t get that we can&#39;t be forced to just accept what they say as fact, and it is not a given that anything RT does is the Russian government--especially when we aren&#39;t willing to accept the same premise for NPR. </p>

Close to 90% for npr so I just don&#39;t see how they would be beholden to government spin when serving the public is in their best interest financially.

<p>NPR only gets about 20% of their funding from private individuals. Most of their money comes from exactly what u/outtanutmeds said. Big banks, auto manufacturers, visa, MasterCard. And one of the biggest is the corporation for public broadcasting which was created by congress and is funded by the the fed.</p>

<p>Dude, that&#39;s not propaganda. That&#39;s people who study politics and elections giving thier opinion. Of course their all gonna hop on Hillary&#39;s dick, she has a long track record and looked like the likely candidate. Berine did surprisingly well, and got lots of attention but much like the Election, Hillary proved more likeable in the end, because (in case you didnt notice cause you were too busy eating pizza or something with the rest of this sub) she had been for months. People weren&#39;t brainwashed into it, they agreeded willing.</p>

<p>Propaganda would be if NPR had only members of Hiliary&#39;s campaign team come on and tell you that Berine was going to eat your babies, all the time with no desenting opinion ever.</p>

<p>Just becauase someone doesnt think Hiliary is the literall anti christ doesn&#39;t mean thier in on some conspiracy. Opinion=Progaganda</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I can&#39;t disagree with anything you just said there. </p>

<p>To me it looks like they work to minimize negative stuff that is revealed about CIA, either through omission or by downplaying the importance of what is learned. </p>

<p>The recent Wikileak about CIA hacking for instance was mostly ignored by claiming it was all known. A week before if you made that claim, you would be called a conspiracy theorist, but upon being presented with actual proof, the narrative shifted to &quot;we all know that!&quot; Nevermind there was next to zero focus on the fact that the real concern should be all these techniques are out in the wild for anyone to use BECAUSE the CIA was compromised. Instead all of this is buried in favor of the Trump outrage of the day.</p>

<p>Also, I wouldn&#39;t use RT to get honest news, the same way I don&#39;t trust MSM to report on a majority of things. You might think I am trying to raise RT up to how you view MSM, but I am really saying MSM and RT are similar and neither is deserving of trust.</p>

<p>Ironic you should say that! I work for a major corporation in a department closely related to security. When the news came out, it was a massive shit show around here, and they have since changed a large number of procedures as a result.

<p>I&#39;m not willing to accept RT or NPR as propaganda, and if anything, NPR is closer. Both are funded by their respective governments, and both claim to be independent from government. RT is a reputable news sight pretty much everywhere but the US. But when they started to have anti-Obama stories, it became Russia propaganda. Ben Swann used to be an anchor for RT, and I respect his journalistic integrity over most in MSM today. Their stories seem to be journalism, and I find it harder to notice a slant in their stories than say Fox News or CNN.</p>

<p>i mean, this paragraph is frightening in so many ways. the OP thinks that RT has a broad reputation better than NPR? the OP thinks that RT was only bad when it became anti-obama? the OP thinks that RT is critical of putin? these sound awfully a lot like wikileaks talking points too .. <em>oh, we didn&#39;t leak on russia because they have a vibrant press!</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_journalists_killed_in_Russia#Under_Putin_.28incl._2nd_Chechen_conflict.29">yeah, right</a>. this is either someone delivering disinformation or just a brainwashed rube.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The newest version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has an amendment added that negates the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 (SMA) and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These laws made propaganda used to influence foreigners and US citizens illegal. Without these laws, disinformation could run rampant throughout our information junkets.</p>

<p>This amendment added to the NDAA has passed into implementation as of this month.</p>

<p>SMA defines the prohibition of domestic access to influence information through a variety of means, from broadcast to publishing of books, media, and online sources by restricting the State Department.</p>

<p>The Broadcasting Board of Governors was created from SMA. This agency claims to “inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy”. They omit that their specialty is making sure propaganda is added to the informational flow we all depend on.</p>

<p>The amendment sanctions the US government, without restriction, the use of any mode of message to control how we perceive our world.</p>

<p>As of now, the level of propaganda in the mainstream media (MSM) is quite high, with all of our television, printed media and internet sites associated with MSM owned by only 5 corporations.</p>

<p>Without these laws, the lies purveyed as truth to foreigners would find their way to our doorsteps as a purposeful operation enacted by our government. And in the name of national security, the US government could, and probably would, disseminate misinformation to gain public support for otherwise decidedly deplorable actions.</p>

<p>Amendment 114 of the NDAA was approved by the House in May of 2012.</p>

<p>The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act (2012) reads:</p>

<p>Sec. 501. (a) The Secretary and the Broadcasting Board of Governors are authorized to use funds appropriated or otherwise made available for public diplomacy information programs to provide for the preparation, dissemination, and use of information intended for foreign audiences abroad about the United States, its people, and its policies, through press, publications, radio, motion pictures, the Internet, and other information media, including social media, and through information centers, instructors, and other direct or indirect means of communication.</p>

<p>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary and the Broadcasting Board of Governors may, upon request and reimbursement of the reasonable costs incurred in fulfilling such a request, make available, in the United States, motion pictures, films, video, audio, and other materials prepared for dissemination abroad or disseminated abroad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand what the ego is because you contradicted yourself pretty quickly there. Stop thinking of people with differing opinions as &quot;middle schoolers&quot; and if you really <em>want</em> to change some minds, it would probably be better if you didn&#39;t choose to come off as demeaning. Instead, consider others opinions as equally stupid as yours, and just look at the facts. </p>

<p>You chose to ignore the facts when they were presented to you rather than acknowledge them. Instead, you consider your word to be almighty and infallible. That&#39;s egotistical as fuck man. </p>

<p>We all understand that the CIA has been using the media to influence for decades. But now, alternative media gave Obama a reason to get a tighter grip on the media they currently control. </p>

<p>Just stop being a dick and listen to others and you might not like what you hear, but that doesn&#39;t make it incorrect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All day erry day. But the best stuff comes from WNYC - Invisibilia, Freaknomics Radio, Radio Lab. WBEZ is pretty good - This American Life frequently has very interesting stories, and though not an NPR program, Sarah Koenig&#39;s &quot;Serial&quot; is fantastic, she used to work with TAL.  I&#39;m not as into the NPR News stuff - thats where a lot of Propaganda By Omission seems to be - Morning Edition, All Things Considered. I dont want to say more because you could probably dox someone based on listening habits. I entirely recommend the WNYC stuff, apart from On The Media which is almost a literal &quot;how-to&quot; guide for spreading propaganda directed at podcasters and bloggers. In fact that may be a terrific place to start listening if you doubt my assertion about propaganda in NPR - its also an infuriating show to listen to at times because it can be awfully blatant. Anyway - Im a democrat that listens to NPR all the time because it has thought provoking material, and I kind of tune out what they say regarding news, when Diane Rehm reported that Sanders had a rally of &gt;23k people and tripped over herself to say Clinton held a rally of similar size as if she had to say something to that effect or be shot, I gave up entirely on NPR &quot;News&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying that Clinton got more votes, while technically accurate, is kinda shitty when considering the tens of thousands (very conservative estimate) of people that were unable to vote in the primary. Having those votes not count not only inflates the difference, it certainly altered the subsequent voters attitude about Sanders&#39; legitimacy as a candidate. A tie in Iowa (first caucus) and a Sanders landslide in New Hampshire meant Nevada had real repercussions. Lots and lots of shady stuff happened in Nevada and ended up going Clinton. But had Nevada gone to Sanders the race would have proceeded differently - not to say it would have a different end result, but it would definitely have been different as both campaigns adjusted strategies. So many are upset about the claim regarding the popular vote in the primary. </p>

<p>Conversely, the general election uses the Electoral College which can allow for some pants-on-head madness but they are the agreed upon rules. Whereas the DNC primary violated several of the agreed upon rules. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Americans don&#39;t, but some factions in the Democratic party weren&#39;t too keen on the primary structure of the Democratic National Committee&#39;s way of selecting their candidate (which mostly stems from their use of unbound or Superdelegates who help decide the nomination regardless of who voted in the State primaries (there are 50 of them). The DNC has no actual connection to the US Government  (besides their members working in it, if you will).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but are okay with President Trump winning with less votes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>DJT won the electoral college vote with a total of 303 votes IIRC. According to the US Constitution, a majority of EC votes is required to achieve a victory for the Presidency. It has absolutely nothing to do with the total amount of votes each candidate receives and entirely on how each State voted. These are apples and oranges, and many on the &#39;losing side&#39; are upset because this election was likely the first for an entire generation who are now &#39;political aware&#39; (and relevant). </p>

<p>The main issue arises (IMHO) due to a lack of education on proper US Civics  (and the less-than-democratic way the Democratic National Committee chooses their candidate for President each year).</p>

I found them because they were the only major news source that was covering the content of Podesta email leaks (I read the emails myself I just wanted to see who was actually covering it).  I&#39;ve also seen articles from both sides of the political spectrum.  As long as you can verify the facts, does it matter if it&#39;s Russian propaganda or not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe RT does a much better job discussing US news and global news than the MSM (which does a horrific one sided job).</p>

<p>They have hired respectable Americans  aND have on better guests and discuss issues from multiple viewpoints from voices the MSM will never have on.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t ever trust them to report news on Russia or Russian related topics, but I am satisfied with their coverage on a lot of other issues. They cover topics MSM literally will never discuss and that is valuable.</p>

<p>I have heard more shit about Democratic and liberals on NPR since 2001 than I have seen from Fox News.  Really nasty attacks that are worded so that conservatives used to Infowars and 
Fox and the radio folks  and others, think they are liberal.  </p>

<p>NPR, where all their so called &quot;liberal,&quot; experts are from libertarian and conservative think tanks like AEI, CATO, and Heritage foundation. </p>

<p>Less than 25% of their funding is from tax money so NPR now must rely on the wealthy conservative organizations for funding.  It is tax supported propaganda, but it is conservative propaganda, not liberal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Silly Reddit, we don&#39;t call it propaganda, we call it public relations.</p>

<p>(But seriously in the 20s there was a guy named Edward Bernays who was a nephew of Sigmund Freud. Freud sent Bernays his texts on the ego, superego and id, which essentially concluded that man was not a rational creature, as was the popular belief at the time, but an irrational animal ruled by primal desires. Bernays was the first person to apply this sort of thought to groups of people, and he became the king of marketing for his pioneering techniques of crowd control. Similarly, he admired Nazi propaganda, having seen Germany&#39;s astonishing recovery of national prosperity and pride after WWI, and he wondered if Nazi propaganda techniques could be used in peacetime. It turns out they could! But he couldn&#39;t call it propaganda.... He would have to come up with a new name. So he coined the term &quot;public relations,&quot; and now every corporation and government in the world has a public relations department. Just let that sink in for a second. Anyone who&#39;s interested in this line of thought and has a few hours should watch the excellent documentary called &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s">Century of the Self</a>,&quot; produced by the BBC&#39;s Adam Curtis. You will never look at the world the same way. It&#39;s utterly eye-opening.)</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin, who is known as Vladimir the Ruthless, using all his profanity on national TV, you name it. We won’t read the profanity here but we’ve got it — this person is on an unbelievable power trip and resembles a demon. He is a creature of the IMF and the World Bank and International Communism. He is a former KGB head and this information is vital ladies and gentleman. We’re seeing the New World Order really come out in full force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really agree. Have been impressed with the variety of views from all over the political spectrum RT has on and lets speak their mind.  It&#39;s much better quality than MSM which would cut to commercial after 30 seconds of meaningful debate because the viewpoints are threatening to the status quo and political class.  The MSM does enormous damage  to this country.  They are gatekeepers of vital points of view and important information and they manufacture consent for our own enslavement while the majority of people have no idea it&#39;s even happening.  I think people underestimate the enormous effect propaganda and msm has on the nation.  They control the debate.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t trust RT to report on Russian issues though but that&#39;s me. I think overall they do a good job of having contrasting viewpoints on and letting them speak their mind.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The establishment left in general was key in blocking Sanders in the media, and that goes for CNN, MSNBC, NPR, and many others as well. The establishment left is a very powerful and well-connected organization that has its tentacles spread throughout all facets of media, aside from perhaps more independent media sources. It&#39;s a combination of corruption and manipulation....actually convincing people that Clinton is the better/more-qualified candidate for the Democrat party. So you have some people who blocked Sanders perhaps because they have a vested financial interest in Clinton becoming president, and there are others who are simply drinking the kool-aid being served to them by those with a vested interest.</p>

<p>We saw the same exact shit happen with Ron Paul on the Republican side just a few years ago...they&#39;d do anything to stop him from rising to the top of the field. I saw that shit first-hand since I was a volunteer for Paul&#39;s campaign...the establishment Republicans HATED Paul and his supporters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paul is the one who first got me interested in politics back during the 2008 presidential elections. Like Sanders, I could just tell that Paul was an intelligent, well-read person who was genuinely interested in helping people...he wasn&#39;t in it for himself at all. He was principled and wasn&#39;t bought off by lobbyists like nearly every other politician these days. He spoke out against our overly-militant foreign policy and &quot;nation-building&quot;, and wasn&#39;t afraid to say things that might&#39;ve been unpopular within his Republican base.</p>

<p>I definitely think there&#39;s a lot of overlap between Paul and Sanders supporters, and unfortunately I think Trump preyed on those same &quot;anti-establishment&quot; voices from our voting public. But Trump, imo, was never actually genuine about wanting to help people...he&#39;s just too obsessed with benefiting himself. He knows how to market himself, and when up against someone like Clinton he saw the perfect opportunity to try and snatch up some of those Sanders/Paul supporters by appearing as the &quot;populist&quot; candidate. But he&#39;s FAR from a populist.</p>

<p>Ideally, I&#39;d love to see the Sanders/Paul supporters break away from the two-party system altogether and form a new party that focuses on getting the influence of money out of our political system. That&#39;s the only way anything will ever get accomplished these days that&#39;s <em>actually</em> in the best interest of the general public rather than just the rich and powerful. Unfortunately, the establishment left/right has such a strong grip on the media and political discourse in this country...which makes it VERY hard for a third party to rise up. But we need a third party now more than ever before in this nation&#39;s history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly what I would like to see happen as well. Neither R&#39;s nor D&#39;s are interested in disrupting the status quo. With money in politics our whole system becomes corrupt to its core. Eventually millennials will take the stage on being the major voting class, and a populist will emerge. Unfortunately, I think it will be some time before we can lessen the grip TPTB have. Hopefully it&#39;s not too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but I disagree.  I don&#39;t care about some zither player from Patagonia.  </p>

<p>The fact is, NPR used to have some measure of investigative journalism, and they don&#39;t any longer.  It is far from a liberal stronghold, it just maintains that illusion.  What they do now is simply pretend to cover issues that matter to people, but really they cover what the billionaire class wants them to.  NPR is propaganda now, and it&#39;s obvious to people who listen on a regular basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re entitled to your opinion...I&#39;m just saying that obviously there ARE a lot of people who enjoy NPR&#39;s programming choices even if you personally do not. Some people enjoy listening to talk radio but don&#39;t enjoy being barraged constantly by political talk. So those people appreciate more diversity in NPR&#39;s programming...whether it&#39;s random non-political stories about people no one&#39;s ever heard about or interviews with artists/musicians. I&#39;m the type of person who listens to a lot of different shit when I&#39;m in my car. I even used to listen to people like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity daily even though I disagreed with them about almost everything. I also disagree with a lot of NPR&#39;s politics (I can&#39;t stand the Clintons, for example), but I sometimes enjoy their random little stories about people and artist interviews. It&#39;s fine if you don&#39;t enjoy that stuff since you don&#39;t have to listen to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol... Why am I not surprised to find one of Putin&#39;s favorite talking points on the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My local NPR affiliated station has a few pledge drives a year. A lot of that money goes directly to pay licensing fees to NPR. NPR only get&#39;s something like 10% of its funding directly from the federal government.</p>

<p>Tell me, OP, how much money does RT get from its federal government and how much does it get from locally funded pledge drives?</p></li>
<li><p>NPR journalists mostly work in a country (the US) where journalists don&#39;t get killed on a regular basis:</p>

<ul>
<li>Journalists killed in Russia since 1992 (motive confirmed/unconfirmed): 56/24 <strong>(80 total)</strong></li>
<li>Journalists killed in USA since 1992 (motive confirmed/unconfirmed): 7/2 <strong>(9 total)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Source: <a href="https://cpj.org/killed/">https://cpj.org/killed/</a></p>

<p>Now, please tell me OP, how much press freedom do US journalists enjoy compared to Russia? Do you really think that your local NPR affiliate is afraid of getting murdered for what he reporst?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We know that Russia&#39;s strength isn&#39;t in there military defense. Trump&#39;s increase in military spending alone is almost enough to eclipse Russia&#39;s entire defense spending (which Putin has actually cut).</p>

<p>Russia&#39;s strengths are in &quot;cyber-&quot; related warfare (espionage, disiniformation, trolling, state-sponsored blogs, etc). USA&#39;s strengths are in raw military strength (weapons, drones, soldiers, ships, etc).</p>

<p>When I see posts like this dominate the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, its clear to me that Russia&#39;s cyber-warfare game is strong. One of Trump&#39;s former campaign managers gets accused by his own daughter of killing people in the Ukraine, and this shitpost reaches the front page in an effort to slide the conversation with whataboutism and deflection.</p>

<p>Spot on. It&#39;s pretty clear in the anti-immigrant stuff going around lately.  I&#39;m not a big fan of Islam, but the picture the right is painting is of savages who all wake up and dream of destroying America. If you&#39;re uneducated and do no research.. I can understand why that&#39;s motivation to search out more divisive information to validate the views. </p>

<p>Control the flow of information, discourage research and discredit large media.. and you&#39;re left with a bunch of angry emotional people who&#39;ll believe whatever they&#39;re fed. </p>

<p>The only people talking cold war are people like you trying to muddy up the water. I have nothing against Russia. I assume most/all countries are involved in some kind of espionage, defense building, secret experiments, etc.</p>

<p>Why is it that whenever Russia is brought up, suddenly everyone loses their shit? Two wrongs don&#39;t make a right. Just because the USA does it doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t <strong>ALSO</strong> discuss what other countries do. Regardless of how much people like you push back against it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>RT is Russian government propaganda just like NBC News and CNN cater to CIA propaganda. </p>

<p>&quot;Mainstream&quot; Media really should be called CIAstream media, because it&#39;s thoroughly infiltrated by the CIA. Famed reporter Carl Bernstein (of &quot;Woodward and Bernstein&quot; fame) wrote a famous piece in Rolling Stone Magazine in 1977 about the CIA&#39;s million tendrels into &quot;mainstream&quot; media. Here&#39;s a link to Bernstein&#39;s classic article: <a href="http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php">http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php</a></p>

<p>For example, The Washington Post is nothing more than a CIA rag, just like Pravda was the KGB&#39;s rag.</p>

<h1></h1>

<h1>I read in Deborah Davis&#39; truly excellent book called &quot;Katharine Graham and the Washington Post Empire&quot; (get the second edition with lots more info) how even long-time Washington Post Executive Editor Benjamin Bradlee worked for the C.I.A. in Europe in the 1950&#39;s.</h1>

<p>I think Putin and the Russian government act like criminals just like I think Bush and our government act like criminals. So regarding RT America, I think of myself as a cop. If a criminal tells a cop what another criminal is doing, the cop is going to listen. Lol. The cop is going to listen to both criminals to get the dirt on each :-)</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of propaganda and lies on RT America, just like there&#39;s also a lot of propaganda and lies on our own U.S. news programs, which didn&#39;t challenge the Bush administration&#39;s allegations of &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; in the lead-up to that unnecessary, financially costly to the U.S. taxpayer, and destructive war -- but a war that was very lucrative to the &quot;Defense&quot; contractors/weapons manufacturers and oil companies when oil prices skyrocketed.</p>

<p>RT America is infiltrated by the KGB (now called the FSB), and U.S. news programs are infiltrated by the C.I.A (what many people call the Central Lying Agency or the Central Propaganda Agency - Lol). Don&#39;t forget the &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; lie, the &quot;Missile Gap&quot; lie in the 1960s, and lots and lots of other lies I won&#39;t go into here.  </p>

<p>The CIA&#39;s Missile Gap lie in the 1960s (claiming the U.S. was behind the Soviets in the number of nuclear missiles) must have cost U.S. tax payers TRILLIONS of dollars.  The CIA&#39;s lie led to massive nuclear missile production to the point in the 1980s we had 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear warheads.  Thankfully, today, we&#39;re down to 6,000 or so.  Can anybody say they want their tax money back from the &quot;Defense&quot; Industry?  </p>

<p>The vast majority of our 20 Trillion dollar national debt is due to the CIA&#39;s / Military Industy&#39;s lies and their outright theft/stealing.  President Eisenhower&#39;s warning about the power of the Military Industrial Complex was so right.  The Military Industry steals 1 of every 2 dollars we give them through &quot;cost overruns&quot; and other shenanigans like $500 dollar hammers, etc. </p>

<p>Russia Today is not respected as media source in many countries besides US. It is joke in other European countries. The English version of RT tones down retoric for American audience. Its Russian broadcast is very much more heavy propaganda for Russian government. </p>

<p>I cannot find link to video, (I do honestly try) where short, very flashy 15 minute style story is about US/UN food aid program being tool of American aggression against Russia. </p>

<p>There are arguments to be make against US and UN policy but to complain that food aid to places like Africa and Haiti is done to attack Russia directly is very funny. </p>

<p>I was working in Saudi Arabia when I see this so I think this story is done in 2014 or 2015. I apologize for not finding direct link. </p>
