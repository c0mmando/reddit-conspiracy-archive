       Satanic Ritual Abuse, pictured

        here
       </a>
       as a piece of “art” in Comet Ping Pong, is very real. So, what is its purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets begin with a little thought experiment. Reduce all of existence to a mathematical equation. Thats asking quite a bit more than we are capable of, yeah? Instead, lets reduce a human being down to a mathematical equation, down to each molecule. Every chemical reaction fully expressed in mathematical formula, including the interaction with the whole body and the environment around it. That is quite a large equation….
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what about human consciousness? We aren’t at all close to understanding it on a mathematical level. How does the electrical and chemical movement of the brain translate into the immensely rich experiences we have? How much “math” is contained in a powerful emotion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the famous painting Mona Lisa. The physical properties of the paint and the frame could be reduced to math very simply, compared to a human body.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what about all of the “math” that was going on in the head of Da Vinci while he was vizualizing the work pre-creation, executing the strokes, determining the geometrical relationships, developing the occult significance? Then add the “math” of the visual input, emotional reactions, comments and criticisms of each person who has seen the Mona Lisa, all of the academic study, and all of the “math” needed to describe the stored memory of the Mona Lisa in the consciousness of each person who has heard of the work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats a pretty large equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we determine what is “real”, we have limited ourselves to what is observable with our senses. But when everything is reduced to math, would not the validity be placed on which set contains more information? Instead of which set can be perceived by an arbitrary subset (our consciousness) of the whole?
      </p>
      <p>
       From here on out in this series I will use the word “energy” instead of “math”. Do you get it? Do you agree?
      </p>
      <p>
       Occult Theory says that this energy is very real, exists on planes of reality which we cannot perceive with our five senses, and is equally or more valid to that which we can perceive.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a member of the Occult Elite is practicing magick, they are doing work on a plane of existence popularly known as Astral. Some groups call it other names. The Rosicicrucians, for example, called it the Plane of Desire. I’ll stick with Astral.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Astral plane is one of many such planes that intertwine with our own. It is the one containing all of the energy stored and released in our emotions, desires, actions, philosophies, relationships, fleeting thoughts and energetic bonds with each other, according to occult theory, And it is here that the Elite do their “work”.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, consider the negative energy stored in raping a child in ritual fashion designed to maximize fear, with the additional purpose of splintering their consciousness for mind control purposes. The victim must be experiencing in a second enough horror, pain and despair to last lifetimes. During this ritual, the Elite are in a state of meditation, using their consciousness to harvest, mold and channel this energy into their astral control grid, which keeps (most) of us hypnotized and unaware of their existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I'll end Part 1 here, leaving more questions raised than answered. I hope I’ve layed out a logical philosophy of energy and, at the very least, why the Elite use the occult and believe/perform magick. There is a LOT more material and specifics to cover :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for reading.

       Love and Light,

       The pineal gland does get activated by techniques like visualization, producing artwork, meditation and playful activities that involve improvisation. Beware the aluminum in soda cans; try not to drink flouridated water. Those things tend to shut down the pineal gland. You're not going to just be tuning into the various layers of the astral planes ( which tend to be unpleasant) but if you focus on love and laughter, you'll tap more into " the mind of God" type creative energy; genius energy; insight energy. Avoid psychedelics, especially ayahuasca. They can do great damage and really distort your awakening metaphysical senses.

       Cleaning the pineal gland by being very careful about what we put in our bodies, fostering positive thoughts, and studying the occult, will make you more in touch with all planes. The common phrase of "openening your pineal gland" falls short of describing the process. Its not like it pops open and you see auras and entities, although I think that development happens eventually. It starts with a heightened awareness with insights that are logically and experiencially valid.

       All of this is true except your description of the astral plane and where our desires and emotions come from. They definitely come from higher planes.

       I would like to know what the positive side of this equation is.  There is always balance. The universe is bipolar.  So if the elite occult can use magick to harm and create/expand their power, then there must be a positive "magic" or power that can create happiness, joy, compassion, love, forgiveness right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So how do we practice "good magic" to counter the "bad magic"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the elite would like us to be focused on the bad magic and feel fear.  They do not want us to learn the good magic to counter them and neutralize them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about good magic is, its free and you dont have to belong to some weird cult to practice it, but you do have to learn it.

       Active, projective love. Putting it everywhere. You can add ritual or symbolism or tools, or you can work with the benign and loving allies of nature like the Earth, the sun, the trees, the mineral, animal and water kingdoms. But ultimately it's love; beaming love energy combined with creation energy is also super powerful. Anybody telling you to make things more complicated has gotten addicted to a system, but the tools are extremely simple.

       it starts with meditation, withdrawing your senses from attachment to physical pleasures, and overcoming fear. Once someone masters this then they are a constant channel of love and light. The ones we consider prophets from various religions figured out how to do it, and the potential is in all of us.
