    <div class="md"><p>Haha that makes sense also, I was gonna have serious doubts if you were trying to claim you had &quot;lot&#39;s of PHD&#39;s, and I completely agree there are both really dumb individuals that have PHD&#39;s and there are really stupid majors to get a PHD in..... </p>

<p>I&#39;m finishing on my poli-sci undergrad (also an entirely useless degree by it self), It&#39;s so easy to spot the professors that are truly passionate about lecturing and research and sharing their knowledge, and which ones are professors because they completed a PHD in some niche focus and can&#39;t find work doing anything else but teaching that niche at 2nd &amp; 3rd rate universities </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the US that is the average for subjects like chemistry/bio.  It depends on where the funding is from - for something like NSF, the prof. will write in how much students cost, which the university also takes a cut of.  Your stipend is the equivalent of what I got (which is less than minimum wage considering the hours pit in...), and same in the US you don&#39;t have to pay tuition (which is a big part of the low stipends).  $33k is not typical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It being minimum wage isn&#39;t all that indicting considering I didn&#39;t pay for anything but food while there. It&#39;s like military payments, they seem minuscule until you realize that you literally pay for nothing. Plus I had employer incentives, which I suppose may mitigate my perception of it compared to whatever your experience was.</p>

<p>Trying to avoid actually asking your school, where is it placed ranking wise? Any friends of mine that ended up staying at Yale for their graduate school were getting around what I referenced earlier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a state school, but well ranked (in engineering).  That isn&#39;t the issue - I don&#39;t know the difference between UK and US programs.  Did you get free housing?  That is unheard of in the US.  </p>

<p>Part of my gripe with the US system is that overall the universities view all students as cash cows (the departments aren&#39;t to blame, they were just as fucked as the students by the system).  Where I was, I was &quot;out of state&quot; so all the funding we received had to take that into account (the university took more from the grants because of this - I costed more).  I took a job after finishing all the required credits but before defending.  The university had a rule of &quot;continuous enrollment&quot;, meaning that even though I was not even in the same state, I had to shell out ~$1500 in fees per semester during this period.  The only reason they do this is to get money. Fucking bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds rather specific to your school as far as fucking you for those fees per semester though. </p>

<p>I suppose looking back that perhaps that was something my employer paid for. Wasn&#39;t that long ago about my memory is borderline detrimental to my health so shit if I know without checking.</p>

<p>Still, I&#39;d say that the cash cow bit is certainly true. That&#39;s true overall, though. I guess I&#39;ll learn my lesson when I do my next masters since I&#39;m back in the US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Continuous enrollment is becoming pretty common (I just googled it).  In the US, you get fucked over the most in master&#39;s programs - if I were you I&#39;d go straight PhD, you can always leave after your masters.  (Unless you have a job paying for it?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I don&#39;t really have much interest in getting a phd right now. I did two masters programs (accelerated and certainly among the best choices I&#39;ve made) in the U.K./France. </p>

<p>The one program I want to do state side is a Masters in Commerce program at UVa (actually heavily attended by engineers iirc so I&#39;d check out if you could get it paid for down the line) and is more because I always wanted to do it more than anything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a hard sell for my employed though, since I decidedly do not work at all in commerce/management. Well maybe tertiary work in it but still. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Legal system is two-dimensional, 2D. To bring it to life, to give it agency, to make it 3D, it co-opts us humans through the Birth Certificate Fraud, the Legal Name Fraud and the Admiralty Law Fraud.

It is we who bring their fraud to fruition, by believing that their paper actually means anything. </p>
