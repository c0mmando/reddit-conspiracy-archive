Not so much as to why we haven&#39;t developed a cure yet (I have my own theories about that) but why it has become so prevalent, especially in the west. A study I read recently said that 1 in 7 Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Surely this ratio was much lower in decades past. Any thoughts as to what may be contributing to the rise in cancer victims? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s got to be something with the diet. The amount of processed and fast foods consumed by the average American is absurd. And to be honest we aren&#39;t completely sure what actually goes into those foods. </p>

<p>As for the cure, it&#39;s got to exist. There&#39;s no way in hell that a cure for cancer doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s just that there are too many people in the world. Think of it as a population control. Also, the cure would be sold at an absurd amount. These big pharma companies wouldn&#39;t allow it to be available everywhere. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s just my two sense (cents?). </p>

<p>Recently, I started the paleo diet, or whatever they are labeling it. I eat meat, i try for the grass fed, fish, and vegetables. I drink water, coffee, and some days vodka and club. That&#39;s it. The amount of energy I have is insane., my sleeping pattern is better, my just total outlook has brightened.</p>

<p>I always assumed that I would get cancer, since my momd died of it 5 years ago and my dad has it now, but maybe with this new way of living, I can avoid it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, it is 100% diet. Specifically, the lack of vitamin b17, which allows proliferation of fungus, which means even if the cancer tumors are removed with surgery... it may still come back as the CAUSE has not been fixed. </p>

<p>One way to combat a fungal infection is to fix the acidity of the host, by using baking soda.  1 tspn a day with water when you wake.</p>

<p>Butter almonds for the b17.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cancer is degeneration of cells. You cant find cure for that. It is like Entropy.....you cant stop everything from falling apart.</p>

<p>But reason why Americans have it so much is because of chemicals in food, and &#39;for profit&#39; type of life/system. They sell all kinds of garbage and destructive foods to their own people without a problem. Couple that with the design of towns/roads/and cities that are not meant for the one activity that humans are designed for, and their bodies are more efficient both internally and externally when being done regularly, walking. Americans do not walk. At all. Maybes small percentage in big cities does, but outside, there is no sidewalks. Your neighbors in cars will drive by so close as if wanting to scare you off the street. So you avoid walking and being exposed, you get in the car. And you&#39;re going to get some icecream.....and there is your other neighbor tailgating you and causing you anxiety and nervousness because he himself has not walked more than to his mailbox for majority of his life. So instead of getting 2 scoops of icecream you get a whole bucket since you are pissed now. People in the icecream place are there, physically, but mentally and emotionally spaced out from the same reasons why you just got the bucket of icecream, so they offer no outlet for your now built up angst.......the problem perpetuates. You are now smoking....and drinking kinda regularly. You feel weak. You see a doctor. He gives you the purple and green with red stripes pills. You are feeling good. Leveled. In your mind. But inside................but inside it is a different story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cancer is caused by damaged dna.  Dna damage is caused by free radicals. Damaged dna instructs the body to create physiologically non-functioning cells in an uncontrolled manner.  Cancer cells are metabolically active, consuming oxygen and calories. </p>

<p>Multiple cures for cancer have been found and then systematically buried by the Rockefeller founded AMA.  Notably the Rife Ray Beam, discovereby an M.D. named Royal Rife. In a preliminary study at USC medical school, he treated 14 terminal cancer patients who had zero prognosis for recovery.  All but 2 were completely cured within two weeks.  The other two were completely cured in 20 days. </p>

<p>Rife started a company to mass produce the Rife Ray Beam.  He was stymied and smeared at every turn by a conspiracy of AMA and Pharma and was never able to produce the machines and get the word out.  A brilliant doctor and researcher but not a brilliant tactician.  </p>

<p>Another potential cure is gcMAF.  Ever hear about all those mysterious deaths of naturopthic and alternative practitioners?  They are all connected by a common thread:  All of them were treating patients with gcMAF (globulin containing macrophage activating factor).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an epidemiologist: </p>

<p>1) Diagnosis has become better. Previously non-fatal cancers might not have even been noticed. Prostate cancer is a good example. I forget the exact percentage - but a good number of men who die of other causes, are also found to have prostate cancer in autopsy. With the PSA tests, more cancer cases are screened and caught. </p>

<p>2) We live longer lives - Cancer is often a disease of longevity. Incidence goes up roughly with age for many types of cancer. The more people attaining those ages, the more cancer cases. </p>

<p>3) Next is probably the reason you are after. I think it&#39;s clear we also are subjected to WAY more carcinogens than past generations. Just take our atomic bomb tests in the 40s and 50s for example. Sad to say we subjected a whole generation of kids to radioactive fallout through dairy milk and other means - exposures which have been linked to increased thyroid cancer rates <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/RF-GWT_home.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/RF-GWT_home.htm</a> . Tons of other possible carcinogens have been used in housing, food, cosmetics etc over the decades - sometimes with little oversight and control.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have eliminated a great deal of other ways to die.  Almost no one dies of measles or mumps or polio or smallpox or plague any more.  More, if you are in an accident, we are far better at saving your life than at any time in the past.</p>

<p>However, while we are better at treating cancer, we haven&#39;t made the same great strides we&#39;ve made with infectious diseases and therefore your chance of dying of cancer increases.  The same is true of other diseases like stroke and heart attack.</p>

<p>The reason why progress on cancer has been slow is that it isn&#39;t one disease but a thousand diseases.  There are cancers that have gone in my lifetime from being &quot;certain death&quot; to &quot;very good chance to survive and thrive&quot; - but there are tons of cancers medical science hasn&#39;t really started to tackle.</p>

<p>If you want a dramatic example, read some of the literature of a century ago or more.  The number of people who die of infectious diseases, minor diseases today we&#39;d get antibiotics for, is huge.  In the autobiographical &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot;, Betty Smith points out that every year she&#39;d have at least one kid in her class die of an infectious disease - I don&#39;t remember this happening every to anyone <em>in my school</em> in grade school, high school or university.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t vouch for everything Dr Hulda Clark did because I haven&#39;t personally tried all of her specific recommendations as laid out in her books, but she does have a very sensible three pronged approach. One very important part is parasite cleansing which so do several times a year; mainstream medicine won&#39;t deal with parasites unless you come back from a trip to India or something with an extreme and clear manifestation. But if you take the herbs Clark recommends ( wormwood, black walnut hull and cloves) you WILL often poop out worms after three to six weeks. We get parasites from pets, from restaurant cooks giving us food without them washing their hands very much, from other people. Clark also was rigid about not using things that have certain chemicals in them and unfortunately these things are in most cosmetics, deodorants, lotions etc. The other thing she recommended was using a &quot; zapper&quot; which I can&#39;t really say helped me in any obvious way but the other things really have had a positive impact on my health. Whether it cures cancer or simply helps us detox, I don&#39;t know. I do believe too that sugar, even in corn syrup, should probably be minimized or avoided because it feeds candida fungus in the body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is not, in fact, a &quot;real&quot; rise in cancer incidence. What makes the numbers go up is the increase in  life expectancy (older people are more susceptible to cancer). In other words: We used to die before we could get cancer, longer lives --&gt; more cancers. It&#39;s like alzheimer desease or any other age related desease for that matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we agree?  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t rule it out (it&#39;s a great sign obviously) but if you believe this sub all types of cancer have been cured cured with _______, just buy this book and find out how!</p>
