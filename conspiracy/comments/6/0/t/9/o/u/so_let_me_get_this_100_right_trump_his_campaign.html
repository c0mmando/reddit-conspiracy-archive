    <div class="md"><p>Most US Reps are themselves being surveilled by FBI/CIA. If you&#39;re not lily-pure, they can control you. So it was good that Sally Yates, then acting DoJ, went immediately to the WH to tell them that Flynn wasn&#39;t truthful to nip that in the bud. FBI could have opened a counter-intel file and observed him and waited for him to be blackmailed. Either she was honest or her hand was forced because she knew with the lower standards of classification that Obama&#39;s EO 12333 allowed, there&#39;d be a lot of eyes on the transcripts thus the possibility of a leak would be high, and it would be out there soon anyway.</p>

<p>Comey and Rogers had permission from the DOJ to acknowledge in open session that an investigation existed, which was more than they were allowed to acknowledge in January. They did not have permission to discuss the details of how that investigation was being conducted.</p>

<p>I do find it entertaining that people want the investigators to tip their hand as to what techniques they are using when they are just barely at a point where they admit the investigation is happening... Watergate was a process, not an event.</p>

<p>Actually I have more than one reason for disagreeing with them, but I&#39;ve only talked about one of them.  If you want to guess at my reasons that is fine, that&#39;s all on you, but like I said I really don&#39;t feel like going through any of the points of forgery Joe came up with.</p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t know how you come to that conclusion.  Ah&#39;nee&#39;s certificate was given to Joe by someone who profits off of this racist crap.  He can take it to as many experts as he likes, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact he got his main point of evidence from someone with a monetary interest in those points of forgery.  </p>

<p>Like I said though, that obviously isn&#39;t the only thing I dislike about this whole thing, just the first thing.  Feel free to continue making assumptions about what I know about this crap.  I&#39;m sure it makes you feel better about your arguments.</p>

<p>That was my attempt at being a dick.  Last I knew Zullo and Joe had not released the reports they received from the experts.  All of it so far has been Zullo and Joe stating what was in those reports, or news sites/blogs reporting on what Zullo and Joe said was in those reports.  I have not seen the actual reports yet, but I guess they could be out by now as I haven&#39;t looked since like December 2016.  </p>

Turns out that that traffic was between the Russians, DeutscheBank (Trump&#39;s boss, they own all his debt), and someone in the tower.  That does not mean they were surveilling the building.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure exactly what you&#39;re asking, sorry.  Are you saying that Obama must have known that the FBI was wiretapping trump?  If so, so what?  There&#39;s nothing illegal or unethical about that, and that&#39;s not what trump accused him of.  I think it&#39;s a given that Obama knew about it, or at least heard rumors - an FBI investigation of a presidential candidate is a FUCKING HUGE issue, and I would not be surprised if the FBI gave Obama a heads-up as a courtesy (especially since Steele heard about the warrants from the Russian side).  But that would just be a courtesy, the FBI doesn&#39;t work for the president.</p>

<p>There is also nothing illegal about the FBI wiretapping trump and his campaign if they have warrants.  That&#39;s what they do, it&#39;s their business, and nobody outside of the DOJ needs to be involved in that decision.  I&#39;m sure they have some internal process that covers who would need to approve it, but they are an autonomous organization.  </p>

<p>trump accused Obama of ordering the FBI to wiretap trump, and that is the very specific question that Comey and Rogers answered.  Obama is not part of the DOJ, and ordering an investigation of the opposing candidate would be an abuse of power, one that people who remember Watergate and J Edgar Hoover are particularly sensitive to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like they are getting lost in the weeds. Obama definitely knew about it, maybe even sat in a conference or two discussing it(who knows), but he didn&#39;t order it. As a voter I wouldn&#39;t appreciate the distinction. My guess is that Trump used the phrase Obama did it, is because it best describes the conspiracy against him. This isn&#39;t some rogue FBI actors.</p>

<p>trump might be speaking vaguely, but Comey and Rogers are not - they are very specifically saying that Obama didn&#39;t order it, not that it didn&#39;t happen.  They went out of their way to make that clear.  There is no question about what they said and what they left unsaid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to point out that OP uses the same name scheme as <a href="/u/Lelouch_Fi_Britannia">/u/Lelouch_Fi_Britannia</a> and <a href="/u/Reinhard_von_Lohengr">/u/Reinhard_von_Lohengr</a>, two accounts that are strongly suspect to be the same spammer. And now a new anime named account with two underscores that also posted in <a href="/r/ReasonableFaith">/r/ReasonableFaith</a> and <a href="/r/TrueChristian">/r/TrueChristian</a> ages ago suddenly pops up and starts posting in <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> for all things for the first time in months just as the other two accounts don&#39;t post for the first time in ages?</p>

<p>TLDR: Fuck off Lelouch, you&#39;re too obvious with your spam tactics.</p>

<p>trump might be speaking vaguely, but Comey and Rogers are not - they are very specifically saying that Obama didn&#39;t order it, not that it didn&#39;t happen.  They went out of their way to make that clear.  There is no question about what they said and what they left unsaid.</p>
