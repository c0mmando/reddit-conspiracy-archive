       I'm torn on this. Part of me thinks yes, part of me thinks no. Interestingly though, while the sheep were watching Comey, confirmation hearings for Gorsuch began. I bet no one was watching that...

       Who knows? I'm not bothering to follow it, but there are those who normally would but are now distracted by Comey. The timing of the confirmation and Comey's interviews are likely not coincidental imho.

       Comey worked for Rudy Giuliani and he either worked on the cases that locked up Fat Tony Salerno and other Gambino family members, they reason they got locked up was from the illegal bid process that was used to build the Trump Plaza and Trump Tower. Comey knows far more about Donny J than we would ever even think about knowing and yet it looks like he still chose Trump.

       Most US Reps are themselves being surveilled by FBI/CIA. If you're not lily-pure, they can control you. So it was good that Sally Yates, then acting DoJ, went immediately to the WH to tell them that Flynn wasn't truthful to nip that in the bud. FBI could have opened a counter-intel file and observed him and waited for him to be blackmailed. Either she was honest or her hand was forced because she knew with the lower standards of classification that Obama's EO 12333 allowed, there'd be a lot of eyes on the transcripts thus the possibility of a leak would be high, and it would be out there soon anyway.

       If the tap is on the Russian representatives line and Team Trump calls that line, team Trump wasn't tapped. The Russian representative was.

       Comey and Rogers had permission from the DOJ to acknowledge in open session that an investigation existed, which was more than they were allowed to acknowledge in January. They did not have permission to discuss the details of how that investigation was being conducted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do find it entertaining that people want the investigators to tip their hand as to what techniques they are using when they are just barely at a point where they admit the investigation is happening... Watergate was a process, not an event.

       The fact that this is progressing so slowly and so little information is being shared should indicate the seriousness of the situation. Comey went guns blazing making a big smokeshow about Hillary but the fact that he's being so reticent with what he may or may not know at this time means that there's probably something there and they're going to progress slowly and extremely carefully; there could be something going on right now that's ten times bigger than Watergate

       Trumps claim was that President Obama has him wiretapped, there is no evidence of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether Trump Tower itself was under surveillance or had wiretaps regarding other investigations, certainly possible but again, no evidence has been presented by anyone that any of this ever happened.

       The FISA warrants issued have no mention of Trump either.  So it is specifically Trump's statement ("Obama had my wires tapped!") that everyone says it isn't true, not that there was no surveillance at all.

       General Flynn was wiretapped while in Trump Tower, Trump's server was wiretapped in Trump Tower. This info was leaked therefore evidence exists.

       This isn't done yet. At least allow it to be over before commenting like this. Also, Obama's BC was a fake. Forensically confirmed. By multiple forensic sources. But I bet you don't believe that.

       That should be the whole press conference on it. Two independent forensic analysts found the same thing (one in America and one in Italy I believe).

       They showed the details of the investigations in the press conference. Draw conclusions for yourself. You're perfectly welcome to bring up flaws in reasoning. But stop accusing people of being racist because you don't like the forensic conclusions they drew from evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And one investigation was Italian. They don't really have any skin in the game. I highly doubt they give a shit about the racial implications of the investigation.

       If you watched the video you would see the actual evidence and maybe be able to critique it. But you didn't. And you're just going to say stupid things and attack a guy that didn't even conduct either of the investigations, which both came to the same conclusion by the way.

       Did you ever ask where Joe got the evidence for this "forgery"?  It wasn't from the hospital in Hawaii.  It was given to them by Jerome Corsi.  A guy that wrote a book on the birther movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       So people looking to prove the document Obama provided was a fake got their evidence from someone who directly profits off of the controversy the birther movement creates.  What a coincidence.

       Here's a quote from Zullo when asked where Corsi got his evidence:

       "I have to be honest with you, that’s a really good question. Because either that’s an unbelievable coincidence, or there’s something else going on.

       Again, I'm not interested in discussing this with you.  I have watched his press conference, I have gone over the "evidence" they've put forth, and I have come to the conclusion that they are still bullshit artists trying to push a racist agenda.

       Actually I have more than one reason for disagreeing with them, but I've only talked about one of them.  If you want to guess at my reasons that is fine, that's all on you, but like I said I really don't feel like going through any of the points of forgery Joe came up with.

       I guess I don't know how you come to that conclusion.  Ah'nee's certificate was given to Joe by someone who profits off of this racist crap.  He can take it to as many experts as he likes, but that doesn't change the fact he got his main point of evidence from someone with a monetary interest in those points of forgery.

       Like I said though, that obviously isn't the only thing I dislike about this whole thing, just the first thing.  Feel free to continue making assumptions about what I know about this crap.  I'm sure it makes you feel better about your arguments.

       The main point of evidence comes from two separate investigations. You clearly did not watch the press conference or you would know that. It didn't come from one guy.

       Are you just trolling me?  I'm talking about the certificate from Ah'nee.  That is the main point of evidence.  You are talking about the experts like they are the main points.  I think we are just talking about two different things here?

       Anyways, if you would be so kind as to provide a link to the reports these experts gave to Zullo and Joe I'll look through them see if they change my mind.  I'm not talking about what Zullo or Joe says is in those reports.  I'm talking about the reports themselves so I can see what the experts say themselves.

       And I understand that.  That wasn't what I was referring to though with anything I was saying.  I was referring to the certificate he provided them.  He got that from one source which was Corsi.

       That was my attempt at being a dick.  Last I knew Zullo and Joe had not released the reports they received from the experts.  All of it so far has been Zullo and Joe stating what was in those reports, or news sites/blogs reporting on what Zullo and Joe said was in those reports.  I have not seen the actual reports yet, but I guess they could be out by now as I haven't looked since like December 2016.

       I don't know about forged, but I think at the very least Corsi found one that had matching angles for the date stamp and the "X" and all that, and pointed that out to Zullo and Joe.  This would indeed be an attempt to stir the pot to help with his book sales.  I'm still not entirely sure how Corsi even had this certificate as it could not have come from directly from the hospital legally.  Considering Obama had to get his lawyers involved just to get a copy of his from the hospital and it was an exception to the law made for the POTUS.

       Obama technically cant "order" a wiretap. The Order needs to come from a FISA court. Have you ever considered why the media sticks with that one word (ordered) and not a synonym like directed? It has a very specific technical meaning if they were to use another word that might get them in hot water.

       Because that's the word Trump used? Then lied about it? Then lied about it again?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was a tap it means it was part of the investigation. Which means that the FBI went to a judge and provided enough evidence for a warrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which means there's evidence that Trump committed a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       This argument doesn't help Trump and makes him look worse.

       FISA warrants are applied for in the FISA Court, a non adversarial court where only the government is present and the rulings are kept secret while have binding legal precedent in the intelligence community. Essentially a Supreme Court for the Intelligence Agencies. Of course this court has a fantastic record on keeping the [government accountable....](between 1979 and 2010, out of 33,900 requests only 11 were rejected)

       I would love to see the applications for those warrants, though following revision of the FISA Court in 2008
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/19/fisa-court-oversight-process-secrecy">
        "The Fisa Amendments Act of 2008, effectively gives the President - now President Obama - the authority to run surveillance programs similar in effect to the warrantless surveillance program [secretly implemented by George Bush in late 2001]. That is because New Fisa no longer requires individualized targets in all surveillance programs."

       I find it hard to believe that only 11 were rejected since didn't the first FISA warrant at Trump Tower get rejected?  So out of 34k one of the 11 rejections happen to be one at Trump Tower.

       I do recall hearing about only 11 but I think that number is from way back, but I have been wrong once before.

       The FBI and FISA court are not part of the "Obama Administration", they are in the Department of Justice.   Nobody needs to order the FBI to do anything, if they get warrants they have the authority to wiretap trump tower all on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crime that trump alleged in his tweet (and the crime that Comey specifically refuted) was that Obama asked/ordered them to do it.  It was an intentionally specific question with an intentionally specific answer, and everyone in the room knew exactly why it was asked that way.

       We can no longer say it was a rogue agent who brought the warrant. It was part of a larger conspiracy. Who issued the warrants is moot in that regard.

       The papers reported on something different.  The FBI was investigating Russian hacking and interference, and they noticed some bizarre traffic coming into an office building in Manhattan.  They monitored that traffic, as they are specifically allowed to without further warrants, because it was coming from a foreign source.  Turns out that that traffic was between the Russians, DeutscheBank (Trump's boss, they own all his debt), and someone in the tower.  That does not mean they were surveilling the building.  That would require a warrant.  No warrant needed for NSA to monitor foreign communications, even on american soil, as long as its coming from somewhere else.

       I'm not sure exactly what you're asking, sorry.  Are you saying that Obama must have known that the FBI was wiretapping trump?  If so, so what?  There's nothing illegal or unethical about that, and that's not what trump accused him of.  I think it's a given that Obama knew about it, or at least heard rumors - an FBI investigation of a presidential candidate is a FUCKING HUGE issue, and I would not be surprised if the FBI gave Obama a heads-up as a courtesy (especially since Steele heard about the warrants from the Russian side).  But that would just be a courtesy, the FBI doesn't work for the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also nothing illegal about the FBI wiretapping trump and his campaign if they have warrants.  That's what they do, it's their business, and nobody outside of the DOJ needs to be involved in that decision.  I'm sure they have some internal process that covers who would need to approve it, but they are an autonomous organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump accused Obama of ordering the FBI to wiretap trump, and that is the very specific question that Comey and Rogers answered.  Obama is not part of the DOJ, and ordering an investigation of the opposing candidate would be an abuse of power, one that people who remember Watergate and J Edgar Hoover are particularly sensitive to.

       Seems like they are getting lost in the weeds. Obama definitely knew about it, maybe even sat in a conference or two discussing it(who knows), but he didn't order it. As a voter I wouldn't appreciate the distinction. My guess is that Trump used the phrase Obama did it, is because it best describes the conspiracy against him. This isn't some rogue FBI actors.

       trump might be speaking vaguely, but Comey and Rogers are not - they are very specifically saying that Obama didn't order it, not that it didn't happen.  They went out of their way to make that clear.  There is no question about what they said and what they left unsaid.

       Semantics. While he was under investigation, its unlikely Obama himself would have ordered any wiretaps. That's why its so odd that Trump would even bring it up like that. I would really like to know what he was thinking. Was it a ham handed attempt at deflection? Is he starting to lose his mind? Is he just that dumb and doesn't really understand how things work?

       I think he was just referring to Obama wiretapping him the same way people call them Obama Phones or Obama Care. His name is attached because he's the President. We know Obama didnt start the free phone program or have anything to do with the Romney Care plan that was already floating around Washington. He just gets the blame.

       Do you believe Obama read the ACA? I don't. Doesn't excuse him but he was just the salesman. The President, including Trump, don't run shit. They do as theyre told.

       Yes, you're missing the fact that nobody has said that trump or trump tower or his campaign team weren't under surveillance.  Comey and Rogers denied that Obama ordered surveillance on trump (the crime alleged in trump's tweet).  Nobody has (publicly) asked if there was surveillance on trump, just whether or not Obama had ordered it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it wasn't asked in the hearing because everyone knows that if the FBI were doing their jobs, that trump and trump tower were under surveillance.  Members of Congress aren't idiots, they have seen more information than we have and they understand how the FBI operates.

       yea its insanity.  Comey is a liar. Theyve been investigating Trump/Russia since July and have ZERO evidence.  Yet, we are to believe that the investigation continues for valid reasons?
Comey said he wont comment on current investigations(when asked about wiretapping), but then stated there was a current investigation into Trump/Russia ties.  Unreal

       trump might be speaking vaguely, but Comey and Rogers are not - they are very specifically saying that Obama didn't order it, not that it didn't happen.  They went out of their way to make that clear.  There is no question about what they said and what they left unsaid.

       Other than where it was obtained from I have not you are correct.  I'm not going to go through each point of "forgery" with you.  You've looked into it, I've looked into it, we've come to opposite conclusions.

       I guess I don't know what you are talking about here.  We are talking about Obama's certificate and Johana Ah'nee's certificate and the similarities the experts he found discovered correct?

        You seem to have come to the opposite conclusion of the actual experts. For no reason other than "Sheriff Joe is a racist!". So, since you disagree with the experts, who the fuck are you to have any credibility?

       Actually I have more than one reason for disagreeing with them, but I've only talked about one of them.  If you want to guess at my reasons that is fine, that's all on you, but like I said I really don't feel like going through any of the points of forgery Joe came up with.
