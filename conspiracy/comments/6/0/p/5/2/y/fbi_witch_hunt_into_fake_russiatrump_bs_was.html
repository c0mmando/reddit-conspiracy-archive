       Didn't see it posted here. Connect the dots. This is 100% why the FBI started its investigation that everyone is freaking out about. Oh, and that fake dossier is 100% due to MCCAIN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we please get the word out to EVERYONE - The Investigation Underway Was Triggered By The McCain-British Spy Fake Dossier... Thats a fact. The same month, July, was when the justice department/CIA/ etc began using the dossier to justify surveillance... I am sure people on here can expand, but this point is getting lost in the shithole that is the MSM and we must get the word out as it proves the investigation is a complete NOTHING.

       Oh hey, don't forget that the FBI didn't actually investigate the DNC server that the "russians" hacked. They took the word of a third party investigation for what several Democrats are calling an "act of war". Does that make sense to any one out there? Seem strange? Hello?

       The FBI lost all credibility when they admitted to falsifying evidence in thousands of cases.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In a subsequent investigation, it was found that evidence had been falsified, altered, or suppressed, or that FBI agents had testified falsely, in as many as 10,000 cases, resulting in many false convictions. More than a decade later, cases were still being overturned because of this massive fraud.

       HAHA. Nice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey thanks for your work here. Is there any way we could get a flair system in place here? Something so we could filter posts by type.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, we could tag anything related to pedogate as such. Because this sub is being flooded so hard right now every story, anywhere in the world about child trafficking is getting posted over and over here. I get that it might be a worldwide conspiracy so it has a place here but it would be nice to filter stuff.

       Just an idea!

       Filter tagging is a monumental CSS challenge apparently (I'm not qualified to judge coding stuff personally), tags get suggested here on a regular basis and we're not against the idea partcularly but it's quite a workload setting it up.

       If it means we have to be here on the clock to tag all the posts ourselves it'll definitely never happen, for the reason you just mentioned.

       The FBI has been violating the Constitution with illegal surveillance (Intercepting US Mail, Illegal Wiretapping, Carnivore, etc...) how is it that you are JUST NOW thinking that the FBI had any credibility to begin with?  J Edgar Hoover didn't create a federal police department, he created an intelligence gathering fiefdom that he (and everyone since) used to further his OWN political agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without a clearing out of the top 4 layers of management at ALL of the intelligence agencies, you can forget ANYTHING getting done or getting better.  Too many career politicians at those levels who've been around for SEVERAL administrations, and have enough dirt on whoever is in the WH and Congress to do what they want without fear of retribution.
