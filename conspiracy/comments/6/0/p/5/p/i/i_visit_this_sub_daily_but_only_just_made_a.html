    <div class="md"><p>People are allowed to talk to him. Of course politicians and ambassadors talk. That&#39;s their jobs. </p>

<p>But it has to be through the proper channels. The problem is that not just anyone can act as a representative of the US when talking to foreign ambassadors. And when you go behind closed doors with them, without being an actual representative of the US, that&#39;s what you are doing. </p>

<p>And when you lie about doing that, and then are caught in the lie, it is treason. </p>

<p>Ya know we get a lot of suspicious activity from new accounts that we are critical of, but this is probably a really good way to come into the community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is called &quot;Lurker&quot; - the definition of reading reddit but not having an account to post.  :-)</p>

<p>Many people do that. It&#39;s okay.  But I&#39;m glad you decided to join us! Nice to meet you!</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m sick of the whole &quot;Russia, Russia, Russia&quot; stuff too. I do not think they are a threat at all.</p>

<p>The people I see lying are Trump and his cabinet. They&#39;ve been caught lying about Russia multiple times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here. No idea how to just jump into the conversations here but since I started lurking this sub back in January I feel like I had a brain transplant. Now I&#39;m seeing INSANE amounts of chemtrails in LA, I am 100% convinced 9/11 was an inside job, and I&#39;m becoming aware of the eminent polar shift/dawning of the fifth sun (along with the hidden mathematics of the pyramids). </p>

<p>Guess I just want to say thanks to the members here for helping me find the new enlightenment. This is the place to be in 2017. </p>

<p>and yes we all have more in common with each other (no matter who we voted for) than with our politicians</p>
