       An important thing to remember is they'll likely think the same of you- totally different world. Endless appeals to logic and reason help, but all-out "red-pilling" friends and family is ultimately a great way to alienate yourself from them. It's a difficult thing, finding the balance in all of it

       AFAIK Snopes is an instant disqualification of your opinions on r/conspiracy. Although the last several months I've seen some pretty shameless defenses of Snopes. Oh well, at least by mentioning it in a good light they identify themselves.

       There's some compelling evidence.

       Not that they hacked vote counts of course, that would be too obvious.

       They colluded with elements of Trumps campaign and hacked the DNC to smear Clinton during the last leg of the election.

       I agree with you.  What's the point of having a Russian Ambassador is NO ONE is allowed to talk to him?

       People are allowed to talk to him. Of course politicians and ambassadors talk. That's their jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it has to be through the proper channels. The problem is that not just anyone can act as a representative of the US when talking to foreign ambassadors. And when you go behind closed doors with them, without being an actual representative of the US, that's what you are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you lie about doing that, and then are caught in the lie, it is treason.

       Bernie had a lot of support, he had a real chance agaisnt Trump.

       But I don't think he had the slightest chance against the deep state unfortunately. He doesn't have the team or the guts. But I like his policies for the most part.

now that we're seeing out in the open just how nefarious the deep state is, it's clear bernie didn't stand a chance..he was too soft

       I think his silence/cooperation got bought, see his new house and car... which is a shame. I wouldn't cross him out indefinitely, he might run again in a less corrupt system, but he's old already so I don't know haha. Welcome by the way.

       Same here. No idea how to just jump into the conversations here but since I started lurking this sub back in January I feel like I had a brain transplant. Now I'm seeing INSANE amounts of chemtrails in LA, I am 100% convinced 9/11 was an inside job, and I'm becoming aware of the eminent polar shift/dawning of the fifth sun (along with the hidden mathematics of the pyramids).
      </p>
