        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>[Edit]:</strong> *warning* getting lots of downvotes, these ideas may not be allowed!</p>

<p>Guys, hear me out. I know it&#39;s fun to talk about the nazis, and the aliens, and the pyramids, and the hole that goes into the center of the hollow earth, and how Antarctica is the wall at the edge of the flat earth holding in all the air, and the lost civilizations buried under the ice, but I have an even crazier theory that I just can&#39;t stop thinking about.</p>

<p>What if global warming is real, and there&#39;s a bunch of ice in Antarctica, and some of it is about to <a href="https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/a-massive-chunk-of-antarctic-ice-is-about-to-snap-off/77897">break off and float away into the ocean?</a></p>

<p>If any of that ice is on land, it could cause sea levels to rise creating millions of refugees. That&#39;s about as bad as an alien invasion as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Maybe John Kerry <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/11/08/501153007/john-kerry-heads-to-antarctica-and-to-a-new-travel-record">went to Antarctica</a> to find out first hand how totally fucked we are. What if it was part of a trip where he also met in person with people around the world who had been paying him to save their asses from the coming sea level rise:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Climate change features prominently on Kerry’s itinerary on his current trip, an eight-day haul from Washington to New Zealand to Antarctica – where he became the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit – and on to two Arab Gulf states and then Morocco before winging to Peru and then back home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe he gets political funding and bribes from people all over the world <a href="http://imgur.com/a/iMfWf">who will be totally fucked when the ocean levels rise</a></p>

<p>What if Trump doesn&#39;t give a flying fuck <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-exxon-mobil-trump-presidency-benefits-2017-1">because his campaign was financed by oil companies</a> who want to drill under the north pole when it melts? What if Trump&#39;s plan to deal with the refugees is to simply block their entry into the US? Does this explain why all of Trump&#39;s executive orders are about immigration? Could this explain why the 9th circuit is all up in his face about it?</p>

<p>It might explain why Saudi Arabia and Qatar paid so much money trying to make Trump not win.</p>

<p>Could the refugee crisis in Europe be related?</p>

<p>I dunno about you but 760 million refugees sounds scary as hell to me. I sure hope it turns out to be space aliens.</p>

<p>Yep, according to the above, Kerry is descended from one of the most famous Mystical Rabbis in Jewish folklore</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kerry already is aware of his Jewish roots, having learned recently that his paternal grandfather was a German Jew born in 1873 in the north Moravian town of Horni Benesov who later emigrated to the United States. <strong>Further research established that the Massachusetts senator’s oldest known Czech Jewish ancestor is Bernhard Loew</strong>, born in 1771 in the south Moravian town of Boskovice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bernhard Loew?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel">Judah Loew ben Bezalel</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Within the world of Torah and Talmudic scholarship, Loew is known for his works on Jewish philosophy and Jewish mysticism and his work Gur Aryeh al HaTorah, a supercommentary on Rashi&#39;s Torah commentary. <strong>He is also the subject of a 19th-century legend that he created The Golem of Prague, an animate being fashioned from clay.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently SOME believe that the USA is a &quot;Golem&quot; - created by mystical magic - to serve the interests of the &quot;Chosen&quot;.</p>

<p>As for Kerry... what? Did you <em>really</em> think that a <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/teresa-heinz-kerry-11718235">Heinz heiress</a> would marry a Goy?</p>

<p>Not quite sure how to interpret that comment, but in any case, you can read more about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem">mythical Golem here.</a></p>

<p>Essentially, the &quot;Jewish sorcerer&quot; uses his &quot;magic&quot; to animate a lifeless (or soulless) creature with the intent of having it serve the bidding of the Kabbalist and his people.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Yiddish_origin">List of English words of Yiddish origin</a> (emphasis mine)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>golem</strong>: a man-made humanoid; an android, Frankenstein monster (from Hebrew גלם gōlem, but influenced in pronunciation by Yiddish <strong><em>goylem</em></strong>) (OED, MW)</li>
</ul>

<p>[Goylem???]</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>goy</strong>: a gentile, term for someone not of the Jewish faith or people (Yiddish גוי, plural גויים or גוים goyim, adjective goyische; from Hebrew גויים or גוים <strong><em>goyim</em></strong> meaning &#39;nations&#39;, plural of גוי goy &#39;nation&#39;) (AHD)</li>
</ul>

<p>Goylem &gt; Goyim - might these terms be related?</p>

<p>Yeah, maybe:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... Consider the nature of the golem himself. Most cultures build their heroes and avengers out of their idealized selves: their Galahads. But the golem is in every way the antithesis of the ideals of traditional Judaism. In a culture that revered learning and wisdom, the golem is stupid and incapable of reason. In a culture defined by the rigorous discipline of religious law, the golem is unruly, savage, and incapable of self-control. In a culture that took pride in its pacifism, the golem is created expressly for the purpose of committing acts of violence.</p>

<p>So contrary is the golem to the ideals of Jewish tradition that in Jewish circles his name eventually became an insult.** To refer to someone as a &quot;golem&quot; is, essentially, to call him an idiot and a fool. The full implications of the insult are suggested by its elective affinity to another term of abuse: goyishe kop, or &quot;Gentile head,&quot; referring to someone of notably low intelligence.**</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/718/features/the-golem-universal-and-particular/">http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/718/features/the-golem-universal-and-particular/</a></p>

<p>Golem - a strong but stupid, brutish and <em>soulless</em> creature that can be influenced to do the bidding of the conjurer - usually for violent purposes.</p>

<p>Potential problem: Golem can sometimes get out of hand - and turn on their masters - with disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>HOLY SHIT!</p>

<p>Heh, thanks.</p>

<p>That part - <em>&quot;the USA is a Golem&quot;</em> was only mildly sarcastic.</p>

<p>From my observations, the US has become a <em>brute beast</em> that has fallen under the &quot;spell&quot; of a relative handful of &quot;sorcerers&quot; who, using the &quot;magic&quot; of money and pressure to influence our leaders, and the &quot;witchcraft&quot; of propaganda and distraction to hypnotize the masses, have beguiled us into doing their bidding and serving their interests, even when these actions are in conflict with our own well-being as individuals and a nation.</p>

<p>With a bit of further study into the long-held dogma, tenets and occult beliefs of these &quot;sorcerers&quot; soon reveals that, traditionally, they have viewed non-Jews as a form of &quot;Golem&quot; - similar to them in form, function and appearance, but fundamentally different when it comes to mind, spirit and SOUL. </p>

<p>To understand how the &quot;chosen&quot; have traditionally viewed the Goyim/Golem, one might draw a comparison to NPC&#39;s, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character#Video_games">Non-player character&#39;s</a> in video games They look &quot;real&quot;, interact with &quot;live players&quot;, and, depending on circumstances, may be helpful, exploitable, neutral, or possibly <strong><em>very dangerous</em></strong>. </p>

<p>In any case, from their perspective, these &quot;Golem&quot; are not animate like &quot;real players&quot;... there is no &quot;real person&quot; controlling the character, and as such, there is no moral prohibition against using or abusing them, provided that it is safe and convenient, and does not result in negative repercussions to the REAL player and his fellows.</p>

<p>This may all sound batshit crazy - but if you like to read, have a bit of free time, and are interested in more information on such matters, I highly recommend the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://strugglesforexistence.com/?p=article_p&amp;amp;id=13"><strong>Love Thy Neighbor: the Evolution of In-Group Morality</strong></a> - by John Hartung </p>

<p>At least read the Abstract and the Author&#39;s note.</p>

<p>Fascinating insights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good stuff, but you&#39;re missing two critical elements here: Eugenics and carbon taxes.</p>

<p>Lets assume that the elites are obsessed with eugenics - that they ultimately believe that the human race is mostly trash and that anyone without their pure DNA deserves to be exterminated (or culled through infertility, disease and withholding medical advances) for the benefit of the planet and their own prospects at survival. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s also say that climate change is real and unstoppable, but it&#39;s not caused by humans in the way that they&#39;d like us to believe. Let&#39;s say that the elites have known about it for a while and knew full well that they couldn&#39;t do shit about stopping it because it was a naturally occurring phenomena... they could predict it though... and they could speed  it up by creating a massive food &amp; livestock industry.</p>

<p>They&#39;d be able to achieve their goal of euthanizing the world&#39;s poor via a long catastrophic event and end what they view as an &quot;overpopulation problem&quot; - and they could even profit off of it by pushing for a carbon tax to be put into place - which essentially amounts to a &quot;guilt tax&quot; put on every person on the planet - and they&#39;d do so in a way that allows them to exploit the system so that after the worst of the chaos is over, they&#39;d end up with an iron grip on civilization. </p>

<p>In short, what if it&#39;s their goal to accelerate us towards this climate change event? And what if the only reason that they are now openly pushing for us to take action against climate change is so they can seize the moral upper hand when shit goes down... and because they know we&#39;ve crossed over the singularity threshold and can no longer do anything to position coastal regions to protect themselves or evacuate. </p>

<p>Most of this stuff can be backed up with actual news events and facts - I&#39;m not saying this is what&#39;s going on, but for speculation&#39;s sake, if we&#39;re trying to construct a conspiracy theory that doesn&#39;t rely on aliens or demons as an explanation, these points that I&#39;ve brought up might be useful elements of that theory. ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ice age kinda was supposed to come. The Earth&#39;s orbit is moving into a resonant node that takes it a bit farther from the sun, usually that causes an ice age (historically speaking) on a pretty regular basis so they weren&#39;t exactly wrong to predict one because shit is supposed to be getting colder right now.</p>

<p>But we chose to go all Venus on our atmosphere so the opposite is happening now.</p>

<p>It seems fashionable to deny the existence of climate change these days and I really don&#39;t want to get into THAT debate, but claiming &quot;they used to predict an ice age&quot; as evidence they are now lying about the warming trend is totally bogus. They legit did believe something different in the past.</p>

<p>Also who&#39;s to say Saudi Arabia can&#39;t offer John Kerry an underage girl to eat every now and then in exchange for open borders and softer immigration policies? Those people live in the desert where it&#39;s <a href="https://weather.com/news/news/iraq-iran-heat-middle-east-125-degrees">very obviously not another ice age</a> right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is much more fashionable these days to lament the impending doom of global warming at the top of our lungs and scream about how it is all Americas fault and we must do something.</p>

<p>It is a political construct on that end. Designed to redistribute wealth to developing nations and away from American&#39;s by destroying the middle class as part of a global wealth redistribution scheme. </p>

<p>Bill and Teds bogus journey was totally bogus. Calling out the elites is not. If you genuinely want to stop pollution talk to China and India and Indonesia and South America and ......well pretty much anywhere but the U.S.</p>

<p>When you compare the actual amounts of pollution the difference is mindblowingly staggering. Is China harming the environment absolutely. Will stopping coal miners in West Virginia have more than the effect of a fart in a shithouse on global warming, No.
L.A. has smog sometimes, but it is from mainland china , that happens to be the way the wind blows.</p>

<p>Humanity as a race has not been around long enough to establish enough unbiased data to definitively prove a trend of manmade co2 vs natural climate shifts occuring for whatever reason and the potential effect on the atmosphere of something as large as our planet.</p>

<p>The whole corruption part of the (who) is dead on. But the why is a little out there. The what is actively being blocked by censorship global elites corruption and pedophile rings. The when is the last 50+ years.</p>

<p>We are actively living in the results of a very successful anti American propaganda scheme perpetrated upon the impressionable minds of the youth in our country through fearmongering and brainwashing at an academic level that has been going on since before the start of the cold war. </p>

<p>The end goal of this campaign is to enrich those that pull the strings and weaken America from it former glory by decimating its&#39; middle class through the loss of basic manufacturing jobs and creating a consumer economy that will bend and bow to the demands of the new powers being created by shipping our industries overseas and therefore making us dependent upon them for our goods and energy needs.</p>

<p>All the remaining prosperity in American society will eventually be tied to the whims of the government or individuals that control the goods flowing into our country.</p>

<p>In fact higher Co2 levels will actually cause vegetative growth to accelerate considerable and because they grow faster and bigger they put out much more oxygen than before. This has a balancing effect. The destruction of vegetation in developing countries for real estate and agriculture to support an ever growing number of mouths to feed in these undeveloped countries is what is kicking everything out of balance. Want to stop global warming. Then you need to stop the population growth in these developing nations that is causing the destruction of the rainforests and other large tracts of land that previously held plants that kept this balance.</p>

<p>The sentiment of people who actively campaign against global warming is mostly well intentioned. Unfortunately it is mostly misdirected. They are attacking the wrong bad guys , there is a reason for this see above.</p>

Too many people in too many poor countries fucking up the ecosystem that has been in place for 1000&#39;s of years is destroying the worlds viable oxygen supply for cattle, farming and housing.</p>

<p>Zero fucks being given by them about the environment is the reason it is going to shit. Climate change supporters know this full well, but they believe America has had its day in the sun and so now it is someone else&#39;s turn. Even if that means the destruction of our planet.</p>

<p>It is all okay as long as the balance of power is shifted to make everything &quot;equal&quot; and &quot;fair&quot;. They genuinely hate America. They want to see it fail.

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. </p>

<p>Whether or not climate change is real or not isn&#39;t up for debate (IMO, at least). I mean, we can prove it happening in the past. It&#39;s the man made part that people have been arguing for decades. It has it&#39;s roots in all aspects of business and geopolitics. The players involved have both individual, and sweeping agendas that affect huge amounts of money and perhaps, billions of people--dependent upon where they stand on the &quot;man made&quot; part. </p>

<p>I think OP is on the right track. And whether it&#39;s valid or not, really enjoyed how they tied in immigration moves by certain countries. We&#39;ve already created models that will show sea level rise and which areas will be effected. The numbers of people affected would be astounding ,as they tend to settle near coastlines. Hell, Miami itself is just barely above water as it is. The entire city has pumps everywhere, running non-stop to keep the water out.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think John Kerry and other notable figures have been going there recently just for a climate change photo-op. No one owns the place, and it&#39;s of no strategic importance to any country really. Just a bunch of ice and some scattered researchers.</p>

<p>I like OP&#39;s angle.</p>
