<p>And there&#39;s <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/60af3i/still_relevant/">this one</a>. </p>

<p>There were a couple others that I&#39;ve seen in the past few but I can&#39;t find them. Can anyone help? There was that ama with the homeless guy where people basically derailed it to talk about how homelessness is the fault of the individual in every case and that they are all shitty people no matter what. I mean homeless people are annoying sometimes, but they can also be chill af, too. I got this one guy who comes around my hotel once a week and I trade him some coffee and a to-go bag of breakfast for him taking out the back trash. He insisted it be a trade, and I kind of like it this way to be honest. </p>

<p>Wtf is up with the universal hatred all of a sudden, and in such contrast to what our society has commonly felt?</p>

Not having free healthcare doesn&#39;t help either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention, there is and has been an ongoing campaign to demonize poor people in the us. They even had programs to force people who accept government aid to take drug tests and then remove the befits of anyone who failed. You know, because all poor people are lazy drug addicts because it&#39;s your fault if your poor. I mean, obviously it&#39;s so easy to be a millionaire and the only reason poverty exists is because people are so lazy they just refuse to help themselves. Turns out the drug testing program was a complete failure as a huge waste of money. Turns out, people living on food stamps can&#39;t afford drugs</p>

<p>A lot of homeless have mental issues or truly do not give a flying fuck anymore. There are those just trying to get by and respect others, but there will always be bad apples in any group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, a major problem with uninsured people is that they can still go into a hospital and it&#39;s legally required for the hospital to treat them for life threatening conditions. If they can&#39;t pay, that burden falls on the providers and the tax payers. This raises health costs for every one.</p>

<p>People are saying that the biggest problem with the new &quot;republicare&quot; or whatever, is that millions of people will lose their coverage. And that will make the cost of care go up even higher.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been wondering if the GOP is beyond passing a law that says, if you can&#39;t pay you don&#39;t get treatment...</p>

<p>Dehumanizing the most disenfranchised classes would be a good first step in making that policy palatable to the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I perceive both situations very differently than you. The first one isn&#39;t homeless hate, it&#39;s random dude that poo&#39;ed in my sink hate. It&#39;s not definitive that he&#39;s even homeless for that matter.</p>

<p>The second one is practical and legal common sense. Most people don&#39;t dispute the business owner&#39;s perspective that the entry to his business must be maintained to a certain standard lest it put his business at risk. </p>

<p>Neither anecdotal story conveys a trend of &quot;hate&quot; nor includes considerations such as the availability of homeless services or the level of crime in an area that may lead you to view circumstances differently. </p>

<p>There really are an infinite number of perspectives out there and even though it may not be readily apparent, most of them are defensible in their own unique circumstances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there were no voices saying &quot;yeah but (insert story like I wrote in the main post)&quot;, like zero.. It&#39;s probably just societal and not conspiratorial, that people are condemning and only condemning, but it still seems like there was a pretty big jump all of a sudden. I know it&#39;s not black and white, and like you say, right and wrong are hard to define in terms of groups because individuals, but it&#39;s precisely the black and white take on things that is surprising me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;ve been down voted... I noticed that too, and was somewhat shocked to see that every comment on the post was attacking the homeless people. Sure, the business has a right and reason to do so, but in today&#39;s &quot;accepting, caring&quot; society that you so often hear about, you wouldn&#39;t have expected such hostility.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like we focus more on racial and gender minorities/differences (don&#39;t get me wrong, each of those has their deserved place too) rather than economic differences, which quite frankly is a huge problem right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comment was mean. I&#39;d be on drugs too. Really though the hardcore drug use and homelessness aren&#39;t really related that much.

I&#39;d say homelessness is not the issue at all, it&#39;s merely a side effect of the government defunding programs to help and take care of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FWIW, I do believe there is quite a bit of &quot;ideological advertising&quot; going on. I use the word advertising instead of propaganda because I don&#39;t believe government is involved.</p>

<p>Ideological advertising is nothing new. One of the key moments in its history is <a href="http://www.heist-themovie.com/powellMemo.html">Powell Memo</a> written over 40 years ago by the future Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>called for big business makeover of government through corporate control of the media, academia, the pulpit, arts and sciences and destruction of organized labor and consumer protection groups. But Powell’s real “end game” was business control of law and politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/4580:bill-moyers-our-politicians-are-money-launderers-in-the-trafficking-of-power-and-policy-2">inspired think tanks</a> such as Heritage Foundation.</p>

<p>Marketing rules the business world, and it is no surprise when the same players come into politics they use the same tools. Just like Coca-Cola carefully researches its slogans, these think tanks research the most effective catch phrases to promote big business friendly political agenda.](<a href="https://vimeo.com/40612032">https://vimeo.com/40612032</a>) Why do you think inheritance tax is called &quot;death tax&quot;? It is a political equivalent of &quot;Taste The Feeling&quot;</p>

<p>Astroturfing is a natural, albeit unethical extension of marketing, and with internet making it laughingly easy to do, that is where many of those organizations and key players are focusing their attention now. Did you know that David Brock, the founder of the infamous Correct The Record PAC was once a fellow at The Heritage Foundation?</p>

<p>So what does it have to do with homeless hate?</p>

<p>In the most simple terms, compassion is a threat to big business friendly politics. Big corporations inherently trend towards taking more out of the society than they contribute back. If you see people left behind and you are a compassionate person, you&#39;d be supporting taxes and regulations to make sure big businesses pay their fair share back to the society. Again, in very simple terms, a decent life for any human being is more valuable than an extra % of profit margin, and this is the kind of idea that needs to be fought against if you want to keep those profit margins up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of St. Ronnie&#39;s first demonstrations of his utter disregard for the less fortunate was the proud defunding of state mental institutions.  The folks who were there - those with mental illnesses severe enough to impair their societal integration - were kicked to the curb. Literally. There&#39;s no place for those people today, either, and there are large populations of them, including vets from the recent desert adventures. </p>

<p>Other people find themselves homeless after losing a job or getting sick, maybe on top of an unlucky break - suddenly they were out of options. It&#39;s insulting to suggest that anyone would willingly choose homelessness, or that a remarkable percentage of homeless are willingly so. </p>

<p>One would assume that capitalism would want to hide the homeless and destitute as a failure of the system - its inability to deliver on any sort of social contract. Instead, when the economy tightens, the homeless are publicly cracked down upon. It becomes illegal to feed or clothe them, or even to transfer items to them. </p>

<p>This is the system reminding its subjugates of what happens to those who are unable or unwilling to comply with the terms of their servitude: your complete and total dehumanization is assured. </p>

<p>It is instructive to see how a country treats its less well off citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. It helps to understand that the lens through which white elites view the rest of the population has remained relatively unchanged since well before this country&#39;s founding. Slavery was a significant factor in American independence, and when the constitutional amendment was passed that outlawed slavery (sort of - more on this in a moment), exploitation for profit took on new and less visible forms. Though owning black people was illegal, discrimination, disenfranchisement, and other forms of segregationist oppression were acceptable. Over criminalization and totalitarian policing by racist law enforcement agencies (which, incidentally, originated from the pre-abolition slave patrols and Night Watch) ensured a steady supply of black convicts to perform hard labor under conditions identical to slavery. </p>

<p>Once international shipping became efficient and reliable, we offshored our slave labor first to Japan, Taiwan, Korea, China, and now anywhere conditions are stable enough to support corporate-instigated extraction and exploitation of human and environmental resources. </p>

<p>But some shit needs to be done on shore. So...</p>

<p>Rinse and repeat with the war on drugs. Unequal sentencing. Stop and frisk. Mass incarceration. Prison labor. Private prison labor. </p>

<p>From the above, make a process template, and apply it to non-white immigrants, but most especially undocumented immigrants of Mexican origin. </p>

<p>It&#39;s always been great to be an American slaver. From back in the good ole days before King George moved to outlaw slavery in His Majesty&#39;s colonies and humiliation in the War of Northern Aggression, to today as corporate consumers of prison labor, migrant labor, or both. But now instead of owning human beings, they get to rent them with none of the burden. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s up with the hate on for Squeegee Kids? They stand on a corner and clean your window quick for a buck. They aren&#39;t going to do anything to get kicked off that corner. They make enough money to pay rent and buy beer and drugs. Take that away from them and you get thieves. Why not let them do something positive? I don&#39;t mind giving a kid a buck to clean my window.</p>
