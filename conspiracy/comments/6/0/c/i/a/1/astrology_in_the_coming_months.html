        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve for astrologists. Tomorrow the sun enters Aries. </p>

<p>For what&#39;s it&#39;s worth, each of you should study astrology if not for yourself, then so you can understand the beliefs of the ruling class. </p>

<p>They are astrotheologists. Every religion is derived from this ancient knowledge. I have spent about 6 years studying astrology, astronomy, occult history, and psychology, and I can tell you without a doubt that they are all interconnected. </p>

<p>If you understand the movement of planets and the gravitational/spiritual forces involved then you understand the importance of a planet going &quot;retrograde&quot;</p>

<p>In April there will be 4 retrogrades happening at once. This has not happened in a very long time. Each planet represents different aspects of human life and when they go retrograde it affects those areas in a different way then the status quo. </p>

<p>Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn all going retrograde will greatly affect human consciousness. </p>

<p>The original astrotheologists used these subtle energies, freely given by the universe, to control the perceptions of the masses. </p>

<p>Today you see the symbols everywhere, every major corporation is in someway using astrology or numerology to pay homage to the 7 original &quot;planets&quot; or &quot;wandering stars&quot;. </p>

<p>Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. </p>

<p>Saturn is the keeper of secrets, the judge, the reality check, the physical world, limitations, etc. He is the god that the Illuminati worship. </p>

<p>Saturn = Saturday = Satan </p>

<p>Words are funny. </p>

<p>Just be on the look out for a lot of fucking change in the next 30-60 days. The subtle energies of the universe are pushing us to change. </p>

<p>Go with the flow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. </p>

<p>I just am expressing my opinions surrounding the subject, and have since I was in high school seen some very strange things regarding cults and the power of mind over matter. </p>

<p>If we all believe the sky is blue, it&#39;s blue. </p>

<p>If we were all raised to see blue as green, what color would the sky be? </p>

<p>You just have to open your mind. </p>

<p>Why is 7 such an important number? </p>

<p>Why did ancient astrologers know so much about the stars, supposedly without having access to telescopes? </p>

<p>Why, in ancient Sumerian cuneiform are the sun and moon considered planets? </p>

<p>Let me ask you this, what would life in earth be like if there were other planets in the solar system? </p>

<p>Would there be life at all?</p>

<p>Still blue.  The world doesn&#39;t run on chaos magic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not.  What are some real world examples where the number 7 had real, physical power?</p>

<p>Math.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert on Sumerian culture, and neither are you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: I meant if there were NO other planets in the solar system. What kind of effect would that have on us? Ask yourself. </p>

<p>I actually am pretty well versed in Sumerian culture and I can tell you they believed the sun and moon to be &quot;planets&quot; or stars that moved. </p>

<p>You say &quot;math&quot; as if it&#39;s some natural force encoded into consciousness, but it&#39;s not. You think some guy with a stick in ancient Sumer has the patience and understanding to map out the cosmos? </p>

<p>How? </p>

<p>Well, the question demands an answer because it DID happen. </p>

<p>The question you should be asking is &quot;how&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way some old wise man on Ur just randomly was able to map out the stars without some kind of understanding of the spiritual disposition of the universe.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you can find plenty on the internet about the daily, weekly and monthly changes in astrology. </p>

<p>Every 30 or so days the sun moves into another position, this is the most commonly known change known as a &quot;sun sign&quot;. </p>

<p>The moon changes every 2 and a half days. In April there will be a significant amount of changes occurring at once, which is why I wrote this post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, frequent enough that Mercury and Venus retrograde are not, by themselves, remarkable.  Combined with Jupiter and Saturn, yes.</p>

<p>Re: <a href="https://www.greatamericaneclipse.com">the eclipse this summer</a>, eclipses are <a href="http://astrostyle.com/learn-astrology/solar-and-lunar-eclipses/">typically associated with upheaval astrologically</a>.  It&#39;s been quite a long time since the US has been in the path of a total eclipse, so....  yes, &quot;growing pains and trials&quot; for norteamericanos.</p>

<p>As for rulers believing in astrology.  I&#39;m pretty certain at this point that elites follow a very old religion, carefully hidden from the masses.  Since you&#39;ve researched this for a long time, I think you&#39;re pretty aware of how all the symbols used in public rituals, timing of events, etc., seem to suggest this.  So astrology would be part of this constellation (as it were) of beliefs.  Note the famous quote <a href="http://karenchristino.com/evangeline-adams/j-p-morgan-and-astrology/">attributed to JP Morgan</a> (perhaps erroneously):  “Millionaires don’t use astrology, billionaires do”</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So do you think astrology is &quot;evil&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s just another system to understand.  Whether it&#39;s &quot;effective&quot; is another story.  FWIW, I grew up with a parent who was a semi-professional astrologer, but I eschewed it for a very long time and ended up becoming a scientist.  These days I&#39;m willing to reconsider whether it&#39;s useful or not, either as a valid method in-and-of-itself for &quot;timing&quot; various political phenomena (due to time-resonances, which I believe in, see r/holofractal), or at least a window on elite views of optimal timing of events. </p>

<p>A final note:  I recall growing up (in the 80s) that <a href="http://www.alabe.com/">Astrolabe</a> was some high-end astrology software that was pretty much the only way you could easily perform certain calculations.  At the time, I lived on the West Coast, and had no context for the location of the company that produces the software, Brewster, MA.  Only after moving to the East Coast did I realize that Brewster is in a very affluent residential community in Cape Cod (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster,_Massachusetts">median family income $57K</a> in 2000).  In other words, the author(s) of the software are (likely) operating a home business in a reasonably wealthy community.  Make of that what you will...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It certainly means <em>something</em>.  What, I don&#39;t know exactly.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t found astrology particularly effective at understanding the timing of events in my own life, but I&#39;ll admit that a traditional analysis/interpretation of my birth chart does a pretty good job of fleshing out my personality and personal challenges, at least in my youth.  </p>

<p>Note that sun sign is not enough, you need at least the moon sign and ascendant to say anything at all about how a person&#39;s birth chart relates to their personality.  But it&#39;s better to have all of the other planets and house positions also.</p>

<p>For me. I&#39;ve seen enough to experience the oneness of nature. These celestial changes DO affect our psyche. You can argue the extent of it, but I think the fact that the elite of this world have always valued and studied these teachings makes it an important subject from the beginning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem! </p>

<p>Well, essentially Venus represents the feminine principle and more specificly young women. She&#39;s the goddess of love, beauty, and relationships. </p>

<p>Venus went retrograde march 4th. When she goes retrograde it seems to have an effect on people&#39;s love life. If you&#39;re in a relationship it may just be a time to reflect and reevaluate things, &quot;are you happy?&quot; &quot;Are things equal&quot; etc</p>

<p>For those who aren&#39;t partnered it&#39;s not a good time to start new love because you&#39;re consciousness is thinking about the past; possibly pat relationships. </p>

<p>This is what&#39;s happening to me. My girlfriend/fiancée broke up with me in February, and based on what our mutual friends have said, over the last few weeks she&#39;s been regretting it deeply, as we are/we&#39;re in true, pure love. </p>

<p>Basically, this is a time for you. Refresh, clean the bells and whistles, get ready for April because when Venus turns the other direction something new and exciting may be waiting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my natal chart sadly proved prescient, but as a general predictive tool, astrology has been bullshit for me.</p>

<p>fwiw, saturn is not the planet of secrets. it is the taskmaster. the planet of kharma. </p>

<p>saturn was the roman god of agriculture. the saturnalia was the roman month-long feasting and merrymaking in dec (but christmas is just a coincidence right?). &quot;satan&quot; is not of roman derivation. it&#39;s hebrew (as one would excpect)</p>

<p>pluto is the planet of sectets, the planet of destruction  (pluto is hades is the king of the underworld, and the one most typically associated with satan in the sense of the lord of hell).</p>

<p>jupiter is the planet of expanse. the planet of justice. it can&#39;t be hard aspected, unlike saturn, which is always hard aspected.</p>

<p>mercury is the planet of communication. mercury in retrograde is supposed to cause communication problems--misunderstandings and missed messages.</p>

<p>venus is the planet of union. can&#39;t really be hard aspected either. mercury can.</p>

<p>you aren&#39;t supposed to just take them by themselves but in context of the sign the retrogrades occur in. each planet supposedly is effected differently by the sign it is in and how it relates to the planet/sign combo on your own natal chart.</p>

<p>here&#39;s my natal chart to explain:</p>

<p>sun aquarius 
ascendant libra
moon taurus
mercury capricorn*
venus pisces*
mars aries*
jupiter sagittarius* 
saturn taurus
neptune libra
uranus sagitarius
pluto libra</p>

<p>(my last 3 planets are genX&#39;s generational planets, the same for all of us)</p>

<p>the * are the home planets for those signs, so theoretically the retrogrades in venus, mercury, and jupiter will be felt more by me than someone else, the saturn one the same or less so. it takes an hour to work it all out, which i don&#39;t feel like doing because after wasting an hour of my time, it amounts to nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends all on an individual basis. It&#39;s simply a time of &quot;heightened energy&quot; and &quot;heightened emotion&quot; </p>

<p>As an aggragate, humanity will likely go through some trial and learning experience. </p>

<p>Venus is retrograde now, since March 4th, till April 15th. When Venus goes retrograde every 18 months it&#39;s a time of reevaluation of relationships and romance. </p>

<p>Mercury, which is retrograding, April 9th - May 3rd, is responsible for the mind and intelligence of man. This will be a period of reevaluation of decisions and mindsets. </p>

<p>Perhaps these energies will push some older, able bodied people to change for the better. We are inching towards another revolution, one that will make the Industrial Revolution look like a joke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with your post here. Around December time I noticed a massive shift in consciousness. Alot of people pick up empathic traits and becoming alot more aware of their reality. During that time I got heavy into meditation and projecting myself for more information about our world. In January I was sat with my partner and I felt like I had information pushed into my brain about the planets and their vibrations and the vibrations and protons our bodies project, with the words computer system. I started to read deep into occult beliefs and crowleys book ect and they 100% follow key dates in astrology where events are happening in the solar system. I truly believe that the planets project the vibrations we cause individually and collectively back to us. Making an impact on our reality and punishing us with karma for our negative vibrations and good vibrations. I believe the elites know loopholes around the dates where they can continue to abuse the people of the earth and get away with it. But something has happened recently and it seems karma is slowly punishing and dragging everyone&#39;s misdeeds into the light and public knowledge. I think this is a moment in history where beings all over yhe universe will write about and talk about. The year humanity rised up and came before corruption and greed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rick Levine&#39;s youtube site gives very good, IMO, forecasts per month. He&#39;s a good mix of expert with psychology. He also notes that, many times, astrologers shouldn&#39;t claim to prove how astrology works, because they don&#39;t really know, they just firmly believe it does because they have studied it extensively and how it apparent it is. Which goes back to what OP said, we should all study it ourselves, because then it becomes very F*Cking apparent. John Anthony is another good lecturer on the topic. Nothing beats diving in for yourself. A favorite site of mine that I regularly check is astrodienst: <a href="http://www.astro.com/">http://www.astro.com/</a>  You can check the current chart of the moment. Also get a free, computer generated read, which is ok I guess, but ooOOOOoo the chart of the moment!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look I understand your gut reaction to this as a materialist and it makes sense. I can assure you I have no interest in starting a cult or convincing of you of anything for that matter. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just someone who cares, and for me, I&#39;ve seen some supernatural shit. I don&#39;t talk about it because yeah, it&#39;s crazy, and most everyone would not believe me. </p>

<p>Just don&#39;t rule out the possibility of there being something beyond what your 5 animal senses can detect. I&#39;m simply warning you as a friend. There are forces out there that would shock those unprepared to face them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a journey. I can tell you that much. I would suggest meditation, prayer, and eating a clean, preferably vegan or light meat diet. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t help you fathom the characteristics of the solar system much more than a germ can explain to another germ the extent of your human body. Understand they are the same. All matter could be broken down and placed within a single human body. Almost all matter is empty space. </p>

<p>The things you&#39;re seeing right now are not as they appear. All that exists, exists because we are looking at it, because we are <em>paying attention</em></p>

<p>Let me ask you this, if I somehow removed all of the other planets from the solar system, what do you think would happen?</p>

<p>Your empirical mind says &quot;well the gravitational anomoly would cause earth to spin out of control&quot; </p>

<p>I ask, well so the other planets are in a way, guardians? </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I suppose&quot; </p>

<p>And the ancient cultures all around the would knew this and considered this knowledge the most important aspect of their society? </p>

<p>That outta tell you something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, this is my turn to shine!</p>

<p>I was surprised to see astrology here in conspiracy.</p>

<p>If you guys are interested, I suggest you a book. The author talks about astrology, numerology, frequency, immortality and CIA / government. </p>

<p>How her daughter disappeared suddenly.
She talks about some conspiracy stuff, government, the lies that they tell us and more.</p>

<p>&quot; Linda Goodman &quot; (Star signs).
 check her other books too! She used to be a famous astrologer.. </p>
