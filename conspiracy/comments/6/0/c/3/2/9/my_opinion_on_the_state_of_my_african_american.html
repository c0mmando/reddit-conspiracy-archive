        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With Trump being elected president after a shocking attempt from the DNC to keep their evil powers in place, I say that it&#39;s time for us African Americans (and Caucasian minorities living under the same circumstances as African Americans) to recover.</p>

<p>We have lost everything (as a majority)-even our independent thinking-to the voices of government corruption. These voices told our fathers to rob stores and use &quot;divide and conquer&quot; methods to get more resources for their struggling families-all because education standards differ from other races (in that I mean our community&#39;s level of education is purposefully awful) and since they are exposed to the radiation of cellular phones and television (and, through mass television brainwashing tactics via advertisements from the MSM, taught to buy nothing but cheap, convenient food) this is their only way out. These voices told our mothers to divorce from fathers to make a quick buck from the government. These voices are the same voices responsible for high incriminations of our race and the &quot;Legal, Neoteric Jim Crow&quot; that those incriminated people cannot escape. These voices are the same ones that are plotting to introduce a HR 610 act, which indirectly states that it will destroy urban, overcrowded public schools by transferring their funds to higher level schools like private charters, which most African Americans cannot afford (it also plans to do away with nutritional standards). These voices are responsible for the revolution in gender changing, and how sudden it became in our community. These voices make me sick, and it should make you sick too.</p>

<p>If the BLM movement has taught me anything, it&#39;s that we CAN stand up and come together to rebel against these whisperings and chats, but we need to do it for the right reasons. Let&#39;s use those same crowds gathered by that movement to also hold days where we get together as a community and clean up the place.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start opening small shops like fruit stands or organic smoothies to attract crowds, and use that money to give back to those communities that raised us.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start holding book clubs instead of gaming sessions.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start fasting more (or at least begin to expose ourselves to ripe fruits and do away with GMO slowly...).</p>

<p>These are just four ways to recover from the plague of the poverty, the &quot;war on drugs&quot;, and the brainwashing of the masses to make our communities a better place, but there are so many other ways.</p>

<p>The government will never be your friend, only a deceitful enemy for a bigger goal.</p>

But the state he opposed made him a stamp
And that&#39;s the best you can hope for if you never give up
Your enemies will teach your corpse to dance
And you and me, buddy, we&#39;ve been living for a ghost
We ain&#39;t been sticking our heads in the sand
So when I&#39;m afraid take me by the hand
And show the world that we can&#39;t be planned. -Pat the Bunny</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gardening and bee-keeping are good ways to get people back into production of goods... service based economy is just about keeping people broke and needy (has people working longer hours to go deeper in debt).</p>

<p>I think that the key (for all people) is empowerment through cooperation and mutual enrichment. Times will only get tougher (economically speaking) in the near to long term... Production of  goods and necessities utilizing private or shared spaces is a sure way to generate income/capital for people who cannot find, keep, or make a living through employment. </p>

<p>I agree with the concept wholeheartedly, but as long as the use of neonicotinoids (etc) is allowed, the bees won&#39;t stand a chance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My concern is that civil asset forfeiture will be used militantly to steal any capital that is used for constructive purposes like urban organic gardens, beekeeping, etc.  It&#39;s not very hard to make an urban garden look like an illegal cannabis operation, justifying a raid and asset forfeiture.  Remember, a conviction is not necessary in many states.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about optics. Don&#39;t go for the <a href="/r/spacebuckets">/r/spacebuckets</a> approach. Put together a raised gardened with 2x6 planks, and have flowers, tomatoes, carrots, and other visibly identifiable fruits and vegetables in there. If it looks sketchy, people will think its sketchy. </p>

<p>Instead of focusing on funds, or spreading money, build trade. Share recipes, fruits, and vegetables from the community garden with each other. Hold book club sessions and arts and crafts, and actively show you care for your community by keeping it cleaned and maintained, even if it&#39;s neglected. </p>
