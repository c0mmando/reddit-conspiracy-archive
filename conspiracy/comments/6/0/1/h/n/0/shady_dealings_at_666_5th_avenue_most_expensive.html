<ul>
<li><p>666 5th Avenue was bought by Jared Kushner (Trump&#39;s son-in-law) in 2007 for a record-setting $1.8 BILLION dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>Charles Kushner, Jared&#39;s father, is a convicted felon that served time. He was involved in a scandal where he hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law who was coorperating with federal investigators.</p></li>
<li><p>Kushner&#39;s exact convictions were for: illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2017, Anbang Insurance Group of China purchased an interest in the building, based on a value of $2.85 billion; some of the deal&#39;s terms were called &quot;unusually favorable&quot;, including  retirement of the Kushner organization&#39;s remaining debt at 20 cents on the dollar, raising concerns about political influence on the Donald Trump presidential administration due to Jared Kushner&#39;s position.</p></li>

<p>Putting him or her in his place and making sure they know that place is important.</p>

<p>I want to instill permanent doubt inside this person. So that just is case they get any other great ideas, like infiltrating an obvious mafia gambling ring or some stupid shit like that, his head remembers, &quot;o, I&#39;m stupid, I better ask Reddit first.&quot;</p>

<p>Making sure that this person knows and is aware that is a stupid idea is the first step in making sure they realize maybe more than just one of their ideas is stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a documentary posted earlier this week about the history of the Russian mob. </p>

<p>One of the things they were doing in the 1990&#39;s was buying property in the US, then turning around and reselling the property to the Russian gov&#39;t at double what they bought it for, splitting the profits 50/50 (or something like that). </p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember exactly how the scheme went down, but this does sound similar, maybe, with what was happening with 666 Fifth Ave property. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Actually Deustche Bank got slapped with huge fines for laundering Russian Mob money too. $660 M from the State. And the Federal case is ongoing, the fines are going to be in the Billions. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of shady Russian money coming into the states to be washed. </p>

<p>What&#39;s happening at 666 could just be Kushner taking advantage of Trump&#39;s presidency and allowing the Chinese to launder some of their own dirty cash... </p>

<p>It could also be something much more nefarious... that building has a nefarious past. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a few thoughts. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the price inflation is necessarily suspect. Given the real estate bubble, pop, crash of the financial markets, and the restrictions on lending, someone who had cash on hand or access to credit would have seen that as an excellent time to buy. When no one has any money, things get cheaper. An investor could have felt he was getting a great deal by taking advantage of capital no one else had.</p>

<p>The sale in 2017 was about a 50% appreciation, over 10 years. That raises eyebrows. But if he got a rock-bottom price in 2007, and he may have, it&#39;s not all that unusual. </p>

<p>China&#39;s got a billion people. They don&#39;t all work on behalf of the government. Most of them are just dudes living in China. It could just be a regular transaction.</p>

<p>But maybe that company does expect something in return from POTUS Trump. And maybe the Chinese government is even involved. That can still be a one way expectation. Everyone who donates big sums to candidates probably expects something in return. And they don&#39;t all get it. Just like a guy might buy a girl a drink expecting to get laid. That has nothing to do with the girl. So if these folks do expect something in return, it&#39;s not necessarily the candidate&#39;s fault--he can&#39;t control a person&#39;s unspoken expectations.</p>

<p>I think the crux of what we&#39;re seeing here is that we have a family in power with many wealthy members, working in areas like real estate and finance that are highly speculative &amp; volatile, thus making it difficult to determine if something fishy is going on. We can&#39;t expect everyone in a family to quit doing business when one member gets into politics. And when you&#39;ve got a family like Trump&#39;s, doing business around the world, there is a lot of potential for abuse.</p>

<p>I think people are right to be concerned. I&#39;m concerned. But it&#39;s also very unfair to accuse a President of being crooked because someone related to him engages in a type of transaction that the family has been engaging in for decades. </p>

<p>I dunno. It&#39;s a tough situation. There are no easy answers. It&#39;s something to keep an eye on. </p>

<p>What part of RECORD SETTING MOST EXPENSIVE BUILDING IN ALL OF US AT THE TIME did you not understand exactly?</p>

<p>Also, forgot to mention in OP that Anbang was denied a purchase a couple years ago in the US due to National Security Concerns.</p>

<p>Also forgot to mention Anbang has been identified as a front for Chinese Government. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is always a most expensive building in all of the US. And it&#39;s always in New York City. Probably usually on 5th Avenue, too. And it usually just recently sold, because knowing what someone&#39;s willing to pay for a building tells us what it&#39;s worth. </p>

<p>While that sale does affect the valuation of nearby buildings, unless an owner is looking to sell he fights to keep his building less valuable by pointing out the negative traits of his property. The more a building is worth, the more it&#39;s taxed.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know about the previous purchase by Anbang being denied for national security reasons. Looks like it was the sale of the kickass Hotel del Coronado, declined because of its proximity to the naval base. In that light I think it&#39;s safe to assume that this company is associated with the Chinese govt, or at least could become so. That does change the analysis a bit.</p>

<p>Not a ton of exchanged money on record. There&#39;s the debate between &quot;donations&quot; and &quot;investments&quot; to be had as well. The Anbang thing appears pretty obvious as a profiteering move. You have to assume the Trump family knew there was no rule against presidential relatives striking business deals off the strength of the family&#39;s greatest position. They employ an army of lawyers. There may be nothing illegal about what they&#39;re doing here and abroad, but there will be after Trump&#39;s time in office. It&#39;s pretty absurd, frankly, and blatant. </p>

<p>It does make me wonder where all of these corporate media hounds and supposedly concerned investigative citizen posters where during the corruption and malfeasance of the Obama, Bush and Clinton administrations?</p>

<p>This intense scrutiny of Trump&#39;s administration is borne out of a rancid partisan power game and not some objective mission to hold power to account. </p>
