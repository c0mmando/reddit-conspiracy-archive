       Hello conspiracy!
      </p>
      <p>
       Everywhere else i try to bring this up it gets downvoted to all hell without any rational discussion of the possibilities. Unfortunately this is my personal conjecture.. In other words im guessing.. But i have a reason for presenting it honestly as speculation.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The media in the US (liberal, conservative, and "unbiased" sources) is lying to us. Universally. Spinning the facts and playing off the emotions of the target audience to discourage productive discourse on issues across the board, and to sow discontent and division amongst the masses.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The current conflict with russia (including our current government witch hunt) is a ploy to breathe new life into the cold war(the greatest fear that the "elders" in our administration know) being pushed by BOTH sides.
        </p>
        <p>
         2a. This could be for profit of the few (global elite) or could be being set up as an introduction to WW3, which would be far more profitable.
        </p>
        <p>
         2b. The main goal could be to cull the booming global population. Nothing does this better than war, and the by products of war (famine and disease)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, like i said i have no sources to cite here (since i believe that all media is pushing one agenda or another) but i figured that this would be the best place to get some quality speculation and discussion from people who are deeper down the rabbit hole than myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr- we're being fucked from all sides and everyone just wants their private hole for their head in the sand

       Little bit of both.. But.. Then again i view reddit as a snapshot of the collective human psyche.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading through reddit is a lot like my adhd.. Lots of thoughts feelings and opinions (some contradictary) developing into an overall shared opinion..

       Yeah, I pretty much agree with everything here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm worried that the MSM is lying even more than we think they are. Hawaiian Senator Tulsi Gabbard just came back from Syria saying that everything we think we know from news reports is wrong: our intervention is flat-out making things worse, we are helping terrorists, the leaders of Syria and Iraq are doing the most to stop terrorism, etc. Many non-western media outlets have come out saying al-Qaeda isn't even real in the way that the MSM is telling us to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're so insulated from the realities of things on the ground that I don't find it hard to believe that everything we're told is spin. There's that famous quote from Reagan's CIA director that says "We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's possible and likely that our news is routinely taken through corporate and government white washing.

       Yes. The world is being juiced for wealth at an untenable rate. We all agree, but have been convinced we don't. The party can only have a few more decades left, at this rate anyway. TPTB will ensure things are ripe for there bloodline here on earth if mars isn't a better option. If they are staying, people have got to go. Period.

       haha great quote. and a scary reality it has become. i recently found tulsi gabbard by the Act shes putting out now, Stop arming terrorists act. As a canadian, i think this is a great act and would definetly help in stopping terrrorism across the world, but really, america/business/zion does not want that.

       However, a war will still be one of the most effective ways to thin us out. Take a look at WW2, the numbers of casualties, and economic boom parts of the world experienced afterwards. Also take a monent to project the current population if thise casualties had not occured then.

       Cancer is, largely, intentionally inflicted. It's arguably the most profitable way of quietly culling a population -- other than, perhaps, organ harvesting which is also industrialized. The direct medical cost of treating cancer in 2014 was
       <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/economic-impact-of-cancer.html">
        $87.7 billion
       </a>
       . About
       <a href="http://www.worldometers.info/cancer/">
        1.8 million people
       </a>
       have died of cancer
       <em>
        so far this year
       </em>
       , on track for about 9 million total in 2017. This is a holocaust of unimaginable scale. (I actually couldn't find numbers for how many, total, have died of cancer in the history of the world, but it's gotta be over 100 million.) If your child is diagnosed with cancer, and you deny conventional treatment, there's a good chance they will be taken from you and
       <em>
        forced
       </em>
       to undergo chemotherapy, often a death sentence, even against their own will. Fuck, that's dark.

      <p>
       Cancer has been largely cured, along with most major illnesses, and the solution is very simple. Not easy, but simple: Concentrated nutrition, cleaning the liver (which, in turn, cleans the blood of all manner of toxins), and specific supplements.
      </p>
      <p>
       The body, with a little help, can generally clear even stage 4 cancer. And atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, drug addiction, and many others. You're not hearing about this because it involves zero pharmaceuticals, and the media and medical industries are utterly controlled. It would cost the medical industry BILLIONS if this got out into the public consciousness. But now you know.

       Wow! I could hug you.. Didnt expect the well thought out answer (even though thats why i came to this sub initially).
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree 100% and have been peripherally aware of this for a good bit now (funny enough pot research lead me to that particular rabbit hole)
      </p>
      <p>
       The only downside of cancer is that it's slow... And that downside is only a downside when the slow, steady, and profitable route becomes sub-optimal. Like we need to cull this shit quick kind of scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       The upside of the fast answer(war) is that anyone who survives can be sent home with (as my vietnam vet buddy calls it) "super cancer" and a host of other medical issues, thus restocking the long term financial pantry.

       Don't you think WW3 is already happening. The thing most people tend to forget is that we have social media and so many news sources. We are processing so much information on a daily basis that people are basically skipping through articles where 500+ people died in a car bombing and 300 people died in a suicide attack, etc. I really can't remember the last time I didn't hear about some kind of attack on the news. Add all the deaths from wars and chaos and you'll be surprised about how many people already died in 2017 alone.

       I think we're in the preliminary posturing phase.. Once upon a time it was a murder here.. Dead (insert foreign country native) showing up mysteriously there..

       These days the scales have stepped up.. We've become more efficient.. I wouldn't say WW3 has started until we have some big name countries taking some clear sides and some declarations being signed.. World super powers openly attacking each other..

       I think you are absolutely correct.  I believe the reason we have blatant and rampant corruption is because the curtains are going to be pulled rather soon.  We are closing in on 7 billion, and tptb will certainly try to save themselves with every resource at their disposal.  It's going to take a mass "awakening" (I hate that word-- wish there were another term) or we are toast.  There is a reason the police have been militarized, and made the enemy of the people with things like civil asset forfeiture, tptb do not want the police to identify with the population, otherwise how can you get them to possibly kill their own friends and neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel things are rapidly unraveling at this point.  I'll be amazed if we skate through the next year or two without a major... something.

       But seriously, you summed up another one of the huge red flags i wanted to include before work and my attention span decided otherwise.. I feel like the whole plate is wobbling and nothing they do at this point can keep it spinning.. Even if tptb come through, almost everyone down the totem pole from them is going to get shafted and they know it if they cant somehow start an eotw/world war style event.

       Well, I'd hate for anyone to have the same dark thoughts that I carry around all of the time, but this world has that effect I suppose on people that don't fall for the usual trivialities in this modern culture.  It's not fun.  But I still recall all of the magazines I would pour over as a little kid in my grandparents bathroom with warnings about the inevitable environmental collapse we would soon face barring a rapid and huge change in--- everything.  As time went on, these warnings evaporated.  I feel much scholarly knowledge is kept from us, or at least not broadcast, instead people have to search all over for the truth.  But the people who run think-tanks have it all. They know roughly how much time is left.  They have studied every aspect of human nature, and can predict with a lot of accuracy how to handle mass movements.  Every field has been examined, because money is no object.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also feel religion plays a larger role in this than people might think.  Many of these people feel they might be fulfilling a biblical role.  That's all I'll say for now, or I'll be called an antisemite, and I just don't feel like having that argument tonight.

       It's only entrenched criminals (and those who take orders from them) who are pushing the Russia thing.   We know from wikileaks 6 months ago that it's 100% fake.

       I have a really hard time taking the guy seriously since he was originally set up as someone hillary couldnt lose against then did when public backlash against her was at critical mass.

      <p>
       On the flip side our government is so corrupt, that your idea as him as our savior implies that voting means anything at all on that level and isnt just a smoke show to keep us all occupied, AND that trump isn't their "trump card" (please forgive this pun) by giving us someone who seems like a maverik but is entirely under their control.

       Again another assumption that's not really backed up by facts.

       Voting isn't overtly rigged in most places.  You just have to be able to win despite a MSM smear campaign, back stabbing from your own party and against an opponent that has billions of dollars.

       Trump is pretty much the only person in the country to whom these things aren't enough to stop him.

       Yup, i freely admit that the things im tossing around in this sub are not strongly backed up by sourced facts. I've even stated that these are feelings, hunches.. The first hints of smoke that indicate that there MIGHT be a fire..
      </p>
      <p>
       The basis of this idea (i cant even call it a hypothesis, it's barely formed and thats why im bouncing it off you guys) is that the party system is a lie and the real power lies above the government. Whichever side won, tptb made out like bandits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elecetion.. The voting system.. I believe it could all be smoke and mirrors to keep the populace complacent.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are studies thay show how "hard" it would be to rig the system... But what stops tptb from rigging those to play the tune they want as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically what im trying to say is that i'm skeptical of everything. Mainstream television is a lie, and possibly a medium for brainwashing the masses. Subtle suggestions to our societal psyche.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if any of that came of confrontational, or as an attack.. It isn't. I repect that idk much about these things and that the sources im shown and information given is questionable, regardless of where.  I question everything..

       correct my friend, basically the world is in the grip of a global mafia cartel.  it can only survive at the moment by working from the shadows. all we need is enough brave souls to shine a light on it.  its starting to happen... so strap in for some exciting times.... :D

       We're not f'ed... but you have to steel your mind against the system designed to keep you occupied with "bread and circus."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is Bob Livingston from personalliberty.com:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Perhaps one of the elite collectivists' most powerful tools in gaining control of the world is their patience. Gradualism can overwhelm the public mind. Almost anything can be changed over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know that such change, if its social structure is to remain hidden and unknown to the general public, requires extended periods of time to slowly and unknowingly seep into the social structure of society. Decades mean nothing to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the elite families have worked on the plan for centuries. Their signature trademark was the belief in the "inevitability of gradualness," that their ideas would eventually permeate into both government and private institutions and from there spread out into society in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the hidden keys of National Socialism, now called "democracy," is that the government wants and promotes opposition but only on spurious issues...
      </p>
      <p>
       How does one get free from this forced mental slavery?
      </p>
      <p>
       The first wake-up call is to come to know that there is a system for controlling you. Most of the masses do not want to wake up. The controlled masses are hostile toward reality. They want no discomfort of thought. They are at peace with regimentation unaware.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are controlled by a system of public education, including colleges and universities. The system is two political parties that are the same except in name. It is the controlled media. It is the medical system. It is fiat or paper money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the system is to control the people, so that most of what we think about and talk about is noise. But there is enough information for those who read to separate fact from fiction. It takes some a few years and others a lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       People mimic the system because they don't have enough information to process or separate fact from fiction or to know reality. The system permanently insulates most people from reality. There is no hope for them unless they seek reality regardless of their inbred convictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless one escapes the parameters of the system, it will one way or the other distort our perception of reality. And as long as we are mentally encumbered by 'the system,' we are subject to being manipulated against our best interest. Even when we think we are doing 'good.'
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between people is how they think. The difference in what people think is what they read. The difference in what they read is how much they read. How much they read is how close to reality they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you let it, your life will be so planned out by the powers that be that you could "live" and die and never know or experience reality."
