       Me and my friend used to be very close when we were kids, he was in a significantly higher social status than I was, as time went on I became more and more Pro conspiracy and he became more and more SJW like, When I brought any subject that wasn't MSM bullshit he would react almost robot like without trying to argue back against me. We had a huge breakup a few months ago because of our differences and recently I managed to save our friendship by saying I was sorry, because the incident that caused our break up was mostly my fault, but I stood my ground saying that I still believed in the conspiracies. I told him it was ok if he didn't believe in them and he agreed to save our friendship, but the way in which he denied my points of view and the cognitive dissonance in him was amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do Jews turn people into SJWs? that video was as much info as I could get. The way my friend's personality changed was very violent, but I'm glad my friend is still in there somewhere tho...

       Actually, local schoolboards control which textbooks go into their classrooms. So, I guess if you live in a Jewish neighborhood with a bunch of Jews on the schoolboard, you could say that "Jews" control the textbooks. Otherwise, not so much. The largest threat actually comes from evangelical Christians who actively seek to get on schoolboards so that they can control the message in the textbooks.

       Not much, if you are insisting that there aren't people who feel left out in America and it's history, you are being oblivious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you are referring to middle class white kids feeling some sort of resentment because of previous European Colonism, that is kind of what happens when you build a city out of blood.
      </p>

       A city built of blood cannot stand. Everything is time and it is only a matter of time until the end is due.

       I'm banned from r/oppression, so here: my response
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiricy talk involving Jews do get decent exposure here. It shows that a portion of the visitors are willing to discuss the topics, and go in depth about the details. In the light of fact-based discussion I think it is therefor important to have these kind of threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got a similar reaction to a thread of my own in this sub which was about Jews as well. It got a positive score, and overal adequate reactions, before being picked up by the
       <em>
        oppressive radical tolerance
       </em>
       activists. They're just everywhere ready to point the finger as soon as someone uses the word Jew thinking they're a Hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antisemitism and general discussoins about Judaism are older than Nazism, and every form of debate and criticism, if done in a factually based way, should be celebrated and encouraged by anyone. Jews too would benefit from this since it would help debunk a great deal of suspicion concerning their culture and supposed agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until it becomes easier to speak out about Judaism, there is no prospect of reaching a point of consolidation.

       So you think generic criticism about Judaism as a religion is the same as the Holocaust?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sir, you're not eligible to arguing about this topic if you equate it to hateful intolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
       By oppression discourse it only makes the diversion between Jews and the rest of the world bigger. Unless of course, they don't want the truth to be known, in which case I argue they better be scared lest history repeats.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fairness, I can't confirm or deny anything alleging Jews or their religion and their role in the world. It's just that, generally, any group who does not tolerate the truth, should be regarded as malicious. Now, if we can't even come to a point where we can debunk this suspicion, and if indeed it is against Jewish interest to discover the truth, don't they inherently deserve to be blamed for all sorts of things, since nobody is allowed to talk about them in a negative, inquisitive, or factually representative way?

       Isn't antisemitism their own fault if they indeed adhere to such interests?

       discussion here, we're talking about a thread with the basic premise of : how are jews secretly in charge of education and the creation of "sjw"s.  I rank this claim right around "jews eat a christian baby for passover meal" level of truth.

       I hear you.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does make sense to me is there seem to be foreign actors influencing current trends in the West by simply externally creating and funding organisations, spokespeople, activists and outlets to such an extent they can skew national democratic interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of the alleged paid anti-Trump protests and over 90% negative media coverage. This policy encourages outrage among the 'common citizen', when what they see around them is red flags signaling all sorts of drama and immorality they've been taught to oppose unconditionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would not surprise me if evidence surfaced that this foreign influence wasn't just coming from globalists but religious fanatics, in which case they come across as equally flawed as radical Islamists, having a similar agenda, although Muslims use different methods (public violence and terrorism, not covert deliberation).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again no evidence here, so feel free to discard any plausible concern. It is a conspiracy theory after all.

       The American Federation of Teachers is run by Jews and the ADL has a lot of influence on the public schools and it does exposes students with tons of topics about race mixing and homosexuality. That's not a "conspiracy theory" thats a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, my question was more like, what power do they REALLY have on education world wide? Not just America.

       Exactly. Let's not forget the amount of effort to control the narrative and the way they fight against free thinking. Even the admin of reddit couldn't cope with the public revelations and opinions found on one of communities and had to manually rewrite comments others made. I'm talking of course about
       <a href="/u/spez">
        /u/spez
       </a>
       , and it shows that the topic of free thinking has been oppressed throughout the ages and can happen anywhere, anytime. I like the example of Spinoza who denounced Judaism and was resultibgly excommunicated from the city of Amsterdam. Religions always lead to intolerance regardless of the progression of science and paradigms. The truth is what they shun as it goes against the fundament of their own crooked morals derived from superstition and ancient prophecies. Religion is a ploy for insanity and anarchy.

       I don't know, I do think Religion helps keep dumb people in check, My point of view is similar to Nietzsche, It's better to have a value in anything even if It's not based on logic than not believing in anything at all.

       Wise men created religions for the masses when there was no authority to teach them compassion, reason, and morality.
      </p>
      <p>
       These men just made up a story to go with it, having no scientific methods to proove anything they were on about. The soul, morals, empathy, spirituality, responsible citizenship.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were truly ingenious. So effective in fact they've created a monster that continues to plague us long after the necessity of religion has been proven as invalid.

       It isn't just a problem of people being "shy" about talking about or getting rid of religion, but It's about a group that only uses it as a mask to avoid criticism and hide their true agenda. That's just one of their weapons, the biggest one they have is crowd manipulation and of course the fear of becoming a social pariah just for talking about this subjects.

       About the thread, the reason I went full detail about me and my friend's story was to show how much the whole SJW mentality is more a result of very hardcore brainwashing ratter than it being natural, It's just a very violent way of separating people in an us vs them type of mentality. I was also curious if anyone was more aware about the control they had in other nations, personally I'm from South America and I can tell from friends over there that the control they have in Argentina over both media, inmigration and education is huge.

       I agree and many people agree with you, from all walks of life. There's a fascist threat that's taking over, more dangerous than Islamists and more dangerous than Nazism. It's because they're not openly announcing their plot and actively manipulating the public image of the traces they leave behind in all layers of society.

       One of the worst things they've done is how they have demonized Nationalism, the worst part is that no one can do anything about it, not even the first world nations. I'm very pessimistic about the right and the left.

       It's statistically proven how much being part of a group one can be proud of increases self-esteem and the desire to face challenges, things like preserving your culture and wanting to protect yourself from an alien tread is all just Racism and Xenophobia.

       Racism, xenophobia, I don't know, maybe it's called 'immigration policy'. Japan has it. Australia has it. A nation has no obligation or responsibility to anyone else considering their demography. People will complain, but they will do so in their own countries, where they belong. Where they have a chance to build a better future instead of being the problem of another nation. That is also nationalism, and it's a beautiful privilege to be part of a sovereign people. This creates strong cultures who can live peacefully in the global community, one of diversity, not multiculturalism. One of respect and diplomacy, not fear and anarchy.
