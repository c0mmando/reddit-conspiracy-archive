    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s doing a lot of righteous work,I fully concur. So why join the CFR? Bernie isn&#39;t a member. Not to present him as some herald of virtue, but he&#39;s managed to accquire enough credibility of his own merits to create a platform to presidency, without joining shady Rockerfeller policy generators? </p>

<p>You could easily argue she&#39;s doing so as a ploy, a psyops to gain connections and experience- then bang! RkO outta nowhere she drops them, and does her own thing. For the people. </p>

<p>But how likely a scenario is that? 
-Tulsi Gabbard single handedly intends to pull off the greatest <em>coup de tat</em> in history by cheating the Cabal from the US presidency? Defying not only decades of tradition, the monolithic conspiracy that opposes us, but sheer mathematical probability, to become not only the first female president, but the first since JFK not answerable to TPTB.</p>

<p><em>theres that</em> ... 
unlikely as it sounds, we must include it as being technically possible. So slim a chance as to render it invisible at an angle- but still, not impossible.</p>

<p>Or perhaps despite multiple terms in Congress, she&#39;s still oblivious to the true nature of CFR, and <em>genuinely</em> joined because she in her eyes, its a prerequisite for a strong political career. </p>

<p>But that falls to pieces when you consider she&#39;s the only politician capable of accurate assessment of the situation in Syria... yet somehow doesn&#39;t recognise the CFR for what it is. </p>

<p>If we assume her perception remains constant when analysing the two scenarios, it should be obvious that an individual who can perceive the latter, will likewise get the former.</p>

<p>What else do you got?</p>

<p>As you may have been alluding to, the last person to &quot;play&quot; the garbage people and land himself in the oval office, got his head blown off. Over 50 years ago. </p>

<p>How people think it&#39;s possible that some second coming will slip through the cracks and then sprinkle fairy dust over the entirety of the US government still puzzles me. </p>

<p>Tulsi Gabbard needs to be watched like a hawk. Multiple terms in Congress, a Major in the army, a woman, a minority, attractive, only 35 years old. </p>

<p>It is funded by the Mercer family, among the most prominent members of the Rothschild&#39;s &quot;The Best Club in London.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mercer family is the financial backing behind Breitbart news:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We of course know that the CNP is bad news given that it is run by the Rothschilds via their Mercer proxy family, but suppose you didn&#39;t know about that. You could still tell they are bad.</p>

<p>One of the highest ranking members of the CNP is Oliver North of the Iran-Contra fame. In other words, the neocons behind Bush and cocaine running are running the CNP.</p>

<p>Who else is on the CNP?</p>

<p>Well, for starters: infowars Washington correspondent Jerome Corsi. Oops, turns out infowars is cointelpro.
Betsy Davos (Trumps education secretary) &amp; brother Erik Prince(Blackwater) - both members.</p>

<p>Now it starts to make sense why Skull &amp; Bones members are being put in charge of the Treasury department. Trump&#39;s people are the same people behind Obama, Bush, and Clinton.</p>

<p>And you can start to see why the anti-pedo Flynn got sacked. This administration was never about rocking the boat. The money, foot soldiers, and ideology comes straight out of a Rothschild backed operation. So, Flynn had to to go.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s entire staff and all his supporters are members of Council for National Policy.</p>

<p>They are responsible for instigating faux revolutions all the time.</p>

<p>Conway, Cruz, McCain, Breitbart, Bannon, Rand Paul, Richard DeVos (family of Betsy DeVos). All CNP, Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachmann. List goes on.</p>

<p>Alternative media talking heads...Phyllis Schlafly, Jerome Corsi? CNP again.</p>

<p>Why have you heard of the CFR but not the CNP?</p>

<p>You have enough names and leads here to conduct your own investigations, independent of me or any sources I&#39;ve offered. I&#39;d strongly advise doing your own research to to arrive at your own conclusions. After doing so, it&#39;ll be difficult to continue believing in the &#39;opposition&#39; presented by the other side. They truly are all in cahoots </p>

<p>cfr is generally shit. however some are worse than others. 
Agreed- either way membership is highly suspect. More so from someone like Tulsi. I remember Obamas rhetoric as a senator <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F9wtAqXq7Sg">sounding very similar </a>, which made him a more effective agent for war &quot;no one suspects the pacifist&quot;.</p>

<p>i still firmly believe obama was better than whatever the hildabeast wanted-or bush!
Can&#39;t agree with you there. As if, bailing out the criminals whose greed collapsed the economy wasn&#39;t enough, he then proceeded to engage in more wars than his predecessors. All this on a campaign of hope and change. The deception will have made things worse IMO.</p>

<p>Gabbard seems cut from a similar cloth. As a Veteran speaking truth on the state of affairs,she&#39;ll be doubly credible to the electorate if she is to run. If she wasn&#39;t a member of CFR I&#39;d be very excited. </p>

<p>Do you see how the myth of duality works? Your expectation shapes your perception. You&#39;re given two options - so you attach affinity to one no matter if they&#39;re deserving or not - <em>as long as it&#39;s not the other party</em>. I have never at any point been for Clinton. I was never for Trump. I just didn&#39;t write him off as controlledop till he&#39;d had a chance to prove me wrong- now that he&#39;s done so through his budget,  cabinet picks, Cabal advisers, utter lack of presidential attributes, flagrant disregard for taxpayer money etc in good conscience, I don&#39;t see how I can remain on the fence.</p>

<p>I agree Trump was preferred to Clinton. But the time for grey areas are gone. As it currently stands, with what you&#39;ve seen to date, is Trump a good president? Not is he better than Clinton would have been, or he&#39;s the best option available etc </p>

<p>You&#39;re certainly right and I agree that trump was the better option. If nothing else he&#39;s shattered the illusion that we don&#39;t all know what&#39;s up by making it common knowledge. More scope for a real revolution.. sadly I don&#39;t see that emerging under Trump.</p>

<p>Difficult to see her not getting the nod for 2020 - it make sense when you think of it- who else are the Dems gonna run? Whoever they did run would inevitably be tarred with the same brush as the rest of the corrupt party. </p>

<p>Not Gabbard. She&#39;s arguably the only democrat to emerge from the election with any kind of credibility (Bernie is seen as a sell out by many  who supported him just to watch him endorse his antithesis -harsh but true) 
Hard to see Trump beating her with a resurgent dem Base supporting her, republicans tired of how he&#39;s embarrassed them last 4 years and independents grateful for a genuine candidate this time around. In recent memory I can only remember2 candidates who&#39;ve managed such concerted growth in such short time: </p>

<p>Just like NPR, I would most certainly blame CFR for not actively resisting that bias, but at least at the 1st glance Gabbard&#39;s membership in CFR is not worse than her being a DNC Vice Chair.</p>

<p>I would argue that the fact that she was able to rise up the ranks of Democratic party that far would be a bigger argument against her than her membership at CFR.</p>

<p>Sorry but you need to keep digging. The CFR isn&#39;t some political activist group - they&#39;re a Rothschild think tank, whose members go onto the highest positions in office and enact into law, the policies created for them by this unelected secretive group.

<p>The reason that presidential candidates’ promises of “change” go largely unfulfilled once in office: they draw their top personnel from the same establishment groups — of which the Trilateral Commission is only one.
Chief among these groups is the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the most visible manifestation of what some have called the American establishment. Members of the council have dominated the administrations of every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the cabinet and sub-cabinet level. It does not matter whether the president is a Democrat or Republican. As we will later see, Barack Obama is no exception to CFR influence.</p>

<p>You have to understand that a politician and their supporters face different circumstances.</p>

<p>Sanders put his best effort forward during primaries, but once that opportunity closed, he&#39;s been playing the political game the way that&#39;d give him the best leverage/influence with other politicians in the future. That meant supporting Clinton.</p>

This is categorically incorrect. Since she began her campaign to raise  around the truth in Syria, Gabbard has gone from popular local politicians, to international profile. You must have missed her meeting to Syria to meet with Assad? Her appearances on CNN, Fox? 
<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/508367/">Never heard anyone refer to her as &quot;The GOP&#39;s favourite Democrat?&quot;</a> At one point before Trumps cabinet was announced, there where serious rumblings that she might get the nod for SOS. Far from the insignificant nobody you&#39;ve pitched her as.</p>

<p>Why would they bother assassinating her when the only people following her are a smattering of excited Bernie Sanders fans? 
Again, for your own ends, you&#39;re marginalising her into something she&#39;s not. With her open and sustained critique on Obama, Gabbard has managed  to bridge the party gap to emerge as that rare politicians who support on both sides. (Take a trip through T_D to see more than <em>smatterings of excited Bernie fans</em></p>

<p>Syria, that means they have to kill her!&quot; Many, many journalists have also exposed the truth and lived to tell the tale.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>She&#39;s not a journalist. She&#39;s a sitting congresswoman , making some very serious claims that run counter to the official narrative. Introducing Bills to stop the US government arming terrorists- when have you ever seen that happen before? Remember any republicans bucking the party line to run campaigns like this under Bush? Under anyone? It took her visiting Syria and reporting back on the lack of &quot;moderate rebels&quot; to shake a lot of people from the myth that US is the benevolent party in that equation.<br/>
Supporting &quot;Moderate rebels&quot; is the lie that allowed the US to fund, sponsor and abet the radical Islamic terrorism that manifests as ISIS, Al Nusra etc 
Have you heard anyone call her a liar? Any attacks on her character from the normally compliant media? Nope. Did you ever wonder how a Congresswoman got the juice to go an meet the leader of the country US has actively been trying to depose? If none of this seems fishy to you, then you haven&#39;t really been paying attention</p>

<p>No. But that&#39;s because she&#39;s essentially ignored. Like I said before, she&#39;s a nobody in Congress. You and I know who she is, people actively interested in politics might know who she is, but most people do not. Because the mainstream corporate media ignores her truth telling. They don&#39;t need to call her a liar, they can just pretend she doesn&#39;t exist, not unlike how they treated the guy she supported in the primaries. It&#39;s not like CNN is doing huge prime time exposes on Gabbard exposing the lies of the corporate media with regards to Syria, MSNBC isn&#39;t saying &quot;It&#39;s great the way she introduced that bill that would force the US government to stop funding terrorists&quot;, none of them are giving her free advertising to praise her for introducing legislation that would decriminalize cannabis on a federal level.

After reviewing the evidence at hand, ignoring my own innate affinity for her, im of the opinion she&#39;s controlled opposition. Being primed to be Obama MK2 - ready for the 2020 primaries.</p>

<p>Seems too much of a unicorn chain of events for my suspicions to remain dormant. This sub knows what fate awaits bonafide truth tellers (see Bill Cooper then see Alex Jones for example) and it certainly isn&#39;t prime time slots on major networks.</p>

<p>Spare me the indignation and pay attention : do you think I, a private citizen, has less  cause to ride for you than a politician does? You don&#39;t know me, but I understand that at some level- you see me. Your concerns are mine. You have family you want to see do well, health you want maintained, a career you want fulfilled etc </p>

<p><strong>I am not your enemy for casting doubt on a dubious factor</strong></p>

<p>I want her to be genuine just as much as you do. But I don&#39;t roll over anytime my owners request it - and neither should you. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are individuals in the CFR who are more or less innocent, but you need only at its members to see what&#39;s what.</p>

<p>Both Clintons. Zgbniew Brzezinski. David Rockefeller. George Soros. Obama. Colin Powell. Madeline Albright. John McCain. Rupert Murdoch. David Patreus. Condoleeza Rice. Dan Rathers</p>

<p>Some historic names :</p>

<p>Henry Kissinger. Allen Dulles. John Rockerfeller. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve been controlling the political dialogue since their inception, with a revolving door policy straight into the White House. You suggest  I may be hasty in indicting her as controlled opposition before she&#39;s done anything- I disagree. I&#39;m being prudent, in delaying my endorsement until the concerns I have are addressed. 
I&#39;d counsel you to remember Obama entered the public imagination in the same fashion: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>young
idealistic 
scandal free
gained plaudits through damning (and<em>extremely</em>well publicised) criticism of establishments foreign policy (Obama -Bush, Tulsi - Obamas)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and of course </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>member of CFR</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems unlikely Gabbard will reach office and choose that point to disavow herself from the organisation that&#39;s provided the apparatus for the majority of her predecessors. When she doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s a given she&#39;ll proceed to fill her cabinet with the exact same CFR characters that have populated her predecessors. <em>Voila</em> synthetic change occurs and the false dichotomy continues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s legit. Not only was she a vocal Berner (resigning as Vice Chair of the corrupt DNC to do so) but she made an off-the-record trip to Syria to see what&#39;s really going on there, saw first-hand that the US is funding ISIS &amp; subsequently introduced the &#39;Stop Funding Terrorists&#39; Act in Congress. Most recently she sponsored a. I&#39;ll in Congress to legalize cannabis across the board. She physically stood with the DAPL protesters &amp; supported them from the start (unlike that fake progressive, Warren).  She&#39;s supported the Single Payer option from the start. Do your research:  She&#39;s legit. </p>

<p>You haven&#39;t commented on how irregular that is- when do active congresswomen visit war zones to discuss peace and call out the incumbent president for sponsoring terrorism? I&#39;ve never seen it happen. I noticed a lot of righteous indignation across the politicians named in the sources, but for an action of that magnitude - unauthorised meetings with current western bogeyman- their responses are decidedly muted.</p>

<p>When you consider McCain is advised by the same people behind Trump (CNP), yet they&#39;re still in opposition - the synthetic drama between Chelseas  and Gabbard, doesn&#39;t seem so strange. 
You&#39;d have thought Hillary &amp; Obama hated each other - both members of CFR. Gabbard disagrees with Obamas policies - still a member of the group that developed them. In all likelihood, like the presidents before her, if elected POTUS, Gabbard will end up with the same folks producing the policy she&#39;ll then sign into law.</p>

<p>Then folks like  will wonder why nothing ever seems to change. .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She certainly seems legit I agree. What&#39;s concerning is her membership of CFR. Whom if you&#39;re aware of, you&#39;ll know to have ample reason to mistrust anyone who emerges from that organisation. So how to reconcile this paradox:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gabbard is a member of the CFR
It is known CFR is part of the wider infrastructure supporting the cabals control 
Gabbard is actively speaking out against policies enacted by members belonging to the same organisation that she does. 
CFR members routinely make the top picks for any incoming president - so if elected POTIS, it&#39;s likely Gabbard will be advised by the same folk as her predecessors (<em>cue the it doesn&#39;t matter who you vote for nothing changes</em> meme)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gabbard must either be:</p>

<p>A) controlled opposition
B) deep undercover </p>

<p>The latter seems less likely when you listen to the former chairman of CFR, the late David Rockerfeller, deceive the aims of his organisation:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as “internationalists” and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>How do they control government policy:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Two major means the establishment employs for controlling government policy: (1) through its influence within the two major parties and the mass media, it can usually assure that both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates will be its own hand-picked men; (2) by stacking presidential cabinets with CFR members at key positions — especially those involving defense, finance, foreign policy, and national security — it can assure that America will move in the direction it wants. Since the council’s founding in 1921, 21 secretaries of defense or war, 19 secretaries of the treasury, 17 secretaries of state, and 15 CIA directors have hailed from the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tl:dr Tulsi is being pushed as the next phase of the con. How warmly will she be received after Trump do you think? </p>
