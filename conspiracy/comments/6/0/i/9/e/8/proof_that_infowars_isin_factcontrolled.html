       I like Eddie bravo. He tends to maybe get a bit overzealous when he starts ranting but he's more woke than most people I think. He can come off as kinda crazy at first glance but I appreciate that. Reminds me of my younger self when I'd get stoned and want to ramble on about conspiracies.

       Corsi is a legit researcher and he's very good.  Keep in mind, some people need exposure so they have to dance with the devil until they get it.  Also, they may not know the entanglements Jones or his parent company may have to other supranational groups like john birch society etc

       We should be listening to everyone on every side, including jeff rense, and then reading between the lines of all of them.

       It's like here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  If you post something 'dangerous' to the establishment, suddenly there's this outbreak of various people debating viciously on both sides
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know who these people are
      </p>
      <p>
       You've never seen them here before
      </p>
      <p>
       They are new accounts or have low karma or they have reasonable karma but have mostly posted in sports and/or other subs and suddenly they are HERE debating
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a forum slid
      </p>
      <p>
       It's street theater
      </p>
      <p>
       IT's here to absorb the screenheight and drown out any legitimate conversations on the subject as a form of censorship through low signal-to-noise ratio
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing happens with video content.  They have deep pockets to produce hundreds of HD/4k videos a week, countless hours of content. And how...by selling water filters and bone broth supplements?  I don't thinks so

       These news stories are real, and verified by police reports, congressional reports and now rep louie gohmert's speech to congress.

      <p>
       It's not our fault you feel you have to get your reportage by listening to EITHER CNN or INFOWARS instead of just connecting dots yourself by reading lots of different news outlets, reading between the lines, and then verifying for yourself with real primary source materials like cspan video of congress talking, or statements made by government officials or police reports

       I believe Jones was offered a deal, like many others, where he is allowed to maintain a platform to act as the monopolistic voice of conspiracy theorists, so that anything he says becomes the publicly perceived "mainstream" view of conspiracies. It's why we always get the "oh you don't agree with Alex Jones? I thought he was your guys's god!" from the sheep whenever we differ from the conspiracist talking heads.

       I wish he were Bill Hicks though.

       He's not.  If he were Bill Hicks he'd be funnier, but instead he's mostly boorish with comedy happening by accident.  If he tried at funny, he'd be phenomenal because I think Jones is really intelligent and has the ability, he just plays the raving lunatic too much.  If he actually made it funnier, infowars could become the libertarian daily show (more than maybe it already is)

       Are the Awan brothers from Saudi Arabia?
      </p>
      <p>
       GWebb has us looking at them, but it seems Trump isn't touching them or SA.  Which i'd imagine would be similar to Alex Jones, whom also doesn't touch Alefantis and CPP directly.

       I figure something is better than nothing, but if there ends up not being heavy swamp draining, then i'm assuming they are controlled or trying to control something.

       From what I can tell, there is no social interactivity with the Twitter account @RealAlexJones and @infowars Twitter accounts. They seem to be purely bot account that Tweet out articles.

       If you want to alert the reporters there to a story, Tweet at the following reporter accounts:

       The Awan brotherhood is what this sub should be really focusing on.

       As for Alex I've suspected him of being controlled opposition for a while. He makes conspiracy theorists look bad with his crazier stories and wastes people's time with a bunch of bullshit that doesn't lead anywhere.

       Presuming it is an actual Twitter list, having it leaked and those entries added generates a more believable story of the credibility of Jones' product.

       It's not like they are the borg and have a hive mind, but it's easier for us to fall into that logical trap and think they are.  It's more like a multi parent hierarchy plus compartmentalization.  They may be on teh same side but not know it and be coaxed into fighting each other, which to the federated parent power structures would be simply puppet theater but to us would appear to be a legit turf war

       You'd think he'd be able to figure that out and put the brakes on it.  I guess he never expected to have the ear of the president of the us.  I still think--if that's true--it's really strange.  Strange bedfellows

       Well I watched his Joe Rogan podcast the other day out of interest. I think he's somewhat of a savant, but part of the issue he has is he trusts all or most of the information he recieves that can fit into a pattern he sees. He even said he recieved info from General Flynn and I'm not sure what Flynn's deal is. Why lie? Anyway, people will take advantage of Alex at every opportunity for good and bad so you kind of have to filter what he says yourself.

       Infowars is against globalism . They've helped expose globalism and wake thousands if not millions of people up to the real enemy, the globalists. They are far far more helpful to us than harmful. I don't care if they don't mention certain groups by race or name, they are in the fight for the right reasons and provide a valuable service.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're the Fisher Price / Sesame Street of conspiracy theories and I love them for be the ground floor supporting the weight of those who wish to dig deeper.

      <p>
       Not you specifically u/911bodysnatchers322, but it's interesting how there's all these attacks on Infowars today after the recent announcement of "investigations" into them and Roger Stone

       Thank you. I'm tired of defending Infowars/Alex Jones. People really think he is controlled opposition- why would he even mention half the things he talks about? They are exposing everything going on, whether you want to believe it or not.

       I have this love/hate relationship with them
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like they are controlled opposition that will cover things once it becomes so obvious that they can't NOT cover it anymore
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like with any intelligence agency.  Once they have intel that is outed, they fess up to it when it's clear they have lost all ability to deny it, but not until then.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my point is Infowars plays the same 'plausible deniability' game with the public.  They won't cover something very damaging to the establishment until it's obvious that NOT doing so will either make them look irrelevant, or like idiots, or control grid themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we need to keep putting pressure on them to cover this awan story.

       The mods did a great thing today by stickying the Awan story

       It's healthy to not blindly follows faces for sure. I do think Infowars gets an unfair amount of criticism, they have to consider a lot of chess moves that others don't, and I don't think a lot of critics consider that.

       Hmmm. Here's Infowars talking about the Awan Brothers on February 21st:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PISEBq1qbo4">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PISEBq1qbo4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no mention of their names in the video description, so searching "Awan Brothers" on the Alex Jones Channel won't return any results.
