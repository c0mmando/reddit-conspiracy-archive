        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TL;DR: A year ago, I lived in a peaceful world where my only concerns arose from my own immediate experience. After going down the governmental rabbit hole, I’ve recognized how impactful the negative energy behind all these horrific realizations can be. I am hoping to alleviate the suffering, or the attachment to what we learn here. Because I firmly believe that, in order to combat this horror-drama time span in the universe’s narrative for humanity, we must remember true love. I know this sounds corny, but it’s more real than I think we initially assume. I apologize for the length — I tend to get personal so as to most effectively/honestly relate my thoughts to the reader. I’d also like to thank anyone who takes the time to read my personal thoughts. I promise that these are always written from an honest and passionate heart.</p>

<p>Hey, guys. I pop in here every so often to read what is going on in the world — or at least that which we are slowly exposed to despite it going on for a long, long time. And in recognizing how impactful some of this horrible news can be as you wake up to the truth behind the society in which we participate, I want to do whatever I can to alleviate the suffering that can come as a result of the learning we do here. Because the only way, I think, we’re going to overcome all of these traumatic realizations is that we come together with Love. Not the false love we’ve been introduced to for centuries — the kind of love in which you love someone or something so that you can, in turn, receive love back — but the true love in which you love genuinely and selflessly. You love for nothing in return. You forget yourself and your own illusory ‘me’ world. Bear with me. </p>

<p>A year ago, I was depressed. I had no reason to be, other than my thoughts were telling me to be. I couldn’t take it anymore. It was suicide or stare my fears in the face. Fortunately, I chose to stare my fears in my face. In that moment, I recognized that my fears were illusory. They were attachments to some ‘thing’ in life, whether it was attaining an object and fearing not getting it or becoming a certain person and fearing not becoming it, or even fearing death through an attachment to this life of mine. These pressures needn’t exist because they fundamentally don’t exist. We create them. This ‘them’ is the ego. It is the illusion for which we think, a false center in consciousness, also called ‘me’. </p>

<p>Generally speaking, most individuals exist in very personal worlds that are separate from all else. We have our own problems, our own realities, our own individual chaotic maelstroms of desires and concerns. And because we’ve believed in the illusion of existing in a consciousness that is fundamentally separate from the world outside of us for so long, we’ve forgotten the most powerful and useful aspect of all of nature: everything is One, everything is related, and everything is Love. Instead of embodying love, we’ve elected to participate in the game of separation. We literally feel separate from the universe, when the universe is the mother out of which we become. But we feel other than the universe? People really believe that each of us comes into this world, when in truth each of us comes out of it. That simple truth speaks volumes of the reasoning behind the chaotic reality which we currently have in front of us. </p>

<p>Fundamentally, we’ve forgotten love. Love has been substituted with artificial constructs (gadgets of technology, falsely loving someone in order to love yourself rather than loving someone selflessly, getting a better job, a better car, winning a war, finding a religion, and so on). I know this sounds hippy. I played college football and was raised in an all-American household. Hippy, flower-loving talk did not exist; it was foreign and rightfully so, I believed. But screw that. We can act like this isn’t true or we can stare it in the face, acknowledge that we’ve drifted from true love, forgive ourselves, and allow the magical process of self-healing to rubber band back to its origin of authentic love.</p>

<p>Here’s my concern. A year ago, I recognized the truth about how the world, which includes myself, had forgotten love. For a span of a few months, I experienced a sort of ineffable bliss in which I finally remembered true love and felt it for all things outside of my own self. Let me tell you something.. experiencing true love at all times of the day, which we can all do, is a hefty reminder as to why this whole ‘existing’ thing happens. The best way I can creatively describe that bliss is in this way: I am a musician and I love music more than anything. I uncontrollably cry when I hear a piano key being played at the most perfect time in unison with a violin. The magic I feel from music is ineffable. And when i rediscovered true love, everything I saw was being seen through the paradigm of that feeling I get from music. Everything was the same one song. It was all one verse, a UniVerse.</p>

<p>But once I’d become aware of politicians participating in spirituality focusing on negative energy, rather than positive, world-leaders being fake beauty queens with personal agendas, economies collapsing, climate change accelerating and showing signs of becoming even more relentless over the years to come, talk of extra-terrestrial life that’s been hidden from the public…I mean, so many mind-boggling happenings are being introduced to our minds. It’s overwhelming — at least it was to me. I admit that the negativity that has surfaced has brought me to the depths of hell. Myself, along with few others I’ve talked with, have unfortunately internalized the disgust so as to try and understand it. Well, I’m not sure it can be understood by any loving soul. It’s so, so foreign. So gross, so dirty, so sickly. </p>

<p>And if you’re on this forum, you likely care about humanity. I’d assume most of us are more sensitive people than others we might find elsewhere. Sensitive people feel compassion. And to be compassionate — to have an aware heart — and to know what’s really happening in the world while there are people walking around blind to the truth…that can have a massive impact. I, personally, have just wanted to cry and cry for months on end now. The emotional weight of this 180 degree turn that my understanding of reality has taken was, at one point, unbearable. But this is why I wrote to you all today. </p>

<p>What I’ve learned throughout the past year in solitude is that life seems to suck right now for the collective, but it needn’t be that way and it will not forever. That’s why change is happening now and the universe is going through a shedding of its skin, bringing to light unfathomable evil in the process. But the unfathomable evil, which we’ve been veiled from knowing for so long, can instill in any sensitive person some pretty massive confusion, disgust, and suffering. This is what we need to be aware of.</p>

<p>The more we suffer, the more ‘they’ win. Be aware of that and make a point of it. Each loving act you do has an impact. Every moment you take to genuinely love anyone, a family member, a coworker, a stranger…it makes a difference in this Matrix. And as all this information is exposed, we can either respond as awake people and culminate massive love as a response. Or we can fall victim to the unveiling horrors and helplessly fall down an even darker path before the universe sympathetically takes a U-turn.</p>

<p>Think about this: when you do something good for someone else and have no expectation of what you’ll receive in return, how god damn awesome does it feel when you see that person’s face light up after you’ve been kind? When you expect absolutely nothing in return, you can’t be let down. And when you can’t be let down and are living with authentic and real love — not that fake love crap we’ve been raised to believe is real — but the real stuff, selfless love…that’s when magic happens. That’s when you remember who you really are and what life is all about. That’s when you look your loved ones in the eyes again and remember that magnetic pull you feel from their heart to yours. You love again. You live again. The darkness has no ability to penetrate that authentic love. It’s the most powerful emotional manifestation of the universe that we can experience. And in order to be invincible and overcome this revealing period of turmoil, we must remember true love and tap into that deep, deep sense of oneness which we can all experience perpetually so long as we remain selfless and put our own agendas aside. Such a thing is hard to fathom in modern society when we’ve been raised to ‘be the best’ but we’re remembering who and what we are and that we’ve drifted from the truth. Thus, I believe our personal agendas are either going to fall apart and crumble as the universe has a plan to reintroduce humanity to what’s meaningful and worth giving our attention to, particularly right now, or we can make the choice to remember true love on our own.</p>

<p>Loving is the easiest thing to do once you forget your own agenda. I love you guys. I know that each of you is simply a ‘different’ manifestation of what I really am, and vice versa. Now, let’s all start living that way. Let’s live as One. For those of you who tend to misread my message and PM me to get out of here with my NWO preaching, I’m not speaking in the sense of One government, but in the sense of universal lovingness. A world in which we realize that everything is related and is made of the same stuff. Where no one is judged and everyone is celebrated. Where everyone’s intention is for the benefit of others and not for the benefit of self. That is where we will win. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fact. Such a simple fact. But it seems the common human thought structure disables the knowing of that fact from being experienced; it seems the mind is so concerned with its own perpetuation that it disallows experience from remembering that love is quite literally the answer to every problem because such a thing would result in the mind being rendered less important...dare I say, significantly less important.</p>

Don&#39;t fear them, when you send them love you take their perceived power. Love the ones who hate you. We are all so beautiful, talented, creative, and THEY try to hold us ALL down. We all have a beautiful spark of light in us from the creator. There is evil in this world that LOVES to feed on our fear and negativity. Don&#39;t let them. Write on the walls, dollar bills, whatever you want love graffiti should be everywhere. Wake up your neighbors. Spread a message of love.

    <div class="md"><p>One thing to keep in mind that I find fascinating:</p>

<p>Love energy will always &quot;defeat&quot; negative energy, but the problem, I think, is that love is &#39;passive&#39; while hate/negativity is &#39;active.&#39;</p>

<p>Negative energy gathers and seeks our more negative energy, actively moving in persuit of this negative energy. For example, someone who lies has to then continue lying to cover up that lie. Someone with a nefarious agenda will persue and plan and think about this agenda.</p>

<p>On the flipside, people don&#39;t usually actively good about seeing postive vibration, we happen to come across it and we can either act, or not act upon it. It&#39;s hard to actively seek good and persue an agenda of goodones, one has to simply maintain that mindset and persure it when they come across it. </p>

<p>As long as someone can be aware of these forces, and work against negative forces, they lean to the positive. This is different than actively seeking out the negative.</p>

<p>That is why it is important to keep an open mind, an honest heart, and treat others the way you wish to be treated. You don&#39;t have to volunteer all your time at a homeless shelter to be &quot;good&quot; -- you need to see the opportunities to bring a positive vibration into the world and act on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote on the idea sometimes ago... I believe good means 2 things:
 1. Righteous (Morals)
 2. Detachment (Emotions)</p>

<p>Righteous means you act on civilized aswell as natural principles if they are present. This is relative. For example if you are born in a world where everyone randomly kills each other and there&#39;s no language you would still be moral to act like that because you don&#39;t disrespect the balance. We couldn&#39;t even talk of &quot;right&quot; because the entire civilized principle thing would be not available for choice.
You get my point i hope.</p>

<p>Detachment is the ability to look at things objectively, 360 degrees on before judging, and it allows one to ponder many interpretations. This allows us to find the most appropriate as well as the most positive, or the most sensible, the most professional, and so on.</p>

<p>In the end i believe that if one refuses to submit his &quot;will to love&quot; to his &quot;ability to understand&quot; first little good come out of it, because the &quot;will to love&quot; is an &quot;urge&quot; and it can be swayed (like today it is) although is good on a base level, while if one wants to be able to choose the good direction for this he first must be able to understand both natural and civilized principles at play and to look at things from a detached point of view.
This i think is why the societies which were stricter to hierarchy and logic could also enjoy more solid relationships, and the ones based on happyness and emotions quickly degenerate on the very metrics they want to improve. Because they are all about the &quot;will&quot; from the inside view which quickly atomizes the human experience, while those that thrive take an &quot;outside interlocking approach&quot; so to speak and have a culture that appreciates the collective processes more than the individuals. We do live now in a fully atomized culture for the most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure where to start...  So much to say in response to this.  </p>

<p>Do you know about meditation and the pineal gland?  We are all connected; we are all one.  This is the great secret.  This is why certain drugs are illegal (DMT), and others are not.  </p>

<p>I think that a lot of us here are humanists.  We love life and we love humanity and we love the Earth.  This is what we are all fighting for.  We want to save all of this, and build a beautiful life for future generations, and ourselves.  </p>

<p>If you read about the NWO, they do not like humanity, and they put themselves above the rest of us.  They consider us to be &quot;human resources&quot;, like cattle, expendable containers, useless eaters, breeders, etc.  They want to get rid of people, to cull the herd to about 500 M.  The NWO has decided on their own who should survive and who should die, and, of course, they decided unilaterally that they should survive.  </p>

<p>The NWO has zero faith in humanity.  We do not.  </p>

<p>The NWO chose the dark side.  It literally is like Star Wars.  They chose the dark side because they are selfish cowards.  They do not understand why someone like me would share something I have with someone I do not know.  </p>

<p>The NWO chose to pursue mind control in the early 50&#39;s with MK Ultra.  They tried various drugs like LSD and magic mushrooms, and funded research in college labs.  What happened is that the professors and grad students would &quot;partake&quot; out of curiosity.  Then they would share with their friends, and soon the &quot;mind control&quot; drugs spawned the peace loving hippy movement-great music and art, and free love.  Guess what?  You cannot control these types of people, and you cannot make money off of them through warfare and enslaving them in factories.  So they made these drugs illegal.  Instead of seeing what a great thing they discovered, they made the drugs illegal and they suppressed the peace movement.  </p>

<p>This is because the NWO are fascists.  They are not humanists.  The fascists won WW2 and have been in control ever since.  </p>

<p>Imagine if we lived in a society in which the Summer of Love was every season.  Imagine how pleasant and stress free that life would be.  We have all been denied that.  We never voted on it.  We were never asked if we want it or not.  It was decided for us that we are not to have it.  Same with the people in Syria, Iraq, Libya... I could go on, but you get the point.  </p>

<p>Now, with the mind control issue, they figured out in the 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s that in order for it to work, you have to split the mind, as in create multiple personalities.  In order to do this, you have to inflict a tremendous amount of trauma.  They also discovered that it works better on younger people, as in children.  This created the missing children phenomena of the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s.  The NWO would abduct children and split their personalities through trauma.  They would then abuse and molest them, and sometimes kill and eat them.  Seriously.  They would do this to the move precious and vulnerable members of society, and they would harass, destroy, and kill those that oppose them.  They would also videotape it for blackmail purposes to keep their members in line.  I have references for everything I have said in this post.  Check my post history, or ask me for them.  </p>

<p>So, yes, loving people is the best thing to do.  It is the only worthwhile thing to do in this life.  I could continue on this subject all day, but I will wait to see what responses I get.  </p>

<p>“I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it’s not the answer.” – Jim Carrey</p>

<p>I betcha Jim Carrey would love to find love again, more than anything else.  And I hope he does.  </p>

<p>I am, personally, one who believes his own cognitive dissonance and massive internal suffering was a consequence of outside forces. Matter of fact, I have proof of being tracked. Yet, it doesn&#39;t scare me. Once you&#39;ve suffered immensely, but endured the journey and gone on to remember Love, you also experience the truth -- not just intellectually, but experientially...it becomes a fact through experience -- which is something that cannot be forgotten again. Once it&#39;s genuinely seen and remembered, it is always there. </p>

<p>Ever heard of the Hawkins scale?</p>

<p><a href="http://happyvibes.net/the-hawkins-scale.html">http://happyvibes.net/the-hawkins-scale.html</a></p>

<p>Love is level 500.  Most people are at levels 100-200, mired in fear and anger. There are many phases in between. There are so many people there are just barely holding on, struggling with starvation, abuse, chronic psychological and physical illnesses, telling them to love unconditionally usually does not do them any favors.</p>

<p>Also see the Emotional Guidance scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure I&#39;d write the realization off so quickly. So much of knowing is remembering. Love is remembered, not found. Anyone is capable of remembering what they are. </p>

<p>And, in honesty, I hadn&#39;t written this with the intent of it finding the starving or those battling chronic illnesses. Rather, I was writing to the people of reddit. Whomever found interest in clicking the title. By reminding those who are able to read the words, those people are then aware of the truth and can spread it on and on creating an exponential growth mechanism. To just remain silent about remembering love because there are people out there suffering immensely is insane logic, imo. </p>

<p>If we all lived in the 100-200 level on the Hawkins scale and were just barely holding on, unable to remember why we fight the battle we do, and yet you were the one individual who remembered that you fight for love, would you remain silent? Or would you go around embodying what you&#39;ve remembered and loving those around you, so as to reintroduce them to who and what they are? Would you not use what you know, what you&#39;ve remembered, as a guideline for how to live your own life and to spread that message?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. I just heavily disagree with your logic. </p>

<p>The conspiracy is to divide us.  It&#39;s a strategy of tension, and it&#39;s the best way to eliminate opposition, by simply playing them off against one another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?”  He said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’  This is the greatest and first commandment.  And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’  On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”</p>

<p>“If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right.  Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  Love never ends; as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.  For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect; but when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away.  When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I gave up childish ways.  For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood.  So faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.”</p>

<p>“But I say to you that listen, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.  If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt.  Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again.  Do to others as you would have them do to you.  If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.  If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.  If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again.  But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.  Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.”</p>

<p>“For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self- control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, man. That makes my day. It&#39;s funny, though, Sadness. I&#39;ve been sad my entire life, which I realized after heavy self-reflection, because once you really become &#39;sad&#39; then it&#39;s hard to recognize that it is, in fact, what you are. Sounds crazy, I know. But I&#39;ve also come to appreciate that sadness hugely as sadness opens up your heart to love and joy. Sometimes, I believe, we need to be reminded. And through glimpses of gentle sadness, we are reminded of the perpetual warmth of love that quietly resides in each and every one of us. </p>

<p>You could do better, sure, we all could. But let me tell you.. just by recognizing &#39;I can do better&#39;, you&#39;ve already made a massive stride. Once that becomes aware, life starts to feel lighter. Once we admit the &#39;mistake&#39; of falling from love, we&#39;re finally on the path back towards it. Be well, my friend</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the ego dies and true love is remembered, that is what you become because it is what you are. That pure and real state of being is that state that each human is consciously or subconsciously pursuing. Once the pursuit ends, or rather is seen for what it is, its not that individuation then dissipates and the universe ends. Rather, the individuality remains, as the character never disappears, and finally authentic love is the fuel of the game rather than a spectrum of harmful emotions, all of which are spent in the journey after the love and contentment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is wonderful. I chase and yearn for that same sensation of blissful love that you had. I sympathize with your stating &quot;We internalize hate and dark influences in an effort to understand them, and it only hurts us.&quot; Love is what makes us human. Love is what drives us to make music and art, and help others. </p>

<p>When we grow ignorant to this, and dehumanize others, we create negative energy, and affect those around us. I want to have that feeling back. I remember one summer just being happy, spiritually, and emotionally. Loving everyone, life, and finding joy from all things. </p>

<p>Guys, I highly recommend all of you in this thread read Siddhartha Herman Hesse. It entails the life of a son of a Brahma in India, and his journey through life. He learns to be in the world, and not of it, and to love all things. And it is only through life he becomes enlightened like the Buddha, and breaks free of the cycle of rebirth and loss. </p>

<p>It is only through that in which he learns to love, and not to worry, because ultimately, all things are pointless in the experience of living life. Possessions matter not, because they can distract you from what matters, that being love. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are spot on.</p>

<p>I like the theory that the evil forces in the world serve as a giant homework assignment for remembering love. It exists not because  they are truly evil entities but are rather playing the role of a teacher. That once we move on to whatever is after this life, we go, &quot;you were such an awesome villain, that was hilarious.&quot; Not all too different than when we play videogames and someone on the screen comes and acts as the opposition. None of it&#39;s real, but it&#39;s only acted out to create the spice of life.</p>

<p>The only time I struggle with maintaining this perception is when there are acts of genocide, innocent children suffering, etc.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evil is necessary and the farther we discover it&#39;s existence the more we will fee love bring us together unlike ever before. </p>

<p>The realization that without evil the universe would have no love gives us even more reason to love evil.  I don&#39;t mean &quot;love&quot; evil.  Love that it exists for us to have free will and learn from reactions that shape our very awareness.  </p>

<p>At rest things wont exist.  There must be evil to counterbalance the positive and give challenge to the life&#39;s purpose of ascension.  Descension leads to depression and losing oneself while ascension leads to finding true self.  </p>

<p>We are a fractured consciousness trying to find our way back to unity by sharing our perspectives of truth to build our reality.  We are confined to the limits of what we&#39;ve been allowed to learn since birth.  </p>

<p>We all are experiencing different universes in infinite through our astral travels through the multiverse.  Our history is encoded in our DNA and our biology.  We tell ourselves the path to higher consciousness in our dreams and our subconscious connections.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think &#39;understanding&#39; evil is the best way to put it. When you understand what evil actually is, it becomes significantly more likely that one is able to open up to loving that evil. To know that evil is a manifestation of love, itself, and that one cannot exist without the other makes it much easier, in my experience, to love all that there is: good and bad. The entire spectrum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you experienced a moment of awe? Or a moment of what feels like pure presence, without any entity within you to judge the moment? If so, and I&#39;m sure you absolutely have, that moment exists as the way it does because, for a glimpse, your thoughts have dissipated. There is no longer the cognitive &#39;person&#39; there to judge and label the moment. That&#39;s also why people meditate -- to be able to enter the moment without thought. </p>

<p>When you love without analyzing the love, that is true love. Because when there is no thought there to screw things up and think, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll love you, but what am I getting out of this?&quot; then there are no longer expectations of what you&#39;ll be getting back for putting out your love. That is when it&#39;s genuine.</p>

<p>When you no longer love for yourself, but instead you genuinely love because it&#39;s who and what you are. It&#39;s what you enjoy. It&#39;s fundamentally what we all enjoy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just funny to me that we&#39;ve reached a point in history where that&#39;s actually a legitimate question: what is true love?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Instead of embodying love, we’ve elected to participate in the game of separation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ve been indoctrinated to feel separate from those who are different from us. Our differences, compared to our spiritual state of being one, is petty and meaningless beyond comprehension. It is this spiritual state of the people existing as one and recognizing our common bond instead of our differences that the establishment through media of all forms imaginable is desperately trying to tear away from. It is the ultimate negative programming that humanity has endured since the rise of feeble minded and fearful government...divide and conquer, weaken through distraction and confusion.</p>

<p>The global establishment is terrified that the people of all colors and cultures will someday look beyond their differences and realize that together they are stronger than any force on earth. That as one, the people could make life on earth more utopian and less the hellish state of war, corruption and brutal occupation of our minds, hearts and souls through media...the media that has corrupted our minds to into believing the lie that keeps these wretched people in power. </p>

<p>Get rid of cable TV. Get rid of that evil tool of control and start feeling the joy of life reentering your soul. Get your head out of your phone. Become aware of your surroundings. SEE again everything around you. LISTEN to the sounds that are a part of your world. FEEL your soul once again and the natural vibration of this universe as you did when you were a child. LET GO of your wants and take deep care of what it is that you actually need.</p>

<p>A 28 year old man, drinking his morning coffee, getting ready to put on a suit, and take a journey into the concrete jungle... And now I&#39;m in tears again. </p>

<p>Tears of joy brother. Tears of joy.</p>

<p>Thank you, from the depths of my soul for your post. </p>

<p>Thank you for the time you put into this. I am grateful beyond words, that you listened to that inner pull of inspiration, that led you to put forth these words. </p>

<p>Your post is on point, and is exactly what I believe, and have believed for as long as I can remember. It has become stronger recently, the feeling of discourse. </p>

<p>A sense of the earth, the universe, our reality, shedding its dry and cracked skin. </p>

<p>16 years ago, I began to wake up. And it was overwhelming. I could not cope with the stress of reality, and how foreign the narrative being presented to my inner being was. It rioped me apart, and has continually done so.</p>

<p>The only solace I have found, has been what you have described. </p>

<p>Love.</p>

<p>Pure, selfless love that I attempt to project into the world I see before me.</p>

<p>We must walk with a sense of gratitude. We must view every moment, every breeze, every interaction with others with nature, as part of that gracious love song. </p>

<p>We are one. We are love. And we will survive. </p>

<p>And yes, this may sound hippy dippy woo-woo come to the light. I get that.</p>

<p>But like you, I grew up in an all Canadian household, with a strict European father, who never showed emotion. It was all hockey, snowmobiles and camping round here eh. No joke. </p>

<p>I took the mask off years ago, and have been trying to find my way ever since. </p>

<p>Thank you for helping me on that journey. </p>

<p>Be at ease, and walk with love today sir. </p>

<p>You&#39;re an absolute treasure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;You&#39; never knew love because &#39;you&#39; are a thought. The thought, the thinking mind, is what prevents us from seeing that what each of us is, fundamentally, is love itself. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason our country is founded on the psychological paradox, &quot;the pursuit of happiness.&quot; When thought pursues joy -- when the mind goes on a journey towards finding love or joy -- it inherently loses its ability to find it. Because only when we stop thinking do we actually enter into the moment, and when you are in the moment, you embody love. It&#39;s there. You knew it and know it. You just have to be reminded of it.</p>

<p>When I first realized this and realized I had trouble falling into that love, I would remember the love I felt when I&#39;d hold my newborn sister (she is 16 years younger than I). I think that is a great way to start remembering the feeling, and then it&#39;s great to consciously step into that feeling of love. Remember it. You got this.</p>
