       He says there is no motive, and no one would be able to hide such a large scale operation. How can I show him that most people who look into the events see the official story is not what it seems (basically I want to show him that educated people are calling shenanigans on it)?

       Yeah, but officially that didn't cause the collapse of WTC7, officialy - fire caused the free-fall collapse of WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other buildings of the WTC which were nearly destroyed by the collapse of the twin towers DID NOT collapse by themselves, so they had to be pulled.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty far-fetched, on top of other far-fetched official things about that whole day.

       What about WTC 3, 4, 5, 6?  The towers fell right on top of them.  They still needed to be pulled down to clean the place up!
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC7 was barely touched in comparison and hardly had any fires going in it.  You're right though, one of the largest buildings fell NEXT to it.....

       Did you consider any of the OTHER buildings that were next to it?  I don't remember the building but a it had a HUGE gash taken out of it and it didn't fall straight down into itself AT FREE FALL SPEEDS.

       Oh wait...sorry....I didn't see YOU quoted a firefighter.  What's his name?  Where was his location?  When did he say this?  Where is it documented?
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST, even if you can trust what BS they say, still said a FIRE caused the collapse.  Not a big gash....nothing.  Even if you could produce a photo I have not seen yet.....that is still no evidence that the building was compromised in any SERIOUS shape or form.  Again...WTC's 3, 4, 5 and 6 all took massive damage and stood where they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice the complete LACK of solid photo evidence of a fire?  Most of the BS photo's I've seen have been photoshopped!   Lots of smoke......but smoke means fuck all.  Smoke doesn't drop buildings at free falls speeds and NEITHER does fire.

       I don't know what your definition of "stood" is, but these pretty pretty damn destroyed to me. You do realize your comparing a 47 story building to 8,9,22 floor buildings right?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are going to say its photoshopped I clearly can't prove anything to you.

       Pally.....you're getting a little excited here.  Fire STILL CANNOT cause the straight down TOP TO BOTTOM free falls speed collapse of a 47 story building.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would mean fire was able to destroy everything on a horizontal level at about 5 and a bit stories a second.  Tell me how fire can evaporate that many floors in that time?  It fell straight down, nothing on each side, no tilting, no nothing.  So, the floors were eliminated equally as it fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a nice crimp right in the middle.....the "Penthouse" goes in first.....tell me how fire can take out the core sections in the middle, dropping out a VERY specific part to the building.....leaving it standing....and then finally dropping it a few seconds later.

       Can't miss it.  That, and please continue to ignore the fact that it housed offices for the CIA and FBI as well as the SEC.  They were all in the middle of that big ENRON scandal investigation, you remember!  Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       That all went down the drain, nothing came of it.  So you can ignore or misdirect people all you like....but in the end it just makes you look like the ignorant fool.

       You clearly don't understand how buildings fall. Let's talk to controlled demolition experts.
       <a href="http://www.jod911.com/WTC%20COLLAPSE%20STUDY%20BBlanchard%208-8-06.pdf">
        They agree with NIST
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In controlled demolitions, they destroy supports, and the building mainly uses gravity to destroy itself. On 9/11 building were weakened by fire and outside damage. They eventually caused portions to fail and cause a collapse. People who demolish buildings use the path of least resistance. They use gravity to do most of the dirty work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firefighters reported pieces of the building coming off well(as much as 5 hours before) before it collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you look at the collapse of the two towers themselves, you can clearly see the building fail right at the floors with the holes in it. There is a single floor collapse, the whole top falls a floor. Then you see the whole thing come down leaving the top section visible until it is obscured by the dust cloud of the collapse of the initial floor. You can actually see the top of the building lurch, and the girders around the hole budge out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right. I could care less about who is housed where because it is completely irrelevant. Are you accusing Enron of 9/11?

       Your right, I didn't claim on top of. There is no evidence that it fell on top of. There is evidence that debris hit the south side. The problem is that there is a very small amount of videos and photos from that side because of the collapse of WTC 1 ad 2 being on that side and obscuring it as well as the raging fire on that side.

       Right, this was in response to shoutwire.
      </p>
      <p>
       And didn't the official report indicate it was the fire that brought the buildings down? That strikes me as strange considering  the first responders reported 2 contained fires. Oh, and then there is that sky scraper in Spain that literally burned for days. It didn't fall. Not to mention the buildings collapsed in a free fall. But you know, who am I to tell you not to let things like physics and facts stand in the way of your version.

       Boyle: There was a huge gaping hole and it was scattered throughout there. It was a huge hole. I would say it was probably about a third of it, right in the middle of it. And so after Visconti came down and said nobody goes in 7, we said all right, we’ll head back to the command post. We lost touch with him. I never saw him again that day.

       The 9/11 report was well after the event anyway. Did the White House stop every newspaper/Tom Dick and Harry/law enforcement in America from researching the subject as well? I know we put a lot of stock in government (ha ha), but I'd bet on The Inquirer to get a story before they would.

       Are you claiming that poorly paid people (news paper people are notoriously underpaid) in a dying industry covered up a missile strike? How much does it cost to a person who has dedicated their lives to the freedom of the press to be bought?

       The 9/11 Commission admits that if NORAD hadn't been running fake hijacking situations, the terrorists would not have been successful.  Ask your dad if he is absolutely 100% sure this was just the most unlucky coincidence in world history...or if there's at least some small possibility there was (one singular) inside man.

       People reported seeing different things that day. Most people really don't know what the fuck they saw. The media immediately started bombarding everybody with.. "its was a plane".."a passenger plane" "American Airlines".
 Anyone on the air who reported seeing missiles, painted windows, or, anything that varied from the "official" explanation were quickly cut off. The media had a great deal in shaping the way people 'remembered' the events, Project Mockingbird anyone?

       True dat. I've listened to live recordings of all the misinformation going around.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't change what the evidence shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't understand the whole passport thing. When flight 175 hits the south tower, you can clearly see debris flying everywhere. It is pretty clear fire couldn't have destroyed everything. They were finding seats, engines, body parts, etc all over New York. So making claims like a passport should have burnt in the fire is just, uh dumb, as you can clearly see all kinds of debris ejected out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a hugely complex event. I used to research JFK conspiracy, and WTC makes that look like a first graders book report. Just the amount of stuff involved makes it one of the most complex events in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw all the videos when they came out. I was taken in by them too. As I tear away all the misconceptions and just false information it all leads me back to the biggest question of them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a conspiracy, there has to be secrets, but there is always a trail. First there would be too many people involved. The more people involved, the more chance a secret will be let out. Just the amount of coordination involved just makes it impossible to be a conspiracy. Way to many people would have to completely sellout America.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the evidence points to a non-conspiracy, as well as the philosophy.

That is cherry picking, you pick all the USA Today people while ignore those that don't work for USA Today.

       All the ones who support the plane actually HITTING the building, were yes from USA today....or they supported a physical impossibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane was no where near the light poles that were supposedly struck by the plane which supposedly lodged one in a Lloyd England's cab.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, stop bringing up all that bullshit about a missile or anything else....global hawk.....not one person saw either of those.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you do, you take "your" witnesses and you call them liars.  You say, they saw a plane in one option and a missile in another.  Which is it man?  You just keep that bullshit alive, and its not even a remote possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sean Boger was in the Pentagon helipad control tower.  He saw a PLANE flying at him.  Not a missile, not a global hawk.......how can you possibly throw out any other possibility knowing what people have already seen and given testimony to!?!

       One last thing, even Mike Walters' testimony shows that the plane could NOT have been on a straight line to knock down any light poles.
      </p>
      <p>
       He talks about how the plane banked around and then flew "into the building".  See, that's the problem, he describes the bank of the plane as it actually was......but the RADES84 data (supposed radar data) and the black box itself shows the plane flying in a STRAIGHT LINE.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is this possible?  Mike saw the plane in real life!  The black box and that radar data (provided by your Gov't) shows a straight line, no bank and on the south side of the gas station.  No possibility for a turn of any kind.  The light poles had to be knocked down!
      </p>
      <p>
       That's it.....the plane was on the North side....banking but still managed to knock down light poles it wasn't even close to.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is this possible my friend??  Can you think critically?  Can you be an adult about this info?  Look at all of it.

      <p>
       Who's to say they didn't know where the planes would hit? And even if they didn't, the explosives could have been planted on every floor. Then after the "planes" hit, detonated whichever they chose. If you weren't capable of drawing that conclusion, I can understand why you're having a hard time coming to grips with something you saw on TV  turning out to be a lie.

       Just mention all the coincidences that happened on that day - according to the official version.
      </p>
      <p>
       The towers were a health hazard because of asbestos applied to the steel frame - yet, the tower collapsed due to the steel frames catching fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The temperature was so high the steel melted and poured out of the building, and everything was pulverized - but luckily they found the hijackers' passports.
      </p>
      <p>
       The twin towers were struck by airplanes, and caught fire from the jet fuel which melted the steel frames - the WTC7 wasn't struck by an airplane, yet it caught fire and crumbled into its own footprint. The only day ever steel-framed buildings collapsed because of fire - and it happened for all sorts of different reasons.
      </p>
      <p>

       I honestly am convinced that the easiest first step to convince someone is to show them the picture of the crash in Shanksville PA.  There is no plane there, and anyone trying to seriously argue that a plane crashed there can be callled insane, because there isn't anything there.

       That forces people to consider some kind of cover up, and then that's the hook.  Once you know there was some amount of a cover up, you then want to know how much more is covered up.

       Battalion Chief Kemly:
      </p>
      <p>
       "..Captain Varriale told Chief Coloe and myself that 7 World Trade Center was badly damaged on the south side and definitely in danger of collapse. Chief Coloe said we were going to evacuate the collapse zone around 7 World Trade Center, which we did."

       Deputy Chief Peter Hayden:
      </p>
      <p>
       "...also we were pretty sure that 7 World Trade Center would collapse. Early on, we saw a bulge in the southwest corner between floors 10 and 13, and we had put a transit on that and we were pretty sure she was going to collapse. You actually could see there was a visible bulge, it ran up about three floors. It came down about 5 o’clock in the afternoon, but by about 2 o’clock in the afternoon we realized this thing was going to collapse."

      <p>
       NORAD? I can talk a little bit about NORAD. The deal with NORAD is its primary focus was outside of the United States. Look up "the donut hole" they had to deal with. NORAD had to be physically called, as there was no direct communication between airports and NORAD. The fighters on ready were launched, they flew at under their top speeds because at the time they weren't allowed to go supersonic over land. They didn't have enough time to reach them before the planes crashed into buildings/ground. The wargames did not cause any confusion.

      <p>
       7/7? What about it? Muslims blow crap up?

      <p>
       which anomalies are you referring to? The only one I can think of was the BBC reporting WTC7 collapsing before it did. Considering there was 7 buildings, and WTC7 expected to collapse, I'm sure it was pretty easy to get it confused. I've been to WTC myself and I didn't even know there was a 3,4,5,6,7 before 9/11. Reporters say stupid/incorrect things all the time. Conspiracy? No. Clueless foreign reporters? Yes.

       Intentionally crashed into the ground? Or unintentionally?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there is a big difference between someone intentionally slamming nose first into the ground at top speed (flight 93), and a plane trying to crash land and not kill anyone(pretty much all the rest).

       Personally, I don't think explosives had much to do with the tower but the fireproofing on the steel could have very much been intentionally weakened in renovations subsequent to the 1994 attack.

       In my experience, it's been easier to just focus on the official story being unbelievable when critically examined. If you can get someone to begin seeing through the official 9/11 Commission version of events, they may eventually draw their own conclusions regarding who did it and why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go with the facts and circumstances which are obvious, readily verifiable and speak against the official story, and slowly his foundation may crumble of its own accord. It has to be at his own pace though. Just plant the seeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many older people have a massive emotional investment in America always being righteous and just and moral and upstanding - and that's a massive thing to overcome. The documentary "Why We Fight" illustrated this perfectly, while profiling a Vietnam veteran who lost his son in the 9/11 attacks.

      <p>
       So, the molten steel pouring out of the tower (see
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-Cn5cqgh-g&amp;amp;feature=related">
        here
       </a>

        this
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If that doesn't explain it better, could expand your point a bit as I'm not following where the objection is.

       Lol the haters, these anti- comments are hilarious. There are lots of things you might find compelling, but others will not. Like the 'pull it' video on youtube, no parts of plane at pentagon and shanksville, thermite residue in wtc dust, reports of explosions and diagonal cuts on wtc beams, and fires just effing don't drop buildings like that. Probably with your father simply having the room to have your opinion might be a goal, as opposed to convincing him. I'd say the engineering related groups are the most dry and science based truthers, and their presentations don't have a hip cat with background music and psychedelic effects getting pumped up about it all, so maybe refer him to some of the ae911truth org stuff.

       To me there are many reasons why the plane impacts and resulting fires could not have caused the collapses of the twin towers. The clearest reason is the speed of the collapses. Think about the columns from the base of the tower up to just below the impact zone. In one moment they went from resisting the full weight of the mass above to providing close to zero resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppose you have access to a large swimming pool. Empty out the pool. Drop a cannonball from the highest diving board and time how long it takes to hit the bottom of the pool. Now fill the pool with water and repeat the experiment. Takes longer to hit the bottom, right? Now remove the water and fill the pool with baseballs. I'm guessing the cannonball will not actually reach the bottom now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that the density and strength of any matter impeding an object's fall have an effect on the duration of that fall. This alone shows the implausibility of the theory that the planes and fires caused the collapses as they happened.

       Look, buddy, I was talking about your father, not me.  It's just extremely fucking clear that you are a young person. Furthermore, it is super fucking clear that you are the kind of young person who has failed to put a reasonable amount of credence in the ideas that people like your father have.

        I totally support your attack on my grammar and syntax.
       </strong>
       I love to insult people about those.  However, I would love it if you, as a person only probably fifteen years younger than me, took heed that their elders, though less intelligent, had specific experiences that could cast significant light upon this world. I'm not one of those elders. But, I have learned, after years of discourse, to find wheat amidst the chaff.
