<p>NIST, even if you can trust what BS they say, still said a FIRE caused the collapse.  Not a big gash....nothing.  Even if you could produce a photo I have not seen yet.....that is still no evidence that the building was compromised in any SERIOUS shape or form.  Again...WTC&#39;s 3, 4, 5 and 6 all took massive damage and stood where they were.</p>

<p>Notice the complete LACK of solid photo evidence of a fire?  Most of the BS photo&#39;s I&#39;ve seen have been photoshopped!   Lots of smoke......but smoke means fuck all.  Smoke doesn&#39;t drop buildings at free falls speeds and NEITHER does fire.</p>

<p>Boyle:&quot;...on the north and east side of 7 it didn’t look like there was any damage at all, but then you looked on the south side of 7 there had to be a hole 20 stories tall in the building, with fire on several floors. Debris was falling down on the building and it didn’t look good.&quot;</p>

<p>Firehouse: &quot;When you looked at the south side, how close were you to the base of that side?&quot;</p>

<p>Boyle: &quot;I was standing right next to the building, probably right next to it.&quot;</p>

<p>Firehouse: &quot;When you had fire on the 20 floors, was it in one window or many?&quot;</p>

<p>Boyle: &quot;There was a huge gaping hole and it was scattered throughout there. It was a huge hole. I would say it was probably about a third of it, right in the middle of it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pally.....you&#39;re getting a little excited here.  Fire STILL CANNOT cause the straight down TOP TO BOTTOM free falls speed collapse of a 47 story building.</p>

<p>That would mean fire was able to destroy everything on a horizontal level at about 5 and a bit stories a second.  Tell me how fire can evaporate that many floors in that time?  It fell straight down, nothing on each side, no tilting, no nothing.  So, the floors were eliminated equally as it fell.  </p>

<p>With a nice crimp right in the middle.....the &quot;Penthouse&quot; goes in first.....tell me how fire can take out the core sections in the middle, dropping out a VERY specific part to the building.....leaving it standing....and then finally dropping it a few seconds later.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNlqk_c-yOo">RIGHT HERE</a></p>

<p>Can&#39;t miss it.  That, and please continue to ignore the fact that it housed offices for the CIA and FBI as well as the SEC.  They were all in the middle of that big ENRON scandal investigation, you remember!  Right?  </p>

<p>That all went down the drain, nothing came of it.  So you can ignore or misdirect people all you like....but in the end it just makes you look like the ignorant fool.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly don&#39;t understand how buildings fall. Let&#39;s talk to controlled demolition experts. <a href="http://www.jod911.com/WTC%20COLLAPSE%20STUDY%20BBlanchard%208-8-06.pdf">They agree with NIST</a></p>

<p>In controlled demolitions, they destroy supports, and the building mainly uses gravity to destroy itself. On 9/11 building were weakened by fire and outside damage. They eventually caused portions to fail and cause a collapse. People who demolish buildings use the path of least resistance. They use gravity to do most of the dirty work.</p>

<p>Firefighters reported pieces of the building coming off well(as much as 5 hours before) before it collapsed. </p>

<p>Even if you look at the collapse of the two towers themselves, you can clearly see the building fail right at the floors with the holes in it. There is a single floor collapse, the whole top falls a floor. Then you see the whole thing come down leaving the top section visible until it is obscured by the dust cloud of the collapse of the initial floor. You can actually see the top of the building lurch, and the girders around the hole budge out.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right. I could care less about who is housed where because it is completely irrelevant. Are you accusing Enron of 9/11? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, this was in response to shoutwire. </p>

<p>And didn&#39;t the official report indicate it was the fire that brought the buildings down? That strikes me as strange considering  the first responders reported 2 contained fires. Oh, and then there is that sky scraper in Spain that literally burned for days. It didn&#39;t fall. Not to mention the buildings collapsed in a free fall.

    <div class="md"><p>True dat. I&#39;ve listened to live recordings of all the misinformation going around. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t change what the evidence shows. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t understand the whole passport thing. When flight 175 hits the south tower, you can clearly see debris flying everywhere. It is pretty clear fire couldn&#39;t have destroyed everything. They were finding seats, engines, body parts, etc all over New York. So making claims like a passport should have burnt in the fire is just, uh dumb, as you can clearly see all kinds of debris ejected out.</p>

<p>It is a hugely complex event. I used to research JFK conspiracy, and WTC makes that look like a first graders book report. Just the amount of stuff involved makes it one of the most complex events in history.</p>

<p>I saw all the videos when they came out. I was taken in by them too. As I tear away all the misconceptions and just false information it all leads me back to the biggest question of them all.</p>

<p>In a conspiracy, there has to be secrets, but there is always a trail. First there would be too many people involved. The more people involved, the more chance a secret will be let out. Just the amount of coordination involved just makes it impossible to be a conspiracy. Way to many people would have to completely sellout America. </p>

<p>So the evidence points to a non-conspiracy, as well as the philosophy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One last thing, even Mike Walters&#39; testimony shows that the plane could NOT have been on a straight line to knock down any light poles.</p>

<p>He talks about how the plane banked around and then flew &quot;into the building&quot;.  See, that&#39;s the problem, he describes the bank of the plane as it actually was......but the RADES84 data (supposed radar data) and the black box itself shows the plane flying in a STRAIGHT LINE.</p>

<p>How is this possible?  Mike saw the plane in real life!  The black box and that radar data (provided by your Gov&#39;t) shows a straight line, no bank and on the south side of the gas station.  No possibility for a turn of any kind.  The light poles had to be knocked down!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it.....the plane was on the North side....banking but still managed to knock down light poles it wasn&#39;t even close to.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s to say they didn&#39;t know where the planes would hit? And even if they didn&#39;t, the explosives could have been planted on every floor. Then after the &quot;planes&quot; hit, detonated whichever they chose.

    <div class="md"><p>Just mention all the coincidences that happened on that day - according to the official version.</p>

<p>The towers were a health hazard because of asbestos applied to the steel frame - yet, the tower collapsed due to the steel frames catching fire.</p>

<p>The temperature was so high the steel melted and poured out of the building, and everything was pulverized - but luckily they found the hijackers&#39; passports.</p>

<p>The twin towers were struck by airplanes, and caught fire from the jet fuel which melted the steel frames - the WTC7 wasn&#39;t struck by an airplane, yet it caught fire and crumbled into its own footprint. The only day ever steel-framed buildings collapsed because of fire - and it happened for all sorts of different reasons.</p>

<p>...the best bit is about the war games which took part on that same day.</p>

<p>...and that&#39;s not even mentioning the other flights and the pentagon.</p>

<p>Really, I didn&#39;t see any mention of it in the video. The plane appeared to have thrusters going full tilt.</p>

<p>Show us a list of architect and engineers, bigger than 1000, that completely support the official theory.</p>

<p>Please provide that list.</p>

<p>STARVE_THE_BEAST  already said it best</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, your implication that a majority of career professionals should endorse a strongly anti-establishment belief before we give it any consideration is ludicrous.</p>

<p>The numbers are already well-established, and they tell a simple story:</p>

<p>There now exists overwhelming material evidence in the public domain that when weighed in totality by the open-minded, rational, skeptical, and brave mind, leads to the inexorable conclusion that there is FAR MORE to the story than the official conspiracy-theory whitewash that was the 9/11 Commission Report.&quot;</p>

<p>Battalion Chief John Norman:</p>

<p>&quot;From there, we looked out at 7 World Trade Center again. You could see smoke, but no visible fire, and some damage to the south face. You couldn’t really see from where we were on the west face of the building, but at the edge of the south face you could see that it was very heavily damaged.&quot;</p>

<p>Battalion Chief Kemly: </p>

<p>&quot;..Captain Varriale told Chief Coloe and myself that 7 World Trade Center was badly damaged on the south side and definitely in danger of collapse. Chief Coloe said we were going to evacuate the collapse zone around 7 World Trade Center, which we did.&quot;</p>

<p>Deputy Chief Peter Hayden:</p>

<p>&quot;...also we were pretty sure that 7 World Trade Center would collapse. Early on, we saw a bulge in the southwest corner between floors 10 and 13, and we had put a transit on that and we were pretty sure she was going to collapse. You actually could see there was a visible bulge, it ran up about three floors. It came down about 5 o’clock in the afternoon, but by about 2 o’clock in the afternoon we realized this thing was going to collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>Woman in the hole? What exactly would you like me to address? She was in the hole, not in a fire. The hole spread over a few floors. People above the fire were obviously still alive. So why couldn&#39;t they be in the hole in an area not on fire? Holes aren&#39;t fires. Holes are just holes.</p>

<p>9/11 commission? What about it? </p>

<p>You&#39;ll have to be more specific about which coincidences.</p>

<p>NORAD? I can talk a little bit about NORAD. The deal with NORAD is its primary focus was outside of the United States. Look up &quot;the donut hole&quot; they had to deal with. NORAD had to be physically called, as there was no direct communication between airports and NORAD. The fighters on ready were launched, they flew at under their top speeds because at the time they weren&#39;t allowed to go supersonic over land. They didn&#39;t have enough time to reach them before the planes crashed into buildings/ground. The wargames did not cause any confusion.</p>

<p>7/7? What about it? Muslims blow crap up?</p>

<p>which anomalies are you referring to? The only one I can think of was the BBC reporting WTC7 collapsing before it did. Considering there was 7 buildings, and WTC7 expected to collapse, I&#39;m sure it was pretty easy to get it confused. I&#39;ve been to WTC myself and I didn&#39;t even know there was a 3,4,5,6,7 before 9/11. Reporters say stupid/incorrect things all the time. Conspiracy? No. Clueless foreign reporters? Yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience, it&#39;s been easier to just focus on the official story being unbelievable when critically examined. If you can get someone to begin seeing through the official 9/11 Commission version of events, they may eventually draw their own conclusions regarding who did it and why.</p>

<p>Go with the facts and circumstances which are obvious, readily verifiable and speak against the official story, and slowly his foundation may crumble of its own accord. It has to be at his own pace though. Just plant the seeds.</p>

<p>Many older people have a massive emotional investment in America always being righteous and just and moral and upstanding - and that&#39;s a massive thing to overcome. The documentary &quot;Why We Fight&quot; illustrated this perfectly, while profiling a Vietnam veteran who lost his son in the 9/11 attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol the haters, these anti- comments are hilarious. There are lots of things you might find compelling, but others will not. Like the &#39;pull it&#39; video on youtube, no parts of plane at pentagon and shanksville, thermite residue in wtc dust, reports of explosions and diagonal cuts on wtc beams, and fires just effing don&#39;t drop buildings like that. Probably with your father simply having the room to have your opinion might be a goal, as opposed to convincing him. I&#39;d say the engineering related groups are the most dry and science based truthers, and their presentations don&#39;t have a hip cat with background music and psychedelic effects getting pumped up about it all, so maybe refer him to some of the ae911truth org stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me there are many reasons why the plane impacts and resulting fires could not have caused the collapses of the twin towers. The clearest reason is the speed of the collapses. Think about the columns from the base of the tower up to just below the impact zone. In one moment they went from resisting the full weight of the mass above to providing close to zero resistance. </p>

<p>Suppose you have access to a large swimming pool. Empty out the pool. Drop a cannonball from the highest diving board and time how long it takes to hit the bottom of the pool. Now fill the pool with water and repeat the experiment. Takes longer to hit the bottom, right? Now remove the water and fill the pool with baseballs. I&#39;m guessing the cannonball will not actually reach the bottom now. </p>

<p>The point is that the density and strength of any matter impeding an object&#39;s fall have an effect on the duration of that fall. This alone shows the implausibility of the theory that the planes and fires caused the collapses as they happened. </p>
