       I dunno.  I read the entire thing and wasn't really able to figure out his complaints.  Quite frankly it sounded like someone who put off reporting income on a regular basis, spent the income, and was surprised that he was in the hole for taxes because he spent all of his income.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand there are legitimate reasons for putting off paying taxes - particularly if you are a small business with limited access to liquidity.  But if you go that route, don't be surprised if you get audited or have to deal with frustrating bureaucracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that makes me not want to be a tax attorney is dealing with all those people who live in fantasy land.  I think this guy may have been okay in general, but there are some kooks out there that really believe shit like, "if they don't declare it then it isn't taxable income."  Dumbasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing about the letter from a psychological perspective is that he seemed to spend a lot of time talking about himself as if he were special.  I mean, it was like he really expected Congress to pipe up and listen to what he had to say about tax laws.  I'm sorry, but we are part of the system.  Talk all you want, but the system is like Pandora, it will chew you up and spit you out if you treat it like it is there for your bidding.

       The mainstream "left" are so perfectly propagandized. It's really quite sickening to see them falling into the same trap the mainstream "right" have been caught in for the last 8 years.

       If it comes out in the press that this guy is a super hardcore Alex Jones' fan and this guy is a 9/11 truther, I give it a 98% chance it's a staged event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones' popularity has skyrocketed over the last two years, and Newsweek and the ADL have been attacking him consistently now.  I thought just yesterday how Alex Jones', if he is the real deal, will probably be set up soon, because no single source reaches the most people and has 'awoken' so many people.

       On top of that, Obama has been an epic failure.  This is the last resort to swing people away from right wing tea parties to Obama's neocon establishment center.
      </p>
      <p>
       More details need to come out.  Right now, I'm 60-40% in favor of this being a staged attack.  But the guy could have just been really mad.

       I see.  But why attack the IRS building.  If you're for communism, then you can't be opposed to taxes.  But then again, if you want to fly a plane into a building, maybe you're not the wisest guy on the block.

       He's not for communism... he's just giving the communist credo, then inventing the capitalist credo to be similar to it. He's against fat politicians, bureaucracy and the higher ups who are fucking us all.

       I read it.  He's like a lot of Americans who have been screwed over by big business and the IRS over and over.  But, I still think it could have been staged, I'm not 100% sure yet.

       Not being 100% sure if it was staged or not is, in itself, a conviction of the government we have. I remember when no one would have even considered a staged attack. But then again, maybe I was asleep and just didn't notice, you know?

       In comparison, I'm 100% sure, (or as sure as I can be about something) that 9/11, 7/7 in London, the Oklahoma City bombing, the first attack on the WTC, and the Christmas underwear bomber were all staged events.

       I read it shortly after it was posted.  I think it's funny that I was downvoted so much for my original post, which was posted before the manifesto was out.

       As for the manifesto, it appears authentic, but as someone who does creative writing, I could also see this being a fake.  I'm still not sure.
