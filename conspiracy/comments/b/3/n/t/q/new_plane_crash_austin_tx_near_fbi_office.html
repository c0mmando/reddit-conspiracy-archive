    <div class="md"><p>I dunno.  I read the entire thing and wasn&#39;t really able to figure out his complaints.  Quite frankly it sounded like someone who put off reporting income on a regular basis, spent the income, and was surprised that he was in the hole for taxes because he spent all of his income.</p>

<p>I understand there are legitimate reasons for putting off paying taxes - particularly if you are a small business with limited access to liquidity.  But if you go that route, don&#39;t be surprised if you get audited or have to deal with frustrating bureaucracy.  </p>

<p>One thing that makes me not want to be a tax attorney is dealing with all those people who live in fantasy land.  I think this guy may have been okay in general, but there are some kooks out there that really believe shit like, &quot;if they don&#39;t declare it then it isn&#39;t taxable income.&quot;  Dumbasses.</p>

<p>One thing about the letter from a psychological perspective is that he seemed to spend a lot of time talking about himself as if he were special.  I mean, it was like he really expected Congress to pipe up and listen to what he had to say about tax laws.  I&#39;m sorry, but we are part of the system.  Talk all you want, but the system is like Pandora, it will chew you up and spit you out if you treat it like it is there for your bidding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it comes out in the press that this guy is a super hardcore Alex Jones&#39; fan and this guy is a 9/11 truther, I give it a 98% chance it&#39;s a staged event.</p>

<p>Alex Jones&#39; popularity has skyrocketed over the last two years, and Newsweek and the ADL have been attacking him consistently now.  I thought just yesterday how Alex Jones&#39;, if he is the real deal, will probably be set up soon, because no single source reaches the most people and has &#39;awoken&#39; so many people.</p>

<p>On top of that, Obama has been an epic failure.  This is the last resort to swing people away from right wing tea parties to Obama&#39;s neocon establishment center.</p>

<p>More details need to come out.  Right now, I&#39;m 60-40% in favor of this being a staged attack.  But the guy could have just been really mad.  </p>

<p>For now, we need more information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read it shortly after it was posted.  I think it&#39;s funny that I was downvoted so much for my original post, which was posted before the manifesto was out.  </p>

<p>As for the manifesto, it appears authentic, but as someone who does creative writing, I could also see this being a fake.  I&#39;m still not sure.</p>

<p>Let me translate:  &quot;I don&#39;t want to pay taxes!  Society sucks for making me pay taxes!!  I ain&#39;t gonna do it!  I&#39;ll kill someone, including me!!!&quot;.</p>

<p>Welcome to the real world, things cost, we all pay for it, that&#39;s civilization, if you want to go back in time and live off the land good luck with that.</p>
