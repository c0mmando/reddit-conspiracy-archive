<p>I think some of the lame conspiracy theorists in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> found out that one or two conspiracies they didn&#39;t believe turned out to be true, but they still don&#39;t understand just how many conspiracy theories are legitimate, or how many official stories of events are absurd.  They come on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to check it out, but they don&#39;t really get the big picture of how massively corrupt the US government is or the agendas behind political movements like global warming or a one world government.</p>

<p>When people dog me for speculative thought on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I tell them to go fuck themselves.  When you speculate, it doesn&#39;t mean you know the truth, but it does require some imagination and reason.  Some people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are just lame and unwilling to think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this a trick question?  Your asking why someone posts a researched response to an OP and gets upvotes?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got to realize being a conspiracy theorists doesn&#39;t mean you have to automatically accept anything posted as part of conspiracy dogma.  Many have realized this and accept that many articles/topics here are either false, misleading or highly sensationalized.  When this is the case you will usually find someone pointing this out/debunking the OP.  If you want a well rounded view of things its good to seperate the wheat from the chaff so to speak as far as information goes.  Hopefully discussion like this will lead to further research and discussion thus fostering a stronger and better informed community.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m asking why, in a thread in a subreddit which was created for us to discuss possible new conspiracy theories, is the top comment always trying to debunk the topic instead of supporting it.  It would be analogous to me going in the <a href="/r/happy">/r/happy</a> subreddit and seeing that all the top comments say &quot;Fuck all life&quot;.</p>

<p>Your argument is fine if it happened every once in a while, but I&#39;m talking about <em>more often than not</em>.  Please explain that.  Otherwise I&#39;ll stick with my current theory that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been infiltrated by paid hacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have examples?  I read most comment sections of the articles (as this is a pretty slow reddit) and what your describing I&#39;ve never really noticed.  I think if you could provide a few examples it would be easier to understand, and illustrate your point with a bit of authority.  On the front page right now the average # of comments is about 3.  In the 4 busiest (comment sections), your claim isn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>You seem to be pursuing this theory based on no empirical evidence.  If you truly believe this you should probably go through about 50 high comment submissions and get some data.</p>

<p>Its my guess that when you find examples of a debunking post being the top rated its going to be because the submission is wrong/misleading/sensationalized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your expectations are not in line with a conspiracy forum. Conspiracy theorists are not all caught up in this notion that these theories are absolute solid facts. We all can see plainly that these are eye witness accounts and I don&#39;t see people just jumping on the first thing there hear. It can be very tempting to think of all conspiracy theorists as paranoid and willing to believe the first rumor that comes in - I can tell you honestly that this just more crap promoted by the mainstream media, people aren&#39;t really jumping to conclusions over this information. </p>

<p>The OP is right. This forum is specifically to promote SPECULATION, it&#39;s not about whether a particular conclusion is empirical or not, that&#39;s for each individual to come to. It&#39;s very simple if you think of it like this: This forum is for THEORY, so I think to start insisting on conclusions (even really great sounding ones) is inappropriate. It&#39;s very elementary, and it is absolutely crucial that you let people form their own conclusions. The last thing we need are more narrow minded POVs crammed down our throats here. We are <em>trying</em> to be open minded here, and we are trying to <em>not</em> draw conclusions - shocking right? </p>

<p>The event is new.  Of course we don&#39;t have any definitive proof or evidence that there is a conspiracy, but the possibility for one is significant based solely on the identity of the crash victims.  Yet the top comment in that thread is asserting that it&#39;s unlikely since the plane could have crashed due to any number of other accidental reasons.  Bravo, you&#39;ve just convinced half of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that it was probably an accident because it looked like an accident.</p>

<p>Again I ask: where have you ever seen a conspiracy discussion group filled with such close-minded, uncurious and skeptical conspiracy theorists?  By rights I should be complaining that the people on this subreddit are <em>too</em> kooky and paranoid, not <em>not paranoid enough</em>.</p>

<p>I disagree.  Virtually all assassination attempts will be made to look like accidents or coincidences.  So what are you trying to say?  Because other, non-murderous possibilities exist, we should all assume it was just chance &quot;until further facts come to light&quot;?</p>

<p>No.  That&#39;s what <a href="/r/its">/r/its</a>-not-a-conspiracy would be for.  I&#39;m not saying every event is a conspiracy.  I&#39;m saying that that in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, every event should be considered suspect until proven otherwise, not the other way around.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s totally fact, but that&#39;s why I like to hear both sides of the argument in the comments section.  You can come across some real intelligent discussion if you find the right topic.  On the other hand, there are some stories that are so completely outrageous you only need to read a few comments to tell the OP is taking too much of a leap, or possibly has an anti-jew/mason/conservative/liberal/Canadian agenda. </p>

<p>Yes it is.</p>

<p>P.S. I like it when non-atheists contribute to the discussion in the atheism subreddit.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s hard to have a discussion with the true zealots: &quot;I&#39;m right because the bible says so, end of discussion, you&#39;re going to hell, I&#39;ll pray for you.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not even about debunking or not debunking.  For example, I posted this thread up because I was reading a thread discussing the recent plane crash into the IRS building, and a thread about the three Tesla employees.  Nobody knows if either of those two events were/are conspiracies or not; that&#39;s why we discuss it in the comments.  However, the top comments in both of those posts went something like, &quot;I highly doubt it&#39;s a conspiracy.  X and Y and Z could easily go wrong, it was foggy, etc.&quot;</p>

<p>Facts are fine.  Opinions trying to shut down debate about a possible conspiracy, before we even know diddly squat about the event, fire off warning flares in my mind.  More warning flares for the fact that each of these comments got upvoted a couple dozen times, while the next best comment (pro-conspiracy) never got more than 3 or 4 points.  The OP was actually downvoted on almost every single comment he made on that page.</p>

<p>Come on, is it really such a stretch to believe that &quot;the enemy&quot; has infiltrated one of the largest and most influential conspiracy theory discussion groups on the internet in order to quell and divert inquiry?  Heck, if I had the inclination to create 15 reddit accounts and the patience to switch between them, I could probably single-handedly change the face and direction of discussion in this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>.... seriously guys.</p>

<p>What I mean is, in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I see too little of &quot;Hey this just happened.  Might it be a conspiracy?  Let&#39;s discuss&quot;, and too much of &quot;Guys, it&#39;s probably just a coincidence&quot;.  The latter always get upvoted higher than the former.</p>

<p>Facts vs. claims--fine.  We don&#39;t know all the facts yet.  So we speculate based on what we know while waiting for more evidence/investigation.  To say, &quot;naww it&#39;s probably not a conspiracy&quot; right at the beginning and move on is highly premature and looks to me like a blatant attempt to shut down discussion.  It&#39;d be like me going into SuicideWatch and posting in every thread, &quot;Guys, I think he&#39;s just faking it.  False alarm.  He could be AFK for X or Y or Z reasons, there&#39;s no reason to suspect anything, even though I know he&#39;s suicidal.  </p>

<p>When did I say that the post debunked anything by providing actual evidence?  I said that the top post stated, &quot;It&#39;s probably not a conspiracy because any number of things could have gone wrong to explain the crash, like fog, or an engine failure, etc; therefore it&#39;s best to assume it&#39;s an accident, unless further evidence arises.&quot;</p>

<p>So, in the interest of arriving at an answer: should that comment be the top post in a submission in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I think that a lot of people don&#39;t really understand how to behave on a conspiracy forum. Conspiracy theories are always going to have detractors so there really is no point in objecting to what anyone posts - the objections could be equally baseless or suspect. There is a great deal of dis-information out there so if you try to debate something you end up just making things less clear. </p>

<p>The way these things work is that everybody who wants to make a crazy, loony or baseless accusation is given freedom of speech to do so, without criticism or judgment. It then is the responsibility of you the individual to find the truth for yourself. Conspiracy theorists never agree with each other, and they all sound crazy in some way, but that&#39;s part of the fun of it. Either way it&#39;s better not to annoy everybody with a childish insistence for things to be black and white - unlike the main site. </p>

<p>Just answer me one question: why are there more conspiracy un-believers than believers in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  At least judging by the upvotes.  To me this is incredible; akin to going to a hard-right Christian website and finding the discussions dominated by pro-atheists, who have actually managed to convince a large portion of the site&#39;s user base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK I am referring to these debunking posts - there is no curiosity and an insistence that the world is black and white. I am saying that is a bad thing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I am an avid follower of conspiracies so when I say conspiracy theorists all sound a bit crazy I don&#39;t mean to say that that is a bad thing - to me the truth of what&#39;s really going on is very crazy. I use that word because seriously if you really do your research into conspiracy theories your head will really spin. I have to really question people who come into conspiracies thinking that it&#39;s just a simple matter of world control and that&#39;s it. Do you know the work of Jordan Maxwell? What about David Icke, you know that guy who went on T.V. and said he was Jesus, who talks about humans being being amazing creatures that the powers that be are terrified of? Now to be honest I don&#39;t think that these people are crazy, but by reddit standards yes they are completely mad. So obviously any &#39;debunker&#39; can come in and say that Icke is mad and by the worlds fucked up standards they are correct. I don&#39;t think the story ends there unlike you. You can&#39;t be all sensitive to whether or not a person seems crazy - anyone who challenges our idea <em>will</em> sound crazy - it goes with the territory. You should not be so terrified of the concept. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, based on what you&#39;re saying here it seems we agree.  The point I&#39;m trying to get across, though, is that, generalities aside, I am noticing very specific instances where perfectly legitimate and even downright exciting <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts are getting downvoted / ridiculed.  I&#39;m not talking about some crazy coming in here and saying that the world is going to end.  I&#39;m talking about, for example, posts about the Tesla employees&#39; plane crash, or the IRS building kamikaze attack.  It may be a conspiracy; it may not.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the place to discuss it; not to say, &quot;it was most likely an accident&quot;, upvote it to the top comment, and then close discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are certain people who subscribe to this subreddit just to downvote and argue certain specific topics:</p>

<p>There are pro-israel zionists who watch for anything remotely related to israel or jews.</p>

<p>There are climate change fanatics who jump on any story relating to climategate or AGW conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>There are brainwashed military thugs who have a lot of personal investment in the 9/11, WMD, Iraq war thing and they are here to downvote and debunk anything suggesting the war on terror is a fraud.</p>

<p>We also have a few obsessive-compulsive aspergers sufferers here in this /r/ who will comb through every article looking for a minor spelling error to point out as proof that the entire article is false. </p>

<p>On the flip-side, there are those who believe a certain group is at the top of the conspiracy pyramid (eg. vatican, jews, reptilians) and they make an effort to downvote and deride articles that suggest any other group is in power.</p>

<p>I could name names but if you&#39;re a regular here you already know some people that fall into the above groups. (I&#39;m in the reptilian group myself).</p>

<p>I try not to take it too seriously and I upvote almost everything here. I don&#39;t mind the constant attempts to debunk even the most trivial facts in these articles.</p>

<p>Despite what you might think from the comments, the pro-conspiracy redditors outnumber the debunkers here dramatically (as it should be) which is why good submissions get decent upvotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aahhhh, what a breath of fresh air.  Thank you.</p>

<p>Well, if you&#39;ve been on reddit for a long time, surely you must have noticed reddit becoming more mainstream and therefore less conspiratorially theoretical.  It&#39;s a shame to me but that&#39;s life.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, however, I&#39;ve always viewed as a haven for naturally curious, even suspicious, critical thinkers.  We are made up more of reddit&#39;s old following, from back in a time when conspiracy theory posts about 9/11 and the like made #1 even without subreddits.  We made governments and powerful corporations quake with our allegations of complicity in false flag attacks, and I&#39;d dare to say that we may have even prevented a few with our predictions.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> today, however, I feel has been infiltrated on a level beyond what is capable by the independent outlying zionist or military zealot.  Is it so hard to believe that reddit is influentional enough that its conspiracy theory subjects (the Federal government/G.O.P; the Israeli government, etc.) have a vested interest in nullifying our threat?  We already know that real companies exist who deploy bands of social-news-crawling agents to promote PR agendas.  How do I know I&#39;m not talking to one right now (no offense), employed by the Federal or Israeli government to ward off any and all attacks against the G.O.P./Israel?  Software hacks aside, even a handful of paid commenters could wreak devastation on the effectiveness of this subreddit by immediately burying bombshell posts, blunting suspicions in the comments, and thinning out good posts with a flood of chaff.  I personally have seen truly monumental and damning posts disappear from the front page within the space of an hour, when, judging by my intuition, I would have guessed the post would make #1 easily.  Sometimes the post still shows up as #1 on the subreddit page, but not on the main.</p>

<p>I know a lot of my personal experience can be dismissed as coincidence or bias.  But I know I&#39;m not the only one who sees this.  And out of all people I would expect to agree with me, it would be the members of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  The fact that a significant portion of them (supposedly) don&#39;t is discouraging.</p>
