        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a serious question, not a dig.  I think 9/11 has a <em>lot</em> of unanswered questions that will never be answered officially, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>One of the biggest is of the WTCs being brought down by controlled demolitions.  All the evidence doesn&#39;t seem to add up - especially building 7.</p>

<p>So how did somebody manage to wire these huge skyscrapers - without anybody noticing - to fall perfectly in on themselves?  I&#39;m not talking about sticking a large bomb in there, but strategically demolishing the building.  Professional demolition experts take months to plan and execute a demolition of much smaller buildings.</p>

<p>Logistically - how was this done?</p>

<p>My second question is how many people do you believe are &#39;in on it&#39;?  It&#39;s kinda hard to imagine that so many people could have been part of such a large scale plan and manage to keep quiet about it for so long (both prior and after - it must have taken a few years to plan...).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is documented in 911 Mysteries, in which an IT tech tried to testify to the 9/11 commission but was denied.  I think they started installing the demolition wiring in about 1996.  But it could have been done in 3 weeks leading up to 9/11, and bombs installed the last week when bomb-sniffing dogs were removed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were 80 elevator mechanics inside the towers on the morning of 9/11. Surely the elevators didn&#39;t need too much attention? Maybe the core columns did...</p>

<p>Also, for 7, none of the charges would need to be wired. Wireless detonators have been around for a long time, and the charges could be designed to look like anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, 80 doesn&#39;t seem like that crazy of a number. These buildings were huge, with a lot of elevators. If one breaks it is going to take a crew of guys to fix it in a timely manner, not just one Roger Work Man. Also consider they were doing routine maintenance everyday.  Then you have to figure a portion of that 80 were in some sort of supervising/administrative positions. Just think of how many cleaning people, general repair type people there were in the buildings. Anyone could have pulled it off, just due to the shear amount of people moving through out the buildings everyday. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The WTC1 and WTC2 towers also had their <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread443374/pg1">fireproofing upgraded</a>, with the work conveniently focused on the blocks of floors that were hit. Failing of the fireproofing was cited as one of the main reasons for the collapse, so this would be something of a red flag. Paint the beams with a corrosive agent instead of fireproofing, nano-thermite or other volatile compounds.</p>

<p>In WTC1 these happen to be exactly the floors occupied by Marsh who acquired <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroll_Inc.#WTC_.26_Sears_Tower_security">Kroll Inc., the very company that took care of upgrading the towers security after the 1993 bombing</a>. Marsh Crisis Management was also headed up by none other than L. Paul Bremer who was the former coordinator of counter-terrorism for the US Government and later became the governor of Iraq. The guy with the <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/143983/paul_bremer_sending_billions_of_cash.html">lost billions</a>, it&#39;s funny how the coincidences stack up.</p>

<p>Among his roles, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Paul_Bremer">Bremer was the former assistant of Henry Kissinger himself and later the managing director of Kissinger &amp; Associates</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bremer and 1,700 of his employees at Marsh &amp; McLennan had offices in both towers. Bremer&#39;s office was in the South Tower. He and his people occupied floors at and &quot;above where the second aircraft hit.&quot;  At the time of his television interview with CNN on September 14, 2001, 450 of his colleagues were unaccounted for; 295 were eventually counted as dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing:  High explosives--available only within military and intelligence quarters--were empirically, scientifically shown to exist in WTC dust.  How it got there is a legitimate question (and one with several credible possibilities), but the existence of it is not.   We KNOW it was there.  There is no question on this.
<a href="http://911blogger.com/node/19761">http://911blogger.com/node/19761</a>
<a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/thermitics_made_simple.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/thermitics_made_simple.html</a>
<a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/explosive_residues.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/explosive_residues.html</a></p>

<p>Moreover, what else can explain the enormous amount of WTC dust, and the complete obliteration of the towers?  Fires do not pulverize thousands of tons of concrete.    </p>

<p>As for how it got there:</p>

<p>&quot;Scott Forbes, a senior database administrator for Fiduciary Trust in the South Tower , has come forward to expose the unusual and unprecedented power-down that occurred the weekend before 9/11. He explained that his company put forth a huge investment in time and resources to take down their computer systems due to the deliberate power outage.  This process, Forbes recalled, began early Saturday morning (September 8th) and continued until mid-Sunday afternoon (September 9th) – approximately 30 hours. </p>

<p>As a result of having the electricity cut, security cameras were rendered inoperative, as were its I.D. systems and elevators to the upper floors.&quot;
<a href="http://www.911truther.com/article1.html">http://www.911truther.com/article1.html</a></p>

<p>There have also been reports of extensive pre-9/11 renovations, especially in the elevator shafts.  It&#39;s also significant that the towers had been privatized in the months before 9/11 for the first time in history.  The problem, though, is that much of the evidence was deliberately destroyed.  The thousands of tons of steel frames, for instance, were immediately confiscated and sent abroad to be recycled and/or destroyed.  It&#39;s difficult to provide a thorough explanation when evidence has been purposely hidden.
<a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/destroyed.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/destroyed.html</a></p>

<p>But there have been many individuals within the towers who experienced enormous explosions both before and after the planes hit.  One that is particularly interesting is William Rodriguez:</p>

<p>&quot;Declared a hero for saving numerous lives at Ground Zero, he was the janitor on duty the morning of 9/11 who heard and felt explosions rock the basement sub-levels of the north tower just seconds before the jetliner struck the top floors.</p>

<p>He not only claims he felt explosions coming from below the first sub-level while working in the basement, he says the walls were cracking around him and he pulled a man to safety by the name of Felipe David, who was severely burned from the basement explosions.&quot;

<a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/eyewitnesses.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/eyewitnesses.html</a></p>

<p>As to how many people are in on it, my guess would be that most had no clue of their own involvement.  Compartmentalization can be quite handy.  But the extent to which this was actually a government-run operation, rather than a government-allowed operation, I do not know.  The evidence suggesting Israeli involvement is more than negligible (and before I get accused of being anti-Semitic, I am a secular Jew), and would explain a great deal.  But again, it is difficult to paint a picture without all the colors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I seem to remember that there was a telecommunications wiring upgrade that happened during the course of a couple of weekends a month or so before the attack. The company was not named and they were accessing floors that were not being used. One of the people who survived the attack also said he could hear lots of construction on the floor above him, which was unoccupied, in the weeks before. They could have put the charges in then.</p>

<p>One theory that I had when it first happened was that they possibly had the buildings wired since construction just in case of some sort of catastrophe made the buildings unstable. Then they could be demolished quickly before they toppled and killed a lot of other people. They would never make this public incase the information got into the wrong hands and then they would be blown up randomly by terrorists. It sounds a little dumb, but it makes a little sense. That is why there was an order to &quot;pull it&quot;. It was already wired as a safety measure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree.</p>

<p>If a building loses total structural integrity as it starts to collapse, then there won&#39;t be any forces to tilt the falling floors one way or another.</p>

<p>To get a tilt, you need one side of the building staying up while the other is collapsing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that would look quite a bit different from what we see. We do not see collapse from the bottom, we don&#39;t see it from random places, we see from the top floor by floor. Nothing happens at the base until the entire building has collapsed, which means that nothing you do at the bottom would cause what you see. </p>

<p>There seems to be this notion that if the top, say, 40 floors collapse the rest of the building could somehow have survived. That makes no sense. 40 floors (10 even) impacting is quite a bit different than simply withstanding a static load. Once it starts to collapse there is nothing to stop it from continuing. You don&#39;t need to assert cutting or exploding or melting anything after that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I did not make the previous point.</p>

<p>Second, you really haven&#39;t refuted anything... You made a claim with sound theory, but no examples or applicable data. I will back up my claims here, I would love if you could do the same. I am always interested in hearing all sides of any complex issue. It would be arrogant of any of us to say, with any certainty, that we know anything about &quot;what really happened.&quot; We can speculate given the &#39;facts&#39; we have. </p>

<p>I understand your argument, but this building was stronger then you are giving it credit for. The sudden addition of an extreme dynamic load obviously would have had a large impact on the structural integrity of both buildings, the issue I have is that they were SPECIFICALLY designed to withstand being stuck by a large commercial plane.[citation needed]? sounds good. </p>

<p>|&quot;...architect Minoru Yamasaki designed the World Trade Center |towers to withstand a collision with a Boeing 707 airplane (Federal |Emergency Management Agency 2002). The Boeing 707 is similar to |the Boeing 767s that actually crashed into the towers, the main |differences being that the 767 is slightly heavier and slower. The |impact from the plane that hit Tower One was well within the force |limits of the design and the impact from the second plane was only |ten percent above the force that Tower Two was designed to |absorb (“Nerdcities: The Guardian” 2002). So, from an engineering |perspective, the World Trade Center towers, at least Tower One, |should have been able to withstand the collisions on September |11th...&quot;</p>

<p>Not just me. The NIST people had access to the info. And I dispute this &quot;stronger&quot; claim. The WTC pushed the technology of the time and had a somewhat uncommon construction with all of the support at the core. </p>

<p>Second, no one asserts that the impact along took down the building. The impact is significant, and the fuselage seems to have survived to hit the core, but so is the fire. We have a damaged building and a core fire weakening the joints. I think that most &quot;truthers&quot; see this as melt/not melt rather than heat until failure.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are lots of models of each of those and we don&#39;t know the weight used in the initial modeling for the WTC. It looks like 707s were around 300,000 lbs while the 767 is about 400,000, a 33% increase. And &quot;slower&quot; has no meaning here. What matters is the speed at actual impact vs. the speed of impact in the model. </p>

<p>This is just odd. You doubt everything anyone in authority tells you about the collapse, but you find a tourist aimed PR meaningful. Yes, I bet they thought it was secure, that does not mean the modeling was accurate. Or that they could deal with a heavier plane moving, perhaps, faster. Or that they considered the combination of fire and impact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is a good analysis of the collapse: Journal of Engineering Mechanics:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am a little confused by the source here. The heading looks like this paper is by Seffen, but it is a critique of that paper. That said, let me make a few comments:</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, it has been &quot;well-established&quot; that the factors that caused the onset of collapse in the South Tower appear definitely to not have been the fires. The fires created from the plane impacts were not that intense just before the collapse initiation for either Tower, and for the South Tower the res seemed close to being contained and
put out by the firemen when suddenly rapidly horizontally-moving masses of material violently broke through walls of the floors below where the fires had been burning from the plane hit.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a critical error here. The concern is not the fire just before the collapse, the question is whether the fire got hot enough to <em>weaken</em> the supports. Once weakened they can start to shift. At that point unequal cooling itself can cause problems since that would cause more movement and weakening of the joints.  (As an example the Dresden Cathedral, which had a steel structure, survived the bombing, but collapsed suddenly the next day though there were not more explosions near by.)</p>

<p>The rest unfortunately reference yet more papers that I do not have access to or don&#39;t have at the moment. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Here is my problem, 99% of the &quot;truthers&quot; give nonsensical and even inconsistent claims. We get talk of cutting the foundation, which is clearly meaningless. We get talk of molten metal weeks after which somehow shows that thermite was used. We get claims that air pressure blowing out windows shows it was an explosion. Or this &quot;twisting&quot; claim which I simply don&#39;t get. What I don&#39;t see at all is evidence that is not explained well by the standard account. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you check out info on some other steel framed buildings and fire? There are plenty of case studies out there. Here is a starting point explaining the picture above in detail. </p>

<p>The First Interstate Bank fire &amp; The Beijing Mandarin Oriental Hotel are two good places to go after that. </p>

<p>Ask yourself how fire managed to pulverize concrete at the very beginning of the &quot;collapse&quot;.

Never falling to the left or right, nothing....just straight down into itself.</p>

<p>Ask yourself the simple questions.  Don&#39;t watch the video and tell yourself that is a building collapsing because THAT has never happened, ever before.</p>

<p>110 floors, an acre in size.....they just all gave up.  The fires could be knocked down with two lines.....all the audio shows this and everyone believes that fire caused it to fall.  Remember, at free fall speeds, that is almost 9 floors a second.  Imagine fire being able to REMOVE 9 floors every second?  Think its possible?

<p>I walked through some of that building and I was several blocks away.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To get it to fall, yes. It is an astoundingly painstaking thing for experts. This would have been by far the largest ever done, more than twice as tall as the next largest. And the WTC had unusual construction, so they would have had to consider that. They need to place the explosives right up against the support columns, not several inches away. They need to know how the stuff in the building will direct and shield the blast. </p>

<p>It would have been too difficult to explosively demolish the WTC if it was a public job. Given that the support is the core and it was so tall demolition would likely be considered impossible. That it fell &quot;in its footprint&quot; say nothing about that at all. And WTC7 was across the street.</p>

<p>Nonsense. The claim is that this was not a rush job, but the best of all time. Somehow they demolished the building top down, not bottom up, which is not how they do it. They made it collapse floor by floor, again quite unique. </p>

<p>I never understand this argument.  It takes demolition experts months and months of complicated, precise, difficult preparation and involves massive amounts of highly-powerful explosives to bring a building down, and therefore it is obvious that a (relatively) isolated plane crash caused what would otherwise have taken months of planning and loads of explosives.

    <div class="md"><p>Some argue that the third building, WTC7 might even have been the primary target of the operation.</p>

<p>It housed the SEC files as well as the Secret Service field office, but would have needed the third plane to hit to seem plausible. After all, buildings don&#39;t just collapse into their footprints for no reason. As it happened, the building was left dressed up for a party that never happened - they had to pull it for any chance of eliminating the evidence and hope that there were enough smoke and mirrors in place.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="http://www.viewzone.com/whitevan.html">truck painted with picture of a plane hitting the towers</a> found on the streets and later dismissed? This would seem like a secondary explanation in case the planes didn&#39;t create a plausible reason due to unknown factors.</p>

<p>As the operation didn&#39;t go all as planned, with the second plane being delayed in departure long enough for the first to take a <a href="http://911anomalies.wordpress.com/2007/06/20/911-military-drones-stewart-air-force-base/">long detour before their synchronized meeting over Stewart AFB</a> it&#39;s possible the third plane never made its rendezvous.</p>

<p>If the people heading the operation expected news to report three planes hitting and only two happened, this would have been quite confusing and could explain the stalling and paralysis of some of the involved parties.</p>

<p>It was all supposed to be so simple. One-two-three. Planes hit each building, buildings come down. When the planes didn&#39;t arrive on time, the buildings didn&#39;t collapse on time.</p>

<p>When WTC1 and WTC2 had not yet collapsed, a third plane couldn&#39;t hit WTC7 as the flight path would have gone through the two first buildings. This was possibly the biggest fumble overall if we&#39;re to follow the theory of an engineered false flag attack.</p>

<p>Why would Bush remain sitting in the school after learning of the two planes? What do actors do when the script is suddenly derailed?</p>

<p>They improvise.</p>

<p>WTC7 was brought down by improvisation, not by a plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So if there were no explosives &#39;right up against the support columns&#39; the buildings wouldn&#39;t have fallen down?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they are not right up against the columns then you don&#39;t know what will happen. The actions become unpredictable. You have to use significantly larger charges and you don&#39;t know whether they blow more or less. The whole point is to have some control. What we see is a building falling down stepwise, floor wise, from top to bottom. No one has presented me with a coherent narrative to explain how explosives would do this. People talk about explosives on the bottom, but those are meaningless. Either you have explosives at the various levels from the point of impact down or it is meaningless. They have to blow exactly right and at exactly the right time. Late and they clearly are not needed, early and we would see it. And if they were not needed but they were there we would see separate evidence of those explosions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does this thing require extremely high precision placing of high explosives by experts - or will any old big explosion - like an aircraft hitting the building, for example - bring the building down?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To bring the building down so that it <em>looks like</em> the airplane did it requires precise placement. You can take the building down in a wide range of ways, but that is not <em>your</em> claim. You don&#39;t simply say it was blown up, you say it was blown up to look like it was taken down by the fire/airplane. Your story requires extreme precision, far more than normal, to produce a specific story within a chaotic situation. </p>

<p>No, I am not saying this - I am saying it did look like explosives. </p>

<p>There is a fire three quarters of the way up the building - and suddenly, for no apparent reason, the whole thing fall into its own footprint. I mean come on - For this to happen, teams of experts need to spend months... </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure Legatus is losing any battles. While they have an agenda to promote, their main goal is control of the economy. and they&#39;ve been successful at that since the 1980&#39;s. </p>

<p>WTC7 collapse seem to begin at the base, where a typical demolition would take place.  That one held offices of CIA, FBI, Secret Service, SmithBarney, the SEC, and more.   I have said it before that any of those entities would likely have confidential data destruction plans in place, that could include anything from mild explosives to all out wiring of complete building.  It is documented that they didn&#39;t have much of a firefighting force or even water to contain the fires within WTC7 by that late afternoon, so in their fear of a security breach or other, they could have initiated whatever procedures they had.</p>

<p>I understand the &quot;pancake theory&quot; doesn&#39;t hold water in terms of actually creating the collapse, but after the initial collapse of those upper floors, the lower floors stood no chance of being able to even momentarily support the momentum/weight of the floors above that were collapsing.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The accumulation of forces as the collapse progressed would have damaged portions of the outer wall closer to the ground more than higher portions, despite the thicker gauge of the steel lower in the tower. </p>

<p>This is exactly what happened, maybe not so much focused on the outer wall, and not necessarily at the bottom of the towers - more towards the center, where window blowouts were observed.  The accumulation of forces is exactly why the lower floors couldn&#39;t contend with the weight and momentum of the upper floors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would lead to the following I think... (just thinking here, I have no facts)</p>

<p>WTC1 and 2 collapsed, WTC 7 got damaged by chunks of WTC 1/2 crashing down.</p>

<p>To protect national security, a self destruct is set in motion for WTC 7 so that snooping firemen or disaster tourists can&#39;t steal secret or confidential documents (about mob cases, informants, undercover operations).</p>

<p>The debris from all towers is hauled away and destroyed to protect all remaining confidential data (there were insurers, banks, doctor&#39;s offices in there).</p>

<p>Well hmm - I don&#39;t believe the official story, but still wonder indeed, as the OP asked, how the demolitions were installed. This reasoning (and again, I&#39;m just thinking here) would open a crack in my theory about 9/11. Interesting - I&#39;ll see if I find anything to support my line of thought. Don&#39;t hold your breath, that might take months.</p>

<p>Marvin P. Bush, the president’s younger brother, was a principal in a company called Securacom that provided security for the World Trade Center, United Airlines, and Dulles International Airport. The company, Burns noted, was backed by KuwAm, a Kuwaiti-American investment firm on whose board Marvin Burns also served. [Utne]
According to its present CEO, Barry McDaniel, the company had an ongoing contract to handle security at the World Trade Center &quot;up to the day the buildings fell down.&quot;</p>

<p>The company lists as government clients &quot;the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S Air force, and the Department of Justice,&quot; in projects that &quot;often require state-of-the-art security solutions for classified or high-risk government sites.&quot;</p>

<p>Go research who Larry Silverstein is connected to. Go research where the money trail for 911 went.. etc.. I know way more about 911 than you and I can assure you Silverstein had a hand in those demolitions.. for Israel.</p>

<p><em>Silverstein has ties of various kinds in Israel. He is a donor to Tel Aviv University and to the Tel Aviv development foundation. He held a few fundraising events at his home in New York for the foundation with the participation of the then-mayor of Tel Aviv, Roni Milo.</em></p>

<p><em>Silverstein is also a member of the joint American-Israeli commission for housing and community development, which was established by former president Bill Clinton.</em></p>

<p>I think the most pressing question was from stingerbell, and we <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be dow nvoting someone just because they have a well formed argument.  He says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the (remote-controlled) planes crash into the tower, a government team enters the Twin Towers to move the explosives to the correct floors. You wouldn&#39;t want the towers collapsing from an undamaged floor, so someone had to move the thermate into the middle of the inferno on the 93rd floor of tower 1 and the 77th floor of tower </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gee, I guess all that time in the Navy, I must have hallucinated the magnesium/thermite grenade that was to be used in case invaders came onto the ship seeking classified material.</p>

<p>They must have brainwashed me into thinking it was real, when it was obviously just a prop.  And all that time I spent mulching classified documents, training for the above scenario (there is a prioritized order..), and in general preparing for the worst, was all just a dream.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how the people in the Conspiracy Reddit believe it happened....</p>

<p>Actually, they don&#39;t believe this - but it&#39;s the only thing that makes sense if all their conspiracies are true.  Shows you just how intellectually dishonest they are:</p>

<ol>
<li> The explosives are planted before 9/11.</li>
<li> After the (remote-controlled) planes crash into the tower, a government team enters the Twin Towers to <strong><em>move the explosives to the correct floors</em></strong>.  You wouldn&#39;t want the towers collapsing from an <em>undamaged</em> floor, so someone had to move the thermate into the middle of the inferno on the 93rd floor of tower 1 and the 77th floor of tower 2.</li>
<li> This explains why the explosives weren&#39;t set off immediately when the planes hit - they had to be moved.</li>
<li> The alternate to this theory is - of course - that the government <strong><em>knew</em></strong> exactly what floors the planes were going to hit (in the future) and simply planted the explosives on the correct floors long before 9/11.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, no, the evidence for controlled demolition <strong><em>DOES NOT</em></strong> add up.  In fact, there is not one (reliable) piece of evidence that this was controlled demolition.  Not one.  It&#39;s 100% bullshit.  It&#39;s nothing more than lies....</p>

<p>Now, that&#39;s not to say the the US government isn&#39;t <strong><em>lying through their teeth about everything</em></strong>.  But, that doesn&#39;t mean they are in on it....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You missed a word. <em>Pyroclastic</em>. Pyroclastic dust is NOT created in all building collapses! It is created in many building <em>demolitions</em>, however. Which is my point. The evidence strongly suggests that these buildings were brought down by demolitions, not gravity. </p>

<p>But I&#39;ll play along for a bit. If it was gravity, please explain how the buildings came down in almost EXACTLY free-fall speed. Gravity? The top of the south tower leaned over almost 40 degrees before plunging <em>straight</em> down through the rest of the building. These buildings were 110 storeys each, with every floor covering an acre of space. That&#39;s an acre of concrete on every floor. 110 acres of concrete gone. Reduced to particulate levels. </p>

<p>Sorry, but the laws of physics do not support the conspiracy theory that the government is presenting. </p>

<p>I am sure that you are aware of the over 1100 architects and engineers have signed a petition supporting a new and truly independant investigation. Right? </p>

<p>To be clear, Stringer, I do not believe the &quot;government&quot; had anything to do with 9/11. I believe that there are criminal elements/agents/people that have infiltrated the government and military at the highest levels, and were able to pull this off due to their inside influence and control. They have gotten away with it through a combination of their peers apathy, cognitive dissonance, and plain old stupidty on the part of the general public - yourself included. </p>

<p>Statements by Engineers
Engineers who participated in the design of the World Trade Center have stated, since the attack, that the Towers were designed to withstand jetliner collisions. For example, Leslie Robertson, who is featured on many documentaries about the attack, said he &quot;designed it for a (Boeing) 707 to hit it.&quot; 2   Statements and documents predating the attack indicate that engineers considered the effects of not only of jetliner impacts, but also of ensuing fires. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Skilling
John Skilling was the head structural engineer for the World Trade Center. In a 1993 interview, Skilling stated that the Towers were designed to withstand the impact and fires resulting from the collision of a large jetliner such as Boeing 707 or Douglas DC-8. </p>

<p>Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed, ... The building structure would still be there. 3<br/>
A white paper released on February 3, 1964 states that the Towers could have withstood impacts of jetliners travelling 600 mph -- a speed greater than the impact speed of either jetliner used on 9/11/01. </p>

<p>The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707—DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact. 4   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A B-25 Bomber has a maximum takeoff weight of 19,000 kg.
A Boeing 767-222 has a minimum weight of 82,380 kg, and a maximum take-off weight of 179,170 kg. 
The top speed of a 767 is also higher by a factor of 2 - 442 km/h vs 913 km/h. This accounts for an enormous difference in kinetic energy between the two crashes. </p>

<p>Go through all 550,000+ websites and tell me there is no reliable evidence. face it, you&#39;re head is in the sand and you are happy with it there, you have no interest in hearing something the contradicts what you think. I have made no conclusion about what happened on 9/11, regardless, I am at least not so stubborn that if I had I would resort to whining like a schoolgirl online.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>One good question would seem to be - Do buildings just fall down in their own footprints?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I walked through some of that building and I was several blocks away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or do they need Professional demolition experts, who must spend months planning, and weeks placing and wiring, complicated demolitions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To get it to fall, yes. It is an astoundingly painstaking thing for experts. This would have been by far the largest ever done, more than twice as tall as the next largest. And the WTC had unusual construction, so they would have had to consider that. They need to place the explosives right up against the support columns, not several inches away. They need to know how the stuff in the building will direct and shield the blast. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems the authorities tell us that it could not possibly be explosives that brought down the buildings - as that would be too difficult to put into operation - yet when they are countered with the argument that the buildings fell on their own footprint, so it must have been explosives, we are told that they didn&#39;t really fall on their own footprint, and a lot of rubble fell far enough away that it set wtc7 on fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would have been too difficult to explosively demolish the WTC if it was a public job. Given that the support is the core and it was so tall demolition would likely be considered impossible. That it fell &quot;in its footprint&quot; say nothing about that at all. And WTC7 was across the street.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So maybe this kind of demolition, which is not the result of months of careful planning, but is a semi professional rush job, caused the buildings to fall mostly in their own footprints, can be put into action be a few guys in a lift shaft with some explosives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonsense. The claim is that this was not a rush job, but the best of all time. Somehow they demolished the building top down, not bottom up, which is not how they do it. They made it collapse floor by floor, again quite unique. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>There weren&#39;t any core columns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes there were.</p>

<p>The core of the towers housed the elevator and utility shafts, restrooms, three stairwells, and other support spaces. The core –a combined steel and concrete structure–[28][29]  of each tower was a rectangular area 87 by 135 feet (27 by 41 m) and contained 47 steel columns running from the bedrock to the top of the tower.</p>
