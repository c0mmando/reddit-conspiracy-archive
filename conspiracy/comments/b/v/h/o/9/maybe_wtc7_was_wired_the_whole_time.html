       Both the DOD and CIA were tenants in the building. Isn't it likely they had the place wired so the could pull it incase of an invasion or something? Silverstein would have known about the explosives, as he would have been key to having it done unnoticed*, and accidentally let it slip not realising it was supposed to be secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       *this also explains the fact that no one remembers seeing people plant the explosives/thermite, because they're only thinking about the last year not twenty years ago when the DOD or CIA were "upgrading security measures."

       I think the assumption is that WTC7 houses sensitive governmen materials, and thus carrying that reasoning over to 1&amp;2 requires some other logical step.

       I read somewhere before that since NYC is such an economic supercenter, and since manhattan has so many big buildings, that maybe all the bigger buildings are wired, "just in case"... seems like this would be pretty easy to investigate, though. Somebody has to have access to the larger buildings who could investigate that or who would leak that kind of information. Personally, I think it's more likely that WTC7 was officially pre-wired and WTC1&amp;2 were wired covertly just for 9/11.

       I read somewhere that thermite can be painted on.  So one would have to be looking for thermite painting for it to be easy to investigate.  The real question is why hasn't an investigation taken place?  After all, it is a viable theory sans the nuttiness of the rationale and that a few people would have to remain silent.

       When you know you are hiding something that no one will be looking for your task becomes much easier. The people that had this task still are in control today, above the puppet governments that are threatened and manipulated. Mere elected officials change regularly and   don't have a clue to perpetuating cover-ups of any real conspiracies.

       The evidence is there, your just overlooking it. These huge buildings fell in their own footprint. Until someone shows how else this could have happened, the facts remain clear and the cover-up lives on.

       I think the logical step is that it was a back room deal cut back in the 90's after the first bombing.  "Gee, you see how close we came.  If it happened again and the towers fell over sideways it would devestate the island and cause many more deaths.  We need install a fail safe."
      </p>
      <p>
       The last minute running around that has been described by witnesses in the week leading up to it might have just been checking and tuning that already existing system.  Debunkers have always fallen back on, "Do you know how many people it would take and how long it would take to wire those buildings for demo?"  I think 7 years years more than enough time for planning and execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they keep it secret?  No one would've wanted to work or lease in those buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they keep it secret after the fact?  Obvious from some many perspectives it's barely worth answering, but I'll try, money, fear of their own lives, fear of being ruined for being part of the construction of something so foul, fear of loss of public confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this scenario it isn't even necessary to believe that it was done deliberately.  It could have been triggered by virtue of the damage, unlikely but possible.

       Yes, I made a comment about a year or two ago on reddit saying the same thing.  I remember articles suggesting that, had the original bombing succeeded in toppling the towers, the loss of life would be in the 100k range.  I think the scenario was one tower toppling into the second and both would fall onto the smaller buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it makes sense in a bizarre way to wire the buildings to collapse onto a small footprint in the event of a successful toppling bombing.  In other words, the expert explosives would be set off if one of the towers was in danger of toppling.  The secret nature of the demolition is for the reason you alluded too... the tenants would leave and everyone would question the integrity of the leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with this plan (if it existed) is that a small group of people have a great knowledge advantage over a large group of people.  Such knowledge could be leveraged to the small group's advantage (financial or otherwise).
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think this is a far fetched theory that is only in the realm of possibility simply because other 'conspiracies' such as Northwoods turned out to be entirely true.  In other words, our leaders are often batshit insane.  So a somewhat reasonable person like myself, who points out that such things are possible and have occurred, comes across as batshit insane.  Or, in more simple terms, the critics shoot the messenger.

       Is it seriously being suggested that infiltrating a cleaning crew is beyond the ability of the various agencies that would be tasked with this kind of covert op?  Or that such a crew, working during the very early hours as they usually do, wouldn't have every opportunity to ferry up as much thermite/explosives as they needed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take note that the NIST reports continue to deny that thermite was used to bring down WTC 7.  Not based on the science, nor based on any engineering analysis or judgment on their part.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the reason they continue to deny thermite as a cause is because they continue to claim that it wouldn't be possible to deploy enough of the stuff without being seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a ridiculous defense, and in any case way outside their field of expertise to be saying what is and isn't a feasible covert op.

       I have always thought this. In case of some catastrophe, they could be demolished into their own footprint rather than toppling and killing a lot more people. The reason nobody will admit it is because if there are other buildings currently standing, then if someone could figure out what the trigger is, that would be a handy tool to REALLY cause terror.

       The security firm that was attached to the 'elevator modernization' project employed one Marvin Bush. The elevator project granted full access to the buildings' superstructures and Bush or one of his peers had enough clout to make sure that there weren't too many questions.

       As for WTC7 being previously rigged for demolition, it is entirely possible, but we won't know until we can indict the traitors and subpoena witnesses without having them murdered by the globalists who will use every trick to shield themselves from America's righteous wrath. America isn't yet strong enough to face the traitors that lurk within its own halls of government and the enemies that lurk within the governments of its so-called allies such as Israel. Something will have to change before the victims of 9/11 will be avenged.

       They always had it wired. Well, following the original attack on the WTC. However, it would only be enough to damage the building so as to make it impossible to find records. But in the weeks before 9/11, there was "elevator repair" being done. But really, they were wiring up extra thermite and Comp. B.

       That doesn't serve a purpose... Why not "Wire" the pentagon in case of "invasion" or the Whitehouse. There were also a lot of other tenants in the building not just government encampments. Not likely for that reason but they did have it wired in advance. If you look to see whos the the "BOD" of the security company in charge of the buildings you'll find "Marvin Bush" one of the Bush boys. Many of the demolition "experts" that agree it was a take down think it "MAY" have taken up to a year in advance to wire all three buildings.

       If I were doing it, I would try to use the existing wiring already in the building which would lessen the task greatly. Possibly they used a  wired device that actually looked like something else that would be easily overlooked as out of place as explosives would appear.

       WTC7 would have gone down earlier in the day if flight 93 hadn't been 45 minutes late taking off.  Silverstein had to wait all day so he could blame the collapse on fire rather than jet fueled fire.  93 missed its window and was taken care of by the military in shanksville.

       The first step is how. If you cant prove that it was done by explaining how it's pointless to move onto they why. Why could be any number of reasons from conspiracy coverup to actual fire damage was going to bring the building down any way so the decision was made to do it cleanly and minimize colateral damage.

       You have to make up your mind. Do you believe the building to be rigged with explosives.

       Controlled demolitions of a building is a massive project beyond what many of you seem to understand.  Its not merely the running of miles of wiring which is an impressive task in itself, the support structures need to be weakened beforehand, which takes huge and hugely loud drills kicking up tons of dust.

       Controlled demo of a building in secret is simply Not Possible.  If you disagree then you don't understand the process, shouldn't you people understand the technique that you're so opinionated about?

       ...Which makes the revelation that Silverstein was trying to push for a controlled demolition to "save lives" and control the "inevitable collapse" of WTC7 all the more interesting.

       yes, this. Who in their right mind would go into an unstable(ie. Highly likely to collapse not just structurally damaged) building to wire it(and cut through supporting beams?) with explosives?

       No, that's just the cheepest way of doing it. The same effect can be achieved with carefully placed explosives. If you read the official explanation it was the failure of one critical beam that caused a redistribution of the stress to cause the entire building to fail.

       Um, yes it was. Dod and CIA would have been permanently maned and financial institutions deal with other institutions around the world and would have people coming and going at all hours.
