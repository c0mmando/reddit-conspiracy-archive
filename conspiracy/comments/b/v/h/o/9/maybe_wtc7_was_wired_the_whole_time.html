<p>*this also explains the fact that no one remembers seeing people plant the explosives/thermite, because they&#39;re only thinking about the last year not twenty years ago when the DOD or CIA were &quot;upgrading security measures.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read somewhere before that since NYC is such an economic supercenter, and since manhattan has so many big buildings, that maybe all the bigger buildings are wired, &quot;just in case&quot;... seems like this would be pretty easy to investigate, though. Somebody has to have access to the larger buildings who could investigate that or who would leak that kind of information. Personally, I think it&#39;s more likely that WTC7 was officially pre-wired and WTC1&amp;2 were wired covertly just for 9/11.</p>

<p>I read somewhere that thermite can be painted on.  So one would have to be looking for thermite painting for it to be easy to investigate.  The real question is why hasn&#39;t an investigation taken place?  After all, it is a viable theory sans the nuttiness of the rationale and that a few people would have to remain silent.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the logical step is that it was a back room deal cut back in the 90&#39;s after the first bombing.  &quot;Gee, you see how close we came.  If it happened again and the towers fell over sideways it would devestate the island and cause many more deaths.  We need install a fail safe.&quot;</p>

<p>The last minute running around that has been described by witnesses in the week leading up to it might have just been checking and tuning that already existing system.  Debunkers have always fallen back on, &quot;Do you know how many people it would take and how long it would take to wire those buildings for demo?&quot;  I think 7 years years more than enough time for planning and execution.</p>

<p>Why would they keep it secret?  No one would&#39;ve wanted to work or lease in those buildings.</p>

<p>Why would they keep it secret after the fact?  Obvious from some many perspectives it&#39;s barely worth answering, but I&#39;ll try, money, fear of their own lives, fear of being ruined for being part of the construction of something so foul, fear of loss of public confidence.</p>

<p>In this scenario it isn&#39;t even necessary to believe that it was done deliberately.  It could have been triggered by virtue of the damage, unlikely but possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I made a comment about a year or two ago on reddit saying the same thing.  I remember articles suggesting that, had the original bombing succeeded in toppling the towers, the loss of life would be in the 100k range.  I think the scenario was one tower toppling into the second and both would fall onto the smaller buildings.  </p>

<p>To me, it makes sense in a bizarre way to wire the buildings to collapse onto a small footprint in the event of a successful toppling bombing.  In other words, the expert explosives would be set off if one of the towers was in danger of toppling.  The secret nature of the demolition is for the reason you alluded too... the tenants would leave and everyone would question the integrity of the leadership.  </p>

<p>The problem with this plan (if it existed) is that a small group of people have a great knowledge advantage over a large group of people.  Such knowledge could be leveraged to the small group&#39;s advantage (financial or otherwise).</p>

<p>Personally, I think this is a far fetched theory that is only in the realm of possibility simply because other &#39;conspiracies&#39; such as Northwoods turned out to be entirely true.  In other words, our leaders are often batshit insane.  So a somewhat reasonable person like myself, who points out that such things are possible and have occurred, comes across as batshit insane.  Or, in more simple terms, the critics shoot the messenger.</p>

<p>I will never understand this point.</p>

<p>Is it seriously being suggested that infiltrating a cleaning crew is beyond the ability of the various agencies that would be tasked with this kind of covert op?  Or that such a crew, working during the very early hours as they usually do, wouldn&#39;t have every opportunity to ferry up as much thermite/explosives as they needed?</p>

<p>Take note that the NIST reports continue to deny that thermite was used to bring down WTC 7.  Not based on the science, nor based on any engineering analysis or judgment on their part.</p>

<p>No, the reason they continue to deny thermite as a cause is because they continue to claim that it wouldn&#39;t be possible to deploy enough of the stuff without being seen.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a ridiculous defense, and in any case way outside their field of expertise to be saying what is and isn&#39;t a feasible covert op.</p>

There were also a lot of other tenants in the building not just government encampments. Not likely for that reason but they did have it wired in advance. If you look to see whos the the &quot;BOD&quot; of the security company in charge of the buildings you&#39;ll find &quot;Marvin Bush&quot; one of the Bush boys. Many of the demolition &quot;experts&quot; that agree it was a take down think it &quot;MAY&quot; have taken up to a year in advance to wire all three buildings. </p>

<p>No, that&#39;s just the cheepest way of doing it. The same effect can be achieved with carefully placed explosives. If you read the official explanation it was the failure of one critical beam that caused a redistribution of the stress to cause the entire building to fail.</p>
