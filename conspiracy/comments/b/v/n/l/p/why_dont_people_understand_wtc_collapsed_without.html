       There is no substantial evidence showing that bombs were planted. Planes exploding are what caused the building to fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though that doesn't mean it wasn't an inside job. It's not like a government has never done a false flag to join a war before. The government could just of easily hijacked the planes and flew them into a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry but there were no bombs.

       That's not evidence. That's editing. Why didn't the video include the footage where you can watch molten meterial pooring down the side of the buildings?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fire proof material was aesbestos, which causes cancer and it had to be removed from the buildings. This was a known fact that it would have cost the owner millions upon millions to repair.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the towers was hit roughly 10 stories from the top of the tower.
A 110 story building can not physically fail down to the core from a weight that is less than 1/10th the full weight of the structure.

       You are mistaken. "Bombs" is a misnomer.  Thermite is used to cut steel-like lightning.  The pieces of the main structural steel that held up the Towers were cut into 16' sections, this evidence is available in pics taken at ground zero.  The explosions in the basement may very well have been some sort of bomb, but the amount of thermite necessary to cut 57 I-beams would probably have a concussive effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of thermite in the dust from the Towers, and the fact that there were
       <em>
        two different chemical signatures
       </em>
       from the thermitic material, indicate that,
       <strong>
        military grade
       </strong>
       material used, as well as "ordinary" thermite.  And lots of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are deliberate disinfo, GTFO.  There are people in this forum who have been studying 9/11 for six or more years.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you like getting your hat and ass handed to you, stick around.  We'll have fun.

       Bookmarked.  Good stuff.  Have you posted to Loosechange?  I haven't been back in quite a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       My bride is almost apolitical, and I was driving her crazy.  And, I had enough data for my own consumption, and none of the people I associated with rated more than "sheeple".  Even old and dear friends would start to glaze over, so I stopped talking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My sense is that we need to work up to a big deal on the tenth anniversary.  We have the proof, we have the data, the videos, the eyewitness accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The disinfo has been, largely, ineffective, because the real thing is so powerful.  Things follow in sequence.  All that is missing are the names and faces.  It would be nice to know motive, but I don't expect to get that lucky.  PNAC spelled it out.  Silverstein opened his fool mouth, Israeli operative went on tv and blabbed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all in the open, now.  But something I said years ago at L.C. still is true.  We are missing  a trained librarian, to catalog all the stuff.  There are stills, video, audio by the hundreds and thousands.  But  you know all this.

       Simple observation of videos and pictures shows that WTC1 and 2 literally exploded, floor by floor. Although thermite residues were found that does not exclude the use of shape charges and other explosive devices. Explosions were most certainly heard by all witnesses, including the firemen.

       retiredgoat, you can go an about the physical evidence forever. What you have to realize is that the 911 commission was compromised; they didn't follow the money, for example. That's a cover up, you know it.

      <p>
       I think we can both agree that the commission was set up to fail, right?

       WTC1&amp;2 were also controlled demolitions.  The explosives were placed during the power-downs in the months prior, and we have physical evidence and paper trail to prove it points straight back to the Bushes, et al.  We had it 5 years ago.  Do some real research.

       too small to produce the observed results.  Ergo: plenty of evidence for extra energy input, Q.E.D.

       I forget which tower is which, but one collapse shows the upper portion of the tower tilting before the building obliterates itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       One would expect this tilted part to fall:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) Over the side of the building
b) faster than the collapse of the building.

       I'd have to see the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a) yes
b) depends: yes if it actually tilts to the side so the tip is falling @ gravity, while the base of the tilt falls @ less than gravity (collapsing building). No if it's just tilted a little bit and tip &amp; base fall @ same speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But gimme video so I can be more accurate.

       And if it was tilted 'alot', there is bugger all more (controlled) explosions can do to stop it.
