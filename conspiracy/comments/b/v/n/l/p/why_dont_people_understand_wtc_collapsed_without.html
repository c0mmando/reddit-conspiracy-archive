<p>The fire proof material was aesbestos, which causes cancer and it had to be removed from the buildings. This was a known fact that it would have cost the owner millions upon millions to repair.</p>

<p>One of the towers was hit roughly 10 stories from the top of the tower.
A 110 story building can not physically fail down to the core from a weight that is less than 1/10th the full weight of the structure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are mistaken. &quot;Bombs&quot; is a misnomer.  Thermite is used to cut steel-like lightning.  The pieces of the main structural steel that held up the Towers were cut into 16&#39; sections, this evidence is available in pics taken at ground zero.  The explosions in the basement may very well have been some sort of bomb, but the amount of thermite necessary to cut 57 I-beams would probably have a concussive effect.</p>

<p>The amount of thermite in the dust from the Towers, and the fact that there were <em>two different chemical signatures</em> from the thermitic material, indicate that, <strong>military grade</strong> material used, as well as &quot;ordinary&quot; thermite.  And lots of it.</p>

<p>If you are deliberate disinfo, GTFO.  There are people in this forum who have been studying 9/11 for six or more years.  </p>

<p>So, if you like getting your hat and ass handed to you, stick around.  We&#39;ll have fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bookmarked.  Good stuff.  Have you posted to Loosechange?  I haven&#39;t been back in quite a while. </p>

<p>My bride is almost apolitical, and I was driving her crazy.  And, I had enough data for my own consumption, and none of the people I associated with rated more than &quot;sheeple&quot;.  Even old and dear friends would start to glaze over, so I stopped talking about it. </p>

<p>My sense is that we need to work up to a big deal on the tenth anniversary.  We have the proof, we have the data, the videos, the eyewitness accounts.</p>

<p>The disinfo has been, largely, ineffective, because the real thing is so powerful.  Things follow in sequence.  All that is missing are the names and faces.  It would be nice to know motive, but I don&#39;t expect to get that lucky.  PNAC spelled it out.  Silverstein opened his fool mouth, Israeli operative went on tv and blabbed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all in the open, now.  But something I said years ago at L.C. still is true.  We are missing  a trained librarian, to catalog all the stuff.  There are stills, video, audio by the hundreds and thousands.  But  you know all this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>retiredgoat, you can go an about the physical evidence forever. What you have to realize is that the 911 commission was compromised; they didn&#39;t follow the money, for example. That&#39;s a cover up, you know it.</p>

<p>And if a plane exploded inside wtc7, you <em>might</em> have a point.  Lucifer is still a douche, lying doesn&#39;t work, and there will be no new world order.  Get over it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Um, what?  Seeing as you know nothing about me, or how I&#39;ve spent the last 8 years or so, you really should STFU about whether I&#39;m blind or think I&#39;m special.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about &quot;real issues&quot; we can.  That&#39;s <em>all</em> I do - I build distributed uncensorable news engines, alternative digital money systems, crowd-sourced credibility indexes... and occasionally I post a couple sentences on Reddit when I&#39;m not otherwise occupied.</p>

<p>WTC1&amp;2 were also controlled demolitions.  The explosives were placed during the power-downs in the months prior, and we have physical evidence and paper trail to prove it points straight back to the Bushes, et al.  We had it 5 years ago.  Do some real research.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;re new to this effort, and shot your mouth off w/o knowing me.  I&#39;ve been in this game for a long time, and it is precisely because I <em>do</em> focus on the real issues that I am asked to take executive positions in various projects.</p>

<p>I am not your evidence monkey, providing links you can google just because you whine.</p>

<p>no one provides irrefutable evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No-one?  Seems to me you haven&#39;t gone looking too hard.  Simple mechanical engineering can show WTC1&amp;2 <em>had</em> to have been controlled demolitions.  The amount of energy (kinetic and thermal) supplied by the planes is <em>many orders of magnitude</em> too small to produce the observed results.  Ergo: plenty of evidence for extra energy input, Q.E.D.</p>

<p>No need to act like an arrogant prick, it takes away from your points even more.</p>

<p>Get used to it.  You either get up to speed or I don&#39;t waste my time.  In 2003 I would have patiently walked you through all my evidence.  It is 2010 - you&#39;ve had 8 frikken years to research this and you haven&#39;t.  When it comes to being an &quot;arrogant prick&quot;, going 8 years without researching and <em>still</em> shooting off your mouth easily beats my &quot;stfu noob&quot;.  </p>

<p>So why can&#39;t you,</p>

<p>I did.  See the part where I said &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; above?  That&#39;s all the proof anyone needs to know your claim was false.  You would need hundreds if not thousands of fully loaded planes to provide the energy needed for <em>your claim</em>.  All I need to show to refute it is to cite the discrepancy, which is available for anyone with enough braincells and fingers to google it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fire</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cited the thermal energy too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you only know one side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve researched <em>every</em> side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which you have not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pal, go back in time 8 years and say this to me and you might be right.  In 2010 you&#39;re just talking out your ass to someone who&#39;s written hundreds of pages of original research.</p>

<p>Save it for someone who cares what you think.  In a few short posts you&#39;ve <em>unequivocally proven</em> you are wasting my time.  Bye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I forget which tower is which, but one collapse shows the upper portion of the tower tilting before the building obliterates itself.</p>

<p>One would expect this tilted part to fall:</p>

<p>a) Over the side of the building
b) faster than the collapse of the building.</p>

<p>Neither of these things occur. Rebut?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d have to see the video.</p>

<p>But a) yes
b) depends: yes if it actually tilts to the side so the tip is falling @ gravity, while the base of the tilt falls @ less than gravity (collapsing building). No if it&#39;s just tilted a little bit and tip &amp; base fall @ same speed.</p>

<p>But gimme video so I can be more accurate.</p>

<p>And if it was tilted &#39;alot&#39;, there is bugger all more (controlled) explosions can do to stop it.</p>
