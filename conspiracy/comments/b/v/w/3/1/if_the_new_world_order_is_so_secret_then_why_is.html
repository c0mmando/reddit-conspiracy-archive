    <div class="md"><p>Indeed.. except maybe the 9/11 part. All indicators point to the elites seeing us as morons. Look at every time a bin laden &quot;message&quot; comes out, how obviously fake it is, or turn on the news for a healthy dose of scandalous bullshit or fear-laden lead-in stories. Somebody thinks we&#39;re awfully stupid, alright. 9/11, though, looks like a false flag attack to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a big factor is disinformation. Since many people are catching on especially people who are less versed in the complexities of it, they are embracing the publicity so they can use it to their advantage by misdirecting us or our attention. There are layers, upon layers involved in the vast network of elite groups and conspiracies for mass control. Even when we think we&#39;re too the bottom of a conspiracy, we&#39;re often not even in the basement yet. Desensitization is another part of it as well.</p>

<p>Oh not to mention, for those who believe the apocalypse is nigh (which many elite do), remember that apocalypse means &quot;the revealing&quot;. It has always been their plan to reveal themselves to the masses as the final stage of their plan. They are so greedy and small-minded, it makes sense they can&#39;t resist revealing their control to the masses as if it&#39;s some kind of ego boost to them, that they are all powerful. But they will fail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought of that before. The &#39;plot to take over the world&#39; theme is common, but the plot is always retarded and easy to overthrow and they WOULD want us to think that good always wins. But these elite, they may be intelligent (in a sense), wealthy and &#39;powerful&#39; but they are small-minded. Real power requires the lightest touch, and they are lumbering and clumsy. The closer they get to the endgame, the sloppier they will get. Tried and true methods are losing their power of the masses as we develop our discernment and see through their ploys. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years.  It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supernational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries</p>

<p>-- David Rockefeller, at a meeting of the Trilateral Commission (June 1991); as quoted in Matrix of Power: How the World Has Been Controlled by Powerful Men Without Your Knowledge (2000) by Jordan Maxwell pp. 15-16. <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Rockefeller">source?</a></p>

<p>In <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3704527408635856046#">this video</a> David Rockefeller denies (equivocates on?) making the statement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are advocating something very different than what the conspiracy theorists claim.</p>

<p>When politicians talk about the NWO they are talking about global governance, strengthened international law, cooperation and peace.</p>

<p>When you see it talked about on youtube with scary music and masonic imagery, the claim is that it is all a jewish plan to enslave the population in a global dictatorship.</p>

<p>The truth? Probably the former with the elites profiting off the change in the global order. Same as they do at the national level, regional level and municipal level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not impossible that there are those looking to take over the world, it&#39;s every evil genius&#39;s plan.</p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t think your definition of &#39;global governance&#39; is the same as is found in international relations and international law text books.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good idea as a concerned citizen to always keep an eye on the elites but to slow progress out of fear is likely a mistake we would be loathe to make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you may be confusing &quot;talking about it&quot; with &quot;having input on the matter&quot;.</p>

<p>So far, Obama hasn&#39;t made a &quot;new world order&quot; statement, but all of his predecessors back to (and including) Reagan have. &quot;They&quot; (whoever &quot;they&quot; are) are no longer interested in being secretive about the existence of the intent/concept. This, however, goes directly to hubris - you&#39;re free to &quot;talk about it&quot; all you want, but you still don&#39;t get any input into the matter - this is a &quot;done deal&quot; as far as &quot;they&quot; are concerned.</p>

<p>EDIT: &quot;Characterizing it&quot; is the more controversial discussion ground. The &quot;Info War&quot;, so to speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the problem is that the MSM has loaded up the words &quot;new world order&quot; so it means something other than what it should. it should mean the global sovereignty of business and the complete corruption present in the monetary systems of the world, not some invisible government similar to the UN. it&#39;s a <em>real thing</em> that has been so mocked and abused by people working for it <em>and</em> against it that the idea has become ludicrous on its surface and ludicrous in its presentation to the masses vis-a-vis the mainstream media. in other words, it is another important idea that affects us greatly which has been marginalized by misinformation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Control and manipulation have been going on for a long long time. Wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few at the top. The internet has revealed a great deal of information. Still I wouldn&#39;t say knowlege of the NWO is widespread. And many that have heard of it still don&#39;t really understand the extent of the control. Those who speak of it are ridiculed and marginalized by being called conspiracy theorists, like it&#39;s a mental illness. Even here at Reddit those who speak of conspiracy are compared to tin foil hat people. It looks like business as usual for the NWO. The USA attack dog is still fighting wars in the Middle East and planning new ones. No one from the Bush administration will ever face prosecution. No one dares call Israel on it&#39;s nuclear program. Monsanto continues to push GMO crops and seeds. We still have fluoride in our water and very few people understand the problem. No one seems to understand the history of the CIA intervening in foreign affairs. CIA and MKUltra mind control program. Media propaganda. Most people believe the official story on 911. Very few people understand the role the Federal Reserve plays in our economy. Cannabis is still illegal. </p>

<p>No wonder they are arrogant and think we are morons. But there is hope, the game isn&#39;t over yet. I still believe we can be free. Continue to seek the truth and see through the lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a massive restructuring of society and global financial  situation going on.    At the G8 summit last, did anyone notice medevev hold a new coin in his hand?   There have always been machinations within global politics.  It is nothing new.  It has always been this way.   The trouble is that although we seemingly have a wealth of access to information, there is little cohesion.    We have never before had so much access to information yet never before had such a vague picture of who is really making the decisions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you&#39;re expressing skepticism, good on you. Certainly the phrase being spoken by presidents has something to do with it. I don&#39;t subscribe to the alex jones version, but the phrase has connotations worth considering. It is a non-hippy way of calling for world peace; the promise is a world without war, the irony that it is to be delivered by capitalist powers who use war and any other means necessary to gain profit. Peace in that context can only be a means for delivering further profit, and can&#39;t be an end in itself. Of course, the word order implies control, and is delivered by the warmasters, so the phrase is bullying - it doesn&#39;t imply anything positive beyond a lack of chaos, so it kind of says &quot;it&#39;ll be our order, on our terms&quot;. The term also freaks people out, both on the right and left, and so encourages a level of mania in political discussion that could otherwise be more concerned with making practical advances, one step at a time. As for the rest of the mythology, whatever - we already have in today&#39;s capitalism an appalling level of subjugation, there is to me no need to &quot;borrow trouble&quot; with prophecy of worse to come. </p>

If everyone were talking about it, then it would be on the headline of every news channel cause nothing is more salacious and tasty than a good conspiracy theory.
