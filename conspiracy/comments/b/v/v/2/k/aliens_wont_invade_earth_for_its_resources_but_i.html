       You missed the point. It's about desensitization (for what it's worth, the 1980's version sucked just as bad - but, as I said, it's not about that ... it's about desensitization) .... desensitization to the idea of being dominated.

       Two ways -

      <p>
       1) Those who
       <em>
        do

       watch it "aren't surprised" when they discover it in real life (or when they discover it's an analogy for things happening in real life).

       "In our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps we need some outside, universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world. And yet, I ask you, is not an alien force already among us?"

This is especially true if they were told that there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all people of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown.

       I would like to know what Gary mckinnon discovered.  He is about to be extradited to America from Britain.   Whatever he came across in his adventures/quest to discover the real data, the Americans must be pretty worried about it.    Is America aware of Gary mckinnons case?     In Britain, we are campaigning for his trial to take place in this country.

       You people are all against a New World Order, eh?...  Let's see what exactly you are against:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Environmentalism - the reason why everyone on Earth screws the environment is because there isn't an over-arching law.  Each country/jurisdiction has their own rules.  If people in Australia are forced to recycle and use renewable energy - that puts them at a distinct disadvantate to the Vietnamese (who don't have suce restrictions).  So, there's no impetus to change.
       </li>
       <li>
        Freedom.  Criminal governments (like you have in virtually all of the 3rd world) can't exist in a NWO world.  Keeping the world as it is means more Hitlers, and Stalins, and Pol Pots, and Kim Jong Ils and Saddam Husseins...
       </li>
       <li>
        Cleaning up the criminal underworld.  The world's major gangs and drug cartels are run with impugnity - because there's no true government that can go after them.
       </li>
       <li>
        If you are against the New World Order - you are siding with the terrorists!  The last thing they want is a government that doesn't protect them!...
       </li>
       <li>
        You are fighting to keep all the different currencies of the world (instead of everyone on Earth just using the dollar).  So, whenever you get screwed at the foreign exchange -  thank your Non-NWO-Government.  You are, basically, adding a stupid tax onto every company's exports (and imports).
       </li>
       <li>
        You are for the race to strip the world of it's resources.  Because, right now, it's a free for all.  Every country is racing to burn all the oil on Earth - because they know that if they don't, somebody else will.  You can't stop this with 200+ governments on the planet - you could with a one world government...
       </li>
       <li>
        You are for the rich countries dominating the smaller countries.  In a one world government (assuming proper representation in that government), you couldn't have the rich steam-roll the poor (like today), because the vast majority of the world is poor...
       </li>
       <li>
        The list goes on and on...  All the major problems the world faces today can be made WAY BETTER with a one world government (assuming the uber-rich don't get complete control of it, which could very easily happen).
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ol>

       Not one of those items describes a certainty resulting from the absence of a NWO... especially the NWO which is presently being forced upon the human species.

       Even if you outlined every aspect of the NWO, why you're creating it, what you hope to acoomplish, and the steps you'd need to go through, people would still oppose it.  So even if it's better for everyone, many people won't see it as such (you ever try telling someone what to do, even if you're right? not pretty in most cases.)  People would, basically, be turning their backs to paradise because of... I don't even know what.  Freedom?  Religion?  Culture?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if it was 100% better for everyone, and forced, how would you feel about it?

       The definition of 'liberty' precludes 'forced' anything; thus, the magical hypothetical 'forced 100% improvement to paradise' crap is invalid on its face.

       No, a military state created and controlled by a corrupt aristocracy which fabricates war, pestilence and death as a means of population control would definitely not be better than a world where people who do wrong (including the aforementioned aristocracy) are held accountable for their wrongdoing.

       because what you're "abstractly" positing is the oppression of the human spirit (*a hostile act, by definition). What reaction do you, honestly, expect in response? "That's fine as long as I can play farmville." ???

        Change here needs to happen on the local level, not the global. I'm pretty sure most, if not all, people here like clean drinking water and fresh air.

        All governments are criminal. The same people who are creating the NWO are the same people who created, enabled, and financed the Hitlers, Stalins, Pol Pots and Saddams. To think this would stop under a NWO is laughable; likely it would increase 10 fold.
       </li>
       <li>
        See above. The criminal underworld is run and financed by the same governments run by the NWO proponents.

       <li>
        Laughable.

        Epic econ-101 failure. Please refer to von Mises.
       </li>
       <li>
        Why not use up all the resources on Earth? So the deer and the eagle can have some to use later on when they develop technology? Seriously, get a grip. Responsible consumption is key here - something that the NWO would not bring.
       </li>
       <li>
        Why shouldn't resourceful countries have a leg-up on smaller, podunk countries? You think this would change under a world government? We already have the IMF - and look at how that's working so far. Extrapolate.
       </li>
       <li>
        No, all the major problems of the world today can be made WAY BETTER by rich assholes in government getting the fuck out of our lives and letting us live, i.e. the people who CAUSE ALL THE PROBLEMS are the ones pushing for "Global Governance." More government never, ever solved anything. History bears truth.
