       It does sound great on the outset, the whole world living together in peace and harmony but there are some huge hurdles.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The right to travel, live and work anywhere would be catastrophic for some areas. Imagine most of sub-Sahara moving to Europe or millions suddenly appearing in California  - all looking for the good life. Areas totally emptied and others overflowing with new immigrants with no infra-structure to support it. I think it would be total chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       • A democratically elected assembly would still have the problems of corporate sponsorship and control. It would be a huge power grab for anyone who could finance the candidates and the only people who could finance them would be strapping rich multi-nationals.
It is also hard enough to get consensus on a law in one country, let alone the world. Imagine trying to get health-care for the world or everyone agreeing on abortion laws! The system would be paralyzed at the best of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The Court sounds great. Whos’ laws do we live by? Sweden’s open and fair system or Chinas “bullet to the head” for so many crimes? A world wide system would ensure that anyone who can any law passed will have reams more power. Imagine a world where the Muslim population gets a law passed about everyone having to never drink again. Or what if many, many people wanted enforced debt-servitude to pay off debts? – instant slave population with nowhere to run to!
      </p>
      <p>
       • There would be no end to corporate rule as they would be the only institutions with the financing to pass laws, elect people to power, enforce the ‘laws” and monitor how everything is going.
      </p>
      <p>
       • You think there is genocide now? Wait until there are no more borders and people to guard them. Tribal and religious wars would kill millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Universally enforced human rights... sure good idea. Who makes the laws there and what if you disagree with the law, where can you go? Think off all the immigrants who vote with their feet to make a better life and if you cannot move anywhere else – how can you be free?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention labour and health laws, health standards and not even a word about different religious and cultural attitudes being in the mix...
      </p>
      <p>
       No, maybe someday we can all live in peace but right now... I don't think so. Countries do guard people against a lot of evil.

       I agree about living standards, Western standards are coming down as Eastern standards rise. Rather than Western standards going higher they seem to be going down to find an equilibrium with the Eastern standards on the way up. Well this is always a positive for the Eastern standard the same can't be said for the West.

       Ideally: A world council akin to the greek democracy and councils would be amazing
      </p>
      <p>
       Realistically: The most corrupt thing ever thought of. It would have to be largely decentralized to prevent dissent in the far-reaching areas or anywhere where its' influence was not strong. It would most likely work out in an Orwellian Nightmare.

       How is world government absolute power? A world government could be strong and it could be weak. I could make an argument that the UN/World Court is a world government with no enforcement power at all. Suppose there were some governing body that dealt with trade. It might have lots of power in that area and nothing in any other areas.

       My point being, creating a one state "world" leaves us open to corruption within that state.  Lets say for example, "they" suddenly decide to create a mandatory micro chipping law, there would be no "shadow council" to argue against the motion.  Plus personally, if I have to be ruled over, I would prefer it to be someone in my country, rather than some black suited minion who knows nothing about the intricacies of my country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, in the future, when humans are more evolved consciously a one world state would be the correct way to go, but now, as current day shows you rather than having a state's sole motivation to work for the people, all it does is crave survival and more power.

       You are making unwarranted assumptions about how that government would work and what it would do. We could consider the WTO a world government, but it just deals with trade. Or the UN to be an utterly ineffectual world government.

       I do hear what you are saying, but how many times through history have "governments" in some shape or form hurt the populous?  I know I'm cynical and yeah I maybe am making assumptions but not they aren't unwarranted
      </p>
      <p>
       Man is still fallible, and you want to essentially give them more power?  I know I might be arguing off in a tangent but at the end of the day, if you mean a "one world government" it must have a certain amount of power over the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you're right, but I just can't see it happening without a myriad of moral/religious/corruption problems.  When I see any situation where power ( in whatever area/form ) is focused on fewer people it just makes me worry.

       I don't grasp the question or the relevance. I am not saying government is perfect. From my POV the issue is one what level should problems be deal with. Trade between countries clearly needs to be handled above the national level. Having a world organization that deal with that makes sense to me. Pollution/warming makes sense to deal with globally. Eduction, not so much.

       Where did I say that? The question, again, is where to deal with the issue best. Traffic laws are local kinds of things, global warming is a global issue.

       And "a certain amount" could mean anything from 0 (the current UN) to an attempt at global dictatorship.

       This is exactly what I'm talking about: not an Orwellian superstate, but a reformed UN/ICJ capable of performing it's original purpose: preventing conflict between states and protecting human rights (as well as dealing with issues of global import, like climate change, international trade, etc.) The closest existing analogy I can think of would be something along the lines of the European Union, but with membership open to (not required of) all states.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see why such a system would be inherently more corrupt than what we have now, which I think we would all agree is completely bolloxed (and for many of the reasons the reforms I suggest are intended to address).

       The problem with a world government is it most likely won't end up being the government you want it to be. Now you at least have some freedom to move to a country that more fits your views. Nearly everything you mentioned sounds great, except in general governments over time obtain more and more power and control.

       World government is probably inevitable.  The problem is that what is being forced on us is not the natural course of getting there but something inorganic.  The DANGER of world government, especially one forced upon us rather than growing of it's own accord, is that it will have power which will be unassailable if and when it gets out of control.

       I may get voted down for saying this, but I believe that the last quality a "world government" - as in anything with more power than the UN - is likely to have, at least at the outset, is "democracy".  The concept is foreign to much of the world and ritually abused in the rest.  I think a "global" government is inevitable, if not by design then by economic convenience.  And it will be run most likely by fiat than by popular opinion, as that is the simplest way to get anything done.
      </p>
      <p>
       One circumstance that I think is highly likely to spawn a global government would be the event of a limited nuclear or other WMD exchange (ie, some mess goes down between China and Russia or India and Pakistan or Israel and Iran, or Kim Jong-Il decides that he is the one prophesied to come and end the world).  After the dust settles there may be a push to give something like the UN Peacekeepers actual teeth and some form of executive authority.  In American domestic history, this is not a very large leap, as we see executive power being hoarded in the wake of turmoil and disaster.

       yes it is a bad thing. Because when the boss is in power you don't like because of the slavery and/or ethnic cleansing, you have no where else to go as it'd be planet wide.

       Well with a direct democratic system we would all be under Chinese rule.
The second a Chinese national tries to make laws for me I'm going to kill that person a lot.( * exception made for Chinese gf) I'm sure that Israel would be very accepting of Arab rule. Armenians I'm sure would love to be ruled by a Turk..etc..etc.
Pretty much the rest of the world would rather die than be under US rule.
It would have to be a council style thing like the UN ..and nothing gets done.  World politics being what they are no one cares what we think.(at least Reddit still loves us) Personally I don't think we can avoid some form of world government, I think we're going to get it shoved up our ass. I think fighting it at this point is a lost battle. The real fight right now is to co-opt the world government so that it actually serves the best interest of the people rather than just the unproductive rich "elite".

       Sounds good to me.

      <p>
       The most contentious idea is the 'right to travel, live and work' idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       The major repercussion of this would be that we would have to strive to make every part of the world as attractive as the developed world so we could spread out the population. At present, and it has already been mentioned, the developed world would quickly be overrun and the social welfare systems would collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how about an organization that would address climate change and environmental degradation?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the international legal order had enforceable laws, it would be a pretty good system, alas, it does not, and therefore is not. My recommendation is to tie the sanctioning power of the WTO to the current form of moralsuasion to bring compliance to the system. Only rogue states would work outside the system and they would be better marginalized by a centralized global government.

       I think that if it we're democratically run it would be an excellent idea. The problem I have now is that the elites idea of a world government reminds a protest slogan I once saw spraypainted on a wall:
       <em>
        10,000 pharaohs, 6,000,000,000 slaves
       </em>
       , the kind of world government that you get with secrecy and a security council. Although I agree with the U.N charter and many of the programs the UN runs (WHO) etc  I cannot agree with the current makeup of the U.N or it's function. Also, how come we can't vote for our U.N ambassador? If this is supposed to be our "world government" then it's an unelected one that does not serve the at the consent of the governed.

       Think about it.  If an alien race came here to see us silly humans, they would not see us as separate, warring tribes.  They would see us as a species.  And even if we can't maintain one giant culture, let each culture itself split off and go populate a planet.

       I don't know if I'd go so far as countless millions, as human growth is exponential, and once we do something it becomes easier and the impossible becomes possible, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I agree, interstellar rather than intergalactic.  But since we do not have any travel lucrative enough for either, I'll be naive enough to say that once we have travel fast enough for quick interstellar travel, intergalactic is just another step.

       I fully understand the argument that as we expand, our colonies will themselves expand, and we can in theory exponentially colonize the galaxy. But when you're talking about 100 billion stars or more, each with their own system of planets to be studied and explored, assuming that a colony wouldn't just spend a week in a star system and move on, I think millions of years is not unrealistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sincerely think that intergalactic travel will not happen unless we learn something drastically new about physics (which we undoubtedly will) that allows us to break the speed of light. Otherwise, I couldn't see it even being attempted for literally millions of years. There is just no reason to do so. I think you might have slightly unrealistic views regarding the number of interesting objects in our galaxy, the distances separating them, and the distances separating even nearby galaxies.

       There are things that should be discussed at a global level, a few perhaps decided at that level. Trade and pollution for example. There are things that should be dealt with at a regional level, some at a national level, some local, some family, some personal.

       The problem with world government is that we'd be subject to the tyranny of the majority, or else a dictatorship.

       You are correct... assuming that all other nationalities are pig-headed enough not to come up with some method of preventing this (coalition government, one nation one vote, council rule, etc. etc. etc.).  The Chinese make up a little over 1/6 the world's population; there's no reason the other 5/6
       <strong>
        have
       </strong>
       to work independently based on state borders (many of which are inventions of Western colonization programs).  However, see my other comment in this thread; I seriously doubt we'll have to worry about such occurrences where a world government is concerned.

       That's the world government that is being setup, not the utopian society they want us to think is being setup. They just say what we want to hear.

       Part of the issue with the larger countries that have existed in heavily-populated areas throughout history is that their cultures are so diverse in the extreme that the universal laws governing all of those areas creates disparities which lead to hatred and revolt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take for example the Serbian majority in Milosevic's Yugoslavia leading to the violent Yugoslav wars which separated the country into 7 countries, or the current situation in Sudan, where al-Bashir's government has increased racial tension and genocidal acts, which may ultimately culminate in the sovereignty of southern Sudan after a referdum in 2011. I'm sure there are plenty of other examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       If majority rules, what about the minority?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: As calzenn stated, maybe some day we can all live in peace but its not today. I do believe that a universal "nationality" is an extremely valuable benefit of a world-unified government and that separation by state reinforces the idea that we are all fundamentally different, but modern society is not nearly advanced enough yet to take on that vast of a project. Many would argue they can't even get a European Union to work economically?
