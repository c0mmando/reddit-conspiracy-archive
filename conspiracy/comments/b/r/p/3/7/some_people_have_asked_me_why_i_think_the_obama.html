        Marcy Wheeler notes what is probably the worst part of all of this, something I consider truly despicable:  the administration is also threatening to veto the bill because it contains funding for a new investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks, on the ground that such an investigation -- in the administration's words -- "would undermine public confidence" in the FBI probe of the attacks "and unfairly cast doubt on its conclusions."

       <p>
        In other words, beyond even the outrageously broad "state secrets" privilege invented by the Bush administration and now embraced fully by the Obama administration, the Obama DOJ has now invented a brand new claim of government immunity, one which literally asserts that the U.S. Government is free to intercept all of your communications (calls, emails and the like) and -- even if what they're doing is blatantly illegal and they know it's illegal -- you are barred from suing them unless they "willfully disclose" to the public what they have learned.

       <p>
        According to Obama, only the President has the power to decide what is done with classified information, and neither courts nor Congress have any power at all to do anything but politely request that the President change his mind.  Therefore, the President has the unilateral, unchallengeable power to prevent any judicial challenges to his actions by simply declaring that the relevant evidence is a secret and refusing to turn it over to a court, even if ordered to do so.  That's the argument which the Obama DOJ is now aggressively advancing -- all in order to block any judicial adjudication of Bush's now-dormant NSA program.

That's what "preventive" means:  imprisoning people because the Government claims they are likely to engage in violent acts in the future because they are alleged to be "combatants."

        President Barack Obama on Monday proposed another two years of hefty spending in Iraq and Afghanistan, seeking Congress' approval for about $160 billion this year and again in fiscal 2011 to pay war costs.

       Well done. Obama's decline from saviour to just another cog in the machine began with his staff appointments and secretarial positions. You've hit on several points that that I either missed or disregarded at the time. Thanks for the reminders.

       Things like this usually don't go too well in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       .  Usually, if you want something to float to the top there, it has to be about either the same old media sock-puppets / scape-goats (Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin, etc), labeling the tea-party "racists"/ignorant/etc yet again, or praising Obama for saying something nice.  That pretty much sums up

       This is one of the best run downs on Obama I've seen.  I would also add to this massive list Obama's reassignment of Ben Bernanke to the Federal Reserve after he over watched the collapse of 08.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing we always have to be cautious about is our tendency to use the noun "Obama" too frequently.  Most of us know he's a puppet PR guy, so sometimes it's good to imply that he is simply doing what he's told to do when it comes to his policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama's approval rating index is -12 right now.

       I expect this to continue to decline, since The Obama Administration received a slight bump recently because of the passing of the health care bill.  One of the primary goals of the Obama Administration is to postpone the financial collapse to his second term, and hope the continuous decline is pushed back so the Obama Administration can be reelected.

       Very true.  It's a difficult balancing act because while we don't want to scape-goat the puppet and hence help misdirect ourselves into focusing on the wrong problems, at the same time we have to keep in mind that many people really are already focusing their love on the puppet.  I think that has to be broken through first before you slip in the whole "two heads of one party" idea and going further down the rabbit hole with notions of TPTB and whatnot.  Otherwise, you'll be dismissed as a "conspiracy theorist", unfortunately.

       What's interesting to me is how rampant this attitude was during the Bush years. Bush was and is the great political sin-eater. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, Dem lapdogs are rehashing all the same whiny, blind faith defenses for their fearless leader that Bush followers used -- particularly when you point out any of Obama's similarities to his predecessor. "Give him time, he knows what he's doing," "Stop 'bashing,'" etc. I had one even tell me that if I didn't like Obama, I should leave the country. Love it or leave it, baby!

       I agree.  Dems were quite quick to assume that Bush was not the "commander guy" as he had called himself, and they were correct.  With Obama, there's just as little agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also considered racist by many to criticize Obama.  That's how far gone our politics are in this country.

       Good observation.  My mom is one of the most conditioned &amp; brainwashed people on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       She lives right outside Washington DC and she is a public high school teacher.   Shes been doing this for about 25 years.  She doesnt even believe that CNN or MSNBC "lies" at all and anytime someone tries to challenge the notion that what she teaches in school is not 100% correct, she flips out and shuns you, literally.

       Any claim of pure "objectivity" is just a pretense.  Everything from selection of material (even whether or not it is discussed at all) to the interpretation all involves subjectivity.

       Hey, it's great you want to account for Obama's sinister underbelly; I'm all for speaking out against the blindness of our public, or of our Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some problems with your post.  One is tooting your own horn "This will be rather epic" -- don't turn people off to your ideas before you even get a chance to lay it out.  "and probably a wasted effort" -- omg, do you really need a safety net to say what you're going to say?  Do you really need to establish that you're better than everyone else before spending a couple hours putting links together?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another is absolute equivalence.  No matter how many things you find similar about the two administrations, Bush was Bush-league in the incompetence game.  There are differences, and even if Bush and Obama administrations are right next to each other in the bigger political spectrum, those small differences can't be taken lightly if you want people to listen to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to say, "Sure Bush made XYZ mistakes, but Obama is making VYZ mistakes" -- you need to highlight the smallness of the differences, then, if you want to make a point about how similar they are.  Acknowledge the difference and then show the overlap.  The overlap isn't total, so stop using such a wide brush!
      </p>
      <p>
       And, I'm sorry, but the small differences at this scale make for huge differences in consequences.  How much more impacting it would be if there were more substantial differences, but to call them the same is to look from a prioritized perspective, not an objective one.  You compare using sweeping categorical statements.  And certainly those categories are damning to the Obama administration from a peace &amp; justice perspective.  All I'm imploring you to do is bridge the gap.  "Sure the Bush policy was a little bit worse in this way, but Obama's policy is so much worse in this other way‚Ä¶"
      </p>
      <p>
       So, sure, go ahead and make your point, but you could make it so much better!  All you've done is list a bunch of stuff.  Hopefully the blind among us will read your list and reconsider their allegiances.   Meanwhile, this isn't a post that truly compares the two;  this is a post that attacks the one.

       I'm a full time computer programmer who typically works 60-80 hour weeks. Not a journalist. It sounds like you're asking me to do Glenn Greenwald type of work.  I'll gladly point to it, which is what I have done.

       Yes- and people can do the intellectual legwork for themselves and dig further.  I'm just pointing out what I've found.

       I see what you're saying, but there is an implicit assumption in the post that those who'd care are already quite familiar with the abuses of the Bush administration.  Again, I can only do so much on my own, in a Reddit post that's already very very lengthy.

       Everything is well addressed.  Kudos, then.

       As is often the case, we each are responding to the impression of an entire movement.  My mistakes in responding to you are where I took you as representative of others who truly minimize the differences.  Here I see you are focusing where you should focus, on current happenings.

       Thanks for taking the time to put this together (and in advance if you continue to update).  And for you consideration.

       A president has to do what he or she can thru the congress of the time, which is a quid pro quo circle jerk of ridiculous proportions. Change happens over decades. Anti-choice voters waited from Reagan to Bush 2 just to get late term abortion outlawed. True progressives won't see much policy they even halfway agree with until 5 of 7 election cycles have gone blue. Of course, the US could go the way of Britain's Labor and Tory parties, which seems likely given the batshit crazy Palin Beck Limbaugh RNC of today; it will take great effort, organizing, public consciousness raising, public lobbying to drag the lefty party back left

       I think Obama is a captive of anti American forces such as Israel and that the same insane mind was in control of both presidents . Hopefully the former president was a more willing slave.
