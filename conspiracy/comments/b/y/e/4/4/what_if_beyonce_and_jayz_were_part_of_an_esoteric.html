        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>EDIT</em>:  I need to emphasize this: This post is for entertainment purposes.</p>

<p><a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/?p=604">Here&#39;s</a> a link breaking down her creation of Sasha Fierce and the video &#39;Crazy in Love&#39;.  I never noticed that Jay-Z blew up a car with Beyonce inside before.  A lot deeper symbolism than I would have thought from a hip-hop video regardless of the conspiracy.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/xmvJi.jpg">This</a> is a breakdown of the choreography in &quot;Single Ladies&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.fixyourmix.com/2009/single-ladies-by-beyonce-a-compositional-analysis/">This article</a> was pointed out by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/thehappypianoman">thehappypianoman</a> to me yesterday.  It&#39;s a compositional analysis of the actual song.</p>

<p>I forced myself to believe it while I did some research <em>purely for entertainment</em>.  It&#39;s  pretty interesting, considered most of my research were non-conspiracy articles.  The choreographers of &quot;Single Ladies&quot; say they were inspired by a 1969 performance by Gwen Verdon on <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em> entitled &quot;Mexican Breakfast&quot;.(wtf?)  I always thought the whole Sasha Fierce alter-ego creation was strange and the fact this hot young talent married Jay-Z.  He&#39;d be lucky to get a groupie that hot.</p>

<p>EDIT2:  Beyonce has an album titled &quot;Green Light Freemasons&quot; remixed by the Freemasons.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  For now, I&#39;m going to believe that Jay-Z wants to be in a cult.  If he finds enough like-minded people, he&#39;ll probably start his own.  And it&#39;d probably have nothing to do with enlightenment or science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it pretty easy to believe, especially considering how clearly influenced by Freemasons Jay-Z is. Just look at some of his clothes designs or lyrics. You shouldn&#39;t have to FORCE yourself to believe it just to do research.</p>

<p>Regarding this being for &quot;entertainment purposes&quot;, I will grant you that some people are entertained by these songs, and lots of people are entertained by the music without delving deeper into the symbolism, but I don&#39;t think you need to put the disclaimer. It&#39;s a perfectly legitimate thing to look into, and studying esoteric history/symbolism isn&#39;t particularly &quot;entertaining&quot; to most people.</p>

<p>Really?  I love this stuff, and that&#39;s what I meant with my disclaimer.  Now, specifically what about Jay-Z&#39;s clothing designs point to the Masons?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They try to infiltrate all religions, but I do not think they &quot;are&quot; them. Saying that is like saying that all followers of those religions are complicit in this conspiracy. Most religions are just common sense wrapped up in some mysticism after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a comment a few days ago interpreting The Gorillaz and showing it related to the Esoteric view of the universe. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/bwjs7/7_gorillaz_plastic_beach_is_fucking_amazing/c0oxywf">Permalink</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>What I like the most is the symbolism behind the music that relates to the esoteric view of the universe - Belief that the universe is in Gods head and we were once one with the mind of God and spiritual beings but then we decided to think for ourselves which started the slow process of materialization and the devil is here to keep us caught in materialization, hell falls on 2012 in the changing of times when the spiritual world meets the materialistic world. Like Buddhism it is believed that you can escape the material world by not being materialistic and meditating.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyHNuVaZJ-k">Feel Good Inc</a> - Look at the video you have Murloc ( an allusion to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch">Murdoc</a> the God of materialism and greed - also notice the upside down cross ) on the stage with woman entertaining everyone as 2D is sad because he is stuck in the material world kept back by steel bars and gravity. You then see Noodle (who is enlightened) on a piece of land moving through the sky powered by a windmill moving freely expressing her freedom from the materialistic world. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V_xRb0x9aw">Clint Eastwood</a> - This is a song about the merging of the spiritual and materialistic world and the horrors of hell on Earth and to not be afraid, if you notice Noodle the enlightened one is not afraid of them. Thriller is also about this and refers to 2012 as the midnight hour.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I have a different beliefs that people don&#39;t seem to understand. I guess I am crazy and think too much into music. But one things for sure I&#39;m not alone in my belief that the Devil is on earth in the form of the illuminati to grip us with materialism just listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mnyBp4FzzI">D&#39;Evils by Jay- Z</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a number of common symbols that have always appealed to mankind.  Often, what is considered &quot;occult&quot; are just symbols that were popular before Christianity.  It&#39;s no surprise that many basic symbols like the eye, wings, or a triangle are still popular among artists today.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fun to speculate about some greater conspiracy, but the real bad guys committing dark acts behind the scenes simply aren&#39;t like The Riddler from Batman.  You&#39;re not going to see the men who killed JFK putting in veiled messages.</p>

<p>I was figuring that most Christians view any cult, paganism, atheism, etc. to be Satanism, and it was mostly Christians who wrote the conspiracy articles linking them.</p>

<p>Well yeah, Satanism and Luciferianism, are 2 sides of the same coin. It&#39;s really just a different name for the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re actually quite different.  Satanism isn&#39;t really a religion at all, it&#39;s basically just a bunch of nihilistic hedonists having fun for fun&#39;s sake, and using the format of Christian religious rituals to exalt their own values.</p>

<p>Luciferianism is essentially a Gnostic religion, that exalts Lucifer as the liberator and sharer of knowledge, (Lucifer literally means &quot;light-bearer&quot;) as they believe he was the serpent who freed us from the tyranny of the Creator god by convincing us to eat the fruit of knowledge.</p>

<p>TL,DR version:  Satanists are gothy hipsters, Luciferians are compassionate iconoclasts.</p>
