    <div class="md"><p>the really fucked up thing is that, given that we know that a bunch of cavemen couldn&#39;t have pulled it off alone, and given that so many Americans died, the ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION is that there is a cabal of ultrarich people controlling AT LEAST both the American government (at the very least, the FBI/CIA/etc) and the government or entity which pulled off the attack. and seemingly no politician has the balls to even ask for an explanation, let alone point any fingers.</p>

<p>personally, i think the fact that whoever did 9/11 got away with it and no one even cares is evidence that America is no longer worth saving and deserves to fall to shambles and smolder with puddles of toxic piss distributed throughout.</p>

<p>if people are so dumb and ignorant in a world so full of information and technology that they don&#39;t even care when you wipe out a large portion of them all at once... they are merely ants. and deserve to be enslaved or destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for truth, I want to know. But by the same token, the problem with revealing the truth is that when it does come out, America will go down as the world&#39;s worst villain since Nazi Germany. The average American had nothing to do with the event, but we will all be painted with the same evil brush. We will be alone on an island, with an angry world pointing all the anger and weapons in our direction. But at least we&#39;ll have the truth out in the open. </p>

<p>We&#39;re going to go down as <em>worse</em> than Nazi Germany. <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/propaganda/timeline/1939-1945/">According to this</a>, listening to &quot;foreign&quot; radio was punishable by prison or death. Later, there was only <em>one</em> German radio network, run by you-know-who.</p>

<p>USians have to <em>work hard</em> to ignore the blizzard of data available, and have no excuse for ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only one nation had the means, motive, opportunity and stable nation state intelligence required to take the U.S. to war in the Middle East while making it appear that Islam—not Israel—is the problem. When a long-deceived American public—especially the U.S. military—grasps the common source of this devastating duplicity, the response will shift the geopolitical landscape. The facts suggest that “sympathy for Israel” is not among the probable reactions. </p>
