<p>It&#39;s easy to see why a clever propaganda system would control not only the two side of your political system, but also a third that seems to challenge it. This is the category that I think people like jon stewart / alex jones / glen beck / david Ike etc...fall into.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like skeptic: &quot; yeah I&#39;ve heard of the illuminati. They are supposed to have been secretly running the world for centuries, using the masses as sheep, right?&quot; me: &quot;yeah exactly&quot; skeptic: &quot;So you really think they are lizard people from outerspace? How dumb are you?&quot; me: /facepalm</p>

<p>So, disinformation agents...do you think they are out there? And who?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t see the &quot;Paulist&quot; movement as being dangerous. Alex Jone&#39;s followers are probably much more dangerous, his mix of anger and charisma are great at getting people pissed off.</p>

<p>Ron Paul holds a PhD and a seat in the congress, he has taken a spot as the poster boy of American revolution, yet he is a creationist. I have trouble believing that he is able to hold those beliefs legitimately. </p>

<p>Further, he goes on TV and tells people: No healthcare is not a right, it&#39;s your own responsibility to ensure proper health care. He goes on to say that education is not a right either. </p>

<p>I like the idea of a small government that doesn&#39;t need anything, nor wants anything, but I don&#39;t feel it can serve the best interest of the people. I believe there are sectors in society that we should not allow to be profit driven. Health care, education, critical services, should not be given the choice between people and profit. Corporations are required by law to think of profit above all else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he is saying that government run schools are not right, which is true. if the schools were run in the private sector i garantee our kids would be smarter. </p>

<p>it is not that the government doesnt need or want anything either, its a government who is scared of the people not the people scared of the government. </p>

<p>I beleive that those sectors would be well maintained by people who dedicate there lives to what they do and to there families, not government beaurocrats who have a little say in everything. The corruption would be weeded out by the people involved in the industries. noones going to want to work with someone once they fuck up and people realized they were fucked over. but in our society corperations do fuck up and those people end up going free with the best lawyers around and noone can say theyve done something bad because the case wasnt found guilty etc. or these companies we are forced to work with because they have all the ties in the government preventing any other from competeing at all.</p>

<p>the government gives the big corporations the biggest proffit incentive of all. paying outstanding amounts of money if you can lobby your corp into a government contract for something the people of the company probably never intended on doing otherwise..
or create a mass flu scare to get that big vaccine checks from governments all over the world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems more and more likely that liberal websites, such as Reddit, have been successfully used to paint the tea party movement as a bunch of idiots fighting against their own self-interest, by concentrating on the tea-party movement&#39;s opposition to health care, which is a side issue, instead of supporting their understandable opposition to the bailout of the banking industry, which stinks to high heaven.</p>
