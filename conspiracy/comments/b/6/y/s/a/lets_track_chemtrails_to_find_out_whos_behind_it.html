        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is there a website that tracks chemtrails?</p>

<p>If not, let&#39;s build one. There are many plane spotters who would probably be happy to contribute (i.e. by uploading high-res pictures of planes with time, date, location, etc.).</p>

<p>Not all planes leave chemtrails behind. So my guess is they either spray only on certain routes, with certain airlines, or with fuel by certain fuel providers.</p>

<p>If there is a pattern, we could find it and narrow down the perpetrators.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 26 Feb 2010 23:16 UTC:</strong> I went ahead and registered <a href="http://chemtrailspotters.com">chemtrailspotters.com</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.patricksaviation.com/forums/?t=3118">Here is an example</a> of what is possible -- Close-up photos of airliners.</p>

<p>An idea I read somewhere else is to use chemtrail data and overlay it over a weather map. Should be interesting to see whether chemtrails actually cause cloudy skies as many allege.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome Idea. Around here it looks like it&#39;s mostly military jets leaving the chem trails.</p>

<p>My concern is what is being put in these chem trails. Once I get a spectroscope, I will tell you exactly what elements are in the trails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Screw the spectroscope, just put some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okB-489l6MI">jars in the bed of your truck</a> and call it definitive proof!</p>

<p>In all honesty I would love for someone to do a controlled test of a &quot;chemtrail,&quot; if only to see the mass denial of believers when it turns out to be mostly water vapor with some soot and burnt fuel.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So say we all. At least I would hope, And indeed I would hope your right. But you will notice a distinct lack of scientific analysis on this subject, despite the amount of pressure from civilians.</p>

<p>Indeed this fuels the conspiracy, But it seems to me a simple step in logic. If there is nothing to hide, why not placate us all, put our minds at ease with a few simple tests ?</p>

<p>The scientific method should be applied here, but no matter the demand, these tests are simply not done. </p>

<p><em>edit</em> Hope your right that it turns out to be water vapor and soot, not hope your right that people cannot accept their own mistakes. XD</p>

I feel less than convinced that it&#39;s actually a sinister thing, but a simple analysis of the possible consequences of someone actually spraying most of the globe with something not fit for breathing at least warrants a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>How about taking pictures of the planes spraying? There&#39;s an army of people out there with telescopes, can&#39;t they be used to take pictures of crimes in progress?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sir, Or madam, need to read up on the supposed difference between the two. </p>

<p>Where as contrails dissipate rapidly, and by a set rule of physical laws, Chemtrails can deviate by a wide margin, depending on the (purported) chemicals being sprayed.</p>

<p>This is where the distinction lies - the dissipation time.</p>

<p>I was going to be a dick about it, as I usually am, But when you use logical fallacies to divert the conversation it is irritating. So ill just try to explain myself instead.</p>

<p>The point I was criticizing you on was not the corporate capacity for such actions, but the physical nature of this phenomena which you questioned. </p>

<p>Before you go &#39;takatakataka&#39; on your keyboard, ensure the things you state are sound in reason, not that your last comment doesn&#39;t bring up points relevant to the greater issue, but it is indeed a diversion away from where you are incorrect. </p>

<p>And if you did the research as I suggested, most of the questions you just asked would&#39;ve been answered - by yourself, a most satisfying outcome, instead of being berated by myself - probably less than satisfying. </p>

<p>The only question you will have trouble answering is the last one - the logistics, as there are theories for this, but no evidence, and therefor nothing credible I can state. </p>

Many foreign governments have come out and admitted that they are spraying, including members of the American scientific community.

Please inform yourself instead of regurgitating the same information given to you by those who do not have your best interest at heart.
