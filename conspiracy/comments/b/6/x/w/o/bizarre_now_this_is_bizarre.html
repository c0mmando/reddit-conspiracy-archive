        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From this week&#39;s exchange between Ron Paul and Ben Bernanke:</p>

<p>Ron Paul: ...a lot of cash was passed through - and a lot of people suppose it was passed through the Federal Reserve - when there was a provisional government [in Iraq] after the 2003 invasion. That money was not appropriated by the Congress as required by law...</p>

<p>Ben Bernanke: Congressman, these specific allegations you&#39;ve made are absolutely bizarre, and I have no knowledge of anything remotely like what you just described.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s ask Henry Waxman (July 2009)</p>

<p>Henry Waxman: In a 13 month period from May 2003 to June 2004, the Federal Reserve sent nearly $12 billion in cash, mainly in $100 bills from the United States to Iraq. To do that, the Federal Reserve Bank in New York had to pack 281 million individual bills ... onto wooden pallets to be shipped to Iraq. The cash weighed more than 363 tons and was loaded onto C-130 cargo planes to be flown into Baghdad...                 </p>

<p>Bizarre? Yes, I think something very bizarre is going on.</p>

As far as I recall, outside business interests extorted most of the funds (supposedly belonging to Iraqis) through fraudulent contracts and whatnot.

    <div class="md"><p>brs816, just a very gentle reminder: most redditors are in the late teens-mid twenties age range. They were just <em>kids</em> when this occurred. So it&#39;s quite possible that many redditors <em>are</em> just hearing about it for the first time. </p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s easy to forget how young redditors are. It saddens me that, for many of them, the last atrocious decade is the one they&#39;re old enough to remember. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition, it may be recalled that one or more plane loads of money that were sent to the Middle East ostensibly to dollarise the Iraqi economy in 2003 never arrived – the reason being that it was in fact parked with the Central Bank of Jordan under the name of Malik. A total of 55 pallets of these notes, sourced by the US Treasury, is believed to have been flown back in to Fort Hood.

    <div class="md"><p>Lets not forget former US ambassador of Iraq set to head up the rebuilding efforts, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0208-02.htm">L. Paul Bremer III</a> out of the picture.</p>

<p>Quoted from that article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week, we were treated to the spectacle of the former U.S. civilian overlord of Iraq, Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, squirming in the hot seat as he attempted with little success to explain what he did with 363 TONS of newly printed, shrink-wrapped $100 bills he had flown to Baghdad.</p>

<p>That&#39;s $12 billion in cold, hard American cash, and no one, especially Bremer, seems to know where it went.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s the former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Paul_Bremer">coordinator for counter-terrorism</a> for the US government, and a former assistant to Henry Kissinger himself.</p>

<p>Here he is in a video interview just hours after the 9/11 attacks. At the time he was working at Marsh USA, who&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tenants_in_One_World_Trade_Center">offices happened to be almost exactly the set of floors hit in WTC1</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2pW6WZhZrQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2pW6WZhZrQ</a></p>

<p>Full transcript of the video is <a href="http://www.politicalfriendster.com/showConnection.php?id1=297&amp;amp;id2=1527">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is a day that will change our lives. It&#39;s
a day that the war that the terrorists declared on the United
States, and after all they did declare a way on us, has been
brought home to the United States in a much more dramatic way than
we&#39;ve seen before. So it will change our lives.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the contrary.I realized it long before this ever happened.I was already taking steps to get out of harms way. Having done that ,my vantage point allows me to maintain relative calm.I know that calm is sometimes misread as apathy.   <em>When the US dollar collapses</em>, Catch up to the game bro! Thats already long ago happened. You cant Fight this.Its SLAVERY. Plain and simple. Choices are limited. Abscond ,resist ,rebel.</p>

When this stuff is brought up I hardly hear anyone saying &quot;this person(s) broke such and such law and it is so and so department&#39;s job to bring charges and they aren&#39;t doing their job because of such and such.&quot;  Since we&#39;re talking about the Fed no one seems to know how or if we can punish anybody.  they are the untouchable authority of the country, if not world it seems.</p>
