       From this week's exchange between Ron Paul and Ben Bernanke:
      </p>
      <p>
       Ron Paul: ...a lot of cash was passed through - and a lot of people suppose it was passed through the Federal Reserve - when there was a provisional government [in Iraq] after the 2003 invasion. That money was not appropriated by the Congress as required by law...
      </p>
      <p>
       Ben Bernanke: Congressman, these specific allegations you've made are absolutely bizarre, and I have no knowledge of anything remotely like what you just described.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's ask Henry Waxman (July 2009)
      </p>
      <p>
       Henry Waxman: In a 13 month period from May 2003 to June 2004, the Federal Reserve sent nearly $12 billion in cash, mainly in $100 bills from the United States to Iraq. To do that, the Federal Reserve Bank in New York had to pack 281 million individual bills ... onto wooden pallets to be shipped to Iraq. The cash weighed more than 363 tons and was loaded onto C-130 cargo planes to be flown into Baghdad...

       that investigates what happened to the money.  As far as I recall, outside business interests extorted most of the funds (supposedly belonging to Iraqis) through fraudulent contracts and whatnot.  Even US soldiers had a hand skimming through the pallets, and no one cared.

       brs816, just a very gentle reminder: most redditors are in the late teens-mid twenties age range. They were just
       <em>
        kids
       </em>
       when this occurred. So it's quite possible that many redditors
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       just hearing about it for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it's easy to forget how young redditors are. It saddens me that, for many of them, the last atrocious decade is the one they're old enough to remember.

       In addition, it may be recalled that one or more plane loads of money that were sent to the Middle East ostensibly to dollarise the Iraqi economy in 2003 never arrived – the reason being that it was in fact parked with the Central Bank of Jordan under the name of Malik. A total of 55 pallets of these notes, sourced by the US Treasury, is believed to have been flown back in to Fort Hood.

        This week, we were treated to the spectacle of the former U.S. civilian overlord of Iraq, Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, squirming in the hot seat as he attempted with little success to explain what he did with 363 TONS of newly printed, shrink-wrapped $100 bills he had flown to Baghdad.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's $12 billion in cold, hard American cash, and no one, especially Bremer, seems to know where it went.

brought home to the United States in a much more dramatic way than
we've seen before. So it will change our lives."

       When the US dollar collapses, you'll be shocked as well?  When its worth nothing, you'll be all like......"nothing to see here".

       To the contrary.I realized it long before this ever happened.I was already taking steps to get out of harms way. Having done that ,my vantage point allows me to maintain relative calm.I know that calm is sometimes misread as apathy.

       i think no one gives a fuck is because they don't know they should.  When this stuff is brought up I hardly hear anyone saying "this person(s) broke such and such law and it is so and so department's job to bring charges and they aren't doing their job because of such and such."  Since we're talking about the Fed no one seems to know how or if we can punish anybody.  they are the untouchable authority of the country, if not world it seems.
