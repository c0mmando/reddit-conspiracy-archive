       I love how rich, isolated assholes think they know more about the world than people who aren't surrounded by 30 layers of lying yes men.
      </p>

       The rich and powerful of this planet have become a joke.  They are the least prepared to handle anything when the shit hits the fan, because they have, quite literally, never had to do anything.

       Here I think you are wrong, because they also have enough money to build cities under airports, missile silo condominiums sealed from the rest of the world, build giant seed vaults, book vaults, ect. for the coming apparently non-existent make-believe engineered apocalypse.

       They are a joke in the sense that they are like court jesters, actors on the world stage, a physical manifestation of the collectively suppressed inner troll, gluttonously dwelling within the fractured psychology of the masses.

       Can you explain your comment vis-a-vis the link? There is a lot of good research that shows that population growth is directly linked to health, namely the infant mortality rate (higher infant mortality rate nearly always leads to a higher population growth rate in order to compensate.)

       Well, if you were actually aware of what he was talking about, you would realize that he is essentially talking about increasing the human lifespan while responsibly managing the population by providing contraceptives and family-planning to those who can't normally afford it.

       And say what you will about Gates, but I think

       Takes too long, by the time a woman develops cancer or another serious disease from her diet, she's already past her prime child barring years.  We need faster acting chemical additives, I'm sick and tired of these Midwest ConAgra and Archer Daniels fucks not playing hardball, especially in exports to the BRICs.  I don't know how many times we have to go over this.

       Because people in areas with high child mortality rates have lots of children, to be sure some will survive to look after them in their old age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lower the child mortality rate, and make contraception available, and people choose to have fewer children.

       That's why I have 2 kids, my parents had 3, and my grandparents had 10.

       That's not the point, the point is that most people still believe vaccines save lives, this proves that the elite really do think vaccines are a way to depopulate the world.

       I agree that there are plans in place to depopulate the world, but this doesn't "prove" that vaccines are a way to depopulate anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill said that EDUCATION and CONTRACEPTION will make our population grow more slowly. That is still more people. Not DEPOPULATION (which is less people, obviously). He did
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       say "vaccines" will reduce population in any way shape or form. To assert this means you either can't understand English or you are looking for something that is not there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the cause you are championing, and I know that Bill is probably some part of it, but this speech is not any kind of smoking gun that is going to convince anyone of the validity of your argument.

      <p>
       By waving this quote around, thinking people will just assume you are a crazy person because the quote doesn't say what you think it says. You are actually

        hurting
       </em>
       your credibility.

       How do helpful vaccines and health care reduce the rate of population growth?  I realize I should have phrased my comment better, but that doesn't change the fact that he's saying vaccines and health care (2 things that are commonly thought to be good for us) are going to limit the growth of the population.  If the commonly held concept that vaccines are good for us is true how will they stunt population growth?  If they were good for us then wouldn't they help increase the population growth instead of help decrease the growth?

       Are you even for real? Are condoms "good for us"? They reduce potential population.

       You said Bill Gate's statements show that "the elite really do think vaccines are a way to depopulate the world".
      </p>
      <p>
       I said it was a ridiculous statement, given that "depopulate" means "less people than before" while Bill was talking about more people, not less. Further, you apparently totally missed the fact that he was not talking about vaccines when he made the statement. He was talking about education and contraception.

       At this point if you think vaccines and health care are good for you I can't do anything to wake you up, you are too deep in denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact you want to argue over the semantics of depopulation vs decreasing population growth when the much bigger picture is that the vaccines and health care were ways to decrease population growth shows either denial or possibly something more sinister...

       Are you even fucking paying attention? I didn't say a single thing about vaccines and health care being good for you.

      <p>
       The reason I made the point is that there IS A FUCKING DIFFERENCE between a DEPOPULATION (people dying) and CONTRACEPTION (not as many women getting pregnant).

      <p>
       I know you understand the difference and I know you are trolling, so go fuck yourself. I've got productive things to do with my time.

       The world's not overpopulated, that's the myth that is fed to the elites to make them go along with such an awful plan.  The easiest way to get people to go along is to tell them it's for our own good.
