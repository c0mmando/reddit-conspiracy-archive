<p>If you&#39;re going to carry out a terrorist attack, why would you do it one way, and then tell everyone it happened in a different way that&#39;s physically impossible? </p>

<p>If they wanted to destroy building 7, why not just fly another plane into it? Or say the terrorists blew it up? Why would they leave all that evidence to the contrary if they didn&#39;t have to?</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to these ideas, I just don&#39;t understand that part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which still leaves the question unanswered:</p>

<p>Why the fuck would they give the press a copy of the plan to start with?</p>

<p>Fine, sure, the press is evil and in cahoots with the military, but if you tell the reporters what you&#39;re about to do then you increase the number of people who might talk, decrease their ability to act surprised, and leave some more evidence.</p>

<p>The alternative plan was &quot;don&#39;t tell the press, leave them to work out for themselves that the building has fallen down&quot;, and the only reason that would fail is if somehow you imagine that your co-conspirators in the press wouldn&#39;t fucking notice the building falling down.</p>

<p>Are you seriously claiming they had to give a copy of the plan to reporters because they were afraid that no one would notice the buildings falling down? Seriously?</p>

<p>And, after all, your claim is that the reporters are directly involved in the conspiracy, even if only to the extent of refusing to admit that they were given a copy of the plan in advance. And I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t care how much of an evil profit-driven capitalist my boss may be, but I&#39;d have a little trouble helping cover up the murder of thousands of people. Which, of course, means that you&#39;re claiming every reporter who was giving a copy of the plan is the sort of person who can help cover up this sort of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Not to mention another problem - people claim the plane was &quot;shot down&quot; and that the conspirators hid the fact that it was shot down, but also claim that the conspirators had prepared explosives for when the plane hit the building.</p>

<p>The keystone cops could arrange a better plan than this overly-complicated charade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let me see if I understand you correctly: I asked why a reporter would be given a detailed plan for the attack, in advance, in order to prepare their report ahead of time.</p>

<p>Your response was to rant about how &quot;the media&quot; is in &quot;kahootz&quot; with the conspirators.</p>

<p>Even assuming that your claim that every media company executive, vice president, reporter, presenter, researcher, editor, and secretary actually is in &quot;kahootz&quot; with them and therefore can actually be trusted completely with a copy of the evil plan, you still haven&#39;t answered the question.</p>

<p>The fact is that the reporter in question is either a member of the conspiracy, or not a member of the conspiracy. If the reporter was a member, then the copy of the plan was actually unnecessary, and if the reporter was not a member of the conspiracy, then a copy of the plan would have been received differently.</p>

<p>Your claim is that the reporter received a copy of the plan in advance and therefore must be a member of the conspiracy. This means there is only one question being asked of you here: why exactly would they bother giving a copy of the plan to their evil reporter, when it would be easier to just let the reporter present the story as it happens anyway?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you have a good point.</p>

<p>One other possible explanation for the BBC clairvoyance could have been that they didn&#39;t know where building 7 was (given that it&#39;s in the background of the shot), and that warnings of its imminent collapse were relayed to them, changing tense.  Google for the video of the foreign accented soldier telling people to move away because the building is going to come down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly the whole crime scene was cleared of all debris without any investigation.  The biggest crime scene in history was cleaned faster your average murder scene.  We will never be able to know for sure what happened because the evidence was tampered with immediately and then shipped out of NY as fast as the boats could carry it.</p>

<p>Keep asking questions from as many sources as you can, and don&#39;t trust what doesn&#39;t feel right.  My intuition tells me the official story is a lie and much evidence can be found to confirm my personal bias.    For me the most important factors in not believing the official story are:  </p>

<p>How quickly the scene was cleaning up; the immediate release of the list of high jackers that remained the same even after people whose names showed up on the list turned out to be alive and well; the complete shut down of our air defense system and the simultaneous NORAD tests of a scenario that was so similar the participants could not distinguish real life from the test; to date not one person has been fined fired or reprimanded for the biggest failure in national security on record, in fact the opposite happened; the obvious scientific information about the burning temperatures of jet fuel and the much higher probability of controlled demolition, and so so many more that I have not the time to mention (on my way to work).</p>

<p>There are more topics and info bits obviously, and I am not quite sure what question(s) you are trying to ask, so what I really want to say is do more research from many different sources and trust yourself.  If you believe the official explanation then go with it man, you should never be told to act against your gut.  To me the official story seems like a huge lie, but I do not have another more plausible scenario.  I don&#39;t have a specific theory on what happened, I simply know the evidence presented in the media is not the truth and a real investigation needs to be conducted.  However we are still waiting on a follow up to the Warren Commission, so I am not too hopeful we will get all the facts here.  And that seems to suit the powers that be just fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divide and conquer.</p>

<p>To me, the conspiracy IS the conspiracy. It may be they left loopholes and evidence for the purpose of dividing the nation. We&#39;re seeing civil unrest and hostility like never before. More protests and more violence. They can now weed out those who &quot;oppose&quot; the government and take care of them. Ever since 9/11 we&#39;ve seen a rise in the police state.</p>

<p>But what is it all for? What do they want to achieve? I don&#39;t think anyone has an answer to that...just theories. World government? I highly doubt that. An excuse to obtain foreign resources? We already knew that. I think it may be for some agenda we can&#39;t even fathom...or nothing at all. </p>

<p>If they have nothing to hide why don&#39;t we get a NEW INVESTIGATION? Problem solved. Clear up inconsistencies in the official story/evidence. Why would they spend time and resources to infiltrate conspiracy sites when they could be presenting a new clear and concise account of what happened that day and the months prior? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well some believe world war three starts with other nations are convinced 9/11 is a fraud and was an excuse for America to go to war and so they join the fight against America.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of worrying when you see &#39;Russia TV&#39; hyping the 9/11 was a false flag operation to all their citizens and the reverse 9/11 truthers are evil hyped to all the American citizens.</p>

<p>and the fact that they are simply not trying any more as seen in the attempted Christmas bombing could be seen to join to this idea. </p>

<p>But then again i&#39;m sure they planned many possibilities that could have happened with peoples and other countries reactions to 9/11 and maybe with all their possibilities they deemed it safest for them for it to be a plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe - I like your thinking generally, probably many of us going in this direction. Just on the side I&#39;d say that maybe it&#39;s too simple to say that the conspiracy IS the conspiracy - there have been failures on their part, maybe big ones. If they are so masterful it seems like it would be fairly simple to wrap up this &#39;world conquest&#39; thing pretty easily. Sure things are always being ramped up but I can&#39;t pin-point one single good reason for them to have committed 9/11. Sure there the oil and the patriot act - maybe even the heroin from Afghanistan but as a conspiracy theorist I must say I&#39;m a bit underwhelmed. I can agree that things are moving forward but too slowly. I don&#39;t doubt that there is an agenda - maybe there is some kind of internal problem - they can&#39;t get their shit together enough to just take over the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it sounds like you are trying to figure things out which is a good thing. I would answer some of this with an emphatic &quot;I do not know&quot; and I am not afraid to admit it. </p>

<p>As for the part that I can explain: Crashing vehicles isn&#39;t an effective way of demolishing buildings. So crashing a plane might have been a good cover story but it wouldn&#39;t actually have brought down the building. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that that things didn&#39;t actually go to plan because of the mysterious &quot;Shanksburg hole&quot; that was said to contain a whole commercial airline - and yet there was zero evidence. </p>

<p>As far as why would you do it one way and then tell everyone it happened in a different way.. I am not certain. I know that things didn&#39;t go to plan. Maybe they expected a certain result that would have made the issue of 9/11 irrelevant (god help us all.) Maybe it was an experiment to see how far they could push us. Maybe it&#39;s a sophisticated way of figuring out which of us are &#39;disloyal&#39; and it&#39;s a way of calculating who will follow their orders. You <em>may</em> find it interesting that it really doesn&#39;t make any difference - why do you expect to know the truth when there have been years of lies? Who killed Kennedy/s? I think that&#39;s pretty important to get to the bottom of - and yet we don&#39;t really know. We especially don&#39;t know why. </p>

<p>Are you suggesting that because we don&#39;t understand 9/11 properly that therefore the official story must be true? </p>

<p>In regards to where does one reasonably stand on the 9/11 issue, I suggest this: The official story is a lie - promoted by the government and the media (this being self evident.) The reason for 9/11 has yet to be determined with 100% certainty however there are many suggestions which are compelling and worth considering as sensible alternative to the official version.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The sovereign people of the US (bless their souls) have a bad habit of trusting everything the government says and being duped into wars. Your average Joe/Jane has a mountain of other issues to worry about, and take most of what&#39;s peddled to them at face value without looking deeper. What&#39;s more, is that there are a lot of people I&#39;ve talked to that did not even know that WTC 7 fell that day; most media focus has always been placed on the two towers. The ones who committed the 9/11 atrocity know all of this, and they are getting better and better at their craft which leads into my second point...</p></li>
<li><p>This had been planned for a long time. I&#39;m speculating here, but maybe two planes were just &quot;good enough&quot; to get the desired effect.  Plus, if you look into WTC 7 and what it contained, it raises a lot of red flags, and this brings me to point number three...</p></li>
<li><p>WTC 7 hosted an alphabet soup of government agencies. Not to mention that the 23rd floor was the Mayors &quot;Office of Emergency Management&quot; which had reinforced windows that were supposedly bullet and bomb resistant, and had independent air and water supplies. It offered a great vantage point in which to coordinate the 9/11 operation. Also worth noting is that it was at the center of the Enron scandal.</p></li>
<li><p>ALL the buildings that fell that day were rigged with explosives. Steel beams from the two towers were pitched thousands of feet away and some were even embedded in other buildings. Even with the initial impact of the planes, along with beams &quot;popping&quot; out from the weight of collapsing debris, there is no explanation for this other than explosive detonation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And then there&#39;s the whole &quot;official&quot; story of the Pentagon building, which is full of holes, no pun intended...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people think that the &quot;no WMDs&quot; in Iraq is proof that the gov is telling the truth about 9/11 (because why wouldn&#39;t they just plant some WMDs if they needed them).  Well actually this is an ingenious flip psychology and serves to muddy the 9/11 truth topics--get the discussion to &quot;bush knew&quot; or &quot;bad intel on iraq&quot; and you&#39;ve avoided the core issue--that the &quot;hijackers&quot; on the planes never were on the planes (no arab names on the flight manifests) or were CIA patsies.</p>

<p>The main goal here is to point the finger at the middle east and begin the &quot;shadow war&quot; on terrorism.  I think they accomplished that beautifully by conjuring up these stories of arab hijackers and using the planes model.  Problem is most people are too uneducated on the topic to understand that a plane hitting the tower (even loaded with jet fuel) would not cause the tower to collapse.  It&#39;s totally impossible for the building to fall like it did without a demolition of some sort - call it thermate, scalar weapons, whatever, the WTCs were built like tanks.</p>

<p>As for building 7, it&#39;s a &quot;mind-bending anomaly&quot; that the 9/11 commission report doesn&#39;t even mention how building 7 fell.  Most of the report focuses very little on how the buildings physically fell, it&#39;s all timeline leadup info and war mongering propoganda (it&#39;s online for free search it).</p>

<p>WT7 was a bunker, most probably a control system for the WTC1 and 2 demo, but also housed wall street investigations, and fires broke out on those floors accordingly.  I don&#39;t think most people even know anything about building 7, and the 9/11 &quot;omission&quot; report supports this.  Why would they fly a plane into it?  The city was already in shock, all they had to say was &quot;it sustained damage&quot; from the other towers, and take it down.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard some people say that because it was such a secure building it had a self-destruct option, and that&#39;s what they used with Larry Silverstein decided to &quot;pull-it&quot; at 5:20 in the evening.  Well OK, then, admitted controlled demolition, why couldn&#39;t the other towers have had similar systems then, and who has clearance to authorize this?  I mean the insurance companies made a payout to him for sure, even after they agreed to destroy it?  And fucking NIST, they babble on more and more about core columns, etc, such fucking phonies.</p>

<p>The more you learn hombre, the deeper down the rabbit hole you go.  This country&#39;s gov needs to be dismantled, absolute farce.</p>

<p>That&#39;s true. It has been 87 years since the last illegal immigrant entered the country, and therefore we can sleep easy in our beds, knowing that the government is on the job of stopping evil-doers at the borders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, many of the hijackers received their passports from a particular Middle Eastern US consulate (in Iran I think), where at least one person went public with complaints about being forced to issue passports to people who were obvious security threats.  So, many of them wouldn&#39;t have had passports in the first place without government intervention.  They were issued the passports because, like Atta, many or all were working as double agents and had all the earmarks of intelligence operatives.  [Atta spoke English, Hebrew, Arabic, German and I think French and Russian; had a pilot&#39;s license <em>before</em> conspicuously going to various flight schools, plane rentals etc., hung around a flight school that had federal protection in bringing coke in from South America, dated a blond stripper who&#39;s kittens he killed when she left him, and reportedly got plastered and shouted &quot;Fuck Allah!&quot; a couple of days before &quot;martyring&quot; himself.]</p>

<p>They simply got caught in their lies the same way a five year old with his hand in a cookie jar.       911 was planned when the Internet was quite a bit younger.  The planners didn&#39;t foresee that the Internet would evolve into such a powerful collaborative tool for citizen-investigators.   I say &quot;citizen-investigators&quot; because most of the government investigators have had their pension/families threatened if they start digging around and telling what they know.  The Jewish Establishment that sanctioned the attacks were too confident of the suppressive ability of their media monopoly,  a monopoly they lost as the Internet grew after 911.   They also didn&#39;t expect any survivors on the ground... or other complications like Edna Cintron and Barry Jennings or the last radio transmissions of the doomed firefighters.  </p>

<p>Flight 93 was intended to take out WTC7.   The passengers were able to force themselves into the cockpit and saw for themselves the true situation.  That is why Cheney had Flight 93 shot down.  </p>

<p>When the initial cause of this madness is never properly investigated and rather made into an issue that simply segments people into believers and truthers, everyone suffers because no facts have ever been properly vetted. </p>

<p>There is too much shady shit involved, especially when it has caused us to run head first into a freedomless america.  Fucking patriot act is still being reinstated, over and over again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the US government was necessarily fully responsible for everything that happened on 9/11. Could have been some rogue CIA operative either doing the deeds or having foreknowledge of someone like Mossad doing them, and GWB and the PNAC really did just happen to get the new Pearl Harbor they needed to implement their plans through sheer dumb luck.</p>

<p>Regardless of what happened, it&#39;s possible, and seems probable, that somebody &quot;important&quot; in media or government fucked up hard that day. The story was probably tweaked or modified in real-time in order to cover up somebody-important&#39;s huge fuck-up.</p>

<p>So, e.g., some hijackers hijack a plane, something really terrible happens you don&#39;t want the public to know about (plane is shot down, people are tortured by the hijackers, people are killed execution-style, people are raped, somebody in government got a memo a few months back about the hijacking happening in the future but never did anything about it other than go on vacation for a few months, somebody else in government didn&#39;t react to the hijacking fast enough to get the situation under control, or any of a million other reasons)</p>

<p>So you fly a missile into a building or into the ground and maybe make up some story about how heroic everyone was that died.</p>

<p>Or say a country shoots a missile into one of the most secure buildings on the planet. And blows up a few of our buildings. And we knew about it, but there was nothing we could do about it because we were under the gun for some reason. So basically some country pisses on our face and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it (or we just don&#39;t do anything about it for some resaon, whether due to neglect or w/e). What can you do other than make up some crazy story and then attack someone else (who doesn&#39;t have you under the gun) as a scapegoat... preferably someone it would benefit you economically to defeat.</p>

<p>I think this shit is a lot more complicated than it seems. But maybe not. Who knows.</p>

<p>There&#39;s always the NWO. But are countries like USA and Israel even part of it? Or is the NWO controlled primarily by bankers? Is it possible for Mossad or CIA agents to be offered large sums of money in order to get them to help you carry out a subversive plan? Who knows.</p>

<p>New investigation needed. May discover government is completely illegitimate. Social unrest may result. YMMV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone gives the people that run this country too much credit.  I&#39;m going to guess that the average Redditor hasn&#39;t spent much time in elite circles but once you do you&#39;ll be greatly disappointed.  There&#39;s many types of people that eventually rise through the ranks and have what it takes to plan something like 9/11 and even then, they&#39;re not thinking of everything.  Bottom line, if you go to a top school and drift through intelligence or industry it&#39;s usually all about a very specific topic  with the help of connections, and this pursuit/trail then blinds you about a lot of realities in the world.  And the more time you spend about people similar to you, the more radical your ideas get and the less you understand other areas and viewpoints.  Yes, they have people to think about this, but they&#39;re just as flawed and more importantly they&#39;re not going to come out and risk their relationship by making a statement they can&#39;t back up with cold hard data or agreements.  </p>

<p>Basically, whenever I&#39;ve met a real mover and shaker, I&#39;ve been disappointed. Whether it was a genius mathematician turned hedge fund manager, Congressman, intelligence worker, diplomat, Senator, future president, etc. Now, I have met some super scary smart individuals, but most of them grew up upper middle class and work in the private sector. </p>

<p>This is why I doubt a lot of 9/11 hype and find it completely plausible that it was easier to fund a group of extremists to carry out what you want to do and having it benefit you.  It&#39;s called outsourcing and it works marvelously. </p>

<p>You can talk about &#39;how&#39; the twin towers fell all you want, but you should really just focus on who was on the planes and where their money came from.  Because FYI, there were a lot more planes that were supposed to be used on 9/11 and our gov&#39;t stopped them.  New York and DC were not their only targets and this is part of the cover up.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to say the gov&#39;t was behind something, then you have to look at how they&#39;ve actually carried out things like this before, it&#39;s always 3rd and 4th party operators.  They&#39;re not going to leave a breadcrumb trail that some community college kid can follow from his parent&#39;s basement, dream on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re wrong about the elite - most people want a simple answer and that is the mistake in the first place. </p>

<p>At the same time just because you have met movers and shakers and been disappointed, but perhaps there is a good reason for that - of course I am going to say &quot;that&#39;s just what they want you to think&quot; but it&#39;s not such a stupid comeback (as long as it isn&#39;t over played.) </p>

<p>There are a lot of people who can demonstrate why senators, scientists, future presidents are just helping to sell a huge lie - hell Noam Chomsky has some good things to say about that. I think you can prove that alot of higher education is more about compliance than anything else - its a pay to play system. The system filters out people who are rebels who don&#39;t want to play by the rules etc You get rewarded for being a douche bag - for a reason. </p>

<p>There were a lot of war games taking place during 9/11 that is almost proof in itself that the government were responsible in some way. There is a lot of compartmentalization and people may have had a role in 9/11 all while thinking they were participating in a war game. It&#39;s not that they were so smart as to pull off 9/11 it&#39;s that system is extremely vulnerable to an attack from within - shadow government type thing. Keep a lot of incompetent morons around so you can do stuff with out attracting attention. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be so confident in our governments inability to keep a secret I believe that the bread crumb trail is out there but people have to risk a great deal to out this info (support for wikileaks) - but all that stuff about Washington being a sieve is a big lie. Truman had no idea about the Manhattan Project before taking office - as a famous example. If you were super smart and devious it would help you to tell people that you were stupid. </p>

<p>I guess I can&#39;t argue with too much you say. I definitely can&#39;t fault you for playing the devil&#39;s advocate - I would only say that I think there is evidence that proves that these people are extremely capable - I have no doubt about that. But I just feel we&#39;re missing a big piece of the puzzle at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which still leaves the question unanswered:</p>

<p>Why the fuck would they give the press a copy of the plan to start with?</p>

<p>Fine, sure, the press is evil and in cahoots with the military, but if you tell the reporters what you&#39;re about to do then you increase the number of people who might talk, decrease their ability to act surprised, and leave some more evidence.</p>

<p>The alternative plan was &quot;don&#39;t tell the press, leave them to work out for themselves that the building has fallen down&quot;, and the only reason that would fail is if somehow you imagine that your co-conspirators in the press wouldn&#39;t fucking notice the building falling down.</p>

<p>Are you seriously claiming they had to give a copy of the plan to reporters because they were afraid that no one would notice the buildings falling down? Seriously?</p>

<p>And, after all, your claim is that the reporters are directly involved in the conspiracy, even if only to the extent of refusing to admit that they were given a copy of the plan in advance. And I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t care how much of an evil profit-driven capitalist my boss may be, but I&#39;d have a little trouble helping cover up the murder of thousands of people. Which, of course, means that you&#39;re claiming every reporter who was giving a copy of the plan is the sort of person who can help cover up this sort of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Not to mention another problem - people claim the plane was &quot;shot down&quot; and that the conspirators hid the fact that it was shot down, but also claim that the conspirators had prepared explosives for when the plane hit the building.</p>

<p>The keystone cops could arrange a better plan than this overly-complicated charade.</p>

<p>One other possible explanation for the BBC clairvoyance could have been that they didn&#39;t know where building 7 was (given that it&#39;s in the background of the shot), and that warnings of its imminent collapse were relayed to them, changing tense.  Google for the video of the foreign accented soldier telling people to move away because the building is going to come down.</p>
