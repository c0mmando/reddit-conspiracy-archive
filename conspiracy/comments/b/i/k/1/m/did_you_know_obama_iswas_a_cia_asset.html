<p>Al Qaeda&quot; means &quot;the base&quot;, which is really just Arabic shorthand for database. The database to which the name refers was nothing more than a contact list of international mujahedin and arms smugglers used by the CIA and Saudis to funnel guerrillas, arms, and money into Soviet-occupied Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;amp;code=BUN20051120&amp;amp;articleId=1291">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;amp;code=BUN20051120&amp;amp;articleId=1291</a></p>

<p>We fight &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; in Iraq in much the same way that we fought &quot;the Soviets&quot; in Latin America (excepting Cuba). Which is to say that the so-called foe is almost entirely fabricated.</p>

<p>To believe that the attacks on 9/11 were unconnected to the CIA, when they originated from a &quot;terrorist group&quot; which was created by our CIA in the first place, is naive and uninformed.</p>

<p>The CIA in the 80&#39;s, working alongside the Pakistani ISI, financed and supported the Afghan mujahedin (some of whom, eg. Bin Laden, later came to be known as Al Qaeda) to draw the soviets into their own &quot;Vietnam&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/brzezinski.html">http://www.counterpunch.org/brzezinski.html</a></p>

<p>Later, the CIA would instruct the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to rubber-stamp VISA applications for some of these &quot;assets&quot; so they could venture into the United States. Over half of the alleged hijackers received their visas through the Jeddah consulate.</p>

<p>The Bin Laden family financial connection to Osama lasts at LEAST until 1997</p>

<p>Bin Laden received life-saving treatment at Dubai Hospital from July 4-14 and met with CIA agents</p>

<p><a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a070401dubai#a070401dubai">http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a070401dubai#a070401dubai</a></p>

<p>5 of the 9/11 hijackers received training at secure US military bases</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/75797">http://www.newsweek.com/id/75797</a></p>

<p>Shafiq bin Laden, described as an estranged brother of the terrorist, was at an investment conference in Washington, DC, along with two people who are close to President George Bush: his father, the first President Bush, and James Baker, the former secretary of state who masterminded the legal campaign that secured Dubya&#39;s move to the White House. The conference was hosted by the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that manages billions of dollars, including, at the time, some bin Laden family wealth. It also employs Messrs Bush and Baker.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, when no one was being allowed in or out of the United States, many members of the bin Laden family in America were spirited home to Saudi Arabia. The revival of defence spending that followed greatly increased the value of the Carlyle Group&#39;s investments in defence companies. </p>

<p>So, are we connecting the dots yet, or does the head of the CIA have to come out with a tell-all confession for you to accept what&#39;s really been going on while this country was busy watching American Idol? It&#39;s a well-documented fact that the CIA has systematically fought democracy abroad for the past five decades, so it should come as no surprise that this snake we&#39;ve nurtured for so long would eventually turn around and bite us in our own home.</p>

<p>Are we supposed to believe this?</p>

<p>Take your initial comment in this thread for instance. I posted a very detailed comment that elaborated on the topic. That post, if I may say so, contains no &quot;craziness&quot;, as it is all documented and anyone who knows anything on this topic already knows these things.</p>

<p>It&#39;s rather clear you have no interest in the content here, instead, as you admit, you make character attacks.</p>

<p>For additional context, you have been identified as a &quot;shill&quot; by the now infamous subreddit <a href="/r/shill">/r/shill</a>. And judging by your actions and past comments, this seems to be consistent with your activity.</p>

<p>If you disagree with this assessment, then stop ignoring content, especially content that is lucid, factual, well-documented, cogent, etc... Analyze the content, consider it, then comment on it.</p>

<p>A comment that says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You guys are even more ridiculous than the birthers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a thread that is well-documented fact makes you look like are part of an official campaign and agenda to supress this type of dialogue.</p>

<p>And this is not far-fetched, as anyone who follows what&#39;s going on knows of the activity of governments and official agencies to &quot;steer&quot; dialogue on sites like reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, much like many of the users of reddit who post similar things as you, you do not know what anti-semitism is, or at least, you have an itchy anti-semitism trigger...</p>

<p>So even the hyperbolic example you gave:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Israel did 9/11/Mossad is responsible for all the evil in the world!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is not anti-semitism. Claiming that a country&#39;s intelligence operation is behind the events that shape the history of the world is that and only that. There is no anti-semitism in this statement. This would be an example of anti-semitism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All jews are evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not actual quote, but just an example so we can clear up what anti-semitism is.</p>

<p>Also, texmex is a respected <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> contributor, whereas you are popularly seen as a &#39;shill&#39;. So what I am trying to say is, around here, your opinion is seen as total crap and does nothing to reduce our opinions of users like texmex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you disagree with me on whether texmex is an anti-semite, tbe fact that he called me a shill does not constitute evidence that I am a shill. </p>

<p>I could post something on reddit saying that Bruce Willis is a bunny rabbit. In fact, I will: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/bikay/and_bruce_fucking_he_just_stared_at_me_and_bruce/c0myncs">http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/bikay/and_bruce_fucking_he_just_stared_at_me_and_bruce/c0myncs</a></p>

<p>My posting this comment does not in fact mean that Bruce Willis &quot;has been identified&quot; as an actual bunny rabbit.</p>

<p>Sometimes when people post things on the internet, they are not true -- even if you really, really want them to be true. (I mean, wouldn&#39;t it be really cool if Bruce Willis <em>was</em> a bunny rabbit?)</p>

<p>I hope that helps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re being called a shill because for someone who claims to not care about this subreddit - you spend an awful lot of time here trying to derail conversation, smear posters, and just spew ignorance.</p>

<p>Seriously, your &quot;annoyed comments&quot; are completely unfounded and ridiculous. More ridiculous than what you&#39;re trying to mock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve looked at some of the evidence and it&#39;s ridiculous</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a perfect example. What evidence? How about looking at the evidence you&#39;re commenting on - instead of saying &quot;LOL UR STUPID&quot; based on something else you read at a completely different time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t go around calling people shills... and I haven&#39;t looked at your comment history, but judging entirely by your input in THIS thread - I&#39;d have to agree. Shill.</p>

<p>You are going out of your way to hamper and discourage unpopular conversation.</p>

<p>Either way, kindly GTFO or STFU.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m a shill because:</p>

<p>a) I think it&#39;s silly to think Obama was a CIA asset</p>

<p>b) because I think it&#39;s silly for Prof Karp to say I&#39;ve been &quot;identified&quot; as a shill because some dude called me that?</p>

<p>I mean, that&#39;s basically all I&#39;ve said in this thread. </p>

<p>EDIT: I mean, besides the whole Bruce Willis-bunny rabbit thing. I&#39;d like to see if you have any proof he&#39;s NOT a bunny rabbit!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are a shill because:</p>

<p>you are mouthy</p>

<p>you are stupid</p>

<p>you are lazy</p>

<p>you are a nigger</p>

<p>Now go do your research asshole.</p>

<p>If you do your research you will rapidly discover what a dumb bastard you have been.</p>

<p>Business International Corporation, accused of functioning as a CIA front company.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to take the word of John Pilger, the man in the video. Here&#39;s Wikipedia:</p>

<pre><code>The company has been identified as cover organization for the Central Intelligence Agency, e.g. see Lobster Magazine, issue 14 in 1987. According to a lengthy article in the New York Times in 1977, the co-founder of the company told the newspaper that &quot;Eldridge Haynes [the other founder] had provided cover for four CIA employees in various countries between 1955 and 1960&quot;.

In his autobiography, &quot;Dreams From My Fathers&quot;, Barack Obama writes of taking a job at some point after graduating from Columbia University in 1983. He describes his employer as &quot;a consulting house to multinational corporations&quot; in New York City, and his functions as a &quot;research assistant&quot; and &quot;financial writer&quot;.

The odd part of Obama&#39;s story is that he doesn&#39;t mention the name of his employer. However, a New York Times story of 2007 identifies the company as Business International Corporation.

In his book, not only doesn&#39;t Obama mention his employer&#39;s name; he fails to say when he worked there, or why he left the job.
</code></pre>

<p>he refused to mention a dangerous trip to Pakistan which he made at a time when travel to that country was discouraged by the State Department. That country was then the focus of the CIA&#39;s largest covert operation, the supplying of the Afghan mujahadeen. While there, this callow college kid met with one of the most powerful men in Pakistan -- a meeting arranged by an unnamed personage with the American Embassy. (Spook-watchers know what that means.)</p>

<p>Adding to the mix is the fact that Ann Dunham, Obama&#39;s mother, had visited at least 13 countries in her lifetime, and had worked for companies that required travel to Pakistan. Her employers appear to have included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Ford Foundation, Women&#39;s World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. Note that USAID and the Ford Foundation have (allegedly) been used as covers for CIA agents. . . . </p>
