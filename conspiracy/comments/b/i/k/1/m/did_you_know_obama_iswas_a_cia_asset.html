       Al Qaeda" means "the base", which is really just Arabic shorthand for database. The database to which the name refers was nothing more than a contact list of international mujahedin and arms smugglers used by the CIA and Saudis to funnel guerrillas, arms, and money into Soviet-occupied Afghanistan.

       We fight "Al Qaeda" in Iraq in much the same way that we fought "the Soviets" in Latin America (excepting Cuba). Which is to say that the so-called foe is almost entirely fabricated.
      </p>
      <p>
       To believe that the attacks on 9/11 were unconnected to the CIA, when they originated from a "terrorist group" which was created by our CIA in the first place, is naive and uninformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA in the 80's, working alongside the Pakistani ISI, financed and supported the Afghan mujahedin (some of whom, eg. Bin Laden, later came to be known as Al Qaeda) to draw the soviets into their own "Vietnam".

       Later, the CIA would instruct the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to rubber-stamp VISA applications for some of these "assets" so they could venture into the United States. Over half of the alleged hijackers received their visas through the Jeddah consulate.

       Shafiq bin Laden, described as an estranged brother of the terrorist, was at an investment conference in Washington, DC, along with two people who are close to President George Bush: his father, the first President Bush, and James Baker, the former secretary of state who masterminded the legal campaign that secured Dubya's move to the White House. The conference was hosted by the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that manages billions of dollars, including, at the time, some bin Laden family wealth. It also employs Messrs Bush and Baker.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, when no one was being allowed in or out of the United States, many members of the bin Laden family in America were spirited home to Saudi Arabia. The revival of defence spending that followed greatly increased the value of the Carlyle Group's investments in defence companies.

       So, are we connecting the dots yet, or does the head of the CIA have to come out with a tell-all confession for you to accept what's really been going on while this country was busy watching American Idol? It's a well-documented fact that the CIA has systematically fought democracy abroad for the past five decades, so it should come as no surprise that this snake we've nurtured for so long would eventually turn around and bite us in our own home.

       I've heard that story. I'd like to see a little more verification. I've also heard he was a high ranking Freemason. One thing you can count on, he is on the inside track of the power sturcture. Still I think he is a script reader, not a script writer.

       Can we stop with the alien thing?  Maybe there are aliens, maybe not, but there's no verifiable evidence (as far as I know).  But there's plenty of evidence implicating
       <em>
        human beings
       </em>
       in all of this, primarily, the Rothschilds.

       You have a point there.  I guess it's hard for people to accept that a member of their own species could be like that, so they use aliens to explain the descrepancy.

       The Bilderberg Group was named after the Bilderberg Hotel in Amsterdam where they held their first meeting. Using the term "the Bilderbergs" is merely in reference to "The Bilderberg Group". Granted, the Rothschilds were integral in starting the Bilderberg Group, but there is no family relation. I am an American. That is where I live. It does not mean I am desended from a family named "America".

       Sure, It's on Hillery's night-stand in a pile with the Whitewater billing records, the rough draft of Vince Fosters suicide note, some JFK stuff, and 0bombers original birth certificate.

       It helps if you can spell neo-con and realize that conspiracy theory was made a dirty word by George Bush trying to cover up his involvement in 911.

       Are you really that stupid that you think Vince Foster was a legitimate suicide?

       No need for childish name calling. The OP's video accuses the president of being a CIA controlled muslim radical who wants to destroy the American way of life. I would call that an extraordinary claim.

       So, if Wikipedia is to be believed, this company provided cover for four CIA agents in 1955-60, and Obama wrote for one of their financial newsletters in 1984. (No mention of his mother) ...I'm failing to see a meaningful connection here.

       Has anyone here heard of Andrew Basiago? He is a lawyer, researcher and was part of the secret DARPA program "Project Pegasus" since childhood due to his father being a high ranking military or C.I.A. official with high security clearance. Among many, many other things, he has said that he met both Obama and Dubya decades ago and both had knowledge at the time (the 1970's to 1980's) that they would be president.

       There was a video that Obama's preacher made explaining this. I can't find it but it says that Obama was picked out in college by the CIA and then trained and whatnot he goes on to explain that like most muslims Obama wants to destroy the American lifestyle.

       Are we supposed to believe this?

      <p>
       Take your initial comment in this thread for instance. I posted a very detailed comment that elaborated on the topic. That post, if I may say so, contains no "craziness", as it is all documented and anyone who knows anything on this topic already knows these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's rather clear you have no interest in the content here, instead, as you admit, you make character attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       For additional context, you have been identified as a "shill" by the now infamous subreddit
       <a href="/r/shill">
        /r/shill
       </a>
       . And judging by your actions and past comments, this seems to be consistent with your activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you disagree with this assessment, then stop ignoring content, especially content that is lucid, factual, well-documented, cogent, etc... Analyze the content, consider it, then comment on it.
      </p>

      <p>
       On a thread that is well-documented fact makes you look like are part of an official campaign and agenda to supress this type of dialogue.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is not far-fetched, as anyone who follows what's going on knows of the activity of governments and official agencies to "steer" dialogue on sites like reddit.

       Well, sometimes I get annoyed by particularly stupid shit here, and I post annoyed comments. I've looked at some of the Obama-CIA "evidence" in the past and it's completely ridiculous.

       It was not a character attack. You have been identified as such and I was making that point. A character attack would be if I called you a doo-doo head.

       Oh, yeah, I've been "identified" as a shill. Just went over to r/shill. The guy that "identified" me as a shill is a crazy obsessed anti-semite.Every post of his is a "Israel did 9/11/Mossad is responsible for all the evil in the world!"

       Ahh, much like many of the users of reddit who post similar things as you, you do not know what anti-semitism is, or at least, you have an itchy anti-semitism trigger...
      </p>
      <p>
       So even the hyperbolic example you gave:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Israel did 9/11/Mossad is responsible for all the evil in the world!"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is not anti-semitism. Claiming that a country's intelligence operation is behind the events that shape the history of the world is that and only that. There is no anti-semitism in this statement. This would be an example of anti-semitism:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        All jews are evil.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is not actual quote, but just an example so we can clear up what anti-semitism is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, texmex is a respected
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       contributor, whereas you are popularly seen as a 'shill'. So what I am trying to say is, around here, your opinion is seen as total crap and does nothing to reduce our opinions of users like texmex.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is all, though I know you will say something provocative and I will have to fight my urge to correct your disinformation.

       I could post something on reddit saying that Bruce Willis is a bunny rabbit. In fact, I will:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       My posting this comment does not in fact mean that Bruce Willis "has been identified" as an actual bunny rabbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes when people post things on the internet, they are not true -- even if you really, really want them to be true. (I mean, wouldn't it be really cool if Bruce Willis
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a bunny rabbit?)

       You're being called a shill because for someone who claims to not care about this subreddit - you spend an awful lot of time here trying to derail conversation, smear posters, and just spew ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, your "annoyed comments" are completely unfounded and ridiculous. More ridiculous than what you're trying to mock.

       That's a perfect example. What evidence? How about looking at the evidence you're commenting on - instead of saying "LOL UR STUPID" based on something else you read at a completely different time.

       I don't go around calling people shills... and I haven't looked at your comment history, but judging entirely by your input in THIS thread - I'd have to agree. Shill.

       Business International Corporation, accused of functioning as a CIA front company.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to take the word of John Pilger, the man in the video. Here's Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <pre><code>The company has been identified as cover organization for the Central Intelligence Agency, e.g. see Lobster Magazine, issue 14 in 1987. According to a lengthy article in the New York Times in 1977, the co-founder of the company told the newspaper that "Eldridge Haynes [the other founder] had provided cover for four CIA employees in various countries between 1955 and 1960".

In his autobiography, "Dreams From My Fathers", Barack Obama writes of taking a job at some point after graduating from Columbia University in 1983. He describes his employer as "a consulting house to multinational corporations" in New York City, and his functions as a "research assistant" and "financial writer".

The odd part of Obama's story is that he doesn't mention the name of his employer. However, a New York Times story of 2007 identifies the company as Business International Corporation.

In his book, not only doesn't Obama mention his employer's name; he fails to say when he worked there, or why he left the job.
</code></pre>
      <p>
       he refused to mention a dangerous trip to Pakistan which he made at a time when travel to that country was discouraged by the State Department. That country was then the focus of the CIA's largest covert operation, the supplying of the Afghan mujahadeen. While there, this callow college kid met with one of the most powerful men in Pakistan -- a meeting arranged by an unnamed personage with the American Embassy. (Spook-watchers know what that means.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Adding to the mix is the fact that Ann Dunham, Obama's mother, had visited at least 13 countries in her lifetime, and had worked for companies that required travel to Pakistan. Her employers appear to have included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Ford Foundation, Women's World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. Note that USAID and the Ford Foundation have (allegedly) been used as covers for CIA agents. . . .

       I browse it because I am amused by the craziness here.

       You're not actually required to believe in the conventional wisdom of whatever subreddits you choose to browse.

       EDIT: Wait, did you just downvote a simple factual statement I made in a completely different subreddit? Classy.

       I like that you accuse me of "character attacks" and then call me a "shill."
