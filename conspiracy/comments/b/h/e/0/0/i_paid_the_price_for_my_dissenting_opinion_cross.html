        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>NOTE: I decided to self post this into the conspiracy subreddit and add some notes adding my thoughts on the New World Order.</p>

<p>I do not need to tell most of you what just happened today.  Alex Jones yesterday and today explained it pretty well on his show.</p>

<p>What amazes me is the sheer blindness of people and levels of them obeying Comrade Barky.  I never saw this type of loyalty from the neocons when Bush II was in office.  At least they questioned the free speech zones and the illegal war in Iraq.  The socialists just do whatever the hell they are told, without question.</p>

<p>I often wonder if America crashed which group of people would be the most dangerous to confront.  I am convinced, after today, it is socialists.  Without question.</p>

<p>Do not misunderstand.  I am no fan of the neocons either.  They are just as scummy and brutal as the socialists, but the socialist I think are far more dangerous to deal with.  You can form your own opinions of course.</p>

<p>So I was figuring today I would vote all Republican in November.  But is it even safe any more to even register to vote?  Rigging elections in the US is commonplace and being harassed because of who you voted for is the likely next stage in the deployment of the police state to be carried out by the authorities.  In fact, is one of the LAST steps before total tyranny. What should I do, or any us of do?  I dunno.  In fact, listening to Alex Jones even brings out more confirmations that we are more trouble than we realize. I am convinced he is now at a total loss of what to do as well.</p>

<p><strong>The Patriot Act did not steal as many freedoms as health care reform did today.</strong></p>

<p>I am going to have to think about this for a while now.</p>

<p>Below is what I posted to the main reddit.</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>Today, I started this morning at 8AM eastern with 8900 if comment karma and now I have 8774. A loss of 126. Why? Because I did not approve of the total bullshit health care reform that just fucked every American.</p>

<p>Do I honestly care that I lose karma? Nope. I do not. Karma has and always will be jack shit to me.</p>

<p>But I do like the idea I can come to reddit.com and express my views without the fear of being banned from reddit. A significant advantage over Digg since we all know, Digg banning people is SOP.</p>

<p>For those who downmodded me, please educate yourselves on this yet another attack on freedoms of all Americans. You dumb shits have zero clue what is about to happen to you. Events like 9/11 get your complete and undivided attention and make you knee-jerk react to the way they want you to do. Health Care reform is like slimy ambulance chasing lawyer oozing under the door when he comes to court. By the time you figure out what they did to you, it will be too late.</p>

<p>Was today worse than 9/11? In my opinion, yes it was. But I am a lot smarter than most people and I KNOW what is coming. Am I arrogant? Yes. Am I an asshole? Yes. Do I need your approval? Hell no. Do I care what you think? Not most of you.</p>

<p>The only way to beat this is if the Five Conservatives Bush I and Bush II loaded the court with can band together and bust this son of a bitch. Like I said. I tried to tell you people what we got and what is coming. But most of you are too fucking stupid to get past &quot;Barky can do no wrong&quot;. Trying to explain any further is going to be lost on most of you.</p>

<p>For those who agree and or upmodded, thank you. You are the few left who truly understand what fascist health care means, how it works with the national ID card scheme, and its overall place in making people just one more number in the corporate system. You people think (and they want you to think) that Obama just defeated the evil faceless health insurance megacorps. Wrong. You were just enslaved by them, but even if Obama got on TV and admitted it and laughed at you while doing so, you dumb bastards who spent the day downmodding me and calling me names and insults would still think it was great.</p>

<p>The human race is pitiful. Maybe you people deserve to be enslaved by these power hungry pieces of shit. Normally I would say have at it, but I have to live under the same system, for I am not rich or powerful. I&#39;ll get enslaved right along with you.</p>

<p>Time is short...</p>

<p>After today, I am definitely scaling back on redditing for a while. I have never seen such blind approval of anything. Reddit is full of socialist morons who are convinced what happened today was a good thing. You were just slammed with the most fascist piece of legislation in the history of the United States of America and most of you are too stupid to see it.</p>

<p>I am out for a while...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we abolished government involvement in the market, there would be price fixing, all sorts of collusion among competitors, and monopolies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, there wouldn&#39;t.  Every historical monopoly that lasted past the time somebody else figured out how to implement some technology, from the British East India Company  to Standard Oil to Microsoft, has been a consequence of government involvement.  Every single one.</p>

<p>Regulation narrows the range of companies, and hence, consumer choice in the market.  Decreased supply with constant demand means increased price.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want healthcare reform as much as the next guy, but you have to step back and look at it for what it is... The whole heathcare bit is nothing more than a nice little package wrapped up for the healthcare monopolies. they&#39;re going to have a hard time getting this to stick through the courts. They&#39;ve levied it on tax and stopped short of granting the IRS real collection powers... it&#39;s going to be interesting to watch this play out.</p>

<p>You can only do so much unless you&#39;re not willing to be part of normal society and live in a cabin in the woods instead. Not to mention being able to bitch about stuff you don&#39;t like about the government is pretty important. e.g. Your complaints bout this bill could eventually have you deemed dangerous by the government under the Patriot Act. For me the dangers from the Patriot Act are still worse because they attack the very rights given to us by the Founders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t put us all in the same boat here. I&#39;ve been a fan of a couple of RobinOhio1&#39;s netsec posts, but here he lost me and I have to respectfully disagree with some of his points. This bill is in no way worse than the Patriot Act and don&#39;t see how one can accuse people that support this bill are socialists.</p>

<p>Ohio is an odd state with an odd mix of people. I&#39;ve been here for 40+ years and I am still trying to figure it out. I think it has something to do with the fact that our neighbors are West Virginia and Kentucky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you library records can be searched and your phone calls monitored, fine, start encrypting and tunneling everything.  If you can&#39;t buy medicine that you want to buy, and if your taxes to pay for this program are too expensive, as well as the now waiting-to-be-more-monopolized insurance getting more expensive, and the medical care associated with it too expensive, well, guess what?  You owe them even more money, because you&#39;re not patriotic enough to be insured.  You are now dying and broke, and the water you drink from the faucet is making your skin fall off, and you can no longer buy bandages without a prescription.</p>

<p>Some of this is hyperbole.</p>
