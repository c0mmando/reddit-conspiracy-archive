Why run a criminal justice system like this? People like money. Privately run prisons get subsidies from the government and cops get quotas. Capitalism has many good attributes but you have to see the ways it is being manipulated to do some evil shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I went to prison for 2-3 months, I went in a young college kid and came out a &#39;hardened criminal&#39;.  I had been in 3 fights, knew alot more about crimes.  As in, how to hotwire cars, etc.  It&#39;s ridiculous in there, the state gives the prison/jail so much $ for one inmate and they cut corners as easy as they can.  Letting inmates work everything from laundry, to lawn care, to washing sheriff cars, to working in the kitchen instead of hiring staff.  Also, the worst food in there, you only eat what you need to.  Then they use canteen to make even more money.  Jails/Prisons make the most money for the counties/cities they&#39;re in by far, honestly.  As does probation.  Probation is a joke, just another money ploy, thieves and everything can get on probation if they have the cash to pay for probation.  Everything in the justice system is a joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Making prisoners work while in custody makes sense on lots of levels, unless you&#39;re going to claim that you and everybody else you met there was innocent...</p>

<p>Do you admit that prior to incarceration you committed crimes and that after spending time in jail you made some changes in your lifestyle so as to avoid returning (even if this just means avoiding crimes likely to return you there in favor of other ones)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an opportunity to work in a prison down south an it surprised me as to how professional and courteous both inmate and staff were. I saw a young black inmate loan his coat to an older white inmate and then when needing it back, go and get a blanket to replace it so the older man wouldn&#39;t be without. I saw inmates doing life without parole volunteer to work in the infirmary and do the dirty work of hospital nurse&#39;s aides... clean, bathe and care for older, less able inmates. I saw industry work, like upholstery, welding and other job skills being taught to inmates. At all times I saw everyone called Mr or Officer Smith or Inmate Smith. The areas were kept clean by inmates and everyone respected everyone else. Those who did get into fights, were taken to &quot;seg&quot; and most all went willingly without a fight or argument. The inmates I spoke with and worked with had hopes of getting out and had no intention of coming back. I also saw chairs and tables in the prison marked as &quot;upholstered by inmates&quot; or &quot;repaired by inmates&quot; as a show of pride by proud workers. I&#39;m not sure which facility you are talking about but the one I worked with was the way I thought it should be. Because a man has been sent to prison is no reason to treat him like an animal, unless you want an animal when he&#39;s released. </p>
