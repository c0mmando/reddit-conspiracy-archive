       There is no rehabilitation process taking place in the system. People go in with a chip on their shoulder and come out insane. Why run a criminal justice system like this? People like money. Privately run prisons get subsidies from the government and cops get quotas. Capitalism has many good attributes but you have to see the ways it is being manipulated to do some evil shit.

       Good call, but I would take it a little broader and say most modern types of banks. Investment banks, commercial banks.

       Banks as a societal tool are a great idea, but the accumulation of power within that system tends to work against my own principals.

       Honestly, I went to prison for 2-3 months, I went in a young college kid and came out a 'hardened criminal'.  I had been in 3 fights, knew alot more about crimes.  As in, how to hotwire cars, etc.  It's ridiculous in there, the state gives the prison/jail so much $ for one inmate and they cut corners as easy as they can.  Letting inmates work everything from laundry, to lawn care, to washing sheriff cars, to working in the kitchen instead of hiring staff.  Also, the worst food in there, you only eat what you need to.  Then they use canteen to make even more money.  Jails/Prisons make the most money for the counties/cities they're in by far, honestly.  As does probation.  Probation is a joke, just another money ploy, thieves and everything can get on probation if they have the cash to pay for probation.  Everything in the justice system is a joke.

       Making prisoners work while in custody makes sense on lots of levels, unless you're going to claim that you and everybody else you met there was innocent...
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you admit that prior to incarceration you committed crimes and that after spending time in jail you made some changes in your lifestyle so as to avoid returning (even if this just means avoiding crimes likely to return you there in favor of other ones)?

       I was there on a Driving With License Revoked, although everyone I know with any SERIOUS crimes on their record usually end up committing more crimes because they can't find a decent job.  And I don't disagree with making prisoners work, we actually enjoyed it instead of being a small box all day, i'm just saying the little ways that go a LONG, LONG way to making them highly profitable.

       Driving without a license led to time in jail?  I think there's more to your story or you're in some jurisdiciton with plenty of money and no prison crowding, i.e. you're not in California where I live and violent felons rarely serve full senteces and frequently don't get sent back for parole violations (rapist serial murderer John Gardner for one example).

       I live in Bum Fuck Egypt, North Carolina.  60 days max for DWLR, I got 30 on that charge and a couple other traffic violations (unpaid speed tickets, unpaid fines) led to 55 days in the county jail.  Felony Possesion Of Stolen Goods/ Felony Larceny led to 6 months in Prison.

       I often think the same about the immigration in the UK, Labour opened up the boarders and built various detention centers and awarded the contracts to first G4, now the prisons and detention centers are run by SERCO (as were the boarder security). Let the people in, let them run free, catch them, then invoice the government.

       I don't know about "Greatest scams ever," but Bush's stolen election in 2000 and 2004 and Obama's comparatively less wrong PR campaign of "Yes We Can" bliss in 2008 are the two biggest election scams of recent history.

       It's not a private business that is holding the gun to your head but the government. Never forget who is holding the gun to your head. Us Libertarians wan't less people (government) holding guns to your heads. Yes, it's that simple.

       I had an opportunity to work in a prison down south an it surprised me as to how professional and courteous both inmate and staff were. I saw a young black inmate loan his coat to an older white inmate and then when needing it back, go and get a blanket to replace it so the older man wouldn't be without. I saw inmates doing life without parole volunteer to work in the infirmary and do the dirty work of hospital nurse's aides... clean, bathe and care for older, less able inmates. I saw industry work, like upholstery, welding and other job skills being taught to inmates. At all times I saw everyone called Mr or Officer Smith or Inmate Smith. The areas were kept clean by inmates and everyone respected everyone else. Those who did get into fights, were taken to "seg" and most all went willingly without a fight or argument. The inmates I spoke with and worked with had hopes of getting out and had no intention of coming back. I also saw chairs and tables in the prison marked as "upholstered by inmates" or "repaired by inmates" as a show of pride by proud workers. I'm not sure which facility you are talking about but the one I worked with was the way I thought it should be. Because a man has been sent to prison is no reason to treat him like an animal, unless you want an animal when he's released.
