       Reddit.com promotes itself “the front page of the Internet,” and indeed, it is one of the most visited sites on the Web. As of this writing,
       <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com#">
        Alexa has ranked it
       </a>
       as the Internet’s 53rd most visited site in the U.S., and the 121st most visited site globally, and its popularity appears to be rapidly growing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who first comes to Reddit.com sees a banner running across the top of their page featuring various “sub-reddits” (subject matters) for them to choose from. If they have an account and log in, the subreddits change to those subjects they have selected to form their own personalized front page. But if they are not logged in, the banner running across the top of Reddit’s front page stays the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the subreddits featured on the top page banner is
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism">
        r/Atheism
       </a>
       . Thus, millions of people every day are automatically “subscribed” to r/atheism until they establish and log in to their own accounts, and choose their own subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       And with over 850,000 "godless redditors" (as members who have formally subscribed to r/atheism dub themselves) clearly r/atheism enjoys a tremendous promotional advantage over the hundreds of other subreddits available in attracting the attention of potential subscribers by being featured on Reddit.com's front page and as an automatic default reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In theory, atheism is “the doctrine or belief that there is no God.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In practice, at least on Reddit's r/atheism, it is the vicious and relentless ridicule, mockery, and smearing of Jesus, Christian people, the Church, organized Christianity, and all of Christendom in general...which is fine. In a freedom of speech-based democracy, everyone is entitled to their own opinion and perspective on politics and religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, given that
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism#Soviet_repressions">
        tens of millions
       </a>
       of Christian clergy, ruling class, “bourgeoisie,” dissidents, and simple peasants were
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Soviet_Union">
        murdered and persecuted by Soviet Communism,
       </a>
       (which was an
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HUjrprciCM">
        explicitly anti-Christian ideology,
       </a>
       and given that
       <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Atheism_and_Mass_Murder">
        perhaps hundreds of millions
       </a>
       have been murdered worldwide by atheistic Communism, how fair is it for Reddit to essentially herd millions of its readers straight towards r/atheism by making it a default subreddit on the one hand, and yet for reddit moderators to complain about "hate" on the other hand?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, reddit moderators regularly issue statements condemning the kind of bigotry that Reddit.com actually endorses on its front page via r/atheism, like
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/sxoaz/a_statement_from_the_rvideos_mods_regarding/">
        this one
       </a>
       recently posted in the popular subreddit r/videos:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A statement from the
        <a href="/r/videos">
         /r/videos
        </a>
        mods regarding racist comments
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past few weeks we've noticed a surge in the amount of racist material posted here, to the point where we are considering a change in policy to address it. We suspect that one or more racist/troll organizations may be specifically targeting us (and possibly Reddit as a whole), with members systematically posting both explicitly and subtly prejudiced comments.
       </p>
       <p>
        We would prefer not to have to intervene and take an official stance to censor comments, so we're asking the community to please be mindful and to respond appropriately to any such hurtful content. Thank you.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And imagine the hue and cry if Reddit prominently featured one of its
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanJewishPower/">
        anti-Jewish sites
       </a>
       on the front page, and herded millions of readers there. Charges of “racism” and “anti-Semitism” would undoubtedly fly.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, don't critics have just as much right to mock and smear Jewish icons, Jewish people, the Synagogue, organized Judaism, and all of Jewry in general as r/atheism has the right to mock and smear Christians, and as Reddit.com corporate hierarchy has the right to encourage such mockery?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all of the hundreds of subreddits available for default status, there has to be some reason the hierarchy of Reddit keeps the virulently anti-Christian r/atheism as a default subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the strong
       <a href="http://www.libertariantoday.com/2012/06/buried-role-of-zionists-in-soviet-mass.html">
        Trotskyite neoliberal Zionist identification with Marxism,
       </a>
       and the fact that "atheist" Soviet Communism was
       <a href="http://www.henrymakow.com/stalin.html">
        initially a conflation of Leninism and Trotskyism
       </a>
       , which outlawed Christianity and made “anti-Semitism” punishable by death, is it possible that Reddit readers are being manipulated by a neoliberal/Zionist agenda of the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">
        corporate behemoth Advance Publications,
       </a>
       which owns Reddit and itself is principally owned by the
       <a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=223">
        Jewish Newhouse family?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, such a scenario is highly likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a call for censorship, but rather for Christians, paleocons, patriots, populists, libertarians, anti-war advocates, pro-sovereignty nationalists, family advocates etc. to "take off the gloves" and start playing by the same rules of free speech that their opposition plays by, and to engage in the kind of polemics that the gaggle of militant Jews, Marxists, neoliberals, radical feminists and angry homosexual activists, etc. over at r/atheism routinely engage in, in order to counter and balance out the anti-Christian hate being preached there with increasing ferocity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, since the anti-Christian r/atheism is featured on Reddit’s front page, there needs to be an opposing forum also included on the front page to expose readers to that perspective, as well, in order to balance out what appears to be the warmongering
       <a href="http://www.judeofascism.com/2012/06/diaspora-zionists-wear-many-masks.html">
        Marxist-Zionist
       </a>
       agenda behind featuring the anti-Christian r/atheism on Reddit.com's front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is all about free speech and should remain that way. Soviet holocaust or not, Nazi Holocaust or not, declaring oneself a member of some religious sect, tribe or "protected class" is not a license for immunity from debate, criticism, and even harsh condemnation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christians and their partisans should no longer stand there and be beaten black and blue by the militant coalition of the bitter and angry over at r/atheism, and its relentless preaching of genocidal hate, mockery and condemnation (the same kind of rhetoric, which when directed at them, they declare "hate speech") without giving as good as they receive -- particularly since so many of these r/atheism useful idiots are being manipulated by neocon, neoliberal and Zionist operatives to perpetuate the wars of aggression
       <a href="http://mailstar.net/iraq-war.html">
        they originated
       </a>
       under their right-wing useful idiot Bush in order to set up a Big Brother police state both at home and abroad.

       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism
       </a>
       myself, but this is definitely no conspiracy. That subreddit consists mostly of high school/college aged kids that have grown up being told non-believers will burn in hell. They hold a tremendous grudge against their families and neighbors who have made them feel like scum. The only reason it's anti-Christian leaning is Christianity tends to be the only religion that is so massively hostile towards atheism. Judaism is mostly indifferent, considering all non-Jews to be one in the same. I'm disgusted by
       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism
       </a>
       as much as the next guy, especially as an atheist myself, but there's absolutely nothing sinister going on. Most of these kids will grow out of it a few years and the ones that don't will go on to live massively depressing lives.

       Not really, I am an equal opportunity offender.  Im an Atheist.  It means I do not believe in god(s).  This would pretty much cover all religions but I am flattered that you think we are singling you (christianity) out.

       It is quite telling that that r/atheism relentlessly attacks Christianity and Islam, but rarely touches on Judaism and Zionism. We have been involved in conflicts in the Middle East for over 20 years largely due to the power of the Jewish elite in the USA. R/atheism reads more like a Jewish tribal tool of subversion and subterfuge.

       You do realize that most of the western world is or was majority Christian, right? There are only a few million religious Jews, and over 1 billion Catholics alone. Never mind the Protestants and the over 1 billion Muslims. Also,

        Christianity

       You make good points. You are correct, atheism is largely devoted to attacking and mocking Christianity. Atheists don't seem to spend much time mocking Judaism. I wonder why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oops, no I don't. I know why -- because Christians are the
       <em>
        only religious group
       </em>
       on the planet that is freely attacked, defamed, insulted, degraded, and mocked without any objection being raised, and without any negative consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       What atheists (and others, such as Jews) say about Christianity wouldn't be permitted to be said about any other religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity is being deliberately targeted and attacked by the mass media in the United States, and this attack has been going on for decades. Atheism is just one weapon of this attack. The ultimate goal of those who control the media ... the destruction of Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should add, I am not a practicing Christian. I'm not saying this out of any slavish devotion to any religious creed. I say it because it is true, and because I can be objective enough to see what is going on, and honest enough to state what I see.

       When Christians in America aren't trying to turn the country into some type of Theocracy, then I'll turn more of my attention to other religions.
Also: Christians: 80% of the US Population, 90% of the Prison Population
Atheist/Non-Religious: 10% of the US Population, but only .023% of the Prison Population.
