Does anyone else know more about this and perhaps some reasonable, intelligent information as to why or why not this is legit or not?

    <div class="md"><p>This kinda stuff reminds me of the &quot;Elections won&#39;t happen this year, as we will descend into Martial Law!&quot; which of course echoes 2008, when people were saying the exact same thing.</p>

<p>So; we&#39;ll stick to &quot;believe it when it happens.&quot;</p>

<p>edit;</p>

<p>Also two other things:</p>

<p>Why the hell does every conspiracy site have to look so trashy? I mean come on, I self taught myself web design in junior high school.. </p>

<p>and I love quotes like this from &#39;predictors&#39;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drake also said &quot;we have won&quot; and people may see mass arrests and politicians being removed from office will be broadcasted on main stream media maybe this week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No better way to keep people interested than saying &quot;maybe it will happen this week.&quot; Because if it doesn&#39;t, I&#39;ll keep predicting!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I can concede the possibility of said substances being used to facilitate such negative experiences, generally speaking they do <strong>not</strong> yield such experiences.  You have to be a special breed of idiot to start talking to &quot;light beings from andromeda&quot; while high and thinking they are an inch away from revealing themselves to humanity and solving all our problems.  Do not conflate psychedelics with these dolts.  Rarely do I hear said dolts accredit psychonautic substances, in any case.</p>

<p>Complete hear-say. Would never stand up in court or any intellectual arguments. You need sources for your argument.

<p>Correct. This situation would be ironic if he didn&#39;t have pot in his system. <strong>The irony is in them blaming <em>bath salts</em> first</strong>. When the obvious drug to be blamed would be cannabis which <strong>was</strong> found in his system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha! All of that crowd have massive ego problems. Can&#39;t wait to see nothing happen next week and hearing the latest excuse. </p>

<p>Edit: just turned on sky news. Massive banking enquiry is about to begin and changes to the industry. Maybe I&#39;ll be eating humble pie next week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following Drake since February, and he <em>really</em> knows his stuff. He&#39;s been able to answer some pretty tough questions with some very good answers.</p>

<p>But again, we&#39;ll see what the next week brings us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?  There&#39;s no Bilderberg/Federal Reserve/etc?  It&#39;s blatantly obvious what is going on now.  Pyramidal fiat money scheme is in power.  You are in the &quot;camp&quot; if you take their orders for your wealth.  Compartmentalization makes it hard to tell who&#39;s giving the orders though.  But if I&#39;m wrong, enlighten me.</p>
