       So I recently found this conspiracy surround a person named Drake and how he has predicted that once he gives the Green Light signal, within 72 hours there'd be mass arrests. Does anyone else know more about this and perhaps some reasonable, intelligent information as to why or why not this is legit or not? I found this:

       The same thing was said for the month of April by david wilcock.
Now it's a guy named drake but for the 4th of July.

       I'd like to believe this is true, but this is just highly unlikely.

       This kinda stuff reminds me of the "Elections won't happen this year, as we will descend into Martial Law!" which of course echoes 2008, when people were saying the exact same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So; we'll stick to "believe it when it happens."

       Also two other things:

      <p>
       Why the hell does every conspiracy site have to look so trashy? I mean come on, I self taught myself web design in junior high school..
      </p>
      <p>
       and I love quotes like this from 'predictors'
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Drake also said "we have won" and people may see mass arrests and politicians being removed from office will be broadcasted on main stream media maybe this week.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No better way to keep people interested than saying "maybe it will happen this week." Because if it doesn't, I'll keep predicting!

       My personal belief is that this is more BS.  It seems like something designed to lull people into complacency.  "Don't worry about it, I've got this all under control.  I just have to get the pieces in place and then... someday... I'm going to pull the trigger and BAM everyone's problems will be solved.  Trust us, we'll take care of it"

       I'm not in a camp, just making shit up from my imagination.  It would be nice if there was a camp to be in.  As far as I can tell, there's only the bad guy camp, where you get symbols for subservience.

       While I can concede the possibility of said substances being used to facilitate such negative experiences, generally speaking they do
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       yield such experiences.  You have to be a special breed of idiot to start talking to "light beings from andromeda" while high and thinking they are an inch away from revealing themselves to humanity and solving all our problems.  Do not conflate psychedelics with these dolts.  Rarely do I hear said dolts accredit psychonautic substances, in any case.

       Complete hear-say. Would never stand up in court or any intellectual arguments. You need sources for your argument. And if you're not well versed in something

        do not

       It's up to you. If you wanted you could edit it some. Maybe turn the thing you heard into a question and include the word
       <strong>
        drugs
       </strong>
       over psychedelics. This will include crystal meth, crack, valium, xanax, alcohol and others into the idea of controlling the masses.

       No it's not ironic. He had cannabis in his system. It stays in your fat for, roughly, 30 days. He had stopped smoking cannabis to "become a better Christian" and it happened to still be in his system.

       Correct. This situation would be ironic if he didn't have pot in his system.
       <strong>
        The irony is in them blaming

        first

       Really?  There's no Bilderberg/Federal Reserve/etc?  It's blatantly obvious what is going on now.  Pyramidal fiat money scheme is in power.  You are in the "camp" if you take their orders for your wealth.  Compartmentalization makes it hard to tell who's giving the orders though.  But if I'm wrong, enlighten me.

       It's not to say that those things don't exist whatsoever. It says that as long as you or anyone else views this situation as an Us v. Them situation , that's exactly what it will be. There is no They. Just Us. "They" are a result of Fear. If you really want to solve the problem facing our race; bridge the gap by changing your language\programming first.

       I don't think of this situation as "us vs them", 'they' do.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We are all one" and "there is no good or evil, just be" is all great flowers-and-roses until "they" (or more accurately, those that 'they' control or have brainwashed) come smashing down your door to pull you off to face whatever inquisition is hot up their pants.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love for us all to get along, but what are we going to do to bring 'them' to our side?  Actually, I think I know the answer to that, but the real dilemma is one of physical proximity.  These people have separated themselves from what is good, and for what...?  Valuable symbols.  What a shitshow.
      </p>
      <p>
       You gotta hand it to 'them'.  They conquered humanity with nothing more than symbols.  Occult indeed.

       Yeah, I know what you mean, but I'm not interested in saving anyone so I don't dictate my behavior towards benevolence. He was attacking and being both insecure and douschie. As long as it's delivered without malice, I'll learn to live with myself. 
Good to meet you though. Good luck on your journey. Cheers.

       My concern is that that's what it will be sold as, but in actuality, it'll just be the aware arrested.  A whole bunch of defenceless nobodies with ugly mugshots to jeer at on tv.  Meanwhile the true culprits remain in place to be exonerated.  "See, we weren't the bad guys after all."

You are in the "camp" if you take their orders for your wealth.  Compartmentalization makes it hard to tell who's giving the orders though.  But if I'm wrong, enlighten me.
