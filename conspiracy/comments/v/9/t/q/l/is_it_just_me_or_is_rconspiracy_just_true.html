    <div class="md"><p>This also works the other way around, a lot of conspiracy theorists want or need to believe in a world that is being run by an evil power elite with an agenda that threatens the world. It provides a clear enemy, and also offers a more simplified and comforting world-view, even if that view is of a world at risk. It&#39;s much more comforting and more easily comprehensible to see the troubles in the world as a result of a single-source (zionists, NWOs, bilberbergers, etc) than as the results of a complex array of greed, incompotence, pettiness etc. If these evils stem from one group, then they can more easily be explained away and eventually &quot;stopped&quot;. And so, despite facts that often disprove or discredit certain theories, a level of cognitive dissonance is applied to continue believing that the ills of society stem from some outside group, not from the nature of society itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>right.. You cant prove a negative.  An assertion, without evidence, shouldn&#39;t be accepted as true.  Its easy to believe in nothing with this approach, but that&#39;s better than believing anything imo.  EIther way critical thought is needed and its easy to just run with what positive re-enforcement you surround yourself with.  I hate RushL. as much as anyone, but I hate when he is right even more, because then I feel like he has value. Giving value to someone you disagree with makes you feel uncertain; and uncertainty is uncomfortable enough to let illogical emotion override critical thought.  News is news despite what the guys with all the money and connections say.  You need to weigh it against reason no matter how badly you need it to fit your narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or satisfy primal schizophrenic urges.  Most of the content I see here is set for the loony bin.  There are a few gems, but most of this subreddit is garbage.</p>

<p>People that blindly follow conspiracy theories without examining the evidence are just as bad as people that blindly accept fox news and governmental sources.  The irony is lost on most unfortunately.  </p>

<p>Examine the evidence, come to your own conclusions.  Don&#39;t believe everything the government says, and don&#39;t believe everything Alex Jones says either.  Everyone has their own agenda, and people that push conspiracy theories do as well.  </p>

<p>The reality is that the truth is somewhere in between, a murky confusing grey area.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler was defeated and died 67 years ago. The Jewish have dominated the US news media and Hollywood since before WW I. </p>

<p>Sometimes this fraudulent quote — “The bigger the lie the more people will believe it” — is attributed to the Third Reich’s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. The fact of the matter is that neither Goebbels nor Hitler made that statement. Goebbels, in fact, said the opposite, stressing that the best propaganda is that which does no more than serve the truth:</p>

<p>“Good propaganda does not need to lie, indeed it may not lie. It has no reason to fear the truth. It is a mistake to believe that people cannot take the truth. They can. It is only a matter of presenting the truth to people in a way that they will be able to understand. A propaganda that lies proves that it has a bad cause. It cannot be successful in the long run.” (Goebbels at Nuremberg Rally, 1934)</p>

<p>There will be some that don&#39;t want to believe it, sometimes even the wife with bruises in plain view. Excuses are made for the behavior for those who choose to overlook it.  Husband overstressed/worked, wife thinks she deserved it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what conclusions?  and how do you suppose people go about investigating, getting witnesses to sing, and obtaining such evidence?</p>

<p>how about this.</p>

<p>a building is observed to undergo global collapse at free fall acceleration.   propose a hypothesis and test it.   </p>

<p>so NIST proposes fire, or damge, but neither satisfies the observations, nor can experiments reproduce the phenomenon so we throw that theory out.    next hypothesis is demolition.  we test the hypothesis.  It is consistent with the observations.   we try to disprove the demolition hypothesis.   so far it has not been done.   therefore demolition is the most likely and only cause consistent with the observations... and there are lots of supporting observation consistent with demolition.  it&#39;s called the scientific method.  </p>

<p>p.s. it was a shitty job since so many people question the official myth.  it doesn&#39;t hold up to the scrutiny of the scientific method.</p>

<p>the offficial myth is the story that is used to support faulty conclusion based on incomplete and unexamined evidence.   not science.  get it straight boy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, though I find the way that people here question things is what is flawed. </p>

<p>Most everyone here has an agenda, usually to prove to others that the ridiculous plot they believe in is true. To that end, they only really question the things that would prove their theory right if that thing were proven wrong. </p>

<p>For instance your theory that maybe just maybe the government planted explosives in the towers. Sure, that sounds almost reasonable, but when you take a step back and really look at that claim it requires <em>huge</em> leaps to come to. Did the government have explosives planted in every building in NYC? Did they hire the hijackers? Did they plan for the other flights to fail? Who has the power to OK thousands of deaths to come to these ends? </p>

<p>So in the end it&#39;s really not quite as simple as &quot;well maybe this minor change isn&#39;t so unreasonable,&quot; it&#39;s more &quot;let me get my foot in the door with this minor change so the next step will be that much easier to believe.&quot;</p>

Is 20% what your waiting for? 30%? A majority? Doesn&#39;t it even get a few gears moving wondering why they question the governments story? I mean come on, the 9/11 commission&#39;s book doesn&#39;t even address building 7, most don&#39;t even know three structures fell that day. Are you Seriously try to tell me that this:

<p>Because people look for conspiracies in every significant event throughout history, and it&#39;s not like Americans have a lot of faith in the government now a days.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean come on, the 9/11 commission&#39;s book doesn&#39;t even address building 7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because the 9/11 commission was more to do with the events leading up to 9/11.  I don&#39;t even think it talked about the technical reasons for the buildings collapse, because everyone saw a couple of huge jets crash into them.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This video, like many 9/11 theories is filled with conjecture, red herrings, and lies.  Like trying to portray OBL as some kind of primitive idiot because he hid in caves, and assuming that the US government would shoot down a hijacked plane even though that had never been done before and nobody knew they were on a suicide mission.  It even included straight out lies like the fact that the Seal team that killed OBL was killed in a helicopter crash afterwards.  The crash killed a few SEAL members, but none of the ones from the OBL mission because there are more than one SEAL team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slippery slope, I never said anything about all historical events, I was under the impression we were just talking about one. That &#39;9/11 theory&#39; video is the Official story spoon feed to the public by the MSM &amp; government. &amp; seriously, even people on the commission criticized it!
John Farmer, Jr., senior counsel to the Commission stated that the Commission &quot;discovered that...what government and military officials had told Congress, the Commission, the media, and the public about who knew what when — was almost entirely, and inexplicably, untrue.&quot; Farmer continues: &quot;At some level of the government, at some point in time … there was a decision not to tell the truth about what happened...The (NORAD) tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public.&quot; Thomas Kean, the head of the 9/11 Commission, concurred: &quot;We to this day don’t know why NORAD told us what they told us, it was just so far from the truth.&quot;
&amp; you really think that someone on kidney dialysis in 2001 was able to stay alive for another decade? Man as long as I have the accounts of Steve Pieczenik on my side I could never go back to the fairy tale world that&#39;s fabricated around us. He worked with Bin Laden in the 80&#39;s &amp; knew him well. Because of historical figures, authors &amp; people from the inside like Bernays, Carroll Quigley, John Perkins, Charlotte Iserbyt, Servando Gonzales, &amp; William Engdahl. There are just too many people out there that have come out showing the facade that is American politics! &amp; once it&#39;s all understood the current state of things makes perfect sense, it&#39;s all by design. 9/11 pave the way for the Patriot act &amp; the eroding of personal liberties. &amp; it&#39;s so hard for you to believe any of it because it challenges your world view, &amp; because of that you&#39;ll always dismiss it using the crutch that has been built for you by the globalists. People are not as psychologically independent as they believe &amp; are Far more influence in their Decision making then they could possibly imagine. They have been trying to construct this world government for over a century &amp; early on they became very good at it. The thoughts &amp; perspectives of We the People is the battle field, &amp; thankfully because of the Internet we&#39;ve been able to slow them down &amp; expose them for who they really are. It sucks, it&#39;s hard to believe, but in the end it&#39;s the true reality of the state of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that everything is a conspiracy or a government cover-up, but it&#39;s people like you (the vast majority of americans too unfortunately) that don&#39;t look logically at the situation and accept what you are told without using your common sense.  If you have done any actual research and still totally accept the story about 9/11 and the death of OBL, then you are either not paying attention, or not intelligent enough to look at information and make your own conclusions.  I would even accept you saying there was at least a shred of doubt that the official story is 100% accurate.  Since that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case, I would stop trolling here and please  move on to r/obama or something where you will be right at home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but I&#39;ve been lurking on reddit for years. Your straw man logic is just awful. For example, paid shills on here, by your logic, would be promoting your oddly clutched cognitive dissonance views that everything is fine and only tin foil hat wearing paranoid people believe such outrageous ideas. See I should be paid, for what I am doing. But instead I have to remind myself how doomed mankind is because of the waves of steeple like you who would rather live blissfully ignorant insisting that everything is fine. When in fact we are told nothing but lies and this whole system is about to collapse (by design) and push the Orwellian one world government agenda into full effect. This should make you mad, at them not a board of open minded individuals talking about issues that never see the light of day on your moms evening news program. Anyways I doubt this means anything to you I&#39;m sure you will just come up with more truth hate speak. All I can say is you will see. You will see.

<p>That&#39;s for a gas and has nothing to do with the energy of a falling object.</p>

<p>Show me the equation you used to calculate that kinetic energy produces 1300C hotspots that burn for months and molten steel.</p>

<p>Something like that would be way too difficult for me to handle as I&#39;m not a scientist or engineer, but the point is that falling objects give off a large amount of energy.  Combine that with two jets worth of fuel and I don&#39;t see why this is so outrageous.</p>

<p>I see you have the list of conspiracy theory talking points and buzzwords.  Why is that cognitive dissonance, can you tell me?  Simply of existence of another plane doesn&#39;t mean anything other than there are other planes.  I bet there were a number of people carrying guns the day that JFK was assassinated, it was Texas after all, but that doesn&#39;t mean that they all killed him.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t even have a rudimentary understanding of science do you?  The act of &quot;pulverizing the buildings to dust&quot; would generate a massive amount of frictional energy AKA heat.  Not to mention that without knowing the specific amount of energy created there is no way to know that it was all being used to destroy the building.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the jet fuel is burned off right away</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if the fuel was burned off &quot;right away&quot;, which I doubt is the case, the heat doesn&#39;t just immediately dissipate.  It is transferred into the materials that formed the debris pile.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Another overused word in the subreddit.  And along with &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; you don&#39;t seem to know what this one means either.  What did I say that was a red herring and why?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Why would any take one absolutist stance when they could take another absolutist stance?</p>

<p>Because the world isn&#39;t absolute. It&#39;s random and chaotic and unpredictable.</p>

<p>I generally trust the government because, when it comes down to it, 99% of government are people just like us. They&#39;re not criminal masterminds, they&#39;re not evil dictators and they&#39;re not power hungry conspirators. As easy as having money and power makes things, the sheer amount of regular, individual human beings one has to pass on the way means that not everything that could be a secret (yet everyone &quot;knows&quot; about it anyway) plot to rule the world actually <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>And &quot;everyone&quot; doesn&#39;t &quot;KNOW&quot; how dishonest politicians are, because some of us <em>are</em> politicians, or have them in our families, or have personal relationships with the people they&#39;ve elected. Yes, there is a lot of corruption in politics, just as there&#39;s corruption in the private sectors, just as people lie, cheat and steal amongst each other every single day. That it&#39;s at a higher scale doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s more nefarious.</p>

<p>Honestly, in my personal opinion, I&#39;d <em>much</em> sooner trust an elected government official with special advisors (or with special expertise themselves) making sense in a public announcement, than I would a bunch of anonymous people on the internet that all gather together in a forum literally <em>called</em> &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open-minded, and I&#39;m certainly not one to hold unwarranted trust with authorities, but you have to consider the alternative as well. I mean, really... Compare the internet and politics, and you tell me which is more made up of lies, scams, cheats and general deceit? To me, politics is just the lesser of two evils in that case.</p>

<p>No, because then you&#39;d be making absolutist statements...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[...] but there&#39;s a reason congress has SUCH a low approval rating: the public thinks VERY low of politicians.</p>

<p>Yes, and to be perfectly clear, that&#39;s because America&#39;s politics are quite fucked up. Sorry to say it, but it&#39;s true. Congress <em>are</em> doing a bad job, don&#39;t get me wrong, but trying to improve a rapidly failing nation of several hundred million when people refuse to give government <em>any</em> trust whatsoever isn&#39;t exactly a one day job.</p>

<p>The American attitude right now is one of &quot;we don&#39;t trust the government&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s the government going to do to fix that&quot; <em>at the same time</em>. Do you see the problem in that? You&#39;re expecting government to fix a problem you refuse to give government the resources they need to fix.</p>

<p>Congress gets nothing done because it can&#39;t get past the partisan bickering, because partisanship is what the voters have voted for, instead of voting for people who&#39;ll go across the lines to <em>get something done</em>. I see this, because my own government in my country is starting to suffer from the same problem. Luckily, we have 8 parties right now, not just two, which mitigates <em>some</em> of these problems, but the real issue is that the largest two parties are not only devouring the smaller ones at a rapid rate, but also converging at the middle to form one big, meaningless blob of politicians that - just like in the US right now - won&#39;t be able to get anything whatsoever done.</p>

<p>Free market isn&#39;t going to fix <em>your</em> economy, they&#39;re going to fix <em>their</em> economy. If you think they&#39;re the same, then I honestly have no idea why your coming at me for not being cynical enough. Free market hasn&#39;t been particularly &quot;free&quot; for a long time, and not because of government regulation, but because of the <em>lack</em> of government regulation. They&#39;re finding ways to slip between country borders, not paying taxes anywhere, paying less for more workers, and generally destroying any small-business economy they can to replace it with their global corporations instead.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a <em>free</em> market at all, and right now, as corrupt as your government is, it&#39;s still the <em>only</em> thing standing between you and them.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Which might have worked when the country was 30 million, not 300, and before industrialization and the new IT economy. Old isn&#39;t always better, and the USA of back then, as cool an experiment as it was, is what allowed the mess that we have today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A sound money system controlled by congress not by a private bank. As well as an economy that is free with no corporate welfare and garbage like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with the first, money should be federal and not private, but I disagree with the second. Well, strictly speaking, I somewhat agree with the second as well, but you <em>need</em> to have government regulate the free market. A country doesn&#39;t become better the less laws there are to protect people from other people, nor will it become better the less laws there are to protect people from corporations. Government, whether you like it or not, is still the last line of defense fighting <em>for</em> the people. Yes, right now, that defense is extremely weak and entirely infiltrated by the enemy, but the fact still remains: a truly <em>free</em> market would wreak havoc on the people.</p>

<p>I go back to my original point: the world isn&#39;t absolute. The best answer is neither a 100% controlled market, nor a 100% free market. No, the best answer is a market controlled by an entity made up by the very people this entity is meant to protect.</p>

<p>When a village is attacked by raiders, what&#39;s the first thing you do? Build a wall. Government is that wall, or rather is <em>supposed</em> to be that wall. Giving everyone guns and telling them to simply protect themselves doesn&#39;t work. The best defense is <em>coordinated</em> and <em>collective</em>.</p>

<p>I find this subreddit pretty stupid, that&#39;s my disclaimer (I mean, for goodness sake, the jerking in this thread is abominable) but this time I&#39;m going to play the cynic. <strong>How does everyone simply KNOW how dishonest politicians/governments are?</strong> Do you know by experience? I highly doubt it. Do you learn it through observing how the media summarises it for you, &#39;unfiltered&#39; (since we all know that only conservative media outlets such as Fox News have an ideological agenda)? Did you learn it at school, along with many other &#39;objective&#39; things? Are you studying politics at university, the birthplace of untampered, neutral reason? No, I&#39;m sure that as a liberal, probably atheist, highly intelligent <em>redditor</em>, you have come to the above conclusion all by yourself.</p>

<p>Why do you believe that all governments always lie, and everything the world says about how dishonest politicians are is obviously true and accepted by everyone? Why do you believe that truth cannot possibly be found in an &#39;official story&#39; but that it is your calling to discover the hidden secrets that lie everywhere, because only you can recognise what the truth is?</p>

<p>The reality is that you are just as much influenced by the voices you value in the world as anybody else, and your blatant (and frankly infantile) double standard is an indication of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look it up. It&#39;s history. Rudolf Hess was a top Nazi official. He got into a plane on May 10, 1941, and flew to Scotland, where he parachuted from his plane and was captured. He told his captors that he had an important secret message for the Duke of Hamilton, that he would deliver only to the Duke in private. It was apparently a peace mission. Churchill had everything hushed up and Hess was put into prison. It is still a big state secret as to what Hess wanted to say, but Hess&#39;s wife reported her husband saying these words:</p>

<p><em>&quot;My coming to England in this way is, as I realise, so unusual that nobody will easily understand it. I was confronted by a very hard decision. I do not think I could have arrived at my final choice unless I had continually kept before my eyes the vision of an endless line of children&#39;s coffins with weeping mothers behind them, both English and German, and another line of coffins of mothers with mourning children.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Big evil Nazi, right? He was declared to be insane by Churchill and locked up in solitary confinement until 1987, prevented from writing anything to anyone or talking to anyone, and at age 93 he was finally murdered in his cell by his captors.</p>

<p>What he had to say is <em>still</em> a fucking state secret. What we can assume is that it involved the royal family or their relatives, and that the last thing Churchill wanted in 1941 was peace. Churchill wanted war. He was a warmongering asshole, and almost everything almost everyone thinks they know about the causes of WW2 and the motives of the Nazis is nothing but Allied propaganda, written and disseminated by the Jews for their own purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they are biased. We get official documents detailing the most heinous crimes committed by America and we are supposed to take it lightly? Those who know about it are pissed the fuck off. So we show it all and not with the small words you are used to on fox news to portray as something not as harmful as it really is. It&#39;s shown pure as what it is. People who complain that it is biased are people who don&#39;t want to know the truth and want it deleted. Simple as that. If you read the wikipedia and then go to the actual dossiers by the CIA you will see that there is no lie in the wiki. Now stop commenting on me, troll.

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve noticed is that very few individuals do any actual investigating. They find stories on the Internet and post them here. Meanwhile, the mainstream media get their stories pre-written from the White House or from AIPAC or other special interests, and just print them as they receive them. Actual journalism, as it once existed in America -- a person going outside and actually looking into events surrounding a particular story, seems to be so rare as to be almost mythical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much of the problem is going to be the semantics of a lot of it. When you say &#39;truth&#39; that&#39;s going to be subjective, what should be stated is &#39;reality&#39;. We are trying to discover the Reality of the situation at hand. &amp; thanks to people like Carroll Quigley, John Perkins, Edward Bernays, &amp; a huge number of others that have come out &amp; given the perspectives necessary to construct a reliable theory to understand that which is reality, it becomes more clear. As well from the horses mouth when it comes to globalism <a href="http://amtruth.com/NWOquotes1">http://amtruth.com/NWOquotes1</a>
What becomes a problem is that when one starts to construct &amp; fit together these perspectives it challenges the overwhelming majority of world-views throughout out society. What is unfortunate is that the amount of disinformation &amp; lack of actual construction of intelligence is staggering. What gets me is how dismissive people become when these type of topics arise, i.e. 9/11, Builderburg, secret societies, fiat currency &amp; fractional reserve banking, psychological warfare against the American people, UN agenda 21, the repucratic party, &amp; so on. Globalist have been working on these liberty killing ideals for over a century, &amp; thank god for the Internet for exposing these crooks. The saddest part is the only thing that&#39;s stopping them from being punished is a lack of overall awareness. If a majority knew what a lot of the &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; knew we be rounding them up for a fair &amp; speedy trial tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism was <em>not</em> started by &quot;Atheists&quot;. Zionism was nothing more than a conservative and extreme reaction to anti-Semitism. Take the radical fundamentalists from Judaism and boom, you have a group of Zionists.</p>

<p>I feel as though I am able to say it&#39;s merely anti-religion because the entire thing has been hijacked from the original Semites. The people calling themselves Semites today, have very little in common with the Semites of Biblical times. It all just proves that there is no race of Jews, anyone can be a Jew. I could go convert this week if I wanted to.</p>

<p>They should not be able to enjoy the protections of being called a race. It is a lie. They are &quot;The Wondering Who&quot;. A RELIGION!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s &quot;The Wandering Who&quot; not &quot;The Wondering Who&quot;.</p>

<p>Theodore Herzl, the so-called &quot;father of Zionism&quot; was an open Atheist that at one point advocated conversion to Catholicism for all Jews. Did you read <em>Der Judenstaadt</em> or any of his other works? Very <em>very</em> anti-religion. Ben Gurion, Begin and the others had similar views when it came to religion. I believe it was Ben Gurion who called religious Jews &quot;primitive cave men&quot; and talked about how they will be extinct in a few years.</p>

<p>The people calling themselves Semites today (if there are any) are Arabs and others from the Middle East. Being an anti-Semite does not mean being &quot;against Semites&quot; any more than a bathroom means &quot;a room with a bath&quot;. It was a word coined in 19th century Germany by a man who hated Jews to describe himself and his cohorts. It was a mark of pride up until WWII for someone to describe themselves as &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;. Once bigotry fell out of fashion due to Hitler, words like &quot;anti-Semite&quot;, &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;supremacist&quot; became insults and people who actually fit those descriptions had to come up with excuses as to why they do not.</p>

There are stories submitted here I consider important, that won&#39;t make the front page, which brings me here, if that makes me a tinfoil hat wearer so be it.  If you have some facts to debate with greenw40, lets have &#39;em, I love a good debate!  But &quot;you&#39;re stupid&quot; is probably the best fact you can present, not having any critical thinking skills of your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For myself I think one must take in almost all sources of information and then decide for one self if the information is true or not true.</p>

<p>I enjoy reading here as there are such varied opinions, theories and sources of information... Yes, some are wild, some are off the wall, but all of them do give one pause and make one think.</p>

<p>Some people blanket love/hate Jones, RT etc... but sometimes they do have useful information. sometimes a wild theory, scaled down a bit (for me) is actually useful.</p>

<p>Truth is a relative thing, but here there is free speech and a sense of wonder at the world, its a good place here to find new and interesting &quot;things&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That has to be the worst use of the word &#39;journalism&#39; I&#39;ve seen in a while. No, journalism is NOT opinionated questions and allegations based on no proof made into a YouTube video by some random neckbeard. Journalism is the reporting of the known facts with the least bit of bias possible. It is accomplished by providing sources for the given information, and articles with journalistic integrity are peer reviewed prior to publication. </p>

<p>I doubt Alex Jones has a single article that has been peer reviewed, and published in a prestigious journal. Why? Well, it isn&#39;t because its a conspiracy against him. Its because he&#39;s full of shit, and makes it up as he goes along. </p>

<p>But don&#39;t mind me pointing out the reality that you can&#39;t just pull an theory out of your ass, and call yourself a journalist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the official version can be partial, you don&#39;t really have all sides of an issue here either, you just have the other extreme.  And the big problem with conspiracy theories is that they often point at holes in the official theories but they don&#39;t really paint a more credible explanation.</p>

<p>Also, as in a lot of subreddits, opposition will be downvoted, even if the points made are sound.  This is an echo chamber for people who think alike more than a laboratory for the discovery of truth.</p>

<p>So no, it&#39;s not true journalism.</p>

<p>Many people who oppose skeptics of official narratives call themselves &quot;skeptics&quot; but in fact accept the official narrative because they unquestioningly trust certain authorities.

<p>Hmmm... Uneducated people with superiority complexes will always exist unfortunately. The distinction that needs to be made here, in relation to this subreddit or other subreddits, is that there indeed will be many who talk about and perpetuate unfounded ideas. There will also be many whom perpetuate fact. 
This is where you need to be careful: holding the theory that &quot;all whom subscribe to conspiracy theories are greatly delusional.&quot;</p>

<p>That kind of generalizing ideal leads to a lack of progression and question-asking which is a necessary component to furthering the evolution of thought.</p>

<p>We should challenge all ideas, whether founded scientifically or otherwise.

    <div class="md"><p>If you seriously convince yourself I have anything to do with Hasbara after having my post history plainly accessible and seeing my activity here, your deduction skills are compromised beyond repair and you are of no use to anyone.</p>

<p>The truth is I have nothing to do with Hasbara and I have no opinion of Jews or Zionists. None. Complete absence of opinion. This is exactly what I feel is reasonable given the available data - all data which implicates Jews or Zionists is questionable and essentially worthless. I argue against you because you are unreasonable and you help encourage others to be unreasonable. It serves no purpose at all, aside from dividing everyone. That is the only reason I argue.</p>

What I have a problem with is believing a statement simply because it contradicts a mainstream belief, continuing to believe it despite a lack of any evidence, and then assuming that anybody who doesn&#39;t believe the same is a *government shill.  *</p>

<p>this is unscientific and not borne out by any observations.  do you have some that we don&#39;t know about?</p>

<p>no, I&#39;m serious.  where are the black boxes?  melted with the steel? LMAO.  hot spots over 1300C and fires burning for months.  molten steel like you were in a foundry.</p>
