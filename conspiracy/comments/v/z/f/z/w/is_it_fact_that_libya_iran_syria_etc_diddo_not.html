<p>Libya was obviously due to the African Dinar plan, and the protection of the petrodollar in oil trade. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The BIS is a privately held company that is primarily owned by the Rothschild family. They only list &quot;working&quot; level staff, not delving into &quot;ownership levels&quot; on their web site. </p>

<p>I would advise you watch an informative video about the Rothschilds critical, early on involvement and the fractional reserve banking system called the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-515319560256183936">Money Masters</a> - it explains how modern day money is essentially debt. </p>

<p>Also, I would advise you watch a documentary called <a href="http://inkandpaperguy.wordpress.com/2012/05/07/inside-job-a-documentary/">Inside Job</a> by Matt Damon - much more current and it gives you insight into how smart this celebrity is (a rarity, for sure) as well as how far reaching the financial corruption has spread.</p>

<p>I doubt the US Federal Reserve lists it&#39;s private &quot;ownership level&quot; information on their website either. I will be checking that out as soon as I finish this posting. <strong>It should be troubling to everyone that this is a private company that has the vast majority of the world&#39;s central banks supplicant in membership and compliant with terminating their deposits.</strong> Think about that. </p>

<p>PS: <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/default.htm">The Federal Reserve</a> does not list &quot;ownership level&quot; information either. If you look in your phone book, the Fed is listed in the white pages, like all private companies <strong>not</strong> listed in the government only blue pages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, the central banks of the vast majority of governments from around the world terminate to the BIS, dummy. <strong>All of these government central banks are terminating deposits to a private company.</strong> </p>

<p>There have been several books written over the last decade about the 400 families who hold a majority of power. I doubt you have read a book in the last decade. You suffer from Dunning-Kruger bias.</p>

<p>I mentioned two documentaries for research. I suppose you think the Federal Reserve is a government agency too. I am not going to try to convince you of anything. Go back to sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Governments deal with other governments in every aspect of their functioning with the exception of where their central banks terminate deposits. This is highly suspicious to anyone really thinking about the &quot;flow&quot; of transactions. It is like the governments of the world are subservient to a private bank. WTF? When is a government subservient? </p>

<p>I saw an ownership listing for the Fed a few years ago - I would love to see the BIS ownership list too!</p>

<p>The site you linked, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/default.htm">www.federalreserve.gov</a> is for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. That part of the Federal Reserve is a federal agency, not a private company. The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are private, sort of, but nothing like other private companies.</p>

<p>The ownership of the Federal Reserve Banks is, of course, on the web. Each regional Federal Reserve Bank is owned by all the member banks in its region. Every National Bank and some state-chartered banks are members of the Federal Reserve. The most convenient place I&#39;ve found on the web to see a list of these is <a href="http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/main.asp">this form on the FDIC site</a>. If you choose select bank charter class &quot;N&quot;, you see all the National Banks. If you choose bank charter class &quot;SM&quot;, you see all the state-chartered member banks.</p>

<p>Each member bank gets two votes for choosing the directors of the regional Federal Reserve Bank. You can see which states are in which district, and other important info in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System">this good Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>The Rothschild&#39;s central bank and their current central bank membership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Bank for International Settlements did have some private shareholders in the past, but the BIS <a href="http://www.bis.org/about/swd010110.htm">bought out the remaining private shareholders</a> in 2001. Back then, 14% of the shares were in private hands, but private ownership of shares carried <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IvCcASTGVmMC&amp;amp;pg=PA274&amp;amp;dq=%22ownership+of+shares+carries+no+right%22">&quot;no right of of voting or representation at annual general meetings and extraordinary general meetings of the BIS.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The private shares were traded on the Paris Bourse and the Swiss Exchange in Zurich. (Source: Page 2 of <a href="http://www.bis.org/about/notesholde.pdf">PDF</a>) It&#39;s certainly possible that Rothschilds owned some part of these shares, but I&#39;ve never seen any evidence of it.</p>

<p>The member central banks own and control the BIS, but the BIS doesn&#39;t have any direct control over the central banks.</p>

<p>So, to summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some Rothschilds may or may not have owned some private shares of the BIS in the past.</li>
<li>The private shares did not enable any control of the BIS, because they had no voting rights.</li>
<li>There haven&#39;t been any private shareholders for several years now.</li>
<li>The BIS doesn&#39;t control its member banks, anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I can tell, it&#39;s a complete fabrication.</p>

Then becomes president of the US-LIBYA Chamber of Commerce (Corporate Fluffer).</p>

<p>Interesting note to make, the National Transitional Council changed the name of the state to <strong>Libya Republic</strong> from  Ghaddafi&#39;s <strong>Socialist People&#39;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya</strong> which according to the former leader:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the official political philosophy of Gaddafi&#39;s state, the &quot;Jamahiriya&quot; system was unique to the country, although it was presented as the materialization of the Third International Theory, proposed by Gaddafi to be applied to the entire Third World.</p>

<p>PS: The Federal Reserve does not list &quot;ownership level&quot; information either. If you look in your phone book, the Fed is listed in the white pages, like all private companies not listed in the government only blue pages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The site you linked, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/default.htm">www.federalreserve.gov</a> is for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. That part of the Federal Reserve is a federal agency, not a private company. The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are private, sort of, but nothing like other private companies.</p>

<p>The ownership of the Federal Reserve Banks is, of course, on the web. Each regional Federal Reserve Bank is owned by all the member banks in its region. Every National Bank and some state-chartered banks are members of the Federal Reserve. The most convenient place I&#39;ve found on the web to see a list of these is <a href="http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/main.asp">this form on the FDIC site</a>. If you choose select bank charter class &quot;N&quot;, you see all the National Banks. If you choose bank charter class &quot;SM&quot;, you see all the state-chartered member banks.</p>

<p>Each member bank gets two votes for choosing the directors of the regional Federal Reserve Bank. You can see which states are in which district, and other important info in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System">this good Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
