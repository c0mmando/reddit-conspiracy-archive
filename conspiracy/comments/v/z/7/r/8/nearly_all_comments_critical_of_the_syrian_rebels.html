    <div class="md"><p>This is from Philip Giraldi, a former CIA officer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://deepjournal.com/p/43/a/en/3049.html">Americans should be concerned about what is happening in Syria, if only because it threatens to become another undeclared war like Libya but much, much worse. Calls for regime change have come from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who several weeks ago predicted a civil war. That is indeed likely if the largely secular and nationalist regime of Bashar al-Assad falls, pitting Sunni against Shia against Alawite. Indigenous Christians will be caught in the meat grinder. Ironically, many of the Christians in Damascus are Iraqis who experienced the last round of liberation in their own country and had to flee for their lives.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://deepjournal.com/p/43/a/en/3049.html">NATO is already clandestinely engaged in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey taking the lead as U.S. proxy. <strong>Ankara’s foreign minister, Ahmet Davitoglu, has openly admitted that his country is prepared to invade as soon as there is agreement among the Western allies to do so</strong>. The intervention would be based on humanitarian principles, to defend the civilian population based on the “responsibility to protect” doctrine that was invoked to justify Libya. Turkish sources suggest that intervention would start with creation of a buffer zone along the Turkish-Syrian border and then be expanded. Aleppo, Syria’s largest and most cosmopolitan city, would be the crown jewel targeted by liberation forces.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://deepjournal.com/p/43/a/en/3049.html"><strong>Unmarked NATO warplanes are arriving at Turkish military bases close to Iskenderum on the Syrian border</strong>, delivering weapons from the late Muammar Gaddafi’s arsenals as well as volunteers from the Libyan Transitional National Council who are experienced in pitting local volunteers against trained soldiers, a skill they acquired confronting Gaddafi’s army. Iskenderum is also the seat of the Free Syrian Army, the armed wing of the Syrian National Council. <strong>French and British special forces trainers are on the ground, assisting the Syrian rebels while the CIA and U.S. Spec Ops are providing communications equipment and intelligence to assist the rebel cause, enabling the fighters to avoid concentrations of Syrian soldiers</strong>.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://deepjournal.com/p/43/a/en/3049.html">CIA analysts are skeptical regarding the march to war. The frequently cited United Nations report that more than 3,500 civilians have been killed by Assad’s soldiers is based largely on rebel sources and is uncorroborated. The Agency has refused to sign off on the claims. Likewise, accounts of mass defections from the Syrian Army and pitched battles between deserters and loyal soldiers appear to be a fabrication, with few defections being confirmed independently. <strong>Syrian government claims that it is being assaulted by rebels who are armed, trained, and financed by foreign governments are more true than false</strong>.</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://deepjournal.com/p/43/a/en/3049.html">In the United States, many friends of Israel are on the Assad regime-change bandwagon, believing that a weakened Syria, divided by civil war, will present no threat to Tel Aviv. But they should think again, as these developments have a way of turning on their head. The best organized and funded opposition political movement in Syria is the Muslim Brotherhood.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who has been frequenting reddit since the beginning, let me tell you a little secret. It died a long time ago. The large subs really only serve to shape herd mentality, they are trash pits of status quo purchased popularity. It is quite possible to maintain armies of accounts, and control them from a single computer, and even post without identifying yourself as  a samefag. Of course, this software was developed by a DOD contractor and you can&#39;t play with it. While it may seem there are tons of shills operating on reddit, that isn&#39;t actually the case. It&#39;s a little more depressing than that. There are quite a few, and thousands of individual accounts, but most of the activity comes from stupid people, which now make-up the majority of reddit&#39;s user base. Aside from this sub and a few others. They will upvote anything that already has upvotes, and they will comment in agreement. It&#39;s a sad facet of human behavior. All the shills really need to do is promote a post initially and upvote their own comments to give the idea that their opinions and posts are popular, and the shit pile that is reddits userbase will go along with it like the brainless eaters they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The software that allows one to manipulate many, many accounts across social networking sites, not just reddit, was created by a contractor. HBGary, to be specific. You can notice the effect more easily in smaller subs, where even popular posts stay with-in a certain maximum range. All of a sudden a military related post is submitted and it will get many times more upvotes than the average popular post for that sub.</p>

<p>Most people believe the news. If you repeat this stuff enough times, it sinks into your brain even if you don&#39;t want it to. The alternative is to be totally uniformed. The world is so large and complex that I have trouble following what is happening in all the different little wars they have going on or are planning. </p>

<p>Our business is clearly war. We must have a war or the economy will fail. </p>

<p>The West (and the East) are constantly trying to control or kill these guys, so I guess that it makes them a little paranoid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its clearly trying to be hidden and it shouldnt be a surprise to anyone. Anything that is not pro american agenda will be hidden. This conflict in syria, is viewed greatly different by east and west. West see the conflict as rebels tryin to take out Asaad. But the east see&#39;s this as an attack by the muslim brotherhood(rebels). The rebels want to slaughter all the shiites. The muslim brotherhood want to slaughter all the shiites. And the shiites are hizballah, Asaad, Ahmedinejad and The Scholars of Iran and much much more. </p>

<p>The shrine recently destroyed in tim buk tu, was a shiite shrine, destroyed by rebels. </p>

<p>You can see that the rebels(muslim brotherhood) is being fueled by &quot;secret&quot; organizations so that the rebels do the dirty work of killing all the shiites.  America doesnt want to come out and say thats what their goal is, might as well jus hand it over to the rebels. Ever since america decimated Iraq, there have been weekly attacks at Shiite shrines. </p>

<p>This situation can be understood easily by someone who has a brain and does their research properly and has experience from the area. Lots of people without real experience of living in the middle east try to understand and conclude wrongly.</p>

<p>This topic can be discussed endlessly, but i have only one thing left to say, foreign intervention will never be the way to solve any problem. I think foreign intervention is an act of war. I dont care what the offical terms and regulations for the UN or w.e. once a country goes to intervene, publiclly announced or not, it is at war.</p>

<p>The worst thing is that people are making ridiculous claims in the open and sometimes even getting upvoted for it such as that Assad is committing genocide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What people don&#39;t seem to understand is in every country there is a section of the population that hates the government and there is also a section of supporters. In a place like Syria where the government are brutal and arrest, torture and kill people, the hatred runs deep. It just takes an event, scenario and little organisation to actually ferment and activate a revolution. Just one twitter poster or a blog can rile up the elements to take action who already harbour these thoughts.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt Assad has killed people but maybe he&#39;s actually got intel on foreigners running riot and he&#39;s lashing out like a madman to try and crush it. It has echoes of Libya all over it. Not only that but the plane they shot down could have been perceived as an Israeli jet which did bomb a Nuclear site in 2007. They were flying in there air space and armed or not, it was violating their sovereignty. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to mention regime change is not permitted under a UN charter but Hilary is still got her big fat mouth open saying it every Five minutes.</p>

People would rather hear a lie that sounds good rather than a truth that is contrary to the rosy worldview flashes on their TV during the &quot;news hour.&quot;  It&#39;s sad but true.  For example most people know their government is corrupt and lies constantly,  But &quot;would rather not know&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t know why you think about that&quot;  this is a manifestation of a common escapism and refusal to accept responsibility in our society that ultimately is leading us towards our own doom.</p>

<p>Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Coda30 still won&#39;t stop beating his wife! Coda30 is a ruthless dictator! <a href="http://i.current.com/images/asset/885/009/81/EazfkU.jpg">Here is a picture of Coda30&#39;s beaten wife!</a>  The international community must stop this atrocity! Clearly, Coda30 is a sociopath and is beating his defenseless wife! </p>

<p>There, I just created a &quot;fact&quot;, and backed it up with &quot;footage&quot;, you can call me an &quot;activist source&quot;. What reason does someone who doesn&#39;t know you personally have <em>not</em> to believe me? And you can&#39;t disprove this without going &quot;oh no you&#39;re just making this up&quot;.</p>

<p>See how easy it is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t upvote enough. Accepting CIA, UN/NATO and mainstream media reports as <em>fact</em> is about as insane as accepting the Syrian government&#39;s reports as fact. The <strong>fact</strong> is, facts are an irrational expectation when it comes to issues like these. I think the closer reality we&#39;ve seen currently, is the <em>good</em> side has been shown to be lying more often than the <em>bad</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I see where you&#39;re coming from.</p>

<p>Do I think there&#39;s propaganda involving Syria? Sure. I know we can&#39;t trust the media to present events as they actually are, especially considering what we&#39;ve seen in the past few months. But it&#39;s my opinion that any misinformation would be intended only to hasten involvement, not to necessitate it e.g. the resourced picture of the dead kid a few days ago- there&#39;s too much from too many credible sources for me to dismiss the representation of the Assad regime.</p>

<p>I definitely agree with you that UN/NATO reports are barely credible: &quot;No we haven&#39;t killed kids in drone strikes what are you talking about shut up or we&#39;ll stick you in gitmo&quot;</p>

<p>Neither side is totally innocent but the government was the first to pick up arms and have killed thousands more people than the rebels have.  The only foreign fighters I have seen in Syria have been Kuwaitis and Iraqi&#39;s neither of which were affiliated with AQ.</p>

<p>Again, I am not saying the rebels are angels, I watched them shoot a captured enemy soldier in the back of the head today after recording his last words.  What I am saying is that the typical heros of the conspiracy world are parroting the government line and the hundreds of videos released daily paint a very different picture of events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To claim NATO has the right to intervene is equally retarded.  Especially since NATO shouldn&#39;t even exist.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t believe anyone claimed Assad was in the right.  This fallacy has gotten more people killed than any regime.</p>
