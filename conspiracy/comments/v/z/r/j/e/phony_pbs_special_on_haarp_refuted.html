    <div class="md"><p>I was referred to what was supposed to have been a PBS Special on HAARP by someone I won&#39;t embarrass here by revealing his name.  The production values were amateurish, the graphics were awful, and the commentator was obviously not a professional.  A couple of minutes showed graphics with the WETA logo but the same voiceover spoke over that as well.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnRPZOUVhJ4">here</a>, at least for now, see the message below for the 
reply from WETA to my inquiry as to it&#39;s authenticity.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Guess what? WETA responded to my email. And guess what? Your supposed PBS &#39;Special&#39; is phony. Refute the facts, you say? There are no facts.</p>

<p>You and you pals should be concerned, if the &#39;evidence&#39; for your beliefs is so weak that you have to resort to lies and deception to try to convince people then your cause is in bad shape.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not going to reveal the person&#39;s name at WETA, just use their contact form if you want to verify this. Don&#39;t worry, if they get it removed you can just put it back and you&#39;ll be back in business! The business of, well, prevaricating.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Xxxxxxx,</p>

<p>Thank you for your email and your interest in WETA. I do not believe that this is a WETA program. I am working to have it removed from YouTube.

<p>Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxxx sent a message using the contact form at <a href="http://www.weta.org/contact">http://www.weta.org/contact</a>.</p>

<p>This is supposedly a WETA production, seems highly dubious to me:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnRPZOUVhJ4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnRPZOUVhJ4</a>
Would it be possible to confirm this? Yes, this is from a tinfoil hat internet site but it&#39;s being used as &quot;proof&quot; in a reputable discussion and I&#39;d like to put it to rest if it&#39;s phoney
Thanks in advance,
Xxxxx Xxxxxxxxxx</p>

<p>The phony PBS &#39;Special&#39; (if the link is still good) is the worst thing I&#39;ve seen here, it&#39;s not just delusional it&#39;s also blatantly dishonest, there&#39;s a fine distinction...</p>
