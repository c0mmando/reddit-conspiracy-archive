But there is no telling what could be laying around in an old box somewhere. I expect to find nothing of interest but what if there is something there and it never again sees the light of day? You seem very closed-minded. I can accept that you don&#39;t believe I will find anything of interest, I don&#39;t expect to.

<p>I feel that way sometimes too. But when I make an ass of myself I tend to leave it to be seen by the public and attempt to learn a lesson about myself from it. The few times I&#39;ve deleted a comment is when I feel I&#39;ve put too much personal information in a post. I&#39;m not angry with you, whoever you were/are. Maybe you had a bad day and needed to take it out on someone somewhere. I will take the lashing my friend, if you ever need it. Just try to smile more.</p>

<p>i still think you&#39;re a moron. you posted to a conspiracy board asking about shit to look for in a dead old man&#39;s belongings, talking about talking pictures. you&#39;re either a paranoid moron, a troll, or stupid. so which is it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t really tell you, and there is no enlightenment. They&#39;re probably was a few hundred years ago, but nowadays it&#39;s more like a giant fraternity. You can literally drive up to any building, and as long as someone is there, ask to join. They interview you, determine if you are a good candidate, teach you a bit. The rest is up to you after that point. You can continue learning the history of the freemasons, or quit. I honestly find it hilarious that anyone would believe that the freemasons control anything, but then again, I know more about them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After giving it some thought, I&#39;m ready to reply to this post. I don&#39;t believe the Masons control the world, but the higher ups seem pretty interesting to me. What is there? I couldn&#39;t tell you and I doubt that I will ever be able to. But what if, right? What if my friend&#39;s grandfather was a high ranking Free Mason who traveled around a lot and has a whole host of items just waiting to be set free? Seems very unlikely but I want to know and have the chance to find out. I don&#39;t want to be the type of person who, when questioning something, just gives up and goes back to the couch to lose myself in the idiot box for several hours. And who knows what other doors this one very small and slightly ajar door may lead to. I&#39;m just trying to live a life.</p>
