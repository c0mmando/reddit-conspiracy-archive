      <p>
       So, I've been led down a rabbit hole lately. I've been studying what I call "Modern Music History and Appreciation". It's where I overlay my personal feelings of a genre or period with the archetype of a fan (fanatic) of that era or the artists themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy comes with my recent delve into the birth of Heavy Metal in popular culture (note: I've never had any respect for Metal). I've been reading the poetry of Black Sabbath and Blue Oyster Cult while listening to the corresponding songs and relating it to the artists or people of that era.
      </p>
      <p>
       1970: Consider first that the Beatles have come and mostly gone. Lennon is being dealt with (if they only knew). MLK and JFK are out of the picture. The Military Industrial Complex is wrapping up Vietnam and has their eyes set on the Cold War. Meanwhile, the Grateful Dead is keeping alive the ideals of the Summer of Love (unfortunately, they are quickly losing their focus). This is the setting for the dawn of heavy metal (and punk-rock shortly thereafter).
      </p>
      <p>
       The original message of early heavy metal is a clear one. It's political, It's counter-cultural AND it's positive. It takes the point of view that the powers-that-be are hypocritical to call the common man criminal or sinful. Manufacturing nuclear weapons is attempted speciecide. Peace, love, the meaning of life is to give meaning to life, etc... Black Sabbath even writes pro-marijuana (and psychedelics), anti-heroin (the Hand of Doom) lyrics. Geezer, who wrote a lot of BS's lyrics, preached a vegan, alcohol and soda-free diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where shit takes a turn: they stepped on too many toes. Heavy Metal became demonized by the church. Ozzy found out ACCIDENTALLY that drunkenly biting off a dove's head makes you VERY popular. Further, the music industry began to rein in the politicism. When an early Metal artist refers to insanity or selling their souls to the devil, he or she means that they have abandoned their deeper message and are now catering to what the masses/executives expect of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Ozzy's album,
       <em>
        Diary of a Madman
       </em>
       , he laments his past decisions and talks about his identity crises and other difficulties with his lyrics. I think, to truly grasp the depth of this, one must understand the role of a muse or daemon within an artist's process. Since the dawn of Art, Philosophy and Creative Thinking, novel thought has been attributed to to the Muse. An artist's Muse or Daemon can be described as an internalization of an external entity. For example, the lyrics to Led Zeppelin's
       <em>
        Stairway to Heaven
       </em>
       were written in less time than it takes to perform the same song. A member of the band was quoted, "It's as if the song wrote itself". Psychologically speaking, the muse is a coping mechanism used to offload praise/rejection resulting from creative works. It helps the artist stay focused. Anyway, Ozzy describes his muse as a voice behind his eyes. He writes about how he isn't sure if it's his voice anymore, if the voice has changed or if a new voice has come to try to replace his true voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my conspiracy:
The real world powers were well aware that popular music was a threat to an industrialized military. I see the response to the dawn of Heavy Metal as the first wave of a psycho-social counter-attack against popular music with a noble message. I think Heavy Metal is significant in illuminating the "war on pop" because it was the first time these methods were used so apparently. Let's take a quick look at the devolution of lyrics in the genre:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now from darkness there springs light
        <br/>
        Wall of Sleep is cool and bright
        <br/>
        Wall of Sleep is lying broken
        <br/>
        Sun shines in you have awoken
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -Black Sabbath, Black Sabbath, Beyond the Wall of Sleep (1970)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I've got big balls
        <br/>
        I've got big balls
        <br/>
        And they're such big balls
        <br/>
        And their fancy big balls
        <br/>
        And he's got big balls
        <br/>
        And she's got big balls
        <br/>
        (But we've got the biggest balls of them all)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -AC/DC, Big Balls (1981)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why pop has devolved. This is why you will never hear a recording artist break into mainstream with a powerful anti-war message. The muse has been replaced by ego. The administrators of Earth will have it no other way. Thus, you see why the government is propping up the RIAA. A gatekeeper is necessary to "protect" the people. This is why MegaUpload was attacked by the FBI (they were branching into music distribution). It's about money, sure... but to those in power, there's nothing more valuable than the minds of the masses. They want us to remain behind the Wall of Sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Music is a weapon of peace. Some bands haven't forgotten:
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ude_RsCnYh4">
        System of a Down - Sad Statue
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. For shits and gigs look up "Camarillo State Hospital". I believe this facility played a role in "adjusting" popular artists to be more "acceptable".

       Actually, I feel that all genres of "mainstream" music are being dumbed down and void of of any message or even any creativity.  The mainstream rock station here only plays music from the 90s and music from now that SOUNDS like music from the 90s, its like they are trapping the "mainstream" people into a time area and anything outside of that sound is considered weird or unlistenable to them.  If you try to show someone who only knows System of A Down as a source of protest music  some independent artists that go much deeper and are more insightful as well as being more musically creative, the mainstream types will throw that shit away and spit on it because it doesn't fit the "norm".  The mainstream rock/pop BS stations are only playing "Clear Channel Approved" type songs that have no political message whatsoever, and if they do it was written in the 90s(i.e. Rage Against The Machine) so it is almost irrelevant in this post 9/11 era of politics.  Some good bands to look into:  Fear Before The March Of Flames, Circa Survive, Sparta, Muse, Modern Life Is War, Iron Chic, Foals, Dog Fashion Disco, Dear Landlord, The Copyrights, I could go on for days.  some of those are "mainstream-ish" I understand but they don't get play really, mostly I would say, because of their message.

       While I agree with your overall sentiment, I have to interject about SOAD.  There is a variety and creativity in their music, if it times it is unfocused and undisciplined.  Lacking insight?  Fine.  Lacking creativity?  No.  I think that they've proven willing to take risks musically and they certainly don't sound like anyone else.  Creativity really is not some comparative quantity...either you value it or you don't.  I think it's easy to see that they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, while Rage Against the Machine does sound dated today, based largely on their subsequent influence, their message is certainly not irrelevant in a post 9/11 world.  In fact, 9/11 only exacerbated the factors they were turned onto back then.  This is clear.  I would argue that by dismissing both them and SOAD, you are letting your musical preferences color your perception of the intellectual and musical content of these other groups that don't fit your taste.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a natural thing to do, since we're communicating in a medium that is largely dependent on subjective personal experiences.

       Actually I really like RATM.  SOAD however is a bit annoying, especially once they let the guitarist start singing, that guy has an ego issue I feel.  I am talking about how mainstream radio is projecting that it is playing the "newest" and "most relevant" music when in actuality they are playing music from the 90s and early 00s and are completely ignoring all the good music that has come out since.  After 9/11 music really changed, but if you only listen to the radio to get your "new" music, you are missing out on all of the GOOD music.  The independent music scene has grown and has evolved music in a way that the people who suck the mainstream dick have no idea what has been done in the last 10 years, as someone who has participated and played shows with HUNDREDS of underground independent bands for the last 10 years I can tell you with 100% accuracy that the radio is not playing ANYTHING worth a shit right now.  Yes RATM and SOAD are classic bands at this point, but they are not mainstream anymore, they are classics.  I'm not kidding man, the mainstream radio, just like the mainstream media, is highly controlled in what they will release, and SOAD is milktoast compared to most of what has been put out since they "blew up", trust me on this.

       Yes this is happening in all genres apparently.  I'm a hiphop head and I watched a steady degradation in the mainstream to today.  I'd rather shove a claw hammer up my urethra than listen to this paraquat rap music that is coming out now in the mainstream.  On occasion one will slip through that is surprisingly enlightening... but for the most part I've shat better lyrics.
At least we have the independent labels to keep genres alive.

       Seconded. Mainstream hiphop is uninteresting. But artists like Imtech and Nas, KRS-1, Lupe Fiasco, Lowkey and a few others keep it interesting and vital.

       Nas and Krs-1 are classics.  Though I find Nas's earlier stuff more pivotal I occasionally hear something new from him that keeps my faith in him up.  I don't know of Imteck and Lowkey, but Lupe Fiasco's first album was garbage.  His two radio songs were fantastic everything else was reaaaally subpar comparatively.  IMHO

       I have... Some of his stuff is waaay to aggressive for my current tastes, but would have been perfect for my tastes circa 95.  I do appreciate his attention to conspiracy fact.  The Micronauts (I think they were called) and Jedi Mind Tricks and some of Dead Prez managed to touch on those topics too.

       I guess I lied. I also listen to MGMT... But that's it. Everything else is too chorus based for me and has no band dynamics. I've been spoiled by prog.

       Interesting. I do feel that early metal doesn't get enough credit for its ability to deliver a positive message. They took the reins of musical political protest from the 60s icons like CSNY. On the other end of the spectrum was reggae, which at the time was also highly political.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if AC/DC is the best example to show the devolution of metal. If anything they were always a "party" band to me.

       There is no doubt that George H W Bush hated the likes of John Lennon, Neil Young, and War Protest Music. He blamed them for what he called "Vietnam Syndrome".

       Metallica was making conscious metal in 1981, and really didn't stop doing so until the Black album. They were too popular to put a leash on...

       My next stop is Metallica. From what I know of them from growing up, they played it much more "safe". I could be wrong though. I was definitely wrong about the earlier groups.

       I'm 34 years old, a music aficinado, I've never liked metal, but... All of the Metallica albums up until the Black album, are the only albums I know of that I can listen to from start to finish without even thinking about changing tracks.

       They sold out with the Black album, and every other one after it. The

       reason the Black album did so well is because it had the full backing of the music industry Oligarchs.

       First of all, great post.  You've done your homework.  I would say that the Sabbath vs. AC/DC was a bit self serving and cherry picked, but that doesn't take away from the point you're making.  I just don't think AC/DC is establishment, more than they were drunken lovable morons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think you might be overemphasizing the church's response to metal.  They were against bands like Black Sabbath because the band's name was Black Sabbath.  Titles like "heaven and hell" and "seventh star" were chosen, arguably, to cultivate exactly that image.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the positive vibe of their message was framed in a decidedly pagan, anti-church context.  Again, as an element of counter culture, I would argue that this is intentional.  I don't think you can say Black Sabbath was unaware of this and only came to it when they began catering to the powers that be, since their name was BLACK SABBATH.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they were positioning themselves in direct opposition with the church, and the positive vibe and "people are powerful" vibe is just a function of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  Don't want people to take this as advocating the church response, or an argument against the great points that OP made.  I just think that Black Sabbath might be getting a little too much credit as a voice of good that was unduly criticized by the church.

       There have always been popular songs with shitty lyrics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest culprit of 'poor' lyrics in today's generation is that Electronic Dance Music has been the #1 genre in the world for nearly a decade, and there isn't a lot of room for lyricism in EDM.
