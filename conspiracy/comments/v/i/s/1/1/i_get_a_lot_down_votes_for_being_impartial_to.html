        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have to preface this I KNOW ISRAEL GOT BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS WHEN THEY TOOK IT OVER FROM BRITAIN.   That was about 65 years ago.  The average Israeli is almost 30.  Saying that they should leave now would be like me giving my house to Seminole Indian.  If you think I should be doing that we have to agree to disagree and I hope to god you never get a job in government.  As for the occupied areas Israel took in the 6 day war here is a video explaining why they cant go back to the original borders <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rusj4yrV4Y&amp;feature=related">This</a>.  As for the Muslims in the West Bank, &amp; Gaza, a majority of them support Hamas, which wants to openly destroy Israel.  If this were an isolated case of Muslims wanting to take over non believers Id be more sympathetic to Hamas.  The Muslims are at conflict on almost every border of Islamic world.  Balkans, Sudan, Somalia, Kashmir, Indonesia, Israel, Algeria.  They even want Sharia law in areas of the US.  Israel shouldnt be getting aid from us I understand how much money my nation gives them and it is a crime.  I also think Germany should stop paying them reparations as well.  The middle east is a hot bed of war &amp; psycho fundamentalists, war is going to happen there and I hope that America doesn&#39;t get any more involved than it is.\</p>

<p>EDIT: What a shocker down votes! Ant suggestions where i can have a convo about this without it getting buried? </p>

Elect either side, nothing would change. How many elections in a row will they argue about gay marrage, or birth control. Nothing important is different between them, so they have to blame each other about hot button, yet superficial issues. Most of which the government has no jurisdiction to rule on anyway.</p>

Good to see that we have all three branches of goverment arguing over how much right the government has to regulate the free associations between people, as aposed to if they have a right to do so in the first place.</p>

<p>When everyone is arguing how far they should stick their hand into a meat grinder, the person who wants to keep his hand seems radical by comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are pro israel not impartial.</p>

<p>this all palestine issues is really simple. Treat the others with respect. But no, Israel is just a fascist and racist state who perpetuate a holocaust against palestinians. Why respect the others when you can kill them</p>

<p>They can&#39;t go away, they can&#39;t live in peace with the local population. Pretty fucked up situation.</p>

<p>The middle east is a hot bed of war &amp; psycho fundamentalists and Israel is one fucking big player on the scene. Maybe the craziest of them since they have <strong>fucking nuclear bombs</strong> made with the technology from their big sister cunt, the US whore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of racism in Israel ill give you that.   They arnt fascist they are the only functioning democracy in the middle east.  If they are commiting a holocaust why were their any palisitinians left after the 6 day war? Also, dont call my country a whore.

    <div class="md"><p>I see Israel fucking US in the mouth every day, clearly a whore to me. A christian whore more precisely.</p>

<p>The only motive why palestinians are still around is that Israel enjoy hunting them, but if you want to hunt in the future you need to let them rise the new generations else there will be no more palesinians to hunt</p>

<p>Israel democracy? Really funny. With more than half of citizens with no rights whatsoever. You don&#39;t call that a democracy, you call it USA</p>

<p>300+ years vs. less than 70 years. Do you know how to do math comparisons?</p>

<p>If you think I should be doing that we have to agree to disagree and I hope to god you never get a job in government. As for the occupied areas Israel took in the 6 day war here is a video explaining why they cant go back to the original borders [1] This. As for the Muslims in the West Bank, &amp; Gaza, a majority of them support Hamas, which wants to openly destroy Israel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do realize that Jews and Arabs lived side by side peacefully in Palestine for about 2 thousand years before the 1940s right? The Israel that exists now is certainly NOTHING like the one that once existed long ago. Israel isn&#39;t a democracy any more than the United States is. It&#39;s the rothschild&#39;s personal pet country....Theres a reason rothschild boulevard is one of the main streets in tel aviv. If you studied your history you would know that the NAZI party was heavily supported by the zionists at the time, and your fellow Jews (i&#39;m assuming you are jewish) were massacred by the million&#39;s so that they could use the holocaust as an excuse to form Israel. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this were an isolated case of Muslims wanting to take over non believers Id be more sympathetic to Hamas. The Muslims are at conflict on almost every border of Islamic world. Balkans, Sudan, Somalia, Kashmir, Indonesia, Israel, Algeria. They even want Sharia law in areas of the US. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is only because the United States is an imperalistic entity that invades Muslim countries and props up dictators, don&#39;t delude yourself into thinking Muslims are some kind of inherently irrational people or that they&#39;re completely unstable. Sounds to me like you believe a lot of MSM bullshit, especially that bit about Sharia law in the U.S. Hamas doesn&#39;t particularly hate Jew&#39;s (or their ancestors didn&#39;t anyways) but they hate the oppresive ZIONIST SUPREMACIST state of Israel. Israel commits genocide and oppression against palestinians on a daily basis. Hamas hates Israel the state first and foremost, and Jew&#39;s secondly...only because of how supremacist many Jews in Israel are. Don&#39;t confuse hatred for the state for hatred for the people...they are not necessarily one and the same.</p>

I dont think the Rothschilds single handly started WWII.  I think dumb ass Woodrow Wilson pinning WWI on the Germans had a lot more to do with it.  Im not a Jew racially or religiously, im not even a christian.  I just dont have a problem with Israel.  The Nazi&#39;s were hardcore socialist and killed anyone who didnt like the party, or had money and wouldn&#39;t play ball.  It wasnt just jews killed during WW2.

<p>Are you joking? What evidence do you have of that? Anyone in an airport that even LOOKS like a muslim tends to get selected for &#39;random&#39; searches all the time. Practically every single FBI funded terror plots that are &quot;caught/foiled&quot; are all muslim plots. 9/11 (which is well documented to have been funded by zionists and pro-Israelis) just HAPPENED to have been committed by &quot;radical muslims&quot;. We&#39;ve invaded libya, Iraq, Afganistan, and are actively bombing sudan, and yemen, and are trying REAL hard to go to war in Iran. </p>

<p>Respectful to muslims? Is this opposite day?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, most muslims are NOT batshit crazy, although more and more are becoming so because of the imperalistic aggresion of the west and Israel and their genocidal tendencies. The HUGE majority of Muslims have no problem with Americans, they hate the american government, but they have NO wish to KILL AMERICANS...oooh so scary!</p>

<p>Accepting the state of Israel is not impossible if perhaps they became a true democracy, and not a supremacist state, but that&#39;s never going to happen, because the core of what modern Israel IS...IS RACIST AND SUPREMACIST. There is no such thing as an isolationist view because Israel itself is merely an extension of the worldwide NWO organization.</p>

The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion…We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.&quot; </p>
