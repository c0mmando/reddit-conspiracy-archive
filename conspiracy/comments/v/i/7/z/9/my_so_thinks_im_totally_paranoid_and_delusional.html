As far as what is going on around the world,  Agenda 21 probably doesn&#39;t carry that much official weight.   The corporate agenda is a lot more transparent and noteworthy,  or the agenda to control oil in the middle east.

<p>You should have a serious talk with her (or him I guess) about the future of your relationship and what it means to the both of you.</p>

<p>This is the best way to address it. If he&#39;s interested, let him tell you. Poking and prodding him about it is not the best way to go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m trusting that he&#39;s intelligent enough to realize the truth when presented with the information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately with many theories, there is no distinct &quot;truth&quot; more so than just theories that start to make more and more sense. You may want to watch every video about it with an open-mind and free yourself of any confirmation bias. You may notice that there are pieces in both sides that you agree with, which may help you come to a better conclusion of what&#39;s &quot;right and wrong&quot;</p>

<p>Like I said above all when doing this;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m going to look through all the video suggestions today and pick the one that is best suited for him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try to look through video suggestions, and articles, and stories that express both what and why they believe is the conspiracy behind Agenda 21, but also watch and peruse why there are those who believe there isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>As I said before, keep an open-mind throughout, you want to learn everything and ultimately you want to find the full truth, even if pieces of that aren&#39;t what you were expecting(or hoping) for.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had many circumstances where I think &quot;That can&#39;t be a conspiracy..&quot; and then find myself reading more into it and being completely blown away. I&#39;ve also had many circumstances where I was sure in my beliefs of a conspiracy, and when I was able to take a step back and critically think and search for the undeniable truth - that even though it totally sucked because I started to realize I was wrong - I was still finding out the truth.</p>

<p>CT&#39;s are generally truth-seekers, and seek to find the real truth behind what are normally the &quot;official stories&quot; - but there isn&#39;t always something behind the official story. Often there are misguided attempts to show what is the &quot;alternative&quot; story which many will blindly follow either direction without actually giving it any sort of legitimate thought.</p>

<p>There are two insanely annoying situations;</p>

<p>The person who doesn&#39;t believe in any sort of conspiracies, who won&#39;t believe you no matter what you tell them.</p>

<p>And those who do believe in conspiracies, who are so dead-set in their opinions, that they also won&#39;t change their point of view no matter what you tell them.</p>

<p>Those who leave their mind open to change, whether it confirms or denies their previous beliefs, are typically the ones who are the &quot;keepers&quot;</p>

<p>Hope this all isn&#39;t too vague, and don&#39;t be surprised if I&#39;m down-voted to hell despite our side-bar conversation. People around here aren&#39;t too fond of me because I typically stray away from the &quot;believe everything I read&quot; conspiracies - and am much more of a truth-seeker, who searches for the truth no matter how ugly, and no matter what the truth ends up being.</p>

<p>edit;</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to be sleeping in the closing minutes after posting this, so if I don&#39;t reply for a while, I promise I&#39;ll reply again to whatever you say back (unless of course you don&#39;t want me to)</p>

<p>Cheers :)</p>
