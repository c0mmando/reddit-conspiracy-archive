        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The proportion of gold owned by banks/reserves to each person in the UK, USA etc. is significantly lower than many &quot;undeveloped&quot; countries like Libya, where plans were made to replace paper currency with gold based currency.  </p>

<p>Our Governments, seeing the eventual collapse of the economy and the inevitable worthlessness of physical and digital currency, are controlling these rip off schemes (reported to offer a fraction of the value of this gold) to extract as much gold as possible from the poor and uneducated, keeping their pockets lined and maintaining the rich and poor divide.</p>

<p>Anyone have any thoughts or input? Am I crazy for thinking this? If I was in a position to move a great deal of gold into my pocket, I certainly would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cash4Gold and their ilk are horribly cynical organisations preying on the ill-informed. If you own any gold and you feel you have to sell, you must shop around (coin dealers will often give you a good price). If possible, hold on to your gold.</p>

<p>Whether these organisations have links to government, I doubt, however. Many Western governments (UK, Canada, Netherlands) have shown themselves to be pretty stupid by selling large amounts of central bank gold when the price was at historic lows, so running a scam like Cash4Gold would probably be too smart for them.</p>

<p>As an aside, the situation in India is interesting, however. Whilst the price of gold is artificially suppressed in the West where most gold bought by investors is &quot;paper gold&quot; (ie it doesn&#39;t exist), Indian investors buy huge amounts of real, physical gold. This is putting enormous pressure on the Indian rupee, and the Indian government is starting to get nervous. They have been introducing new import taxes, sales restrictions etc to steer investors away from gold. These overt mechanisms ultimately have the same objective as the covert mechanisms used by the US (eg the massive scams represented by the Comex and GLD; Fed intervention in the gold markets; mass media disinformation and financial press psy-ops against gold etc etc.).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The gold trade is very real with bona fide private parties. Every seller matches a buyer. Central banks buy direct from major refiners. Refiners buy from miners, dealers, and scrap businesses like cash4gold. Dealers buy from refiners, the US mint, individuals etc.</p>

<p>Margins are big for scrap dealers and scammy numismatic dealers. Everybody else earns modest margins of 1.5 to 3% trading standard bullion products.</p>

<p>I do NOT have any reason to the the government is directly involved in any aspect of the trade but I DO think that the media chooses carefuy which gold related ads it will run. Have you noticed how all the gold ads are just kind of ridiculous and make you feel like it&#39;s something only a frightened grandmother would buy? The ads never talk about the real reasons for gold... the reasons central banks hold gold.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. It is a rare exception as it requires a lot of work for both parties to set up and measure how many ads have been sold, billing etc. </p>

<p>Most people sign up with somebody like <a href="http://www.valueclick.com/">http://www.valueclick.com/</a> and they place the ads. This is a mature industry, they are really good at targeting ads based on the content of the site and the demographics of the reader. Most of it is done automatically, they just put the ads where they&#39;ll get the most clicks, but they also follow the browser around and profile the individual reader too. Posting gold ads on an article about inflation is kind of a no brainer though...</p>

<p>You should just install this hosts file and you won&#39;t see any of that crap. Makes it much harder to profile you too. <a href="http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm">http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes of course I am aware of that... so?</p>

<p>Order 6102 was not actually implemented, although it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to see something like that in the future. You can be sure if they&#39;re coming after gold that things are real bad and everything else is worthless. In that scenario gold is being circulated directly, not sold for dollars in a reportable and taxable transaction.</p>

<p>The thing about gold though is they&#39;ll have to kill people to get it. Unlike your bank account or stock portfolio which can be seized with a keystroke.</p>

<p>Get those rolls of silver-wire they use for jewelry. It&#39;s available and almost cost price silver, and will be easy to cut into very small pieces. (i&#39;ll accept 0.5cm for 1 egg, OK?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you explain why you think so?</p>

<p>Historically, gold has held its value better than any currency/commodity I know of... It&#39;s a truly scarce resource, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>I mean, I agree that food, shelter, arable land, education resources, transportation, etc... are the things which actually hold value (not to mention life, human or otherwise). However, it&#39;s not likely that bartering with bags of oats is going to be your best bet for living comfortably when fiat currency fully collapses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You already explained why he thinks so.</p>

<p>Obviously, once the collapse comes, you think people will get through it quickly, so gold will hold value.</p>

<p>He probably thinks it might last a long time, thus not leaving any &#39;worth&#39; for luxuries such as gold.</p>

<p>Many Western governments (UK, Canada, Netherlands) have shown themselves to be pretty stupid by selling large amounts of central bank gold when the price was at historic lows, so running a scam like Cash4Gold would probably be too smart for them.</p>
