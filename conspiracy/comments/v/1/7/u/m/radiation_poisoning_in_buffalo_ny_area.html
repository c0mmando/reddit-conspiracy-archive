        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One of my wife&#39;s paramedic friends in the Buffalo area contacted her tonight about two patients with confirmed radiation poisoning. Two rigs were confiscated. My wife&#39;s friend said there were multiple federal agencies involved and that they couldn&#39;t say more because they were being watched. They&#39;ve since gone dark and are unreachable.</p>

<p>Does anyone have more information? This happened within the last three hours.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I still haven&#39;t heard back from them. I&#39;ll see if my wife can get a hold of them at some point today.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Still no more information. Googling is fruitless. Hopefully by tonight I can get some answers; if not then, soon.</p>

<p><strong>Final Update:</strong> Sorry, but all I could get was &quot;[They] can&#39;t talk about it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Radon gas build up in their home?</p>

<p>Edit: Just thinking about it if there was a radon gas build up and you were exposed to it you would feel sick. But i doubt at that point you would call an ambulance you would probably figure it to be a virus or something and spending a couple of days on the sofa furthering their exposures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The closest one I can think of is Ginea outside of the eastside of Rochester. This is kind of concerning though because I do live in Rochester and if there is something going on in Buffalo all of western NY should probably be made aware.</p>

<p>There was a post sometime last week about radiation levels being elecated someplace in the midwest, I wonder if the wind carried it to Buffalo?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live right outside Buffalo in the suburbs, 20-30 minutes away from the city limits, right on the borders of the &#39;country&#39; region of WNY. I have a friend who lives downtown in an apartment on Elmwood Ave - he has a geiger counter that was his dad&#39;s, who is the fire chief in some surrounding suburb, and he was telling me just the other day it made no sense because it was reading so high - he told me it was way too high and must have been broken or something.</p>

<p>He liked playing around with it, but just walking down Elmwood it was way higher than normal background radiation should be - he thought it needed to be recalibrated or something and figured it was broken. Maybe it&#39;s not.</p>
