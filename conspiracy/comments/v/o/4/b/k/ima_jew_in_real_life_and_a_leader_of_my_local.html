       I lived in Israel, Eastern Europe, Jordan, USA, Russia, China, Japan, Nigeria promoting Jewish values, history and hopes for humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a former member and promoter of the JDL. I left due to my age as I am now in my 60s but have had a fruitful career of doing what I truly believed in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all the countries I worked in, the Chinese people were the kindest and most accepting of the Jewish culture and religion. I never understood what it meant to be -true- friends with another human-being at such a deep level outside your family until I moved to China.

       You've got it wrong, no one here has any problems with jews, your average run of the mill jew is no different than anyone else, in the eyes of me and pretty much even the most extreme conspiracy theorists, and certainly of the general population.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're talking about the Israeli government and the mossad, cabalistic satanists, and other hardline zionists when we complain about the bad things jews have done
      </p>
      <p>
       95% of ethnic and religious jews are wonderful people, there is less difference between me and you than there is between me and my government, or you and the Israeli government

       Members of an infamous message board called stormfront have taken r/conspiracy as their brood nest with
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       and
       <em>

       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       as their agenda sandboxes. It isn't just stormfront, actually stormfront is considered to be the old and outdated cadre full of a number of US/IL government sanctioned monitors, but, for simplistic purposes, I think using stormfront is appropriate to use because there are too many numerous other splinter communities.

       Those who truly control the minds of a given people, control who the terrorists are perceived to be. Things are more complex than one thinks, even in the conspiracy realm because the true elites aren't stupid by any means.

       As has been said by another, you won't find many jew haters here. Yes there are some but most of us are pretty quick to put them in their place.

      <p>
       My only question to you would be, do you think your God is sympathetic to your goals? Meaning, when you die and stand before your God, will your God look at the lives you have taken and tell you that you are a righteous spirit?

       People from my "own people" consider me a traitor for previously following/leading a group that is in contradiction to our own religious values. Jews outside of Israel are forced by Judaism to follow whatever power at large controls such and such land. Due to common sense, I won't take the risk of someone figuring out who I am or who my kin is.

       If you have something to say go for it. Like all groups and conspiracys, its not the masses that make decisions or have any knowledge of the inner workings, it is the TOP leaders or those even higher who pull the strings. It is insulting for you to assume that we who ask questions of official stories automatically hate Jews or think you have some evil plan, which you dont say but kind of imply. I'm friends with lots of Jews (even serving right now in Israeli's military) and they are just like anyone else. BUT after having said all of that there is one thing about jewdiaism that I would like to more about and that is the deep inner workings of the Kabbalah. Please, if you can, enlighten me on any deeper aspects that you can. I have read the bible a few times (forced to as a kid) so I have a pretty decent background on the fundamentals that may or may not lead to deeper knowledge. Sorry for any spelling or grammer errors, im not a reddit grammar nazi (no pun intended) Thanks!

       Fair enough and well said, actually, my understanding of Kabbalah is severely limited. They are a religious sect of Jews, one of many. Despite our small size, there are a number of various Jewish sects that don't agree with one another, similar to Christianity and Islam. Kabbalah leans into the superstitious, such as an affinity towards numerology. Most common Jews know little about this sect besides the Los Angeles Zen Buddism celebrity marketing as per Madonna and the like. They believe in a Jewish mysticism, and according to many historians, is a fringe sect manifested due to a lack of Jewish understanding as to why the Jews were persecuted throughout the years and why the Jews are who they are from Jewish perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kabbalah is very "cool" in Israel and the other countries with major Jewish populations.. but it is actually just a fringe outlying sect similar to Christianity when it first started.

       The whole "numerology" thing always seemed like BS to me, until I realized that to the occult and other groups numerology and symbolism were extremely important. Interestingly enough, (I'm sure you know this as a Jew) the Hebrew language was actually set up giving letters a decimal value. So words actually have numerical values, which to me give numerology a lot of credit in some aspects. I truly want to learn more about the Kabbalah, but all the info I find is either "the Kabbalah is really simple and no biggie." or "it explains all the dark secrets of the occult and is the basis off all of them." Like all things, I'm sure the answer lies somewhere in the middle.  And, I hope I speak for "all of us" here in that when people "speak out about Jews" we don't hate you for being a Jew or think that YOU are apart of some monolithic conspiracy, just maybe your leaders. Although you could hook me up with one of them Jew jobs, I KNOW they pay well :) Why can't we all be chosen people of God if WE choose "him", and not the other way around? I think "God" is inside of us all, if we choose to look for him, and share love with everyone. Peace.

       Try studying the works of Gershom Scholem if you want to learn about the origins of the Kabbalah and its primary beliefs. The two major texts on the Kabbalah are the
       <em>
        Zohar
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Sepher Yetzirah
       </em>
       . The first is very long, the second very short. The
       <em>
        Bahir
       </em>
       is also important. These are difficult to fully comprehend for a beginner, but there are many introductory works on the ideas in the
       <em>
        Zohar
       </em>
       .

       Here's a quick wikipedia quote from the Currency Wars series' synopsis.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The book says that Jews have been conspiring to covertly influence historical events ranging from the Battle of Waterloo to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, with the intention of increasing their wealth and influence.[22]. In this respect, the material echoes traditional antisemitic conspiracy theories such as The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, The International Jew, and Nazi propaganda like Der Stürmer.[23] This is seen as rather unusual as China is not generally known for antisemitism.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews HAVE been conspiring to covertly influence historical events ranging from the Battle of Waterloo to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, with the intention of increasing their wealth and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So have Protestants.
      </p>
      <p>
       So have Catholics.
      </p>
      <p>
       So have Hindus.
      </p>
      <p>
       So have Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       So have Christians in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       So have non-christians in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       So have every other exclusionary clique of people called a culture, be it based on race, religion, financial ties - or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO. ALLEGING THAT JEWS HAVE NOT BEEN "CONSPIRING TO COVERTLY INFLUENCE HISTORICAL EVENTS" IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR WEALTH AND INFLUENCE IS TANTAMOUNT TO CALLING JEWS SUBHUMAN - saying that they have not been doing this is the same as saying that Jews aren't human
       </strong>
       . Are you idiots in the JDL saying that you don't think Jews are smart enough to do the same shit that every other subsection of humanity has done through the ages of human history and into the modern world? Are you saying that Jews are perfect moral beings as compared to the rest of humanity and as such are not subject to the same processes and failings that all other races, cultures, and peoples are subject to? Then you are racial supremacists and we should try you like we tried the Nazis at Nuremberg.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty good at taking anything anyone says and turning it against them in ways they obviously did not mean in order to discredit them. Maybe I should join the JDL. "Never Again" is their motto - maybe you should take a walk through Palestine and keep repeating "never again" in your mind while looking at what 'the jewish state of israel' has done there, because 'well, we wanted the land, it's ours now, give it to us or die'. Fucking terrorist states.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're like an emmisary from North Korea trying to spread love and peace and respect for your Dear Leader - and when anyone criticizes you, you fall back to your "good loving north korean values", and attack your critic for "hating your race and being anti-korean and anti-goodness/anti-peace". It's an extremely juvenile thing to dedicate your life to, even though the average North Korean believes exactly the same things that you do about his own state, and how principled his state and "race" is. Never separating lofty ideals and hopes and dreams(which even the foulest of dictators promotes to his people, lofty ideals and lip-service to principles found in every atrocity-committing army in history ..never actually practiced except selectively and in the IMAGINATIONS of the people/cultures telling themselves those lies). So when you criticize them, they act as though "well sure look we may be representing a militant little group of douchebags who, but we promise it's for good reason, sure we commit acts which are internationally recognized as war-crimes and crimes against humanity, sure, but if you criticize us you just hate our race and derpderpderpderp."
      </p>
      <p>
       The distinction people like the OP fail to make is the distinction between fiction/imagination and REALITY. That tends to happen when you grow up a religious fundamentalist, or are never allowed to develop your own mind, your own life, and your own identity except in the context of whatever little caste/ideology/self perpetuating-pigeonhole you were born into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welcome to the fucking intellectual black-hole.

      </p>
      <p>
       We're talking about the Israeli government and the mossad, cabalistic satanists, and other hardline zionists when we complain about the bad things jews have done
      </p>
      <p>
       95% of ethnic and religious jews are wonderful people, there is less difference between me and you than there is between me and my government, or you and the Israeli government

       You're conflating stormfront with this subreddit and politics, worldnews etc. Just the very fact you chose to bring up stormfront shows that something isn't right. I don't know quite what it is, but please get the fuck out.
