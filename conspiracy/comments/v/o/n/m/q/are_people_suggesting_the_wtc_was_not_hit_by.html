    <div class="md"><p>Enter the voice of reason.
It&#39;s easy for people to cast stones on a group that has not clearly defined their ideals/goals.</p>

<p>Do I believe something happened there that was illegitimate? For sure. Nukes? Fuck no. Thermite? Hells yea. I still remember sitting in high school, witnessing the attacks on TV for the first time. And I still clearly remember thinking, &quot;buildings don&#39;t fall that way. Unless the engineers who put that Jenga puzzle together printed off their diplomas themselves.&quot; </p>

<p>Later, as we all did - whether or not we subscribe to them - caught wind of some pretty interesting coincidences and better yet: inconsistencies with the official story of what happened. So, as any responsible individual would do, I kept them in mind and started to see what I could find that would either contradict these allegations or shed some light into what really did happened.</p>

<p>Unbenounced to me (a Canadian), there was a pretty big uproar over the whole ordeal - rightfully so, considering the possibilities. Filmmakers started cranking out documentaries, usually laden with a sense of foreboding and an all-around conspiratorial feel. We&#39;re they right? It&#39;s unclear, but there sure were large amounts of synonymous proof of nefarious activities.</p>

<p>So, why not check their sources, too? Right? Seems like the way to go if I want to have any kind of grasp on what really happened. </p>

<p>It was around this time that I started to wonder why I was so upset by something that happened in a neighboring country, hundreds of miles away in a city I&#39;ve never even been to...
Then, it smacked me in the face like I owed it money. It doesn&#39;t matter where it happened; hundreds upon thousands of families were affected. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s in a different country. 
No longer would the &#39;as long as it&#39;s over there, not over here&#39; mentality cut it. Realistically, the only thing that separated such an atrocity from myself, were those minuscule miles indeed. All of a sudden, it seemed like it had hit home.</p>

<p>So I kept researching.</p>

<p>While the jury is out in what really did happen, I think we can safely say that the NIST report was flawed severely - from the getgo. The people writing the reports had TONS of ties to shady activity surrounding the WTC buildings.</p>

<p>Using this as a true starting point, we can see that there are indeed some &#39;conspritorial&#39; elements at work here. Just how far the rabbit hole goes is up for debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are not thousands of people who claim they saw a plane.  There are people as well who claim they saw no plane and only heard explosions.  There are people who also claim that they saw a missile.  So you have people who claim they saw a plane, people who claim they saw nothing, and people who claim they saw a missile.  Best go to the actual evidence of what was there, right? Well anyone who has any experience in physics can tell you that the force of a plan crashing into a building (let alone one with the structure of the WTC) would not result in it tearing through it like a piece of tissue paper.  Also, lack of black boxes recovered (which they always recover).</p>

<p>also, after watching zeitgeist, how do you refute the interviews of people who heard explosions prior to planes striking building?</p>

<p>its undeniable that planes hit the towers, but also unlikely that planes could take down buildings which were specifically designed to withstand them, and even less likely that a piece of plane could cause the entire adjacent building to fall down, especially in the fashion that it did</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were no planes. Man you all are easy to fool some of the time. Look at the big picture, it is not possible. Those planes would have been shot down faster than a turkey in Syria. Search for planer in last weeks posts. Great vid which you should watch before commenting further. On mobile... Anyone dig it up?</p>

<p>Cell phones working in planes, come on. Planes not crumpling when they hit concrete, good one. Planes actually hitting targets in the US! Cool story bro.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The planes were remotely controlled.  </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t sci-fi tech, almost every commercial airliner has had the ability to allow the tower to take complete control of the plane in an emergency for decades.</p>

<p>Explosives were placed in an elevator shaft, under the guise of maintenance, as well as other key positions (such as the points of impact) to ensure the structure went down uniformly.</p>

<p>The missing footage from the Pentagon didn&#39;t show a missile, it showed the explosives planted inside the Pentagon during renovations explode prematurely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What?  If you have a legitimate point to make, why are you intentionally being so cryptic?</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they use planes, when the technology has been in place for decades?  And when the other, untested option would most likely lead to failure, bringing the entire circus down with it?</p>

<p><em>&quot;The SPC Corporation provided the flight termination system and command transmitter system, the technology that allows planes to be remote controlled should the pilots be incapacitated or the plane hijacked.</em></p>

<p><em>Dov Zakheim one of the 9/11 conspirators previously ran SPC corporation company that specialised in flying planes that fly by remote control.</em>
<em>Dov Zakheim is an Israeli dual citizen like most of the others involved in 9/11.&quot;</em></p>

<p>If you goons would stop focusing on the HOW and start focusing on the WHO, the pieces will simply fall into place.</p>

<p><em>&quot;During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Syrian missile batteries in Lebanon caused heavy damage to Israeli fighter jets. As a result, Israel developed the first modern UAV. Israel pioneered the use of UAVs for real-time surveillance, electronic warfare and decoys.[12][13][14] The images and radar decoying provided by these UAVs helped Israel to completely neutralize the Syrian air defenses at the start of the 1982 Lebanon War, resulting in no pilots downed.[15]
*
*With the maturing and miniaturization of applicable technologies as seen in the 1980s and 1990s, interest in UAVs grew within the higher echelons of the U.S. military. In the 90s the U.S. Department of Defense began to buy UAVs from Israel. The Navy bought the Pioneer UAV, which is still in use. Many of these Israeli and newly developed U.S. UAVs were used in the 1991 Gulf War.</em>
<em>UAVs were seen to offer the possibility of cheaper, more capable fighting machines that could be used without risk to aircrews. Initial generations were primarily surveillance aircraft, but some were armed (such as the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, which utilized AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles). An armed UAV is known as an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV).&quot;</em>

<p>FYI: we&#39;ve been remotely controlling space craft for roughly 60 years.  Spacecraft which, if off by a fraction of a degree, would result in catastrophic failure.  I sincerely doubt that directing a plane into a tower would prove to be more difficult than landing a craft on the moon, what do you think?  In fact, today we have remotely controlled drones making precision strikes halfway across the globe today.  The news is absolutely saturated with stories about remotely controlled aircraft blowing up buildings and killing innocent people.   </p>

<p><strong>SPC and Boeing&#39;s &quot;Flight Termination&quot; technology literally enables a commercial jet to home in on a beacon remotely.</strong>  The FTS equipment is designed to be housed in a pod, fitted on the underside of the fuselage.  Imagine that.</p>

<p>Dov Zakheim, unsurprisingly, is the monster that called for &quot;some catastrophic and catalyzing event — like a new Pearl Harbor&quot; in the now infamous (at least to those who haven&#39;t been duped by cointel) &quot;Rebuilding America&#39;s Defense&quot; papers from PNAC.  Also, Tridata Corporation <a href="http://www.firetactics.com/wtc-93.pdf">oversaw the investigation</a> after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 1993, Tridata is a subsidiary of SPC.</p>

<p>Dov is a Rabbi, a member of the CFR and PNAC, an Israeli dual citizen, former Comptroller of the Pentagon (tasked with finding the $2 trillion missing funds[you know, the money the offices in the precise branch of the pentagon that was hit were investigating]), a ballistic missile expert, worked for the Rumsfield Commission and was one of Bush&#39;s policy advisers during his time as Governor.  Oh did I mention that previously, Dov classified numerous F-15/F-16 attack jets as &quot;military surplus&quot;, in order to sell them to Israel for a fraction of their actual cost (jets that American tax dollars paid for) giving them the second largest fleet in the world?.</p>

<p>Bonus - <strong>He was fired as Comptroller when ONE TRILLION DOLLARS just &quot;disappeared&quot; from the Pentagon&#39;s coffers in 2005.</strong> </p>

<p>We seem to have a misunderstanding here.  Recently, I found a video on YouTube which argues that the two towers were not hit by planes, but were blown up from the inside, and that the planes were added later via CGI.  This idea strikes me a ridiculous.</p>

<p>As for Building 7, everyone agrees that it was not hit directly by a plane, or a missile, or even your momma&#39;s stank breath.  But that&#39;s not the issue.  </p>

The fact that it hit an area that was already being redone as well as where a lot of important files were is fishy.

<p>Of redditors I believe are sincerely concerned about conspiracies, I have noticed only one who does not think the twin towers were hit by planes. That is lollipopguilder. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/v9tql/is_it_just_me_or_is_rconspiracy_just_true/c52slic">Here</a> is a relevant comment I found after a brief search. </p>

<p>These type of comments get very few upvotes and very few responses in agreement. So you really have to cherry pick to say this reflects badly on 9/11 truth seekers of reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that hard to figure out.  Planes certainly hit the buildings.  The buildings were planted with explosives prior to the attack..  They knew that most people would believe the plane impact + fuel explanation for the towers&#39; collapse.</p>

<p>Those towers were designed to withstand multiple 747 impacts.  One of the building engineers used the comparison of stabbing a pencil through a screen door - there will be a hole, but it&#39;s not a threat to the entire structure.</p>

<p>We also know of other buildings in history that have burned and burned... completely burned to the point where there was almost nothing left except for the steel beam frame.  Buildings don&#39;t collapse from fire.  We don&#39;t really have any reason to believe that the heat from the burning fuel weakened the steel beams to the point of total collapse.</p>

<p>Not to mention how symmetrically all 3 buildings game down.</p>

<p>9/11 did not happen due solely to &quot;incompetence&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well it&#39;s unfortunate that some people think it&#39;s ridiculous that no planes hit any buildings, because it does seem like that&#39;s exactly how it went down. After carefully rigging the buildings for demolition, why on earth would you do something risky like fly planes into them? It doesn&#39;t make sense. Especially when most people now agree that no planes crashed into the pentagon, a field in PA or wtc 7 - but for some reason they still cling to the notion that they did crash into the twin towers. It&#39;s kindof sad - because it demonstrates the futility of 9/11 truth - even the people who advocate it most are closed to the most likely possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was an outside job, allowed to happen by complete incompetence and ignoring good intelligence from our allies.  Those puffs that people see coming out of the building are just dust and debris being forced out due to pressure from the collapsing structure above.  World Trade 1 and 2 collapsed, because the force of an airliner hitting the building weakened enough of the super-structure to allow extended exposure to extreme heat from burning jet fuel and other bits and pieces of the WTC (WTC was shaped like a furnace, after all; hollow core in the middle bringing up oxygen to an inferno) to further weaken the structural steel in that section.  The weight from the floors above caused it to collapse and the fact that it had no internal structural support allowed it to collapse fast.  The fire didn&#39;t have to melt the steel, just soften it.</p>

<p>It is also <em>plausible</em> that flaming debris and wreckage got into the lower levels of WTC 7 (I think it is 7 that everyone points to) as well as the shock from the collapse of enormous structures near it, weakened it&#39;s foundation and lower structure enough to cause it to collapse.  I can&#39;t speak to this one too much, because I haven&#39;t really looked that close at the explanation(s) of its collapse.</p>

<p>I asked her why buildings have insulation on all the structural members.  Blank look.</p>

<p>There were only two people carrying large signs re: 9/11 conspiracies, sorry about &#39;truther&#39;.</p>

<p>The rally was intended to be humorous, the, um, 9/11 enthusiasts were there to try and sell people on their theories.</p>

<p>9/11 truth advocates twist and turn and follow any tortured reasoning they come across that they feel proves their point, and eagerly pursue any fanciful &#39;proof&#39; (a puff of smoke is proof, a picture of an airliner hitting a huge building isn&#39;t) they can find in their investigations, &quot;investigation&quot; in this context meaning &quot;looking on the internet a lot, especially in 911 sites&quot;.</p>

<p>The fact that someone is dredging up the topic of this thread, after all the years of it being chewed up and spit out again and again and again really gets me thinking someone is (very successfully) trolling <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>One of many problems you have is this:</p>

<p>9/11 happens, nacent 9/11 truth groups point to what <em>really</em> happened, that being cruise missiles.  Oops, there weren&#39;t cruise missiles.</p>

<p>OK, then backpack nukes!!!  Only no radiation.</p>

<p>OK <em>PODS!!!!</em>  Drat, no pods.</p>

<p>Etc., etc.. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem with that, if it needs saying:  Once you&#39;re wrong about the mechanism the logical basis for continuing the pursuit of your theories disappears... the effect isn&#39;t there, therefore the cause isn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>A rational person who discovers that there was no cruise missiles in the example above would think, &quot;oh well, I was wrong about the cruise missiles, therefore I was wrong about the mysterious conspiracy&quot; and go about his or her life.</p>

<p>You, on the other hand, will never do that; you&#39;ve decided in advance that your original premise must be correct therefore any and all evidence that doesn&#39;t hold water can be cast aside and you can dredge around for still more evidence, in perpetuity.  </p>

<p>If you are the troll, I salute you, if you aren&#39;t... my opinion won&#39;t matter, by definition, so I guess have a nice day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, no doubt there was much more information. No single report, even one as long as a Tom Clancy novel, can possibly cover everything about such a large and chaotic event like 9/11. Personally, I think the commission report does a pretty good job for what its purpose was. It&#39;s a shame so few people in 9/11 debates know much about what&#39;s in it, much less have actually read some or all of it, particularly amongst the truthers who often attack a strawman of it. </p>
