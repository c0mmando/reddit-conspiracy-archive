My point is exactly what TYPE of plane hit the building, because of the videos &quot;filmed&quot;, they seem to somehow defy all basic physics by tearing through the outer shell of the WTC like tissue paper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No on the first one. It was released by some very questionable sources.</p>

<p>The second one is extremely suspect. NO ONE REACTS TO THE GIGANTIC PLANE FLYING INTO THE BUILDING. It&#39;s not until a split second after impact, when the fireball starts expanding outward that they actually react. All of the talking could simply be an overdub...</p>

<p>I have little doubt that they did fly <em>something</em> into those buildings, but it damn sure wasn&#39;t commercial jetliners. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone was staring at the first tower and probably not paying any attention to the jet, and as far as no one reacting until a split-second after, when should they have reacted?</p>

<p>My standard response to people who say they weren&#39;t airplanes that were flown into the buildings is usually this:</p>

<p>There are records of these flights taking off from their prospective airports and passenger manifests showing the names of the people on these planes. If planes weren&#39;t flown into the buildings, what happened to these flights and what happened to the passengers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;when should they have reacted?&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as they saw the gigantic fucking plane flying at like 500 mph, LESS THAN 1000 FT IN ELEVATION, right at the building.</p>

<p>The planes disappeared from radar on at least one occasion. That is when they landed, evacuated the airliners, executed the passengers, and buried them with bulldozers.</p>

<p>I think a majority of the passenger manifests were made up of fictitious people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the most obvious &quot;conspiracy&quot; in the history of man. You&#39;d either have to be a full blown idiot, a government paid disinformation agent, or completely and totally out of the loop to think otherwise...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you familiar with Pilots For 9/11 Truth?</p>

<p>&quot;Top speed for a 767 is 898 kph/558 mph and that is at an altitude of about 30,000 feet, source:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zap16.com/civ%20fact/civ%20Boeing%20767-200.htm">http://www.zap16.com/civ%20fact/civ%20Boeing%20767-200.htm</a></p>

<p>at 30,000 feet the atmosphere is 1/3 the thickness of atmosphere at 700 feet. This would cause approximately 3 times as much drag so the top speed would be about 1/3 of the top speed at 30,000 feet, or about 200 to 300 mph at best, and that is with no wind. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;ve seen these kinds of aircraft fly faster than that at lower altitudes at airshows. </p>

<p>Honestly, no matter what anyone says to me, I won&#39;t believe that these attacks were anything other than a well-coordinated terrorist attack. Since it&#39;s apparent I won&#39;t convince you of that I think it&#39;s best we just agree to disagree on this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen: The Truth And Lies Surrounding 9/11?</p>

<p>Did you know the &quot;jet&quot; that hit the Pentagon performed a 360 descending spiral to hit it? Do you have any idea how unlikely that is? Do you have any idea how hard that is? Do you have any idea how much easier it would have been to just fly directly into it?</p>

<p>Did you know they&#39;ve never released any of the confiscated videos of the Pentagon attack?</p>

<p>Did you know the plans to invade Afghanistan were drawn up months in advance?</p>

<p>Do you have any idea how many trillions of American tax payer dollars have gone to the military industrial complex since 9/11?</p>

<p>Are you familiar with Operation Northwoods?</p>

<p>Did you know the largest joint military exercises in Americas history were taking place on 9/11?</p>

<p>Did you know their &quot;exercises&quot; almost directly mirrored the attacks?</p>

<p>Air traffic controllers thought it was all just a drill.</p>

<p>Get this through you thick skull: America is the most heavily guarded nation on the planet. The Pentagon was attacked roughly 30 minutes after the WTC. IT&#39;S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THESE JETS WERE ALLOWED TO ROAM THROUGH AMERICAN AIRSPACE INTO FUCKING WASHINGTON FOR A FULL 30 MINUTES.</p>

<p>ALL hijacked aircraft in America get military escorts, yet, they were told by Dick Cheney himself to &quot;stand down&quot;. </p>

<p>Did you know there was insider trading indicating knowledge of the attacks in the days leading up to 9/11? </p>

<p>The list of incriminating evidence go&#39;s on, and on, and on...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Yes, and Building 7 was damaged extensively by falling debris by the two towers, causing its collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>That made me chuckle. I suppose the falling debris damaged a majority of the upright structural beams? You do know how strong steel buildings are don&#39;t you? They will literally roll over in their own footprint if not properly demolished. You do know they found thermite in the WTC dust?</p>

<p>IT&#39;S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A BUILDING TO COLLAPSE AT FREE-FALL SPEED WITHOUT BEING PROFESSIONALLY DEMOLISHED.</p>

<p>There&#39;s literally thousands of architects and engineers screaming bloody murder. What&#39;s more? They are joined by thousands of pilots, cops, firefighters, and the like. You should really invest more in the industry professionals...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So here&#39;s what I&#39;ve determined after listening to this...</p>

<p>The firing of this person is a travesty, I won&#39;t disagree... just because you present an analysis of events that go contrary to the official events you shouldn&#39;t go through what Mr. Farrell was subject to. </p>

<p>What I hear in his interview is his side of events that led to his dismissal and the steps he&#39;s taken to fight that dismissal. I assume he based his analysis based on issues and evidence you&#39;ve quoted during our debating, but the issue I have with this is we&#39;re only hearing his side of the events... that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not any substance to what he has to say, but without hearing both sides it&#39;s hard for me to point to this and say &quot;AHA! It WAS a conspiracy!&quot; </p>

<p>I will tell you this... hearing his story has at least put enough of a doubt in my mind that I&#39;m going to go back and take another look at some of the points you&#39;ve presented and take a fresh look at them. I can&#39;t promise that, once I&#39;ve done that, my opinion is going to change, but I will go back, review the points you&#39;ve raised, and see where my opinion stands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Fold back pattern&quot; you say.  Who made that one up?  Does that mean that you think that part of an aircraft going one direction extremely fast is going to go the other direction for some reason?  And you could see this from videos taken from a long distance away?</p>

<p>It&#39;s wonderful what mysterious and technical sounding names can do, if they were <em>nano-</em> fold back patterns well, then, I&#39;d have to believe that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fold back pattern is not a key term or bold face word in a text book, so don&#39;t try to become esoteric with its meaning.  There are simple physics applied, with a static collision, that would show the force counteract the plane in a way that it would not tear through the building without resistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fold back pattern naturally means something as it has grammatical and linguistic value.  It is not a highly scientific term for specific purposes.  However, I&#39;m glad you have presented your level of intelligence with your responses.  The lack of a resistant force to the airplane when it collides with the tower shows the impossibility of such a reaction.  There is something to physics, and the laws by which matter on this planet behaves.  I suggest reading about it sometime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I linked you a video that answered most of the questions that you posed and you said it was a fabrication. </p>

<p>So there&#39;s really nothing more for us to talk about, and honestly the minute you resorted to insulting me I stopped taking any point you may have been trying to make seriously. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again... we&#39;re just going to have to agree to disagree on this. Neither one of us is having our minds changed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one and only film I can actually recommend to anyone is <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8797525979024486145">The Truth And Lies Surrounding 9/11</a>. There is no theories in this documentary, everything is backed up with official documents. I was just like you for 8 years, I truly <em>believed</em> the official version of events. That is, until I watched the Truth And Lies.</p>

<p>My life has since changed dramatically. I spend dozens of hours per week combing through alternative news sources, blogs, Live Leak, YouTube, Vimeo, and internet archives. I feel like a digger. Looking for hidden jewels, addicted to the forbidden fruit.</p>
