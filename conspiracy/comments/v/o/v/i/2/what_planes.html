       I'm really not sure what to take of this but it sounds very credible. I never believed in the no plane theory with the WTC until I watched this. Now I'm not sure anymore.

       I can help you out here, my office was on the top of a 40 story building 7 blocks from the WTC and my people all saw the second plane and some of them saw bother planes.

       This would be great if it weren't for the multiple images, videos, and eye witness accounts of the planes hitting the towers, as well as the plane wreckage found at the site.

       Are you kidding me?  That is your evidence?  A couple of pictures of a wheel and an engine taken out of place of the site?  And then one picture of a window section of a plane? A plane?  It does not necessarily entail a 757.  And on the site it even suggests that the pictures are not the same and questionable at best.  I think you have some learning to do, youngin.

       That was the first site I was able to find on short notice. Even if you think that it wasn't a plane that brought the buildings down, the fact that planes did hit them is indisputable.

       That is the entire point.  Did I ever say NOTHING hit the towers?  Did I try to blame it all on holograms or reptilians? No.  So first of all, get your shit straight.  My point is exactly what TYPE of plane hit the building, because of the videos "filmed", they seem to somehow defy all basic physics by tearing through the outer shell of the WTC like tissue paper.

       No on the first one. It was released by some very questionable sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second one is extremely suspect. NO ONE REACTS TO THE GIGANTIC PLANE FLYING INTO THE BUILDING. It's not until a split second after impact, when the fireball starts expanding outward that they actually react. All of the talking could simply be an overdub...
      </p>
      <p>
       I have little doubt that they did fly
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       into those buildings, but it damn sure wasn't commercial jetliners.

       Everyone was staring at the first tower and probably not paying any attention to the jet, and as far as no one reacting until a split-second after, when should they have reacted?
      </p>
      <p>
       My standard response to people who say they weren't airplanes that were flown into the buildings is usually this:
      </p>
      <p>
       There are records of these flights taking off from their prospective airports and passenger manifests showing the names of the people on these planes. If planes weren't flown into the buildings, what happened to these flights and what happened to the passengers?

       "when should they have reacted?"
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as they saw the gigantic fucking plane flying at like 500 mph, LESS THAN 1000 FT IN ELEVATION, right at the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       The planes disappeared from radar on at least one occasion. That is when they landed, evacuated the airliners, executed the passengers, and buried them with bulldozers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a majority of the passenger manifests were made up of fictitious people.

       It's the most obvious "conspiracy" in the history of man. You'd either have to be a full blown idiot, a government paid disinformation agent, or completely and totally out of the loop to think otherwise...

       Your explanation sounds far more outlandish than what actually transpired. Executed and buried in mass graves?

       I know more about aviation than the average person does, and passenger jets most certainly can reach those speeds at those altitudes; they're just not designed to and doing so causes stress on the airframe and the engines.

       Are you familiar with Pilots For 9/11 Truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Top speed for a 767 is 898 kph/558 mph and that is at an altitude of about 30,000 feet, source:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.zap16.com/civ%20fact/civ%20Boeing%20767-200.htm">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       at 30,000 feet the atmosphere is 1/3 the thickness of atmosphere at 700 feet. This would cause approximately 3 times as much drag so the top speed would be about 1/3 of the top speed at 30,000 feet, or about 200 to 300 mph at best, and that is with no wind. "

       Honestly, no matter what anyone says to me, I won't believe that these attacks were anything other than a well-coordinated terrorist attack. Since it's apparent I won't convince you of that I think it's best we just agree to disagree on this.

       Have you seen: The Truth And Lies Surrounding 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know the "jet" that hit the Pentagon performed a 360 descending spiral to hit it? Do you have any idea how unlikely that is? Do you have any idea how hard that is? Do you have any idea how much easier it would have been to just fly directly into it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know they've never released any of the confiscated videos of the Pentagon attack?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know the plans to invade Afghanistan were drawn up months in advance?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any idea how many trillions of American tax payer dollars have gone to the military industrial complex since 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you familiar with Operation Northwoods?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know the largest joint military exercises in Americas history were taking place on 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know their "exercises" almost directly mirrored the attacks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Air traffic controllers thought it was all just a drill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get this through you thick skull: America is the most heavily guarded nation on the planet. The Pentagon was attacked roughly 30 minutes after the WTC. IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THESE JETS WERE ALLOWED TO ROAM THROUGH AMERICAN AIRSPACE INTO FUCKING WASHINGTON FOR A FULL 30 MINUTES.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALL hijacked aircraft in America get military escorts, yet, they were told by Dick Cheney himself to "stand down".
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know there was insider trading indicating knowledge of the attacks in the days leading up to 9/11?
      </p>

       The list of incriminating evidence go's on, and on, and on...

      </p>
      <p>
       That made me chuckle. I suppose the falling debris damaged a majority of the upright structural beams? You do know how strong steel buildings are don't you? They will literally roll over in their own footprint if not properly demolished. You do know they found thermite in the WTC dust?
      </p>
      <p>
       IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A BUILDING TO COLLAPSE AT FREE-FALL SPEED WITHOUT BEING PROFESSIONALLY DEMOLISHED.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's literally thousands of architects and engineers screaming bloody murder. What's more? They are joined by thousands of pilots, cops, firefighters, and the like. You should really invest more in the industry professionals...

       So here's what I've determined after listening to this...
      </p>
      <p>
       The firing of this person is a travesty, I won't disagree... just because you present an analysis of events that go contrary to the official events you shouldn't go through what Mr. Farrell was subject to.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I hear in his interview is his side of events that led to his dismissal and the steps he's taken to fight that dismissal. I assume he based his analysis based on issues and evidence you've quoted during our debating, but the issue I have with this is we're only hearing his side of the events... that doesn't mean there's not any substance to what he has to say, but without hearing both sides it's hard for me to point to this and say "AHA! It WAS a conspiracy!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I will tell you this... hearing his story has at least put enough of a doubt in my mind that I'm going to go back and take another look at some of the points you've presented and take a fresh look at them. I can't promise that, once I've done that, my opinion is going to change, but I will go back, review the points you've raised, and see where my opinion stands.

       And of course you have to account for the aircraft and the passengers that departed and never arrived, right?  They were tracked by ATC, what happened to them?

       There's only 3 types of people who believe the official version of 9/11: the uninformed, in denial, or paid disinformation agent. And so, as you can see I leave plenty of room for the uninformed, and I know you aren't just simply uninformed. How do I know?

       Correct.  Videos of planes tearing through steel beams without so much as a fold back pattern of ANY type is real evidence, of video manipulation and not an actual passenger airliner.

       "Fold back pattern" you say.  Who made that one up?  Does that mean that you think that part of an aircraft going one direction extremely fast is going to go the other direction for some reason?  And you could see this from videos taken from a long distance away?

       Fold back pattern is not a key term or bold face word in a text book, so don't try to become esoteric with its meaning.  There are simple physics applied, with a static collision, that would show the force counteract the plane in a way that it would not tear through the building without resistance.

       So fold back pattern doesn't actually mean anything (but it sounds all sciency) however you cite it as being proof of something?  And there wasn't resistance to the aircraft?  I'd say that
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       completely destroyed the aircraft and severely damaged the building, what do you call that?

       Fold back pattern naturally means something as it has grammatical and linguistic value.  It is not a highly scientific term for specific purposes.  However, I'm glad you have presented your level of intelligence with your responses.  The lack of a resistant force to the airplane when it collides with the tower shows the impossibility of such a reaction.  There is something to physics, and the laws by which matter on this planet behaves.  I suggest reading about it sometime.

       9/11 was nothing but a well-planned terrorist attack... I think the reason people have such a hard time accepting that is they can't come to terms with the fact that 19 hijackers armed with nothing more than box cutters and maybe some pepper spray were able to carry out an attack of this magnitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, unlike some other people, I respect the opinions of those who think otherwise... I've just never seen anything that was able to convince me  of any sort of conspiracy.

       Which, despite your ridiculous claim and article, goes back to what made the two towers collapse?  Plane crash? Nope.  Fire damage? Nope.  Demolition? Well, you're somewhat of a lost cause, anyway.  Cheers to ignorance.

       I don't know about the WTC honestly, but the Pentagon I defiantly believe there was no plane. After all of the research I done on that plane there is just so little evidence for a plane hitting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again I am not so sure on the WTC.

       Yes, and Building 7 was damaged extensively by falling debris by the two towers, causing its collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm not going to convince you of that, anymore than you'll convince me it was a grand conspiracy, so again, why don't we just agree to disagree?

       I linked you a video that answered most of the questions that you posed and you said it was a fabrication.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's really nothing more for us to talk about, and honestly the minute you resorted to insulting me I stopped taking any point you may have been trying to make seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll say it again... we're just going to have to agree to disagree on this. Neither one of us is having our minds changed.

       The one and only film I can actually recommend to anyone is
       <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8797525979024486145">
        The Truth And Lies Surrounding 9/11
       </a>
       . There is no theories in this documentary, everything is backed up with official documents. I was just like you for 8 years, I truly
       <em>
        believed
       </em>
       the official version of events. That is, until I watched the Truth And Lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       My life has since changed dramatically. I spend dozens of hours per week combing through alternative news sources, blogs, Live Leak, YouTube, Vimeo, and internet archives. I feel like a digger. Looking for hidden jewels, addicted to the forbidden fruit.
