<p>Laff.  Obviously this makes him an expert in matters of atmospheric physics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The individuals who are demanding answers about HAARP are scattered around the planet. As well as bush dwellers in Alaska, they include: a physician in Finland; a scientist in Holland; an anti-nuclear protester in Australia; independent physicists in the United States; a grandmother in Canada, and countless others.</p>

<p>Those are all experts, obviously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the objections to HAARP have been registered using the tools of the 1990s. From the Internet, fax machines, syndicated talk radio and a number of alternative print mediums the word is getting out and people are waking up to this new intrusion by an over zealous United States government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well its obvious you are going to parade your ignorance as the truth. So it looks like I&#39;m finally going to have to destroy you, and your weak &#39;logic&#39;. You can thank me later. Funny thing is that you got your buddies from r/conspirtard to come here and troll as well.</p>

<p>Here is the truth:</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t refuted anything, not a single fact that was presented in the PBS special. All you did was attack its production value. This is because you CAN NOT refute the facts presented, so you attack its production value, which is an irrelevant fact that attacks the author. That makes it an &quot;ad hominem&quot;, as per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An ad hominem (Latin for &quot;to the man&quot; or &quot;to the person&quot;), short for argumentum ad hominem, is an attempt to negate the truth of a claim by pointing out a <strong>negative characteristic</strong> or belief of the person supporting it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me telling you to resume business as usual, by continuing your r/conspirtard circlejerk is not pointing out a negative <strong>characteristic</strong>. Obviously you are too stupid to tell (now that&#39;s an ad hominem). And just in case you are too fucking stupid to realize what a characteristic is (From what you&#39;ve said so far, I wouldn&#39;t doubt it), here&#39;s the definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1char·ac·ter·is·tic
noun \ˌker-ik-tə-ˈris-tik, ˌka-rik-\
Definition of CHARACTERISTIC
1 - a distinguishing trait, quality, or property
2- the integral part of a common logarithm
3- the smallest positive integer n which for an operation in a ring or field yields 0 when any element is used n times with the operation
See characteristic defined for English-language learners »
See characteristic defined for kids »</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thirdly I looked at the <em>Skeptoid</em> website, and checked out the author. This is his educational background:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dunning was born in 1965 in Santa Monica, California, USA. Between 1983 and 1984 he studied computer science at Brigham Young University; film and television at UCLA from 1985 to 1987 and then fiction writing at UC Irvine between 1988 and 1992. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dunning_%28skeptic%29#Biography">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So looks like some guy with a degree in film production is a totally qualified meteorologist? Lol, I find it funny that you attack the credentials of my source, yet your source only has a degree in FILM PRODUCTION, but to you that&#39;s good enough because he suits your needs.</p>

<p>Also that article does nothing to discredit HAARP, it once again attacks that &quot;doctor&#39;s&quot; credentials, but doesn&#39;t refute any of the concerns that people have about HAARP. It doesn&#39;t go into the science behind meteorology, except a quick mention on how the ionosphere is above the stratosphere and atmosphere, and the three are not interconnected(which is obviously fucking false, Mr PhD in film production). The majority of this article is an attack on the people that are trying to warn others. It lacks substance and facts.</p>

<p>And finally, just because you are too fucking stupid to know left from right, I HAVE NOT ignored you and accused you of not saying anything.</p>

<p>I ACCUSED YOU OF NOT REFUTING THE FACTS PRESENTED IN THE PBS SPECIAL. You can call it what you want. Hopefully typing in all caps will get that through to your pea-sized brain.</p>

<p>Now that’s what I call rebuttal filled with facts, and ad hominems.</p>

<p>If you want to have a real debate and not bullshit (then maybe I&#39;ll treat you with respect, but so far you&#39;ve lost that), refute the points laid out in that video which features PBS, and then we can go from there. But you fail to do that and create fallacious arguments to no end. Go back to r/conspirtard, you haven&#39;t convinced anyone here.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: I don&#39;t usually use ad homimens when I debate people, but I was respectful to the cuntfestering troll for too long, and all he does is twists my words and create fallacious arguments. It was a good laugh while it lasted though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider myself destroyed, thank you.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll have to give you partial credit for Dunning (did he claim to have a doctorate?  I must have missed that), although he did lay out the problems with the HAARP pretty well.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d be more worried about &quot;Dr.&quot; Begich, given that he deliberately used the phony diploma to impress people and, again, the alleged PBS video, which uses WETA&#39;s logo in a dishonest attempt to attain legitimacy (if you really think that was a PBS production I&#39;m not going to argue the point further, unless, of course, WETA replies to my email).  Those two aren&#39;t just examples of being unqualified to comment on the top but are examples of deliberate deception, this is a really important distinction.</p>

<p>One thing that&#39;s gotten lost here is the wildly improbably nature of some of the claims for the mysterious HAARP machine, such is it causing earthquakes in other parts of the world and other craziness.  No, I&#39;m not a geologist, nor am I an atmospheric physicist... say, how about we ask someone who might actually <em>be</em> a scientist? <a href="/r/askscience">/r/askscience</a>, or Slashdot???</p>

<p>The problem with that idea is that we&#39;d be laughed at and generally made fun of.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s been fun, keep your tinfoil hat on!</p>

<p>You and you pals should be concerned, if the &#39;evidence&#39; for your beliefs is so weak that you have to resort to lies and deception to try to convince people then your cause is in bad shape.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not going to reveal the person&#39;s name at WETA, just use their contact form if you want to verify this.  Don&#39;t worry, if they get it removed you can just put it back and you&#39;ll be back in business!  The business of, well, prevaricating. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I was wrong to accuse you of lying about this issue, I have no reason to believe you were involved with the production of the video in question.  &quot;You&quot; in this context means people who hold the same opinion, collectively, not &quot;you&quot; personally.</p>

<p>I do apologize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You crack me up; only a portion of that video was of PBS. I had said that earlier, I was asking to to debunk the facts presented in the WETA &quot;portion&quot; of that video. You failed to do so, and continued to attack the credibility of the &quot;production&quot;. Either way you were unable to refute the facts presented in that particular video, whether it was from WETA or not. (either way, if someone used parts of a WETA special, w/o their approval, in a video of their own, then WETA has the right to take them down for copyright infringement. Otherwise it&#39;s public domain and WETA can&#39;t do shit.)</p>

<p>And here is a better &quot;produced&quot; series on HAARP, it has been aired by TruTv, and I can confirm this. There are many experts that all say the same thing, good luck at refuting them all: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY4HGs-9JiU&amp;amp;feature=related">Youtube</a> (This is just the first part, you&#39;ll have to find the others; they&#39;re probably on youtube as well).</p>

<p>Here is a written document by Florida International University regarding HAARP&#39;s manipulation of weather: <a href="http://www2.fiu.edu/%7Emizrachs/HAARP.html">http://www2.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/HAARP.html</a></p>

<p>See, the problem with your argument is that you don&#39;t refute any of the fact presented in the video/ article/ whatever; you just attack the characteristics of the authors&#39; works, which doesn&#39;t help you convince anyone.</p>

<p>Plus explain all the DoD investment in HAARP, if it&#39;s just for &#39;research&#39;?</p>

<p>P.S. I don&#39;t take offensive, once I&#39;ve dished it out. I believe it is expected, no? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, which portion of the video was from PBS?  There were no words, no captions, just graphics, and everything was overlaid by the same voice.  There was actually no information content from PBS at all, but you keep saying you want me to refute the PBS special!  </p>

<p>Seriously, tell me what portion was from PBS, just list the facts that WETA presented and also tell me how you decided which were a WETA production and which weren&#39;t.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said this before and I&#39;m not going to say it again, PBS was used in a dishonest and deceitful attempt to lend that &#39;special&#39; legitimacy, no more, no less.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how I can refute the &#39;facts&#39; as presented since they&#39;re presented as, well, Facts, carved in stone, without any references.  I have a trained praying mantis that can predict the stock market by traveling into the past!  Can you refute that?  You can&#39;t, can you?</p>

<p>How does it locate submarines and under ground facilities in other parts of the globe?  How does it perform &#39;electronic sweeps for mind control of large populations&quot;??  Do you consider those to be facts?  <em>Mind control?? Really??</em></p>

<p>It says that earthquakes and volcanoes produce EM disturbances and &quot;it is theorized&quot; something to to the effect that the reverse is true and somehow HAARP can cause that... who&#39;s theory?  How would such a weapon be aimed?  How would underground bunker detectors be aimed, all across the world?  Is that &#39;theorized&#39; or is it a &quot;fact&quot;</p>

<p>It refers to &#39;gigawatts&#39; of power being projected into the ionosphere... where did that power come from?  A gigawatt is the peak output of </p>

<p>&quot;The largest unit (out of four) of the Belgian Nuclear Plant Doel has a peak output of 1.04 GW.<sup><a href="http://www.electrabel.com/whoarewe/nuclear/keyfigures_doel.aspx">[10]</a>&quot;</sup>  That&#39;s from Wiki and you can look it up along with it&#39;s reference.</p>

<p>It lists several other patents, why?  They don&#39;t seem to deal with the topic at hand.</p>

<p>It quotes &quot;The Lost Millenium&quot; which is subtitled &quot;How did the Atlanteans tap the free energy of the universe&quot; (the book was apparently rereleased as &quot;Siva!&quot;, the blurb on the cover says &quot;A Science Fiction novel of the far past&quot;.  The quote is a juicy one and very dramatic (and the voiceover says that the earth operates like a generator and in some mysterious way can be sped up and fly apart... how is this related to HAARP), and how is that a fact?  And why are they quoting a sci-fi book in a supposedly science related article?  Aside from the juicy quote that says what they want have the audience believe, of course.</p>

<p>The video is gibberish, intentionally deceptive gibberish. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> You list a link from &quot;Florida International University&quot;...that&#39;s not actually <em>from</em> the university, it&#39;s from a staff member or a student...  I can&#39;t find &quot;Mizrachs&quot; anywhere and nothing from the university itself except for a &quot;HAARP access road&quot;.</p>

<p>The link says that &quot;That still would not be as powerful as HAARP&#39;s multi-gigawatt (giga = billion) radiation capability&quot;.  OK, so that means multiple, big, power plants.  Where are they??  You can actually see HAARP on Google Maps (partially in low resolution, but you&#39;d think that large power plants would show up even so, wouldn&#39;t you?).  Unless they&#39;re nuke plants where do they get their fuel?  </p>

<p><strong>Yet Another Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Ah, here&#39;s <a href="http://www2.fiu.edu/%7Emizrachs/">Mizrachs:</a>.  He&#39;s an &quot;Adjunct Lecturer, Florida International University, Department of Sociology/Anthropology&quot;.  </p>

<p>An &quot;Adjunct Lecturer in Sociology/Anthropology&quot; doesn&#39;t represent the University nor does he seem to be qualified to have an authoritative opinion on HAARP...</p>

<p><strong>Another Edit:</strong> Re: &quot;TruTV&quot;:</p>

<p>ABOUT US</p>

<p>truTV is television&#39;s destination for real-life stories told from an exciting and dramatic first-person perspective and features high-stakes, action-packed originals that give viewers access to places and situations they can&#39;t normally experience. Among truTV network&#39;s primetime fan favorites are the original series Operation Repo, World&#39;s Dumbest, Hardcore Pawn, Lizard Lick Towing, Disorder in the Court, Black Gold, Las Vegas Jailhouse, Top 20 Most Shocking and Bait Car.</p>

<p>Not exactly PBS and pretty much the definition of &quot;sensationalize&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Hopefully the final edit:</strong>  </p>

<p>Back to the patent:  it says nothing about detecting submarines or underground bunkers, it <em>certainly</em> doesn&#39;t say anything about mind control.  And talks about &quot;The method of claim 2 wherein said artificial particles are provided by injecting same into said at least one region from an orbiting satellite&quot;, that doesn&#39;t sound like HAARP as it exists today does it?  </p>

<p>Also &quot; The method of claim 1 wherein said electromagnetic radiation is generated at the site of a naturally-occurring hydrocarbon fuel source, said fuel source being located in at least one of northerly or southerly magnetic latitudes.&quot;  Also not HAARP.</p>

<p>Strangely, it doesn&#39;t list References, although it does list &quot;Other References&quot; as:</p>

<p>Liberty Magazine, (2/35) p. 7 N. Tesla. .
New York Times (9/22/40) Section 2, p. 7 W. L. Laurence. .
New York Times (12/8/15) p. 8 Col. 3..</p>

<p>Strange references for a scientific patent, those are more like publicity.</p>

<p>Also the USPTO doesn&#39;t require proof that something actually works or even if it&#39;s possible... they just look for something that is, basically, new.  Long ago patents <em>did</em> have to be for real things, no longer.</p>

<p>In fact you can find patents for:</p>

<p><a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;S1=20060071122.PGNR.&amp;amp;OS=DN/20060071122&amp;amp;RS=DN/20060071122">Full body teleportation system</a></p>

<p><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=6960975.PN.&amp;amp;OS=PN/6960975&amp;amp;RS=PN/6960975">Space vehicle propelled by the pressure of inflationary vacuum state</a></p>

<p>None of the above actually exists or are possible with the current state of physics...</p>

<p><strong>Final Edit:</strong>  Good news!!  Turns out that HAARP does in fact transmit gigawatts of power, it&#39;s not the same thing as the plain old input power, it&#39;s a function of &quot;effective radiated power&quot; which involves the antennas in some mysterious fashion.  So I retract one (and only one) of my objections to the sources you&#39;ve come up with, that being the size and number of power plants needed to run HAARP.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program">Source:</a>, yes, the non-tinfoil hat Wiki page on HAARP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And another thing...</p>

<p>In academia there are two sources of information, primary and secondary.</p>

<p>A primary source is from the guy who did the experiment, did the study, did the research (not internet research, research in the real world).</p>

<p>A secondary source is information that&#39;s been subject to peer review, publishing in an academic or scientific journal, cited in other research, etc..</p>

<p>In the later case the probative value of the information is determined by the reputation of the various people that review, publish, whatever in addition to the reputation of the original source.</p>

<p>The weight you give to a primary source depends heavily on the reputation of the author, researcher, experimenter in question.</p>

<p>For example, if the director of CERN told you that they&#39;d discovered the Higgs Boson you&#39;d be impressed, because he naturally could be considered to have a valid opinion of the highest order.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you were told the exact same thing, in the exact same words, by Bozo the Clown, you might be skeptical.</p>

<p>What you&#39;ve been providing me is a little like a primary source (well, actually a real primary source would tell you how the arrived at their conclusion, provide their data, cite their sources and the like, which your sources didn&#39;t do in any way, they just made statements that you&#39;re supposed to consider as hard evidence... for no good reason.  In fact every PBS show I&#39;ve ever seen interviews the primary character involved to some degree, your PBS article is notable in that it didn&#39;t do that.  This is another clue).</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve said I was wrong in attacking the credibility of your sources.  Actually, that&#39;s the right thing to do; for example, a real PBS show would have a certain weight, while a production of random internet doods would have very little, and random internet doods deliberately pretending to be a reliable source would be entitled to no weight at all, quite the contrary, they could be considered to be frauds and their opinions could be tossed in the trash, and in fact in academia that&#39;s exactly what happens to someone who is found to be falsifying a study or whatever, the entire thing goes in the can.</p>

<p>The same thing applies to another source, which you present as being from the Florida International University, which would have given it some weight... only it wasn&#39;t from FIU, it was from the &quot; Adjunct Lecturer in Sociology/Anthropology&quot; as noted below, or possibly above, depending on how reddit formats all of my sparkling prose.  And your sociologist/anthropologist did the <em>exact</em> same thing that the rest of your sources did, statements without anything to back them up, just presented as cosmic truisms that have nothing behind them. </p>

<p>PS  And the video also mentions how Teller, IIRC, told about a laser like thing and then the narrator leaps to the conclusion that he <em>really</em> meant HAARP, um, that&#39;s quite a leap.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Here I go again, I&#39;m almost tempted to fly all the way to Alaska and take pictures of HAARP and it&#39;s supposed massive power supply... only if I did that you and your pals would just decide I was in on the plot and discard everything that they hadn&#39;t decided just had to be true.  You&#39;ve already decided I was a mossad agent, in fact, so that kind of makes the whole thing moot, doesn&#39;t it? </p>

<p>HAARP exists and is used to modify weather...</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a PBS special on HAARP: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnRPZOUVhJ4">Youtube PBS Special</a></p>

<p>And the name of which HAARP was patented under is: <em>Method and apparatus for altering a region in the earth&#39;s atmosphere, ionosphere, and/or magnetosphere</em> (Which obviously indicates it is used for weather modification, and can possibly be weaponized) <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=4,686,605.PN.&amp;amp;OS=PN/4,686,605&amp;amp;RS=PN/4,686,605">Source: US government&#39;s patent office</a></p>

<p>Also if you are feeling really ballsy you can request records on weather modification projects (per the FOIA) from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), which they are required to keep on record per Public Law 92-205, 15 USC § 330B, enacted in 1971.</p>

<p>Oh no, you can&#39;t wiggle out of this that easily.  That video had <em>one voiceover</em>, an amateur one, and the WETA part may or may not have been about HAARP but there&#39;s no way to tell, is there?  Whoever did that voiceover and whoever &#39;produced&#39; that video included WETA to lend it some sort of legitimacy and you <em>absolutely did</em> introduce it as a &quot;PBS Special&quot; when it was no such thing.  If you need it spelled out there would have been two voiceovers if only part of it was from PBS, there wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Lying is hard work, there&#39;s a lot that can go wrong, as you&#39;re finding out.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m done with the video (which, I believe, will show that you or someone like you <em>deliberately lied</em> and attributed &quot;evidence&quot; to a reputable news source, falsely) it will help sink the supposed HAARP enthusiasts and just maybe make the front page, if not the MSM.</p>

<p>HAARP heats the ionosphere in the region directly above it. That doesn&#39;t mean it modifies weather.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lightning actually occurs when there&#39;s an excess of charge in clouds. The ionosphere is much, much higher than that. Regardless, it&#39;s still a leap from that to saying HAARP modifies weather, even if it could create lightning near the HAARP facility. That would sound more like pedantically splitting hairs on the definition of &quot;weather modification.&quot;</p>

<p>No, I didn&#39;t watch the video. I much prefer to read about these things.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying the supposed PBS video isn&#39;t from PBS, they have standards, that video doesn&#39;t, so that&#39;s not an ad hominem attack on PBS because it&#39;s not a PBS production.  For an amateur production it&#39;s... well, it&#39;s still not very good.</p>

<p>I have seen much worse quality of video on PBS than that.</p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t take you more than an hour to refute the patent on HAARP, which clearly states that it will be used to modify weather and how.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll give you all the time in the world if you need it, hopefully HAARP won&#39;t have caused an earthquake in your area by then.</p>
