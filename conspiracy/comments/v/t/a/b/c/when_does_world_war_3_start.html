       I've seen a lot of blogs and writings and opinions about WWIII and how some think it's inevitable, some think it won't come, and others are just in fear of the possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a certain perspective, WWI and II were started for specific reasons (and I'm not talking about the mainline reasons we all learned in school, of course). And they were started in a specific way, and with specific tools designed at the time. The world we live in now (especially in a "post 9-11 era") is completely different. The tools that TPTB and MSM use have evolved, morphed and have been "hybridized" to fit the current architecture and common mind of man today.
      </p>
      <p>
       We may never see WWIII start in the same way the people from early 1900's or late 30's saw WWI and II start. Think for a moment what defines that the world is at war. Sure, one person or even a large group of people could see that certain large nations are at war, but when is it globally defined and accepted as a world war? Isn't it when the MSM and TPTB issue a statement in the media as such? Isn't that how everything "popular" is propagated for the masses?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that a "WWIII" has already been started and has been going on for some time but TPTB aren't using the old tools of the past to propagandize it as such. There's no need to whip the world up into a frenzy with declaring "World War Three!" because they know it wouldn't benefit their cause. They already have most of the masses where they want and the world has already been at work for decades. There's no need for a propagandized World War anymore when you have the United Nations and NATO exacting their pseudo powers in country after country to get what they want.

       This is the kind of interesting exploratory posts I like seeing here, as opposed to the fools that are asking if EVERYTHING is a false flag operation.

       in WWIII right now. US foreign policy since WWII is like late game CIV4. The fantasies of some mad man at the CIA. Grab all the resources! Make everything ours!

       So far it has been a long war against third world countries. It's been this way since the early 60's as an attempt of the U.S. to secure all their resources first, in order to put a resource stranglehold on the other block of nations.

       It's already happening. You have to understand that most wars are bloodless wars, economic wars. Most revolutions are the same way - entirely, or almost entirely, bloodless.
      </p>
      <p>
       People constantly do what they have been conditioned through entertainment to do - look for some big mega-event like a nuclear attack, nuclear war, megaplague, bioweapons apocalypse - or some "giant mega FEMA camps we're all going to!" type thing, so much so that they miss the realities they are actually facing ALREADY.

       The Rothschilds dropped Israel onto Palestine to watch the fireworks and profit from both sides of the clusterfuck of conflict for decades. They had the last stand alone super power in their pocket too (Britain).

       I think TPTB declared war on the masses years ago and we are just realizing the banking elites have merely expanded and evolved slavery. The last president to stand up to the fuckers in charge got his head blown off in full daylight.

       The Cold War was a hot war and WW3. You mean WW4. In a sense, it has already started as actors are always trying for an advantage, but it is mostly financial now. Iraq, and Afghanistan, Libya and Syria as well as the Sudan are all examples of the effort to control oil and protect Israel. However, WW3 may break out between the US and China, although the US may try to use India as a proxy. History tells us that wars will occur is you wait long enough. The advances in technology means nuclear war. This does not bode well for mankind. Just wait. It will happen. Maybe not in our lifetimes, but it will happen.

       I think you have a wonderful user ID and it always makes me smile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are right that WWIII has already started: everywhere there are "limited engagements" and "humanitarian interventions".
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no Al-qaeda, there are no terrorists. There are paid (in dollars and heroin) mercenaries (blackwater - Xe - academi). We are fighting adversaries of our own creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the USA has the greatest military in the world is it fighting the second greatest military to a ten year stalemate in Afgahnistan? If not, then who are we fighting? Where are they getting their weapons?
      </p>
      <p>
       We use to make stuff. Now we blow it up (and kill people). That is not going to end soon. We are in a perpetual war that ends only when there are too few people to resist or somehow the machine grinds to a halt.

       Anytime I see Blackwater/Xe mentioned without their newest name change  included I fear their plans at obfuscation have been successful. It is now Blackwater/Xe/Academi. In a generation's time they just may complete an entire sentence this way.

       Russia just switched back to being against Britain, The US, etc. The wars never really stopped. US wars: Korean, Vietnam, The Middle East. The US has basically been posturing to take on China the whole time. And this is only from the explicit wars. Forget about the secret military agencies.

       The only way we'll have anything close to another World War is if the entire global economy collapses, which if things continued the way they are would probably be another ~25-50 years.

       Biggles, really dude? Your prediction is 25 years at minimum? I just do not see the dollar lasting that long. The collapse may be more subtle than we think-depending on how much food you've got on hand. Some global entity will probably swoop in and form a new reserve currency (probably based on gold, so the current gold bugs eat it from depreciation- fucking irony) --note: i'm just speculating here friend-- btw I have some hard assets as a precaution, but you can't help and wonder if installing such a commodity-based currency to drive down those physical asset prices  was in the cards as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, there are just too many facets in the collapse scenario, where-by very minor complications can hault our distribution chains. It's similar to buying insurance-- I'll be okay if the "worst", economically, happens.

       For the global economy to collapse? I think it will be around 25 years, but in an extreme maximum, I could see another 10-25 happening, just because I'm not into giving 'deadlines' for when I think it will happen, but unless a drastic turnaround happens, I do think it's inevitable, so I just leave more room for error than most.

       Ya, I agree here. I just think my post is just about how I feel.

      <p>
       I feel like by approximating in the next 25-50 years, it is also implied that it could be in the next 5 or 10, but maybe I was just being too vague, sorry :c
      </p>
      <p>
       I stand by the idea that I don't think there will be another World War (Or WW3) until there is a global economic collapse, there's just really too much to lose for everybody and I think that breaking point is a global collapse.

       I concur that WWIII has already regain. The MSM and our political leaders are in denial of the fact so most people haven't a clue. Radical Islamist are attacking civilized nations all over the globe. They have openly declared their intentions. Sharia law, universal compliance to Islam, and the total destruction of Israel. The world it appears will only come to grips with this global threat when they acquire and strike with nuclear weapons. PRAY THAT DAY WILL LEAVE US ABLE  RESPOND.
