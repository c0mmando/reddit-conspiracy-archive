    <div class="md"><p>Audit passes. USD Crumbles. New fiat currency takes over issued from IMF. USA sells tons of assets to compensate for China and Pakistan debt. Welfare state envelopes entire USA. Massive and explosive social unrest. Severe militarization of continental USA.  People embrace big brother to help them, this means living in assisted housing-millions of people. Total fascism takes hold of USA. The boot has been brought down making it increasingly harder to break free of total slavery. Generations become accustomed to living in perpetual slavery. End of freedom in USA. Repeat as needed in afloat countries. After currency restructuring is completed globally,section globe into manageable state-run countries(entities/corporations).

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds clich√© as hell but, you do hold power. The power is on your vote(s). I&#39;m not talking about your federal election vote, because that doesn&#39;t amount to a hill of beans any longer. The power that you hold is within your dollar. Lobbyists--and Isreal-- own the USA government. Lobbyists write legislation. Lobbyists are hired by corporations to write laws that benefit them and their board members. Corporations use the money from consumers to pay for lobbyists. Next, you have banks. Banks obviously have big wallets. Unfortunately for them, their wallets are filled with consumers&#39; monies. Invest your money in the little guys, read credit unions, and you essentially cut a little hole on the big banks&#39; wallets. Enough little holes and the wallet will fall apart. and on a side note, kill your television! All it does is condition you into subservience. Television plays with your brain, look that shit up; higher brain waves are affected by television. Also, telecommunication companies hire lots and lots of lobbyists, so quit paying them to hire capitol hill thugs.</p>

<p>The voting system is entirely corrupt. Your vote means nothing, no matter who you vote for. Energy is better spent correcting misinformation and having adult discussion with your peers. All politics are local. Get INVOLVED in your local political movements, doesn&#39;t matter which. Just get involved.</p>

And if the USA defaults they can liquidate all citizen&#39;s 401k, Roth IRA, etc. People will be dead in the water without big brother saving them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Audit passes.  Audit begins.  Foul play is discovered.  The treasury department seizes the Federal Reserve and takes over operations.  Federal reserve principals held on treason charges.  All Federal reserve debt since 1913 deemed fraudulent.  Treasury begins printing new notes, backed by gold and other commodities in parallel with the USD, allowing the new note to float against the USD.  All government employees shifted to the new currency and all American citizens and American corporations are allowed a one time fixed rate conversion into the new currency.  USD Crumbles into oblivion as hyperinflation destroys it.  The Treasury keeps printing USD to pay back Federal reserve and USD debt.  All debtors get screwed.  Primary debtor nations experience economic disaster.  China, Israel, the UK, the EU, Japan and many other nations immediately enter into severe depression.</p>

<p>This would very likely be the start of WW II, but the US economy would improve quite radically from this scenario and I suspect that something very close to this has been planned for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehh, it&#39;s a work of fiction, BUT, it is about time for a paradigm shift. First, we had the revolutionary war, 80 years later the civil war, 80 years later WWII and the great depression; which precipitated the introduction of the 16th amendment, or taxation without representation. This was the ugly father of the Federal Reserve. Now we are at the precipice of a new socioeconomic paradigm. Obviously, world currencies are failing one after another. This will only go on for so long, before a new society (or train of thought) is born. If we don&#39;t see some sweeping changes in the way humans live their lives, our children certainly will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In case anyone wants to read a bit about the last audit of the Fed, story from July 2011:  <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=9e2a4ea8-6e73-4be2-a753-62060dcbb3c3">Senator Sanders The Fed Audit</a></p>

<p>One segment:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As a result of this audit, we now know that the Federal Reserve provided more than $16 trillion in total financial assistance to some of the largest financial institutions and corporations in the United States and throughout the world,&quot; said Sanders. &quot;This is a clear case of socialism for the rich and rugged, you&#39;re-on-your-own individualism for everyone else.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the investigation&#39;s key findings is that the Fed unilaterally provided trillions of dollars in financial assistance to foreign banks and corporations from South Korea to Scotland, according to the GAO report. &quot;No agency of the United States government should be allowed to bailout a foreign bank or corporation without the direct approval of Congress and the president,&quot; Sanders said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine, but what about the fact that congressional oversight committee overwhelmingly approved this bill? Couldn&#39;t this be a sign that our representatives know that shit is about to hit the fan and want to be seen as being on the side of the people when it does?</p>

<p>What if the whole house of cards is about to come tumbling down? This shit can&#39;t stay a secret among the informed forever. What if we are hitting critical mass and the tyrants are about to get their comeuppance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to think that would be the case honestly but realistically speaking we are nothing more than debt slaves to those actually in charge and even if congress could somehow force the non government bank that is the fed to open their doors the president, regardless of who it is because they are all the same, will just declare martial law just like the executive branch has been doing to congress for years every time they try to cross the agenda. because the banks run this world and the federal reserve makes the money to allow that tyranny. I would love to see a change to that, for the scales to tip but historically they never really do. Countries may fall but the banks always run away with all the wealth. The average American is stupid or blind to reality because people still join the military knowing its designed only to make others suffer, they are so addicted to their ipads and TVs that I can&#39;t imagine anything that would make people stand up and say no like they should. This is brave new world and everyone is too selfish to care.</p>

You get in trouble for lying on a tax form. You don&#39;t get in trouble for not filling out a form (but good luck getting benefits). </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t know how a credit agency can put you in jail. They can wreck your credit score but they can&#39;t put you in prison. Are you getting bills? Do those bills have your name in all capital letters? That&#39;s not you, that&#39;s the corporation that was created in your name when you were born. The United States owns your corporation, not you. You don&#39;t have to fulfill any obligations held by your corporation, but if you don&#39;t you won&#39;t get Social Security, etc. (protip look at the name on your social security card).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that about the capital letters, that&#39;s how I get out of jury duty but the taxes still come out of my income before I even get the money, if I don&#39;t pay back taxes, even though I don&#39;t apply for anything federal the IRS will put me in prison since I can afford a lawyer to fight the fact that taxing income is illegal in this country. And I was meaning more the tax with saying they would send me to jail but since I am refusing to pay my debt since is not legal how I got the debt they can bring me to court over it and pretty much force me to pay or spend time. My birth certificate, like everyone in this country creates a corporation in my name that makes me liable for things that are illegal to enforce upon a natural person but if I fight it too much I will draw too much attention to myself and I don&#39;t want that</p>

<p>No.  It won&#39;t mean shit until the Fed gets BOOTED from ruling over the government...and THAT shit ain&#39;t gonna happen without the entire country (shit - the <em>world</em>) going to all out war first.</p>

<p>The bill passes the house, but it won&#39;t get really enacted.</p>

<p>And if it does get enacted, it won&#39;t actually get APPLIED to the Feds because I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll somehow keep themselves from being audited.</p>

<p>And if they DO get audited, it won&#39;t matter because they&#39;ll make sure that the auditors find &quot;nothing wrong with their practices&quot;.</p>

<p>And if the auditors DO find something wrong with their practices, that info will never see the light of day because the motherfuckers OWN the MSM.</p>

<p>And if it DOES see the light of day, they&#39;ll just as quickly BURY the info with so much disinfo as to make your head spin.</p>

<p>Bro, the point is that it really doesn&#39;t mean jack squat shit that some cheesy bill passed the house.</p>

<p>A lot more has to happen - and we the 99% have to likely get up and do it ourselves - before any real change occurs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what taxes are you trying to avoid? If you don&#39;t want to pay federal income tax, just don&#39;t fill out any forms and don&#39;t apply for any federal benefits. You get in trouble for lying on a tax form. You don&#39;t get in trouble for not filling out a form (but good luck getting benefits). </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t know how a credit agency can put you in jail. They can wreck your credit score but they can&#39;t put you in prison. Are you getting bills? Do those bills have your name in all capital letters? That&#39;s not you, that&#39;s the corporation that was created in your name when you were born. The United States owns your corporation, not you. You don&#39;t have to fulfill any obligations held by your corporation, but if you don&#39;t you won&#39;t get Social Security, etc. (protip look at the name on your social security card).</p>
