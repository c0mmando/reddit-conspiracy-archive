    <div class="md"><p>Am I the only one who thinks that his AMA from the back of a cop car is BS? </p>

<p>Who here has been in the back of a cop car? From your experience, how, exactly, would you post an AMA from the back of a cop car?</p>

<p>Using the smart phone that they DIDN&#39;T confiscate?</p>

<p>The same smart phone that you managed to get out of your pocket while handcuffed?</p>

<p>Using said smartphone while your hands are behind your back (as is usually standard procedure when arrested)?</p>

<p>Anyone who subscribes to conspiracy should be well aware that the cops don&#39;t want you using your phone after you&#39;ve been arrested. Even if, on the very, VERY unlikely chance that someone arrested because they seem to be a threat actually had their hands cuffed in front of them, does anyone seriously believe that he was able to get out his phone, launch whatever reddit client he has and post that before the cops got wise?</p>

<p>Anyone who is a member of r/conspiracy should know better. Seriously, how come no one doubts anything that gets posted in this subreddit? Do you guys think Reddit is really so secure that completely illogical shit like this can be seen as reliable? That there are no attention-lovers, moles, spies or just plain trolls here?</p>

<p>Sorry, I don&#39;t buy that cop car thing for a second. That sounds like a deliberately dramatic exit to me.</p>

<p>There is a pretty sizable lack of critical thinkers and a huge amount of confirmation bias around here. If it sounds right, it is right, instead of searching for proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I say around here only because the general &quot;motto&quot; is that CT&#39;s are critical thinkers who are searching for the truth, and question everything. Where as it seems more and more CT&#39;s aren&#39;t interested in the truth if it disagrees with their previous beliefs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying all people are like that, just noticing more and more.</p>

<p>Wanted to edit to reply to this;</p>

<p>I fully agree with this sentiment, as I state numerous times in this sub.</p>

<p>It really is a plague to all people. People everywhere have a large confirmation bias, and tend to agree with the truth so long as it agrees with what their idea of the truth was.</p>

<p>I love the idea of questioning everything, critically think and use the evidence and proof you see to create the most logical and sensible answer. If that agrees with what I thought, great, if not, then I simply learned something new.</p>

<p>Too many people blindly trust whatever they&#39;re told because it &quot;sounds right&quot; - it&#39;s not just CT&#39;s, which I didn&#39;t mean to imply, it&#39;s just that many CT&#39;s claim to know better, when the bulk don&#39;t seem to show it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Accurate.  I&#39;ve been in the back of a cop car with out arrest on a few occasions too.  They can just hold you there if you&#39;re causing trouble or in a place you&#39;re not allowed to be until they figure out what to do with you.  Depending on the situation he may have just been intimidated, dropped at his vehicle or home, then watched very closely and obviously to keep him in line.  If he&#39;s as paranoid as he seemed, he&#39;s probably got all his electronics off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...So... you believe the NSA took him because he knows the &quot;truth&quot; or whatever. They do this because they believe he&#39;s a threat to national security and secret agents go to arrest him without warrant, or without criminal charges. Then your saying, during this massive coverup (in which they managed to silence and coverup every single private and goverment lab in the area) they have to arrest him in order to silence him too. However, they just happen to leave him un-cuffed with his cellphone in the back of a police car, during which he has enough time to do a Reddit IAMA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I did not say any of that and your decision to turn it into that make you rather suspicious.</p>

<p>I simply said that it is accurate that you can in certain times use a cell phone from the back of a cop car.  If a cop was simply asked to secure an area w/o knowing the reason then its possible.   </p>

<p>Im also not saying OCDTrigger is legit, he seemed more interested in spouting non-sense then focusing on the topic.  But he was willing to correct his posts and respond to valid criticisms about his meandering, making it seem as if he was at least TRYING to be genuine.  </p>

<p>On the other side of it, the official reaction has been relatively standard procedure for creating an &#39;air of calm&#39; during a catastrophe.  Report some but not all, leave it as a mystery but an unimportant one (the explosion reports).  Minimize exposure of emergency personel to media until the situation is assessed and contained. etc etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s acknowledged by many people, including people in this sub, that he took it overboard with trying to grab people&#39;s attention. He makes some points that weren&#39;t proved to be rambling, but he really took it to a different level in terms of attention grabbing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See I just don&#39;t see that as definitive proof of anything, I really need more information to create an opinion on either side.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even totally against the concept of a nuclear cover-up, as much as the ramblings of OCDTrigger and his inability to consistently speak with people who refuted anything he said, made me start to question him.</p>

<p>edit;</p>

<p>Just to note - I also am skeptical to believe the one-liners in OCDTrigger&#39;s original threads that also state that they aren&#39;t receiving any different readings. The thing that OCDTrigger failed to do (in my opinion) was accurately defend his claims when anyone with any seeming knowledge of the field decided to refute any of his proposed theories. Which is why I have a hard time trusting him, despite the questions I still have from all of his threads.</p>

<p>While wikipedia scholars cut and paste articles and random people on forums say one thing, I need more proof of something before I can say I believe anything. I know that&#39;s vague but that&#39;s because it&#39;s just in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol @ HAARP...</p>

<p>EDIT:  I just want to point out that those that claim that this little bitty array, used to &#39;ignite the atmosphere&#39; and energize high frequency radio waves (in an effort to &#39;bounce&#39; them off the atmosphere like short wave radio waves do) only effects a <em>small</em> part of the atmosphere.  Many times I have heard that all the greenhouse gasses we have released (those responsible for global climate change) cannot possibly effect our atmosphere, but that HAARP and its tiny little patch of the atmosphere can manipulate weather and climate on a global scale.  Doesn&#39;t this seem just a <em>little</em> inconsistent? ...because, it is inconsistent.</p>

<p>If there really was a coverup, the posts would have been deleted on every subreddit. There is censorship everyday on <a href="/r/polictis">/r/polictis</a> and this story would have certainly been deleted if it was true.
Moreover, the part where he is arrested is stupid. If he was really arrested to stop him from spreading this coverup, the police would have taken his phone right away.</p>

<p>And even if they forgot, he does an AMA on the site that led him arrested ? Really, you believe that ?</p>

<p>Anyway, it may be stupid but I think this story was just an experience to see the kind of reaction the reddit community would have in a case like that. And also to ridicule the conspiracy theorists by referring to the tinfoil hats !</p>

But it was gone from my links from the top bar and my drop down? But then...I found the link on the left side if i edited my subscriptions.</p>

<p>It is probably just glitch...BUT THEN I thought to myself...IN A VERY PARANOID MANNER:) wouldn&#39;t it be weird if there was some post they didn&#39;t want me to see. Something some bot wanted to filter from my vision. And then I see this post. I have probably done like 10 searches for OCD trigger over past 10 days out of curiosity. </p>

<p>Just odd. Just odd. </p>

<p>I think he truly did find something.  And they didn&#39;t like him making such a fuss. I hope he is ok. That is why I prefer to be a watcher. I got kids:) But still like to know what is going on. </p>

<p><a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> (SRD) is a meta subreddit dedicated to aggregating the drama on Reddit strictly for observing and discussing. Although the bot above, brigitte_mohnhaupt, would like you to think that SRD is an invasion subreddit, drama is never submitted to SRD for the purposes of causing drama or swaying discussions in their favor. That would kind of defeat the purpose of observing drama anyways.</p>

<p><strong>If you choose to follow the link provided by brigitte_mohnhaupt into SRD please read the sidebar before participating.</strong> You&#39;re welcome to participate in the discussion, but SRD is not another platform for your drama.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the NOAA weather website.  If you look at it, there are a lot of little blue and green dots around the country.  They are all near major cities, where humidity comes from evaporation off of concrete and steel as well as just occuring in the air; the radar just happens to also be in a big city.</p>

<p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> any kind of nuclear phenomenon.  It&#39;s just weather.</p>

<p>I was only speaking on behalf of people who are just loaded with confirmation bias, and aren&#39;t critically thinking and aren&#39;t searching for the truth.</p>

<p>I firmly acknowledge that&#39;s not nearly everyone in this sub, I am only saying that in regards to those who DON&#39;T actively search for the truth.</p>
