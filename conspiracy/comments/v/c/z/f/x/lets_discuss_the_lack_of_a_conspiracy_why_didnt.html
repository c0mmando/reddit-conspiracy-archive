       No matter how much of the material shared here you choose to believe, I assume the vast majority of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       believes that the Bush administration engaged in extensive lies, cover-ups, and manipulation with regards to the Iraq War and the "War on Terror".
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is why didn't they fake finding evidence of WMDs in Iraq after the US invaded?  For example, it seems like it would be incredibly easy to fabricate evidence of an Iraqi biological weapons program- whether creating files, faking positive tests for anthrax, or planting machinery and test tubes for creating WMDs.  There would be little cost, little risk, and immense political reward for the Bush administration.  If they had created credible evidence of a WMD program in Iraq that could pose a legitimate threat to the US, many would consider Bush to be one of the greatest presidents rather than the worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course no one here knows the answer for sure, but it is interesting to discuss the LACK of a conspiracy where one could do the job so well.

       Both a bio-weapons program and nuclear program would involve a huge amount of infra-structure and personnel; a hard thing to fake and  engineer in a short amount of time post invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the real reason is that after the power-coup that was 911, the power-cabal-in-charge no longer had any fear of a reprisal of any kind [political, legal or in the controlled media] so they didn't really bother to come-up with any evidence as evidence is no longer necessary.

       Yup, plus couple in two other factors.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Many prominent Democrats went on record calling for Saddam's overthrow based on the bad intellegence.  They needed this facet to get out of the news cycles.  It was basically a no win for them to admit they were gullible.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Once the first salvos were fired, the "You break it, you bought it" policy was in effect.  The only thing that would have undermined this would have been trying to factor in a post justification.  It goes with the "only thing worse than the crime is the cover-up".  Why run the risk of giving the populace a reason to be against the war early when there was no need?

       Well we can say that in retrospect, but the '04 election was extremely close. Bush won the popular vote by 2.5%, and the electoral vote by 35. The vote was not decided until Kerry conceded Ohio the morning after and winning the state would have tipped the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       So given the amount of conspiracies and manipulation attributed to the Bush administration, this situation seems RIPE for the deployment of some fake evidence. And remember, in Powell's presentation to the UN, he showed satellite photos showing that the bioweapons program was mobile, and conducted in trailers. It doesn't seem like it would be hard to fake evidence- just find a Winnebago in the desert, point to some test tubes, and say they tested positive for anthrax. Or hire some Arab dudes in lab coats to say they ran a WMD program. Or point some clicking Geiger counters at some machinery and say it's radioactive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet there was none of this, and cooking up this evidence would have been MUCH simpler than nearly all of the other conspiracies found on this page.  Foreign policy and the Iraq was was the main issue in the '04 election, and had that happened Bush would have likely won in a landslide, rather than such a slim margin.

       Ok I just looked for so long and can't find it. Mind digging it up quick since you know what you are looking for? Allegedly trucks with nuclear material were headed for Iraq and got stopped, but I can't find anything official on this, just forum posts.

       Of course you can't find anything 'official'. They would never admit to it. I think what you've found so far is probably all that is to be found anymore.

       It is all a part of conditioning the population into accepting the paradigm and forcing them to realize that they are helpless to change anything. IE the absence of WMD's in Iraq caused many protesters to take to the streets, but it didn't change the game plan one iota. This caused the populace to be even more helpless and confused when bigger changes happened like the NDAA... there was not even a peep of protest for this. It is because like a dog the population is conditioned now to accept anything the ruling class thrusts upon them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, if they did find WMD's in Iraq the american people would have felt justified for invading. The general public would feel like the american military is actually serving their interests, and people would not be conditioned like a beat dog to accept fate.

       Please understand that this is not a "Bush/Cheny" conspiracy. The plan runs much deeper than Bush, in fact, he is merely one piece of a much bigger puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush was willing to exchange his fame for notoriety in order to further a much larger goal of sending a message that there is no stopping the plans of the elite. No matter how unjust, the elite will continue on their track.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, the Iraq war was all about classically conditioning the general population to accept fate, as I pointed out earlier.

       Bush was not an idiot, he was playing the part of the fool.

       Because there is a concentrated effort to convince a large subset of the public that the government is crooked, so they make things very obvious because otherwise most people would be too stupid to put the shit together. Iraq having no WMDs is meant to be publicly known - this allows the public to understand our current scaremongering about Iran is untrustworthy. All of this is necessary so we can eventually topple the system and change the world and blah blah blah - using tools like Anonymous, Wikileaks, or any number of esoteric wisdom teachers, all of which are completely in their fucking pockets. Have you guys seriously still not figured this out yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. the wisdom teachers are not on a government payroll. The connection is this - they deal with the same spirits. They just call them by different names. Spirit guides, Ascended Masters, whatever, Galactic Federation of Light, they're exactly the same thing as the demons the secret societies worship. It's all really damn obvious, too.

      <p>
       That invisible beings are pulling all the strings is not in any way obvious, do you have any evidence for this?

       I never said the reality of these beings was obvious. I said the fact that they're the same beings on both sides is obvious. If you don't know they exist already, hey, that's great. But they've been in touch with humans for a very long time, and if you want, they'll be in touch with you too. All you really need to do is see the testimony and see how much of it corroborates other testimony without being directly related. It doesn't matter if you understand it.

       When you say that these beings are on both sides is obvious, that implies that the mere existence of the beings is even more obvious. This is not obvious, neither the existence of the beings nor whose side they are on if any.

       Do you have the data of this testimonial evidence that you speak of? Testimonial evidence is so very flimsy as it is, and even if it was legit that seems far more likley to be

       How is that faulty logic? If you claim that being X favors side Y, how is that not implying that being X exists? What is the evidence that being X exists OR favors side Y?

       I haven't made any extraordinary claims. We can look at these entities as variables, they don't even have to exist. They exist as concepts, the people who I allege interact with them claim themselves these beings exist. Measuring these claims against one another is completely possible, and easy. It doesn't require knowing anything about these beings themselves. This is something you should have been able to deduce from my first post, but you're throwing this nonsense around, confusing matters to the point where discussion becomes more complicated than necessary.

       So you claim there are entities, then all of a sudden they are just concepts... man I cant follow you at all. Have fun in your crazy little world I am done trying to understand it; you explain things so poorly but also as if other people have something seriousy wrong with them for not being able to decipher your inarticulate nonsense. You expect people to just agree with your absurd assertions even though you cannot provide any proof or even properly  explain your reasons for believing them.

       It's not hard at
       <em>
        all,
       </em>
       you're just digging your own hole of ridicule going on and on about how unreasonable it is. I say there are entities. Do I have proof of these entities? No, I do not, I don't even believe empirical proof is necessarily possible since they're incorporeal. What I have is enough similarity between enough testimony to be convinced the shit is real on a
       <em>
        personal level,
       </em>
       but not enough to prove to someone who expects better evidence. Am I even trying to convince you to believe in these entities? No, I am not. I know I don't have the proof to do this, so I've skipped over this issue entirely. What I am trying to tell you is this: both the secret societies associated with the NWO and these esoteric wisdom teachers who supposedly
       <em>
        oppose
       </em>
       the NWO report being in contact with entities of some kind. It's common. The reports are fucking ubiquitous. Okay? So, we have these two opposing teams, but they have both testified to being involved with entities. What I'm saying is this: these testimonies can be compared, and, by these comparisons, the entities being described by each of these groups can be shown to be the same entities. Does the reality of these entities need to be verified in order to make these comparisons? No, not at all. It's just comparisons between two separate bodies of descriptions, anyone can do it. This is why I act as though there is something very wrong with you for repeatedly bringing up "proof" of these beings - it's very fucking simple and proof is unnecessary.

       "If they had created credible evidence of a WMD program in Iraq that could pose a legitimate threat to the US, many would consider Bush to be one of the greatest presidents rather than the worst."

      <p>
       The terror fear campaign was skillfully managed.   Fear was being focused on the NEXT threat,  not the last one.   The average person still considered Iraq to be linked to 9/11,  WMD or not.   Anything found would have pointed at an outside supplier,  the US included.   That would not have helped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Show an example of the government wanting to reinforce a backward looking effort that would condone the idea of doing proper investigations?   They would rather create a new crisis than get people used to the idea of figuring out what had already happened.   Let the past be the past is a huge priority of the information control state,  unless it relates to gaining support for a present or future policy.   Even then you would only dredge up past issues that you could have monopoly control of the information flow.   During yellow cake,  how many experts were out there who could openly refute?

       How would that not have helped?  If Bush wanted to focus on the "next threat" he could just say that country supplied them, and cook up some phony evidence demonstrating it.  Doing so would have been MUCH simpler than carrying out most of the conspiracies discussed on this sub.  There would have been no better way to get the American people to sign onto another war/ increase the military budget/ impose more draconian measures.

       Bush was not unpopular with his base for not finding WMD.   He was unpopular for having underestimated how much money and life it would cost to secure Iraq for our permanent military bases that were focused on oil and regional presence.  Bush got his two terms,  and set the agenda to where even the present administration is locked into it.   Mission accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other conspiracies are you referring to?   Try to imagine this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush to Cheney: We haven’t found any WMD, is that a problem?   Cheney:   We found Osama and let him go, we did a WTC and Pentagon investigation that was a snow job, same with anthrax, we have Americans scared, there are no restrictions on our military budget, we are planning for Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iran, we got what we wanted.  No one of any import dares suggest there is not a valid war on terror.   We just announce that we haven’t found them, call off the search, and if we ever really need to find WMD, we will address that later.   For now, be glad we didn’t find them, because if we did, they would have “made in USA, or made in whatever, people we need to have on our side, written all over them.   We knew Saddam was using prohibited WMD against Iran and his own people and we never complained.   Let sleeping dogs lay.   Iraq and 9/11 have been linked in people’s minds, that is all that matters.   Bush:   Thanks Dick.   Investigations are loose cannons.   We are on a roll, so I agree.    Even if we did find WMD it would be better to not admit it.   Remember those pictures of Rumsfeld all chummy with Saddam.   Unless the public has a fit, lets play it down for now.
      </p>

       Even when the public did have a fit,  it was not televised.

       If you think the weapons were made in the USA... either the weapons are decades old, or you think they were sold during the Bush I administration (who invaded Iraq) or Clinton administration (who bombed Iraq)?  And Saddam stayed silent about getting weapons from people who are bombing him?

       Saddam used WMD against Iran and his own people.   You could also add Israel to that list.   Saddam had to purchase whole systems or components from abroad to do that,  and the US and its allies were his main sponsor until the Kuwait war.   Of course after Kuwait,  it was more difficult to sell anything to Iraq.   But if Russia or China had provided key systems,  it would be up to the CIA,  NSA,  Cheney,  Wolfowitz and others on whether it was actually strategically necessary or desireable to point the finger at them at that time.    My main contention is that the disclosure of finding WMD in Iraq post 9/11 was neither strategically necessary or desirable.    Thousands of road side bombs based on US explosives should make it clear that the country was packed to the gills with US sourced munitions.   The makers of these munitions along with Wall Street have a disproportionate say in what goes official and what doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Kuwait and especially after 9/11 Saddam was not allowed to tell his side of the story.   Eventually he was captured,  imprisoned,  and murdered,  during which time the media did not translate or broadcasts his unedited statements.   If you have a better source for his statements during his "trial" (what a joke),  I would love to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to US military sources,  Osama had been treated at a well known hospital and had also been surrounded in Tora Bora.    In both cases,  the US military was redirected to provide Osama clear means of exit.   In addition,  communications attributed to Osama following 9/11 have been the subject of much good analysis.   Certain videos and tapes have either been fabricated or edited in order to serve the US agenda.   The official post 9/11 life of Osama is largely a fairy tale in my opinion,  and the story of Osama's capture,  murder,  and burial at sea is dubious at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternative sleuthing is an esoteric art that clearly resides on the wrong side of the rail road tracks,  surrounded by unsavory and ill motivated associations.  It is rarely publicly vindicated,  but its adherents find their reward in not having drunk the official kool aid,  and in those occasional releases such as Gulf of Tonkin and Operation Northwoods.    Credible witnesses and researchers have also come forward on the issues of the second Iraq War,  Anthrax,  9/11,  the assassinations of MLK,  JFK,  RFK,  the death of Osama etc. etc.   Its a jungle out there,  but I suggest you step "outside of the beltway" if you want to start finding out what is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  Second guessing the policy choices of the inner circle in DC and Wall Street without a seat at the table has its limitations for both the conspiracy minded and government apologists.   Over time,  the 9/11 fairy tales,  the Iraq War fairy tales,  etc. become less and less believable.    The power of spin starts wearing off and new facts come to light.    I like your post questioning the handing of the WMD story,  and I do not know the answer.   Someone could suddenly "FIND" old WMD in Iraq a week before the upcoming elections in November.   Information is a political weapon,  so how it is used is not always clear,  and if it is ever made clear,  it is after the passage of a substantial amount of time.

       But that matter shouldn’t blind us to the larger point:  The strategic rationale for the war didn’t actually hinge on classified information concerning chemical and biological stockpiles.   Rather, it depended on assessments about the nature of the Saddam Hussein regime and its activities.  The relevant facts were available to the public.

        THOMPSON:  Recently, part of an intelligence document was declassified and revealed that the United States had discovered certain quantities of sarin and mustard gas in Iraq.  In other words, WMD that Saddam claimed he didn't have.  Some were quick to point out that these were pre-1991 weapons and not the ones we went to war over, but it does seem legitimate to ask why not declassify the whole document and disclose everything that's been found over there?  It seems that there's some difficulty within the government in doing this, or talking about it.
        <strong>
         Do you think that the WMD that's been found there has any significance, and that we should go ahead and declassify the rest of the document?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        SECRETARY RUMSFELD:
        <strong>
         What you have stated is correct.  They have located something like 450 or 500 vessels, canisters, or warheads that either are currently filled with sarin gas or had been filled with sarin gas, some of which may or may not have deteriorated.  These have been gathered over a period of time.  The Department of Defense role is to destroy them as they're found.  Needless to say, chemical weapons are weapons of mass destruction
        </strong>
        and, as you indicated, Saddam Hussein had promised to declare them, said he had declared them to the United Nations and did not declare them. He had not done so.  How many more there are, we don't know.  We are constantly getting our hands on more of them, and we consider them a threat to our troops and a threat to the Iraqi people.  So clearly, Saddam Hussein is in violation of his representations to the United Nations; and clearly these are weapons of mass destruction; and clearly they're dangerous.  It is a fact that Senator Santorum and Chairman Hoekstra of the House Intelligence Committee have been discussing.

       Why wouldn't the resistance use these weapons against the US forces then?  They've made and cobbled together some devistating pieces of improvised weapons that forced the US to rapidly prototype and deploy a new type of vehicle, and retrofit at least two classes of others with stockpiles of arms that Iraq had.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were effective checmical weapons in country that just needed to be retrofit to go off as an IED, those would have been perfect to cause casulties and panic.  Exposives to damage the things like HUMVEEs that had no environmental controls, and then a delayed blast of Sarin/Mustard Gas on the response to up the anty for casualties.

       Don't complain to me. It's DoD that reiterated WMD's and hyperbole the information. It shows that Bush Administration did try to cover up by falsifying information with made up evidence. As later rebuked by CIA findings that no WMD's existed. Bush and his cronies got caught faking information that WMD's existed. Bush administration lied before the invasion on WMD's and lied afterward on WMD's. Right out of DoD and Rumsfields mouth who was GW's mouth piece.

       I read that they did find WMDs - phosgene gas, to be specific. Instead of turning it in, they kept it secret and brought it over to the US to use for tests and who knows what else.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was an accident in the process of transporting it, phosgene gas leaked, and that's what caused the massive bird deaths a year or two ago. John P. Wheeler was going to blow the whistle, but they killed him before he could.

       Saddam used WMD against Iran and his own people.   You could also add Israel to that list.   Saddam had to purchase whole systems or components from abroad to do that,  and the US and its allies were his main sponsor until the Kuwait war.   Of course after Kuwait,  it was more difficult to sell anything to Iraq.   But if Russia or China had provided key systems,  it would be up to the CIA,  NSA,  Cheney,  Wolfowitz and others on whether it was actually strategically necessary or desireable to point the finger at them at that time.    My main contention is that the disclosure of finding WMD in Iraq post 9/11 was neither strategically necessary or desirable.    Thousands of road side bombs based on US explosives should make it clear that the country was packed to the gills with US sourced munitions.   The makers of these munitions along with Wall Street have a disproportionate say in what goes official and what doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Kuwait and especially after 9/11 Saddam was not allowed to tell his side of the story.   Eventually he was captured,  imprisoned,  and murdered,  during which time the media did not translate or broadcasts his unedited statements.   If you have a better source for his statements during his "trial" (what a joke),  I would love to see it.

       According to US military sources,  Osama had been treated at a well known hospital and had also been surrounded in Tora Bora.    In both cases,  the US military was redirected to provide Osama clear means of exit.   In addition,  communications attributed to Osama following 9/11 have been the subject of much good analysis.   Certain videos and tapes have either been fabricated or edited in order to serve the US agenda.   The official post 9/11 life of Osama is largely a fairy tale in my opinion,  and the story of Osama's capture,  murder,  and burial at sea is dubious at best.

       Alternative sleuthing is an esoteric art that clearly resides on the wrong side of the rail road tracks,  surrounded by unsavory and ill motivated associations.  It is rarely publicly vindicated,  but its adherents find their reward in not having drunk the official kool aid,  and in those occasional releases such as Gulf of Tonkin and Operation Northwoods.    Credible witnesses and researchers have also come forward on the issues of the second Iraq War,  Anthrax,  9/11,  the assassinations of MLK,  JFK,  RFK,  the death of Osama etc. etc.   Its a jungle out there,  but I suggest you step "outside of the beltway" if you want to start finding out what is going on.
      </p>

       Edit:  Second guessing the policy choices of the inner circle in DC and Wall Street without a seat at the table has its limitations for both the conspiracy minded and government apologists.   Over time,  the 9/11 fairy tales,  the Iraq War fairy tales,  etc. become less and less believable.    The power of spin starts wearing off and new facts come to light.    I like your post questioning the handing of the WMD story,  and I do not know the answer.   Someone could suddenly "FIND" old WMD in Iraq a week before the upcoming elections in November.   Information is a political weapon,  so how it is used is not always clear,  and if it is ever made clear,  it is after the passage of a substantial amount of time.
