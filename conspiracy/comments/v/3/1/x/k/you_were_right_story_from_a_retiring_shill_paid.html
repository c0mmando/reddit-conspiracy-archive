       So as many have you guessed this account(sanswork) is actually owned by a professional poster.  I've found a new position however that I'm more comfortable with so I'm going to retire this account publicly and answer any questions you may have.  There are some questions about my employers I won't answer however as I do not wish to be sued.  I will also continue posting on this account in other forums since it was actually my personal account before I got into this position.
      </p>
      <p>
       About a year and a half ago I was contacted by a company as I had apparently indicated through comments my dissatisfaction with my work somehow.  I had an account with a bit of history and through connecting my personal information was found to have a solid knowledge of the reddit community from previous accounts(been here since the beginning on my previous account).  I was offered a not super salary but it was good enough for what the work was(to continue posting in the forum).  Unlike the previous shill story posted a few weeks ago I was given no talking points, folders or made to visit an office.  I work from home and was simple told to question every theory and to build confusion and questioning.  I'm a natural devils advocate so this seemed like an easy and perfect job for me.  I was also instructed at this time to gradually work into it and to not just jump in making tons of posts as that would raise too many flags.  Clearly over the past two months I've gotten a bit too involved personally in the discussions and have done so anyhow.  My employers were not a government entity nor what I recognize as a military contractor though I could be wrong.  I'm not exactly worried about my personal safety as my story is easily discredited.  So anyhow.  Ask away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: finally off to bed.  Will try to answer any new questions when I wake up this afternoon

       4 year old account, post history indicates they did engage in lots of 'derailing'.  What are you basing this on?  We have plenty of evidence money is allocated for just this cause.

       I'll admit I have no evidence. It just seems far fetched to me. Someone is paying him just to play devil's advocate in threads on Reddit, and not even on a specific topic? It seems like a waste of money.

       actually, about 30-40 of these spread around the popular forums would have anyone uneasy about breaking rank and file feeling a lot better about towing the official line. And that's what the major players in every industry need, more of the status quo.

       What does my happiness have to do with it?  Pretty small-minded assumption - that I corrected this for
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       somehow.  What shit.  How the fuck does that benefit me in the slightest?  Exposing myself to the defensive stupidity of hordes of idiots is not exactly
       <em>
        fun
       </em>
       , you know?  And why would this make me happy?  Just knowing that people like you are in the world excitedly and proudly defending their right to be wrong makes me vomitously depressed.  So no, I'm not happy at all.  Does that please you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, your hyperbole is rather trite.  There are countless things more annoying than all-caps corrections.  For instance, idiots defending their poor wield of their native language.  How about that?  Pretty spurious contention there, genius.

       Well yes, but it is feasible that a shill may just need to poison the well generally.  I'd say that what makes this more unlikely is sanswork admitting this and not being worried about his 'handlers' . He says he doesn't think he is working for the government or military but how would he know who he is working for ultimately.  He is not stupid and would realise that anyone wanting to poison conspiracy discourse is either government or big business with deep pockets and so blowing the whistle would be rather dangerous perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if he will answer any questions.

       I'm not worried because no one will believe it ultimately and they know that.  I may get called a shill all the time but the number of people that actually believe those insults is very low.  That said its happening constantly now and on almost all conspiracy comments which is why this account is no longer useful.

       My childhood was pretty good.  I grew up in a small town on the outskirts of Toronto with lots of wilderness to play in.  I don't personally think I'm a bad person.  I personally don't see the big deal in disrupting convos/stories here.  It's not like I'm stealing or anything.

       Also go read my reply to that.  I agree the treatment was horrible but I think we as a nation definitely killed way more than 50,000 of them.

       My conscience is clear.  I can't say enough I don't feel bad deep down for what I did just not interested in the constant arguments anymore.  I'm usually a pretty calm, non-confrontational person in person.  As I stated above I won't say who it was.  Just that they are not government/military.  At least not directly.  They also aren't secret with constant changing names like the other dudes company.  Mines just a standard internet consultancy.  I assume they are billed as such too.

       So... you're a sociopath then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen, I'm not going to sit here and pretend that the discussions that happen here on this forum have any importance at all (by-and-large, they are completely insignificant).  However, you know that you are spreading propaganda for someone with an agenda to avoid truth from surfacing, right?  If you connect the dots, you'll see that whoever is at the end of the rainbow and writing your checks, or possibly the person writing THEIR checks, is a very bad person.  And we're not talking about little white lies here.  We're talking about the cover up of deprivation of human rights, genocide and the eventual complete degradation of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that there are plenty of people who can live with that reality... but I couldn't.  Not in a million years.  And it's not for the future of the society, or the future of the country, or even my children.  It's the knowledge that I used my time on this earth to contribute negatively, and intentionally subverting people trying to do good work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good for you to find a new gig, but I'm torn... I'm not sure whether to hope for your sake that you are being truthful and really do feel no remorse for the negative impact you have had on humanity or to hope for society's sake that you do have a conscience somewhere in there.  Either way, I hope that moving forward, you make more positive decisions and do something that you can be proud of.

       I suppose you believe the one about 19 inept hijackers from saudi arabia directed by a billionaire hanging out in (one of many of these) cave complexes that didn't exist in afghanistan.. it's so far out there and full of holes you'd need to have stockholm syndrome to believe it IMO.

       I would like to think that any decent human being offered money to spread dissent would question the motive.  You repeatedly claim to have no clue whatsoever as to the purpose or intent of your employment but you were still readily willing to sell the free expression of your fellow man for personal gain.

       how are those surpluses coming?  oh wait, yeah.. deficits and debt.  how conservative.   also the conservative estimate of cost of jets we don't need.  really conservative.   the only thing they are conserving is their own jobs.

       What I assumed, incorrectly, was that you gave a fuck about anything... because you are posting your opinions on the internet.  It makes no sense at all that you even took the time to type and hit "enter" if you don't give a fuck.

       <em>

       posted because
       <em>
        I

       give a fuck.  My right.  My choice.  Also, fuck you.  Your attitude and contributions in general suck various kinds of ass.

       Your intentional misrepresentation of my comment is indicative of both your inability to communicate effectively

       The internet is the hivemind of a modern society. As time moves on you will learn that what you've done is basically the same as Rush Limbaugh paying a soulless shill to spew talking points supporting his senseless garbage of a show in an attempt to make his claims seem legit. As it has been done on radio you have proven it is done on the internet as well. Go fuck yourself.

       Its probably just me, but.. I have my doubts that this has to do with getting a different job that you're "more comfortable with" since you don't seem to show any discomfort with the position.

       so you weren't let go in anyway, you found a new job because you weren't very comfortable with your shill job and all that innocently coincides with the self admitted fact that your account is no longer of any use?

       *There's no way to prove it and of course you'd deny it if true, but your behavior is very suspicious. Especially the fact that have been flapping jaw and claiming I am wrong without actually bothering to prove it, yet acting as if you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is actually pretty typical of your posts, now that I look into it a bit. It's cute.*

       for those encountering shills - make sure they know that they are only making you less confused, and certain that you are right.   thank them for being a sounding board to help convince you.

       Honestly for the most part the random shill comments never bothered me too much.  As I said I didn't have a specific topic or sounding point to focus on so it was hard to determine for a fact I was a shill.  It was only when it became constant in almost every comment that it stopped being ignorable.

       I'll ask some more questions, hope you can answer them:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        How often did your superiors 'check in'?
       </li>
       <li>
        How did you communicate with them?
       </li>
       <li>
        What exactly was your mission?  Did it change on a daily basis?
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Did anyone review your work and give you 'pointers'? What were they?
       </li>
       <li>
        Can you recognize another 'fellow' shill?
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Were you aware of any co-workers?
       </li>
       <li>
        What would you estimate the 'shill' % here on reddit (of all conversations)?
       </li>
       <li>
        Any themes you were to draw special attention to?

       As I've said elsewhere I have no clue.  I'm not sure of a specific agenda I was just asked to start questioning/disrupting more posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       None really, I've been using online forums for years.  Just keep posting but with more of a dismissive nature.  As I said I naturally play devils advocate and question a lot so it was a good fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe just to discredit?  I really don't know they weren't specific enough to specify a plan.

       Why would anybody do that ? If you are getting money for youre services than other side (the side that pays) have to get something in return.

       Good question. I really don't know though.  My best guess is just to try and disrupt the subreddit.  But thats just a guess that makes the most sense.  As for why they want to disrupt it I don't know.  I don't see much worrying to the ruling class being posted here.

       has a basic problem that people only upvote what they want to here and what follows their personal beliefs.  Ignoring a lot of valuable content.  Even without me I doubt it will ever be that relevant.

       you have no idea what people read/upvote or ignore.  how would you know?  upvotes don't mean crap in r/conspiracy.  i would wager that many are paying more attention to downvoted or disappeared posts.   maybe we're playing you too!

       Very interesting. I think a fair amount of rational questioning can be a good thing for this community. The fact that you were paid to be hyper-skeptical(i suppose) is certainly concerning as I believe the self-evaluation of post should organically come from the community.(obviously). Similarly to a comment posted above, the efforts of a shill should be negated by the research and knowledge base of the community itself. Anyway, I personally appreciate you coming forward. I don't personally blame you for accepting the position because of the current dire economic situation, the benefits of working from home, ect,ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question: Does your personal philosophy align with the general ethos of r/cons -- Is there a bit of cognitive dissonance at play as you knowingly take money to subvert the discussion?

       I spend a lot of time studying/reading about who I consider the world leaders.  While I agree they exist I disagree with their backgrounds/motives/abilities to plan together that is a common thread in here.  I love research and I find so much stuff posted here without it that it was very easy to fall into character for me.

       Personally, what are your sources? What is your knowledge-base of these world leaders hinged on?
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it, these are individual actors, with unique perspectives and opportunities that have been presented to them via the social-networking they participate in. People network with each other about a wide range of things; these very wealthy and influential people happen to network with other wealthy and influential people about how they can mutually support their business models. Historically speaking we can successfully prove that fraternal brothers will support one another and cohesively mold their actions based around similar ideologies. The ideologies are what can definitively be spoken to, based upon the written and spoken works of said influential actors. From an epistemological stand point, we can't certainly KNOW a great deal. We can; however, develop patterns of association and form a belief or a solidified image of what/how reality is manipulated by individuals working within their "elite" social-networks, their "good-ol-boy clubs".

       I found superclass the book to be a good introduction into it.  Also in my previous life in working with a lot of wealthy/powerful people you see the same personality "faults" over and over.  Those "faults" are great for getting to and maintaining status but cause a lot of other problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snakes in suits is another fun read though not totally as on topic I still feel its relevant to the elite class.

       The dude is a master of the shilldom. My thought is: why would someone genuinely waste so much of their personal time arguing with an entire subreddit, near-constantly? I sure as fuck can think of better things to do.

       I've explained this numerous times. I waste so much of my "personal time" hanging out on Reddit because I have no choice. I have three different heart conditions and I am locked to sitting in a chair, on my couch, or laying in bed. I literally get no time to do anything, so I spend an enormous amount of time on Reddit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I sure as fuck can think of better things to do.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Name some better things I can do when I can't leave my apartment. Here's the kicker; it can't include lifting anything more than 10 pounds, or walking around for more than 20 minutes at a time without sitting down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a shill, not even close, I just speak out when I disagree with something, and I speak out when it's fairly obvious that someone is simply being ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been retardedly screwed over by the government due to loopholes in the system nearly my entire life due to my medical conditions, so I've had more than enough reason to dislike everything the government does.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't mean I let a confirmation bias rule my decision making like so many people here do. Critical thinking is the most important part of figuring out the truth, and if you can't think critically and you can't look at things objectively, you're not searching for the truth, you're just creating fantasies.

       Hello, users, I am the unofficial SRD ambassdor bot, here to quickly explain exactly what SubredditDrama is.

      <p>
       <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">
        /r/SubredditDrama
       </a>
       (SRD) is a meta subreddit dedicated to aggregating the drama on Reddit strictly for observing and discussing. Although the bot above, susanne_albrecht, would like you to think that SRD is an invasion subreddit, drama is never submitted to SRD for the purposes of causing drama or swaying discussions in their favor. That would kind of defeat the purpose of observing drama anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If you choose to follow the link provided by susanne_albrecht into SRD please read the sidebar before participating.
       </strong>
       You're welcome to participate in the discussion, but SRD is not another platform for your drama.

       I spend a lot of time studying/reading about who I consider the world leaders.  While I agree they exist I disagree with their backgrounds/motives/abilities to plan together that is a common thread in here.  I love research and I find so much stuff posted here without it that it was very easy to fall into character for me.
