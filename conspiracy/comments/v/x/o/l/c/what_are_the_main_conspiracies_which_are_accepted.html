</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no conspiracies. This subreddit harbors dissidents that have become disillusioned by a few &#39;documentaries&#39; that convinced them that there&#39;s a group that seeks to rule not only the United States, but the whole world. This is virtually impossible. No one is that amoral to put lives at risk and enslave people, why? because it&#39;s unfair. That&#39;s why. </p>

<p>We live in a democratic state. This by itself should be proof that the conspiracy theorists are in the wrong.</p>

<p>Please leave this subreddit, save yourself before you become deceived by these people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty logical conclusion when you ask simple questions like, what do nuclear bombs do Billy? gee I don&#39;t know , c mon have a guess, kill mass amounts of people who never done anything so wrong in their entire lives that they deserve to die for no reason, correct Billy.
Nuclear bombs are bloody useless to everyone.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently subbed, and here&#39;s why: I&#39;ve got a crackpot friend who believes in (more or less) EVERY SINGLE conspiracy evar, and even though I&#39;ve taken time out of my daily schedule to disprove certain individual conspiracies, he persists in his beliefs. 
I find this stuff hilarious (sometimes), and do have a slight conspiracy angle in this book-thing I&#39;ve been working on. So, I&#39;m here for the lulz and lessons on what sort of stupidity to avoid (so I don&#39;t sound like a blabbering idiot). 
Good enough reasons? </p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m sure this subreddit isn&#39;t all about the space-lizard/evil jews/hollow earth stuff, right? ....Right? -scared- All that&#39;s stuff&#39;s about as much fun as the Truther movement :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I disagree. &quot;Ignorant cunt&quot; would be a much more abusive term then some sticks. Just think about it, when you say to someone that he&#39;s a faggot he&#39;d assume you are referring to him as a homosexual and telling him to go eat a bowl of dicks. But when you tell someone that he&#39;s an ignorant cunt you are not only telling him that he&#39;s a terrible and jerky person but also an idiot. However, faggot is a fun word to call people.

<p>r/Conspiracy is a forum, not a single person. It consists of more than 60.000 subscribers. Subscribers who have all their own opinions and believes. It has no elected speakers. No charter must be accepted to join this forum. It would be presumptuous by any poster to present a consensus for this forum.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should read some of the past threads. It should give you an impression about the believes of various conspiracy subscribers.</p>

<p>Same thing could be said about reddit as a whole. But when people talk about a redditor they get the picture of a liberal atheist who likes cats and Obama and <del>faggots</del> gay people. So you&#39;re saying there&#39;s no stereotype to this subreddit? No common kind of post?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using stereotypes might be a convenient way to view the world, but stereotypes are just believes. Such believes may or may not accurately reflect reality.</p>

<p>In my opinion a characteristic shared by many conspiracy subscribers is the believe, that it is unwise to trust authorities and corporate owned media conglomerates at face value. But that&#39;s it. Different people believe different things. Different people use different standards what kind of information and sources they find reliable.</p>

<p>The MSM has spend decades stereotyping people who thought their government and the MSM were misinforming them as lunatic fringe. They were labeled conspiracy theorists. Questioning the official narrative of historic and contemporary events became associated with irrational ideas and crazy people.</p>

<p>Although I frequent numerous conspiracy related forums like the deeppoliticsforum I have never encountered a single person who actually believes that Elvis is still alive or even feels the need to discuss such topics. It is the classical usage of the guilt by association technique.</p>

<p>In my opinion this association is not just an accident. It was a direct response to the citizens concern about the assassinations in the sixties. There is also some evidence which supports my opinion. For example a declassified memo which instructs CIA media assets how to deal with those who question the official story of the death of JFK.

<p>Recently Kevin Ryan wrote a good article in which he also analyzes how this memo effected major newspapers. After this memo stereotyping and ridicule was used to silence dissent in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This cultural phenomenon goes back to 1967. At that time, in response to questions about the Warren Commission Report (which President Ford helped create), the CIA issued a memorandum calling for mainstream media sources to begin countering “conspiracy theorists.”[13] In the 45 years before the CIA memo came out, the phrase “conspiracy theory” appeared in the Washington Post and New York Times only 50 times, or about once per year. In the 45 years after the CIA memo, the phrase appeared 2,630 times, or about once per week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before the CIA memo came out, the Washington Post and New York Times had never used the phrase “conspiracy theorist.” After the CIA memo came out, these two newspapers have used that phrase 1,118 times. Of course, in these uses the phrase is always delivered in a context in which “conspiracy theorists” were made to seem less intelligent and less rationale than people who uncritically accept official explanations for major events.

<p>So if you wish to pick up media concocted stereotypes be free to to so. But don&#39;t expect those people you want to stereotype to accept such labels.</p>

<p>For those who want to know more how stereotyping and ridicule is used as thoughtstopper and serves to silence dissident voices, I recommend Corbett Report episode number 50 (ca. 50 min podcast).

    <div class="md"><p>When I said stereotype I meant the <em>actual</em> stereotypical and common post made in r/Conspiracy (like FB screenshots in r/Atheism), because I am still unsure what is the main notion in this subreddit (conspiracies duh, but which?).</p>

<p>Also, congrats on your conspiracy theory about conspiracy theorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there such a thing like an <em>acutal</em> stereotypical post in this subreddit? </p>

<p>Sure there is a lot of banking bashing, distrust of politicians, distrust of the intelligence agencies, distrust of the MSM and often also a general anti-Zionism which sometimes develops into anti-Semitism. But I am unaware of such a common post. </p>

<p>There are thousands of posts in this subreddit. If there is such an <em>actual</em> and common post which is embraced by the majority of the subscribers you should surely be able to provide multiple examples of it.</p>

<p>I never said there is, I asked if there is one, to get a clearer picture of which conspiracy theories are most accepted here. However, I see that it is irrelevant (as you described).</p>

<p>Same thing could be said about reddit as a whole. But when people talk about a redditor they get the picture of a liberal atheist who likes cats and Obama and <del>faggots</del> gay people. So you&#39;re saying there&#39;s no stereotype to this subreddit? No common kind of post?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I disagree. &quot;Ignorant cunt&quot; would be a much more abusive term then some sticks. Just think about it, when you say to someone that he&#39;s a faggot he&#39;d assume you are referring to him as a homosexual and telling him to go eat a bowl of dicks. But when you tell someone that he&#39;s an ignorant cunt you are not only telling him that he&#39;s a terrible and jerky person but also an idiot. However, faggot is a fun word to call people. That was my pseudo-intellect shining.</p>
