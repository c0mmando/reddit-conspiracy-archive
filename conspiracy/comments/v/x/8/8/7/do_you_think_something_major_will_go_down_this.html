       From an economic collapse to Isreal and the US invading Iran, the 2012 "prophecies", mass alien disclosure, ascension and a false flag attacks at the olympics. I've heard many different conspiracies coming up in 2012, what do you believe will happen in 2012 and what kind of evidence is making you certain of this?

       ^ What this guy said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people need to understand that with these scare tactics about "the end of the world in 2012" people are cashing in on their fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are buying kits to survive the end of the world, giving massive hits to websites, spreading the fear they've acquired from such tales.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'biggest' thing is just what's already happening, the Middle East is continuing to become an even bigger shitstorm, and the economy is going to continue to become worse and worse.

       on topic, I believe exactly what spike said. the conspiracies regarding the olympics, even though very convincing and realistic, will not happen because conspiracies about major events happen every single time. Only on a couple of occasions did these conspiracies become true

       I have different levels of belief when it comes to the categories you just listed, but essentially I think something WILL happen by the end of the year...and definitely something major due to a combination of all of the above, especially the economic situation, and the Iran/Syria situation. As much as many self-professed conspiracy theorists love to slam the Mayan 2012 connection as being nothing more serious than Y2k, it's too much of a coincidence for the 26,000 year cycle to reset right on the eve of the greatest financial collapse in the history of the planet AND when WW3 is looking increasingly imminent with the upcoming invasion of Syria and eventually Iran which will
       <em>
        HEAVILY
       </em>
       involve Russia and China.

       There certainly are a multitude of issues which could have a complete paradigm shift in very short order if certain conditions arise. I wouldn't attempt a prediction of what will happen, and I wouldn't give much credence to anyone here who claims to KNOW what will happen, at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the items mentioned above have a certain amount of validity to them, and the timing is incredibly fascinating. In short, I do believe that something could happen with relation to what you have mentioned above. Saying anything more would be unfounded speculation in my opinion.  I'm just so happy to be alive right now.

       Just as an fyi, the calendars have changed significantly over the years. Even the Mayans will tell you that it is off by an unknown amount of time. Maybe as much as 100 years. This isn't actually 2012 as far as the Mayan calendar is concerned.

       Just for the record, that 26,000 year procession cycle talk is ALL bullshit. We're actually closer to the beginning of the
       <em>
        previous
       </em>
       procession cycle than we are to the beginning of a new one. If you do your research diligently, you will discover this. What is alarming to me, and what makes me believe this 2012 shit is relevant, is that all the supposed scientific reasons for it are
       <em>
        completely invented,
       </em>
       yet it's been popularized and made really big regardless. Obviously some hidden hand intends to do something with it or it wouldn't have blown up the way it has - because there are no genuine merits responsible for how big it's gotten, only artificial hype. Seriously. Look into it. It's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       More on this point, it's noteworthy that practically everyone who has helped to popularize this 2012 business admits themselves that
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1AXJX1iDsY">
        they received their info from spirits they channeled, and on psychedelic drugs in most cases.
       </a>
       If it weren't for these people receiving this info from these spirits, we wouldn't know anything about 2012. This is literally where the narrative came from. This is noteworthy because these spirits are the same entities giving information to people like David Wilcock, David Icke, Jordan Maxwell, Michael Tsarion - people the truth movement looks up to, who teach about the NWO and how to stop them and etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you investigate these matters you start to see a picture - these spirits are pulling strings. The elite of present day worship them, but the truth movement and the New Agers and modern socially-minded young people worship them too  - only in slightly different forms. The truth movement stuff, all this conspiracy stuff, plays right into their hands - they are trying to wake us up on purpose, they have something bigger than a police state NWO in mind, us discovering the corruption of the current world is only a small part of the plan. They want us to build the new world and for this reason they are giving us all the tools to take apart the old one and training us to be master builders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just putting this info out there because it's good info. For real, do your research, what I'm saying adds up. Peace.

       I provided proof of the most important part - that the entities responsible for the 2012 mythology are the same ones who are now telling you to wake up and how. The former paragraph about the procession cycle is basic astronomical truth. I tell you to look it up instead because it's not my job to do your ninth grade homework and I know you people selectively believe what you like anyway. The last paragraph on my conclusions also needs no proof - it is supposed based on the data rather than supported by data. The other two paragraphs are proof enough to do the math alone.

       You should look into hindu/ buddhist views on the cycles of time. It coincides with the Mayan calender which this cycle ends dec 2012 and then a Golden Age is going to begin as we are currently going through the Iron Age or lowest age in terms of consciousness

       Yes exactly. Kali Yuga represents the Iron age or worst age(last of the cycle) when enlightenment is reached by barely anyone and the Satya Yuga represents the best of all ages the Golden Age.

       However I think you are trying to connect two things together. Example: Say you get a fortune cookie and it says something like "Happiness will come from suffering", the entire day you are trying in your mind to think of something that matches that "fortune".

       Yes we are on the brink of something major, but I believe it's unrelated to the myans.

       Yes, and if not this exact year then soon. See McKenna's "novelty theory." With tech and everything else we're moving way too fast for something big not to happen.

       Our monetary system has been purposefully fucked.  The US Dollar will cease to be the "World Reserve Currency" sometime within the next year or so.

       To be honest no.  I do like reading theories on hear but people also thought the NATO summit was gonna start something. And this has been going on for, as long as I've been paying attention, three years and I have yet to see a theory on any of the events come true. Predictions like the one about the Olympics happens 3-4 times a year and I doubt this will be any different.

        This will be
        <em>
         The Year of Three Presidents
        </em>
        .
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama dies on July 4 of a "heart attack".  His Trojan Horse usefulness to his employers &amp; CIA handlers, the Bush Family, is finished.  The "Secret Service prostitution scandal" in Colombia in April was a palace coup designed to install (shift) key double agent bodyguards around Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biden will step aside to let Hillary be the nominee, AND take the presidency early.  This controversial decision will predictably outrage the right-wing, but also cost Hillary, setting her back in votes &amp; popularity immediately with her base in her clumsy handling of the "crisis".  The economic crisis will do the rest in putting Clinton into third-place in the presidential race.
      </p>
      <p>
       Palin will enter the race as an "independent".  There will be three tickets:  Romney/Ryan, Palin/Santorum (although Rand Paul will jockey for this position), and Clinton/Clark.
      </p>
      <p>
       No candidate will receive 270 electoral votes.  The election will be thrown into the House of Representatives, per the U.S. Constitution (and a repeat of the Election of 1824).
      </p>
      <p>
       The House-majority Republicans will split the vote.  Third-place Clinton/Clark will claim the presidency.  In a move that will further outrage Tea Partiers, this Constitutional marginal victory will be verified by John Roberts, who is part of the plot to install Hillary, but for the purposes of installing her as a patsy president for the military coup on 4/4/2015.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "victory" will result in Hillary being called "illegitimate" for the damaged months of her troubled presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election happens against a backdrop of economic disintegration as European banks default.  By December, the new economic crisis will be reaching its peak.  Entering 2013, emergency attempts to stabilize the Euro &amp; world economy with currency pegging.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will be viewed by the right-wing as the "One World Government" establishing itself, although that already exists in the form of Transnational Corporations buying &amp; selling governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       There remains the possibility of an "International 9/11" (either full or modified in scale) of false-flag simultaneous attacks on Paris, Berlin, Los Angeles, D.C., Ankara, Moscow, Tokyo, Beijing &amp; Mumbai; this will be an excuse for attempts to coordinate framework of international anti-terrorism laws &amp; regulations combined with framework for unified currency market system, regulated by international board of corporate elite "trustees".

       Aside from natural events or aliens swooping down (neither of which I expect to be more or less likely than any other year),
       <em>
        shit will only happen when and if people make it happen
       </em>
       . There are a lot of people freaking out about 2012. (More than at Y2K? I don't know and I'm not sure if there's a good way to check - perhaps analysis of television news coverage.) All that mental energy, all those people worked up in fear or hope or uncertain anticipation. Something
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       happen to some of these people. They will have a profound experience which changes them and their view of reality. What exactly that will be and if the "non-believers" will be able to witness anything besides folks freaking out remains to be seen.

       The only thing I foresee is military action of some sort in the Middle East. Obama is already waging war. A larger, targeted mission with a promise of no occupation would bolster his re-election. Romney couldn't really challenge him as the right loves war and the left basically blindly follows Obama, right or wrong.

       Ok, first reddit post (long time lurker and sly up/downvoter)! I think that something WILL happen this year. As comments downthread have mentioned, the evidence for 2012 being predicted by Mayans as the end of the world is rather flimsy...but have gotten SO much media attention. I believe the fear is being spread intentionally by the powers that be, so that if some major world event DOES happen (whether it is orchestrated or organic), the people are already freaking out and will be much more suggestible to, oh I dont know, give up certain liberties and rights in order to keep themselves safe etc. Although, with the crazy amount of natural disasters happening over the last few years I dont doubt there will be more to come in 2012. 
Edited to clarify point

       I believe if we Americans and citizens of the world don't stand up to out tyrannous and oppressive governments, we are in some big trouble. I believe something will happen, but it can be either for the greater good of us peace lovers, or for the worse. Scientists have been speaking about an ecological tipping point a lot lately, and that is another issue in itself that we have to keep in mind.

       nobody got the joke huh? from that back to the future stir on mainstream-reddit? NO I don't think anything bad will happen this year, I generally tend to think nothing bad will happen period. All we got to do is prevent our leaders from forcing something bad to fulfill prophecy which is so unnecessary it's not even funny. I have faith in good over evil  and the power of peace and creating a future we actually want to live in over short term gains from fear, pain, and strife

       We learn from the past, I would have thought that instead of referring to this as some "conspiracy theory" people would find trends in the way Hitler's Germany grew, and the way Stalin's USSR destroyed the world. You dont need to be an "evil" and "satanic" dictator to come up with these ideas. The US and UK have already started this war, if you look closely the first signs are always turning up at a time of economic crisis, where the population are desperate...then removing public power, basic human rights like banning peaceful protests against the Olympics, and freedom of speech by enforcing illegitimate cyber-copyright laws. The governments are gaining power and making their citizens believe they have none but to help their own country at times of war...hence how armies are created.

       umm benjamin fulford believes he's got the answer, and honestly, i believe he along with icke and wilcock are the only story that has had evidence (not enough for 100%) and seems to be slowly unraveling if you pay attention to news from around the world. My opinion, i just to see my alien fwends :)

       Funny how that works right? It's almost as if he says grandiose things in order to compell people to go past the paywall on his site. It's almost as if he's just trying to make money.

       lol relax kid.  I'm just curious what his message is, I don't want a copy of any of his articles.  There's thousands of conspiracy nuts out there, give me one good reason to give this one particular one money just to hear his likely ridiculous claims.  jcl5391 is basically advertising for him, so give me something other than, 'oh check this guy out..trust me!'
