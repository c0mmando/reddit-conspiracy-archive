<p>in the hands of the righties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is part of the problem. I do not believe it is &quot;in the hands of the righties&quot;, nor do I really believe &quot;the righties&quot; is even justifiably a real group of people. </p>

<p>r/politics has been beyond gamed for years, and not by the left or the right, but by the editors at the very top of the media food chain (some office with fellows loosely related to Conde Naste, Wired, and then actually the rest of the mainstream media [yes I know reddit is &#39;independent&#39; now. I have a bridge to sell you in London...]).</p>

<p>The posts and content of the discussion there is gamed first within the system, then by exterior forces too numerous to enumerate; consider the DoD or the NSA working solo to manipulate certain stories (the Stratfor emails showed that there is software that lets one dude control 500 unique online identities). Then you have private companies like Coke or Nike. Then exterior states like Korea or China. Then the JIDF, and then Stormfront. Then Stormfront pretending to be the JIDF. Then individual social media firms (check out r/socialmedia for a slow but ongoing discussion on how to fuck with reddit for <del>fun and</del> profit) who represent smaller brands and celebrities. Then individual troll users who use sockpuppet accounts. And the mods. And the admins. And various law enforcement agencies. </p>

<p>Almost <em>none</em> of the groups and individuals in the above paragraph are <em>righties</em>, but groups with distinct and unique political and ideological backgrounds and agendas. </p>

<p>Given the <em>absolutely fucking astounding number of people fucking with the reddit voting system,</em> <strong>especially on r/politics</strong>, I stand by my earlier statement and suggest it is better to abandon it and let people know to find such discussions elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is a strange situation, but somehow r/conspiracy has better political coverage than r/politics - and r/politics seems to be controlled through some sort of...conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it is different. I submit a lot and for every three or four upvotes I normally get one downvote. The hard part is getting the upvotes.

But I&#39;ve been looking at all the voting patterns on <a href="/r/politics/new">/r/politics/new</a> and it&#39;s suddenly happening on almost every submission.

The U.S./west isn&#39;t operating on capitalism, the &quot;rightists&quot; aren&#39;t capitalists.   As well, there&#39;s not left and right, there&#39;s collectivism and individualism.  Those who you are railing against are your fellow collectivist of a different tribe.  Your diametric opposition are anarchists, who are pure individualists, though at least you&#39;re closer to the mark in attacking those who believe in what Ron Paul is arguing, following the Constitution, which is individualist. </p>

<p>But I realize that there are two divisions, financial and cultural. I think we have become, mostly, very leftist culturally, and financially very very rightist.

    <div class="md"><p>Many independant studies have been conducted which show that concervative republicans donate far more to charity than do their counterparts. The difference is that the concervative is more willing to shell out of their own funds to a cause, while liberals shell out of all of our pockets to trickle through the payroll departments of petty beurocrats and have less effect. Hey I have no problem with your family receiving aid from the gov in a time of need. However you might considder that it was your parents hard work and determination to get it together for themselves that was the real savior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What constitutes cheating?</p>

<p>Besides spam, the other big no-no is to try to manipulate voting by any means: manual, mechanical, or otherwise. We&#39;re not going to post an exhaustive list of forbidden tactics (lest we give people ideas), but the two major ones are:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Don&#39;t use shill or multiple accounts, voting services, or any other software to increase votes for submissions </p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t be part of a &quot;voting clique&quot; </p></li>
</ul>

<p>A voting clique is a group of people who send links to their submissions around via message, IM, or any other means, with the expectation of &quot;you guys vote for my stuff and I&#39;ll vote for yours.&quot;</p>

<p>Cheating will result in your account being banned. Don&#39;t do it. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>These people have organized voting cabals. They may even use bots. All against reddit rules. </p>

<p>If I had 10 dummy accounts I believe that I could control about 98% of what moved up on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, or, at least, block almost any article I disliked. I believe others have figured that out and are doing it. People with an agenda, some righties, some capitalists. I have noticed that articles about the dangers or poor performances of &quot;products&quot;, even comments about that, get mass downvoted. I don&#39;t believe reddit would care enough about such things. But who would? The capitalists who produce them and the lobbyists they hire and the sockpuppets the lobbyists hire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The poor performance of products and warnings probably should not be in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> unless it is clearly related to a politician or legislation. It would be better suited in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> so people might down-vote it for that reason. articles also frequently get downvoted if they cover an item from a single point of view.
so ask your self these questions: is the submission</p>

<ul>
<li>related to a U.S. Politician,Party or piece of legislation(no)</li>
<li>does the title deviate from what the article is about(yes)</li>
<li>is the source credible(no)</li>
<li>does the article come from a bias point of view or push a certain ideology(yes)</li>
<li>does it sensationalze an issue(yes)</li>
<li>  if the answers you give match the ones in parenthesis you are much more likely to get downvoted.</li>

The Koches call themselves libertarians. They think there should be no laws, no regulations for them. Libertarianism can only work at very low population densities. And given the path the wealthy capitalists have put us on, seems like we are headed for a huge population reduction, but until we get there, I&#39;m for helping people who need help and controling those that do evil.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe in the Soviet holocaust stuff and I believe that things got WORSE for most people after the Soviet Union was broken up. Ten million people died. In Uzbekistan they were <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3943.htm">boiling people alive</a> which even the righties never accused the commies of doing. </p>

<p>Little countries are easy to conquer and push around. So I&#39;m opposed on a practical basis to any breakup of any country. It&#39;s bad for them. I would fight against any break up of the US. But that is mostly love and patriotism. </p>

<p>As far as the EU goes it&#39;s not working because it was just an economic union to make the rich richer. It wasn&#39;t a political union. </p>

<p>And yeah, Iceland was right. But if the UK or even Denmark decided to make Iceland pay it would be easy to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A socialism can not exist without central planning, which is the very definition of control.</p>

<p>The word &quot;communism&quot; has been poo-pooed so hard, that to this day it still carries a very negative connotation. But in reality its about building from the &quot;community&quot; up, hence the name &quot;Communism&quot;. Its about the workers and the managers getting more than the capitalists, but the capitalists making a profit as well, if the business does well, just at a fraction of what they do today.</p>

<p>Communism is different than socialism, but people tend to get them confused.</p>
