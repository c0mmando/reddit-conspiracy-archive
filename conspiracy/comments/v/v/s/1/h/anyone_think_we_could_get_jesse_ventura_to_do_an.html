       Jesse Ventura seems like a really cool guy, it'd be great if he could do an AMA. But, I think that he'd get a lot of flack from the "mainstream reddit users" I guess you'd say. I've spent quite a bit of time defending him on various threads. A few weeks ago someone posted a picture of Jesse from the movie Predator with a quote from his character and most of the posters said negative things about him like:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Too bad "The Body" is also a conspiracy theorist whack-job.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       The point is that's the way many people treat anyone who mentions something which could be considered a conspiracy theory, it doesn't matter if someone is a veteran of a foreign war, former governor, and successful author because once you're associated with "conspiracy theories" then the mainstream will label you as crazy. I was bringing it up because on the threads that I've seen that mention Jesse there has been a lot of hostility toward him. Most of the comments are childish in nature, but the fact of the matter is he is being demonized not only for his beliefs, but also for not wanting airport security to molest him everytime he gets on a plane since he has a metal implant in his leg.

       Well I've read plenty about silver and it is amazing.  When you get very small angstrom size particles of silver in your body it keeps viruses in check.  There are places in your body like your joints where there is little to no cellular immune system.  The silver particulars destroy the virus and bacteria upon contact.  I think that it is important as hell but certainly only piece of a larger health solution.  Now does the Silver Lungs generator produce these small particles?  I have no idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there was this guy who very famously turned a shade of silver by taking silver.  He routinely fucked himself by putting salt into the solution with the electrodes and that Chlorine - I believe bonded with the silver and did a bad one on him.  You are just not supposed to do that.  I've seen a few quick videos of him and he just looks like a really neurotic guy to me so that is just cemented into the heads of older people.

       it's colloidal silver administered through an atomizer (what asthmatics use for certain medications) so it can be ingested into the lungs to zap any bacterial or virus lurking there.

       I suppose that taking in it through the lungs is more efficient than using the digestive system.  That silver is making its way all through your internal body fluids and it should prevent you from ever having an outbreak of mouth herpes (cold sores).  It works like this because the silver will go into your spine where the viruses hide and it will continually zap them away and so the virus numbers will remain very low.  Its really a shame that people who have had outbreaks of genital herpes are taking these awful medicines when they could just be doing what you are doing and they would have zero negative side effects with a whole bunch of other positive side effects.

       Hey so you should check out Mother Earth Minerals.  They have a book called
       <em>
        Wellness Secrets for Life
       </em>
       .  In this book I learned about silver, zinc and copper being the second stage of the immune system.  First stage is your body pH, second stage is the metals and the third stage is the cellular immune system.  The ultra basic Western medicine system teaches virtually nothing about the first two lines of defense and so they make it out as though white blood cells (T cells ... for HIV/AIDS people) are the end all be all of immunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this company is run by a defrocked doctor who was ignorantly going about healing people instead of just giving them pills.  So I believe now he can help people lose weight but he can't cure the disease of obesity as a doctor if you get my meaning.  So everything is a disease and only doctors can treat diseases with drugs and surgeries.

       Alex Jones has some interesting theories but really he's a crack pot. Here's a quote from one of his articles about EPA regulations..
"the EPA has simply declared CO2, the life-giving gas that plants breathe, to be a deadly poison, and will impose the limits by dictatorial fiat."

       He is overly dramatic that is for sure but that is just because he is a Texan.  If you take out 80% of his flare it makes sense.  So I bought a very small amount of coal stock a few years ago and it has been way down.  There were Obama trades being broadcast and they all about "alternative" energy.  I followed them and although I didn't put money into them they were pure money makers.  That seems to me to be just a given at this point.  Are you not aware of carbon credits, Kyoto Protocol and all of that?  This is not new.  America is being repositioned for better or worse to use its immense natural gas reserves and coal use is being hit hard.  Crazy.....

       Alex Jones won't be taken seriously. There's been too many incorrect theories, scams and just plain bullshit to come out of his mouth for him to even dare make AmA.

       I think Jesse Ventura could be a guy that might change Reddits views on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , instead of "THAT'S STUPID, YOU SHOULD X/POST TO R/CONSPIRACY LUL, AMIRITE GUISE?". Jesse Ventura is a good writer, a great journalist and never starts preaching like some sort of profit. He simply wishes for people to open up their minds to reality where everything that they've been spoonfed to believe by the media, may in fact, not be true. Which is partly why I like him so much.

       All the people who stand to gain the most from it are behind the AGW scam. They needed a revenue stream, so they mounted a propaganda campaign to demonize a harmless and indeed essential gas, carbon dioxide. They charge people a penalty for generating carbon dioxide -- well, life generates carbon dioxide, and also uses it. It's part of our biology. The more CO2 in the air, the more vigorous the growth of crops that we need to feed ourselves. More CO2 means more food. I can't put it more simply than that, yet the con artists who run the man-made global warming scam have turned it into some sort of poison in the minds of the sheeple (and I can't think of another word for those who believe in AGW, unless maybe retards).

       It's easy to get taken in, if you are accustomed to bowing before scientific "authority" and if you lack common sense ... and I'm sorry to say that common sense is sadly lacking today. People don't use their own minds to make independent decisions any more, they rely on "experts" to tell them what to believe (just as the peasants of the Middle Ages relied on the priests of the Roman Catholic Church to tell them what to believe). But if you start to actually look at the contrary data, the whole AGW scenario falls apart and is revealed for the cynical money and power grab it always was.

       All those links do is point to some sort of global conspiracy for scientists to lie about things. It doesn't disprove any of the evidence of climate change, nor does it even try to. It's irrelevant to the facts.

       Look, you can patently and blindly sit there, without looking at the evidence I've presented before you -- and snidely continue to regurgitate the exact same talking point you've heard from every news source, talking head in the business while knowing that the majority of "mainstream" people will agree with you (and if you find comfort in social reinforcements and groupthink then you might just do that)
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you could SHUT THE FUCK UP for like 30 minutes, go through the links -- maybe even do your own research to see if it is possible that powerful globalist actors have been able to influence the public discourse and even force scientists (while promising them massive funding if they do so, or study anything that mentions "global warming") to create fraudulent data (like the hockey stick
       <a href="http://www.john-daly.com/hockey/hockey.htm">
        graph
       </a>
       ) so as to further a global agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is fraudulent scientific data so hard for you to wrap your mind around?

       That is hilarious. Why is it then, that Newsmax was able to report in 2002, under the titled article: Enron Gave Big Bucks to Democrats,
       <strong>
        Backed 'Global Warming' Scam
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "During a White House meeting in July 1997, Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay prodded Clinton and Gore to support a "market-based" approach to what he described as the problem of "global warming,"
       <strong>
        a theory discredited by a majority of the world's climatologists."
       </strong>

       Without any kind of massive scientific uproar?!?

       Thank you for providing evidence when asked for. I am in complete agreement with you by the way. I don't know why ME24601 won't just look at the facts and realize how much propaganda hes eaten up....

       I only submit verifiable factual content. There's far too much rampant speculation in this subreddit. Thanks for taking the time to appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record I support curbing pollution because I'm an environmentalist and a true conservative (as in I'd like to conserve our natural resources) and I hate the oligarchical oil companies that direct the trajectory of US foreign policy as it fits their profit margins -- I'd love to see alternative energies.

       Every sane person is against real pollution. But co2 isn't pollution. The sheer audacity of the AGW crowd in trying to present carbon dioxide as a pollutant and a poison is so amazing, so mind-boggling, I can hardly believe they actually had the gall to do it.

       Yes, thanks, Malizulu, for taking the time to dig up the relevent data. It's always out there for anyone who wants to look at it, but although you can lead a fool to knowledge, you can't make him think.

       That's right, keep your eyes tightly shut and your fingers in your ears. All those piles of peer-reviewed articles are so comforting, aren't they? You can use them to build a fort of computer models around yourself, and never have to look at the reality of the world.

       He was also an actor.

       And how many times was Alex Jones featured on his tv show?
