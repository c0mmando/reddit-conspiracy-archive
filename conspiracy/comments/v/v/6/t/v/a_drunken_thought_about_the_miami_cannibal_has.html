      <p>
       Last night while drinking with friends and discussing current events, a discussion about the Miami Cannibal came up. Primarily that it was concluded that Rudy Eugene was not on Bath Salts, but only had weed in his system.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said in the title, this is my first time coming to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . So I'm unsure if this theory was thought up by anyone else, but I was thinking...
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the findings were faked and falsified in order to help give politicians a reason to counter pushes for marijuana legalization? Say Eugene was in fact on other drugs, but some government official/agency/body pushed for Weed to be named as the only thing in his system. This would be done in the hope that it would cause somewhat of a panic, or give a reason and something to cite for politicians to oppose marijuana legalization?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand this might be a stupid theory due to quite a few holes, but it's what I came up being half drunk.

       also marijuana can stay in your system for quite some time after you've smoked it (about 30 days in some cases). So he probably wasn't even high as they were detecting residual levels.

       Newer drug test can detect marijuana use up to 5 months after stopping th use of pot.  It is not THC that the test detects, the test detects what THC gets metabolized into.

       So he gnawed on his face to the point of bleeding? He bit pieces off and spit it out? Eugene saw something attack the man's face, he scared it off and started giving the man CPR, in a desperate attempt to save his life, it was just a coincidence that he was naked, he chose to go save the man immediately rather than putting on clothes first. The cops actually shot a good Samaritan and are covering it up? Sounds plausible.

       Well of course. Push that he was on bath salts. Thus, more regulation. Ask anyone - they will say it was bath salts. But now, new story. Marijuana. Thus, populous thinks cannibalizism is now an effect of marijuana. Thus, more regulation. It'll be a bath salts/marijuana limiting regulation. Okay I'm rambling. Fuck the State.

       No it's because the Cannabis smokers fell asleep while lighting the reefer and it caught the land around them on fire leading to it's current status. That or people would claim the fire was started by terrorist as an attack against the Air Force Academy.

       I'm thinking that this guy probably did have THC in his blood, like so many other people, but that it is completely irrelevant to his apparent mental breakdown. 
Considering that THC stays in your system for something like two weeks (sometimes more) after last smoking/eating/vaping/whatever, them finding it in his blood isn't really a big shocker, and it's actually not at all an indication that he was under the influence at the time of the attack.

       I don't know, my state (Alabama) spent most of the legislative session chasing down various forms of synthetic marijuana, and with robberies happening left and right the local police were too busy running multiple units to shitbox convenience stores and cuffing Middle Eastern shop owners selling spice. Upshot being, they've "taken care" of the drugs we all know by cuffing a drug runner or trailer park meth cooker and having them do the walk of shame on the news, time to keep inventing new boogeymen like bath salts and spice to keep the war on drugs funded and convince people it's still necessary.

       Not gonna cry about spice being chased down. I'd rather smoke dogshit than touch synthethic weed- atleast you know what you'll find in the dog droppings.

       Sad part is, people were only smoking the stuff to avoid the penalties for smoking weed. Don't know why anyone still would here, the legislature put the chemical component in spice on the same controlled substance list as the drugs it's trying to mimic.

       If you watch the full footage of the attack, it looks like a third person runs up to Rudy and hits him, knocking him to the ground. Immediately after this event the attack begins. This is event is a "shot from the grassy knoll" so to speak. Why doesn't anyone talk about this third party? If that third person had not walked by to (apparently) hit 
Rudy, would he have attacked?

       I think we also have to keep in mind that there is no standard formula for these bath salts.  So how do they know what to look for in toxicology.  I know around where I live the gas stations and smoke shop owners where making it them selfs in the back room.  Policy recently raided a few around here.

       i would say its being as an obvious campaign against marijuana now.  i  dont think its to gain backing by politicians but to strike fear in ignorant americans who will now be afraid of pot smokers and of marijuana itself.
