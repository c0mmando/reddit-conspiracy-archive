       I've heard the "conspiracy" that a secret space program exists - one with a budget off the books. This branches into zany territory as some say we haven't officially had a manned mission to the Moon since the 1970's but have had unofficial ones; some say that NASA was founded by Nazi's and their dogma, leading to top-secret experiments; some say it's because of aliens; there's probably other ideas out there as well. Although these can be purely conjecture or very interesting, I want reasons/evidence to back up your opinion, whatever that may be.

       imported Germany's rocket program to America, which became NASA, later headed by Von Braun, who had his NAZI file erased at the behest of Dulles. But that's not even black budget stuff.

       , former head of Skunkworks, literally bragged about black budget technological development, saying such memorable phrases as, "We now have the technology to take E.T. home," and “We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would take an act of GOD to ever get them out to benefit humanity”, and "anything you can imagine we already know how to do."

       has done some great research into the subject as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah, I don't so much
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that there is definitely a secret space program, but, I'm pretty open to the possibility. Uh, because secret planes are real (stealth bomber, aurora project). As well, there are secret subs, secret drones, and secret bases. So why shouldn't there be secret space vehicles, too? I'm just going to go head and take Ben Rich at his word despite the obvious issues with his publicly declaring secrets and his being, ya know, a shady defense industry contractor, but that is just my opinion. Personally, I wouldn't hesitate to look to defense contractors for clues about what is really going on, whether they are revealing secret truths or demonstrating the military's current disinfo trends.

       JPL, Which was NASA's spiritual precursor, was the brain child of Jack Parsons. Jack Parsons also happens to have been a friend of both Aleister Crowley and L. Ron Hubbard. They took part in something they called "The Amalantrah Working" which had the purpose of rending a hole in the barriers between this world and another one.
      </p>
      <p>
       What dwells in that "other world" is a class of beings called Lam. And going by the portrait Crowley apparently drew of the Lam he spoke to, I'd say it has an uncanny similarity to the alien greys people had been reporting contact with pretty much from then until now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could be bullshit, but the fact that the guy who basically founded NASA was into this sort of stuff is surely something to think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a thorough rundown of the whole shebang:

       NAZI occultism would almost certainly continue at NASA even though the uniforms change from fatigues and leather to khakis and ties. Even a cursory examination of the apollo program's symbology would reveal a more than marginal interest in esoteric mythology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parsons was a psychotic genius. The stories of their workings out there in the desert are some of the most intriguing bits of esoteric Americana I've ever read.
      </p>
      <p>
       But occultism and black budget research do seem to cross paths enough to stoke curiosity's hearth for this guy, too.

       Semi related, but I recommend the book Secret Rituals of the Men in Black, by Allen Greenfield. Here's the whole book as a matter of fact:
       <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/cienciareal/men_in_black.htm">
        http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/cienciareal/men_in_black.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I fully expect occultists and magick practitioners to exaggerate a lot, especially if they publish books for sale. However, it is a wild story and the stuff described mirrors a lot of older occult ideas. It's not the supposed results of these rituals that's as crazy as the idea of how this stuff is in plain sight and is shared with so many members of government and intelligence, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you happen to have any good links that talk about what the Amalantrah Working involved? I see Parsons, Hubbard and Crowley talked about together often, but don't really know if the men themselves wrote much about what they were all up to back then, or what roles and occult philosophies they were participating in.

       That to 25th gen would be quite a jump then. It'll be interesting to see in 30~ years what technologies were in development in today's world that we had no idea about.

       Some say the recent switch over to private space programs was because the FedGov didn't see a reason to continue paying for the public front for the military's space program anymore.

       That's interesting, but I've watched it, and I don't think it does much to address the specific data available to evaluate whether or not secret space programs are real. It just assumes they are, and presents a bunch of dubious color tricks on old moon photos. Now, don't get me wrong, I would love for the moon to truly be as alive as these photos suggest, but I simply don't think the movie addresses secret space program details in much the same way as David Sereda's

       I think if there have been secret missions to the moon in the last 15 years, they've been Chinese, not American. I believe the Chinese are a lot more advanced than their tightly controlled press releases state.

       I havn't really grown up much over these 20 odd years but my understanding of our place in the universe has grown immensely.

       Yet the most interesting and most confounding issue I've ever come across in the whole "secret space program" is the phenomena Martyn Stubbs referred to in

       There were routine unannounced middle-of-the-night launches that would wake you up.  They sound like someone is tearing a bedsheet in your ear at top volume, and the brightness of the launch lights up your midnight bedroom.

       These launches were never announced or identified.  I'm sure this is easily verifiable by anyone who lives near Cape Canaveral.

       There's always been a secret space program (since rocket research began, that is). In my opinion, there are probably orbiting nuclear weapons platforms. Space is the ultimate high ground, and the Pentagon can't afford to ignore it. Neither can the Russians or the Chinese.

       Of course there is. The NRO just gave NASA two massive telescopes that were obsolete for them, but they were more advanced then anything NASA had. The secret space program is at least 30 years more advanced.

       There are multiple very black and very big programs that have been going on for many decades. We've gone up and we're gone down.

       The Shuttle was sacked because it was completely obsolete. NASA is only the public face of space operations. Some pretty serious classified space ops are at least 3 decades old and probably 4. So you can imagine the volume and depth of efforts at the truly secret bases. Area 51 was and is relatively open in comparison. And why do you think the government got so upset over Gary McKinnon a decade ago? He hacked in and found records of a Navy space fleet.  Ten - years - ago.

       You probably don't want to go to Mars. It's cold, dry, the air is staticy, you get covered with that damned red dust. The last time I went, I got so tired of the sand and rocks. It's not all it's cracked up to be.  The old underground Martian caves are okay though. Creepy as hell. And I never got over being spacesick, and the drugs to counter it screw up your appetite.

       yes because trillions upon trillions go "missing" every year and you can bet that every country with the capability has been trying to weaponize space for the last 60 years which means there has probably been some version of an orbital/space cold war going on with secret payloads on those satellites.  possible claiming of territory for resources on reachable locations like the moon and possibly mars have probably also prompted military exploration projects perhaps even projects by corporations with trillions of dollars.  certainly the corporations are more running the world than any government and they have all the resources and no regulations since they can be global and simply operate from wherever they want.  in fact when you really start thinking about it the idea that the wealthy and powerful have not been up to projects involving space that the general cattle public are not informed of, well that's just ridiculous.  of course they are doing things.   in fact it's even been mentioned by astronauts and stories on missions that certain aspects of the payloads of the space shuttle or to the space station were classified.

       Everything you need to know about this story can be gleaned from the program that sells outdated/replaced equipment from Iraq to continental Police Departments. NRO needed to offload the hardware and they didn't care how - because it's been replaced with
       <em>
        better equipment
       </em>
       . That's an eye-opener, no pun intended.

       TBH I hope so. One day when we go to war with a superpower. I will be thrilled to see the Air Force unleash a Space based weapons platform unleashed on the enemy, and take them out in one bold move. I will then kiss that generals ass for having the foresight of preparedness.
