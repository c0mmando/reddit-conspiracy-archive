       I have a 22mb cable connection, and it's virtually flawless. Perfect pings and connectivity. When I view conspiracy videos of almost any sort, they either take forever to load, or they don't load at all. It can not be a coincidence...

       This has been going on for months now...

       Answer this: Has the government requested to have YouTube videos removed? Did YouTube render such services? If the answer is yes, then they have obviously conspired to censor certain types of information, and if that's the case, IT ALREADY PROVES THERE IS A MOTIVE, AND THAT THERE IS LIKELY MUCH BROADER IMPLICATIONS.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they're willing to outright remove videos, you can bet your bottom dollar they are using other methods to censor information.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's worse? Removing videos entirely, or, slowing them down? As far as censorship is concerned, limiting their bandwidth is a step down (in intensity) from completely removing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so, the motive is there, as well as the means. You people always try so hard to make it seem as though conspiracies have no merit, as though the government has nothing to worry about. You couldn't be more wrong. Dissidence overthrows governments...
      </p>
      <p>
       I've personally missed dozens of videos because I didn't have the patience for them to load (as intended)...

       Not going to try and explain this to you, as your mind is clearly made up, and you spend the bottom half of your reply telling me what I'm doing, and how undeniably wrong I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your entire reply is more of a rant, and just fyi, having videos LOAD slower, you would still be able to see them. If the government was trying to stop you from looking at it, adding an extra FIVE seconds to your viewing experience wouldn't stop you from still watching the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government was trying to censor what you can and can't see, making a video take longer to load isn't going to stop you from seeing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can watch any youtube video here, about any conspiracy, at the same rate I can watch any other youtube video. But then again, I am a government paid shill with 17,428,192GB/s download speed, and I also have a green button that every time I hit it, 10 random conspiracy related videos are deleted.

       If you ask me, it's a very, very clever way to limit information uptake. Perhaps you aren't capable of seeing the bigger picture?

       Ah so that's the government plan. Expose a nation of A.D.D. and prove to the conspiracy theorists that they are in fact just as impatient as the rest of the world, and they will not sit around and wait five seconds for a video to load.

      <p>
       What bigger picture? Your tale?
      </p>
      <p>
       You link no videos for comparison, you ask a question that leaves no room for refutation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the last sentence of your original post;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It can not be a coincidence...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This CAN'T be a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so then what are you trying to accomplish? You have no interest in being refuted, you have no back-up to your claims, short of that, an article that states people are impatient.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were really thirsty for all that knowledge in those youtube videos, you would wait five seconds for it to load.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please; link me 10 conspiracy videos, that load slowly (or never) and then link me 10 videos that you feel load instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will tell you if I lag when loading them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article you linked does not "prove" anything. A two second delay on a video loading does not make you incapable of watching the video, or incapable of waiting. IF anything, it just proves that you aren't any smarter than the other people in the A.D.D generation.

       I don't really care to continue this conversation with you. You've insulted me numerous posts in a row, and I'm not really into discussions like that.

       After comments like this, I have no interest in continuing to talk with you, if you can't refrain from saying shit like this.

       Both are HD. Even non HD conspiracy videos take ages to load. It doesn't make any sense. Unless...

       And that's it? It plays without interruption? The entire way through without buffering again? Not even remotely the case for me. Look at my connection:

       Youtube videos buffer based on the current demand for each video. Music videos, which get a ton of requests, get streamed faster than "conspiracy" videos because they are requested less often.

       Oh yeh, you seem incredibly credible with your ad hominems, and gross assumptions. Conspiracies were still a fringe thing last time I checked. Fringe
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       is not a main source of revenue. They've cooperated in numerous ways with the Federal government in the past. Why wouldn't they try and make the path to enlightenment HARDER. Conspiracy theorists are few and far between, I'm quite certain YouTube could care less about the minuscule revenue potential from such a small subgroup...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not an assumption I came to lightheartedly. I've been dealing with this for months, and I'm fucking sick of it...
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube used to simply remove videos that touched on certain topics, but by the time they did that, numerous people had copied and re-uploaded them. This seems like a much more effective means to secretly censor the public.

       I just pulled up two tabs, side by side, both on YouTube. In one tab I searched for Justin Bieber, in the other I searched for Illuminati. In the Bieber tab all of the videos played (including from regular users/fans) play without interruption. In the Illuminati tab, all of the videos take at least 10 seconds to que up, play for another 10 or so seconds, and then pause and load again. The videos in the Illuminati tab are

       well fuck, you uncovered the fact that a famous musician video sponsored by a corporation that is more likely to get hits can get more bandwidth than a nobody living in a trailer talking about idiotic bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not a conspiracy, fuck-knob, it's economy of bandwidth. The video with more hits gets more bandwidth.

       If you're sitting there, literally hitting refresh in the /new tab, or even just occasionally, then yes, you are monitoring this subreddit. I always find it very interesting when people whom don't even believe in the most relevant, and obvious conspiracies, act as though they give two fucks about any conspiracies at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't monitor anything just for the sake of bashing it, as I take no interest in things I DO NOT BELIEVE IN.

       Not going to try and explain this to you, as your mind is clearly made up, and you spend the bottom half of your reply telling me what I'm doing, and how undeniably wrong I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your entire reply is more of a rant, and just fyi, having videos LOAD slower, you would still be able to see them. If the government was trying to stop you from looking at it, adding an extra FIVE seconds to your viewing experience wouldn't stop you from still watching the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government was trying to censor what you can and can't see, making a video take longer to load isn't going to stop you from seeing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can watch any youtube video here, about any conspiracy, at the same rate I can watch any other youtube video. But then again, I am a government paid shill with 17,428,192GB/s download speed, and I also have a green button that every time I hit it, 10 random conspiracy related videos are deleted.

       Several months ago, I did think it was just a coincidence. For me to continue thinking that, based on my own experience, I'd have to be in denial. It's blatant, right in front of my face, annoyingly there.
