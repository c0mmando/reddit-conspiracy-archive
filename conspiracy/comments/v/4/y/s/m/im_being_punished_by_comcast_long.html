     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       After watching my bill jump from about $110 to $176 in the course of less than six months for no discernable reason, I decided to look into what options are available to me.  I
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       a high-speed connection for not only personal use, but work related issues as well.  Unfortunately, comcast is it in my area.  DSL is too slow and unreliable in this area, and the planned FIOS rollout to this area got cancelled.  Big surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have to stick with comcast due to the monopoly they have on the area.  I have no other choice.  Of course, since I'm a long-standing customer, I don't mean shit to them -- all their package deals are available to new customers only.  But there was one called "Blast Plus" advertised on their website, and in fact is the only package deal advertised that was available to me.  $79.99.  Much better than $176.  It cuts out most of the premium channels, but since the extent of my TV watching is the occasional NCIS episode and football games, I couldn't have cared less.
      </p>
      <p>
       I call Comcast's customer service.  They tell me that I have to contact a separate, local number to switch to Blast Plus, but I otherwise won't have a problem.  Ok.  I then call the local number, and they have absolutely
       <em>
        no idea
       </em>
       what I'm talking about.  After walking their own sales rep through their own web page and pointing out the package deal to him, he says that that's an online only offer, and I'd have to order it online.  Sigh.  Fine.  I was told, though, that the changes would take place immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I order it online.  As the last step of my order, I'm connected to a customer service rep through their chat program.  Despite having all the information in front of her, she asks me what package I'm purchasing.  I tell her.  She immediately just disconnects.  The order doesn't go through, and I lose contact with her.  Not a word was said.....she just disconnected.
      </p>
      <p>
       I put my order through again.  This time, I get a customer service rep named David.  He then proceeds to tell me that the website offer doesn't apply to me, and that I was "misinformed".  When I told him I wanted to downgrade my service, he proceeds to instantaneously flood the screen with canned responses and disconnects before I have a chance to even read them, much less reply.  Of course, the number he gives me is the number that I started calling in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       By now I'm irate.  All I want to do is downgrade my service to something more affordable and nobody is letting me do so.  I call the original number and demand to be put in contact with a supervisor.   I bluff a bit here, and say that they will either offer me the package deal advertised to me on the website, or I'm going to cancel their service in its entirety.  I make it very clear that I want to work
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       them, but if they insist on continuing to give me the runaround, then the obviously don't value me as a customer and I will take my business elsewhere.  My bill is now $80.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also decided to buy a new modem, shaving off another $7 per month from my bill.  Well lo and behold! There's a problem with the modem, and they need to send a technician out to check it out.  Fine.  "How about Saturday, between 8 and 9?"  Sure.  I'm up at the crack of dawn anyway, and at least it doesn't kill what otherwise is shaping up to be a gorgeous day, weather-wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I wake up shortly before 8, and go about my morning routine.  The phone rings while I'm in the bathroom, and I miss the call.  Caller ID comes up as "Restricted".  Figuring it was the comcast tech, I call their tech support line and ask them to have him call me back and come by.  Keep in mind that we're not even at 8:00 yet.  "Can't do that.  Our technicians are required to call once.  If you miss the call for any reason, then your appointment is considered cancelled."
      </p>
      <p>
       "So let me get this right.  I have an appointment between 8 and 9 and I have to sit by the phone all morning, waiting for a random phone call and if I miss that call I lose my appointment?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Our techs are only required to make one phone call sir."
      </p>
      <p>
       "So what's stopping you from just sending him back?  If my appointment was cancelled, he's got an hour free now."
      </p>
      <p>
       "He's moved on to his other 8 AM appointments.  We schedule more than one per technician."
      </p>
      <p>
       ಠ_ಠ ಠ_ಠ ಠ_ಠ
      </p>
      <p>
       "You schedule more than one appointment?  That's ridiculous.  What if my service call takes more than an hour?  Doesn't the other guy get screwed?  What if I were the second appontment of that hour and the other guy's problem took more than an hour?" I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       His reply:  "Your appointment won't take the whole hour, sir."
      </p>
      <p>
       My reply:  "Do you even know what he's coming here for?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Him: "No."
      </p>
      <p>
       Me:  "Then how do you know it will take less than an hour?  What about travel time from one place to the next?"
      </p>
      <p>
       He has no answer and continues the usual canned responses.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We have an opening between 12 and 4.  Would you like that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       So now we go from a convenient one-hour window to an afternoon-killing 4 hour window:   "Why can't you just send the technician back.  He tried calling
       <em>
        5 minutes ago
       </em>
       .  Surely he's not even at his next appointment yet?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm afraid I can't do that.  You missed the call and we're not required to make another one.  Your only option is between 12 and 4 today."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why monopolies are bad.  They know I can't even threaten to switch companies, since they are the only high-speed internet provider in my area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad part is I've been a customer of theirs for 12 years with absolutely no issues -- until I tried to downgrade.

       Comcast employee here, and while I apologize for the shit customer service you're receiving, no one is punishing you for downgrading.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're seeing is the result of a bunch of boneheaded policies, coming together to be a huge pain in the ass for customers and employees alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of the package, you're probably
       <em>
        technically
       </em>
       not eligible for the promo-rate blast plus based on corporate guidelines.  Sometimes we get a little bit of flexibility there, especially if you call in.
      </p>
      <p>
       First things first: the online setup sucks.  It sucks ass.  Never use it.  The chat reps are outsourced to the Phillipines, and have very little in the way of flexibility or understanding of the english language.  With that said, there are a few (a VERY few) online exclusives that save you some money, and the reps in the call center will not be aware of those (they're all location-specific, so a rep getting online will see different deals).
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put, just call.  We're local and can provide MUCH better service and flexibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, moving onto your appointment, that is technically the policy for tech call-aheads.  Its the same policy for new installs, restarts, downgrades, and disconnects.  Its equally stupid across all fronts. In terms of a missed appointment, we do get them back same-day, but as you noticed its an all-day slot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stupid policies? Yep. Conspiracy? Nope. Believe me, there's just as many new customers dealing with the same bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       - Side note, PM me your general area.  If I cover you I can probably smooth this out.

       Eh its like any big company, it exists to make money.  Believe me, I've had my share of shitty experiences, but I decided that it was the lesser of most evils for internet LONG before I started working there.

       Nobody working here is out to screw anybody, and (gasp!) most of us actually do give a shit about customers.  There's a lot of boneheaded policy moves that make life harder for customers and employees, but at the end of the day I work my hardest to do the best I can within those dumbass policies.

       I have a hypothesis: You and your cohort are nice, honest hard working people, who happen to be employed by a company that is run by evil, baby-eating assholes who seem intent on destroying the internet. In addition to this, they have you convinced they are "boneheaded", so you excuse their obvious attacks.

       I think a lot of the policies are actually well-meaning, but have evolved to a point that they simply don't work.  Same with any company as bloated as Comcast I'd imagine.

       Right, but Comcast specifically has been trying to destroy the internet. You can't just excuse their actions as "well-meaning" or as "same as any company". You just can't. Comcast is a horrible company with a history that shows it is intent on tearing down the internet and forcing cable back on the consumer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I think you have surrounded yourself with a kind of reality-shield in order to work for them. You actually think Comcast has "well-meaning" policy...It is laughable.

       Oh absolutely, and I'm in complete agreement on that.

       I'm specifically referring to the policies we're discussing here, which are purely related to pricing and appointments.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're talking broader policy decisions, absolutely.  The only good news is they're going to get their asses reamed by the FCC on the bandwidth thing with streampix.

      <p>

       I am so confused by your sudden reversal, but I am happy to call you friendly redditor anyhow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I choose to see Comcast as a single edifice, and assume that the culture at the top affects the culture on the bottom - grok: the policies OP is complaining about.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, let me tell you about "holds". A "hold" is an intentional hoop or chute for the consumer to jump through while seeking reparation for a grievance. The idea is that you put enough hoops and chutes in between the customer and any kind of refund or profit loss, that the customer gives up a certain % of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out-sourcing your text chat to the Philippines is a Hold. Having them ask, again, for your information, is a Hold. Having to call different numbers, then being read common responses, is a Hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comcast, I believe, employs these tactics at the bottom in order to insulate and enrich the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: Comcast is evil top to tails, dude. Sorry.

       Heh just because I think the service itself is superior says nothing about my feelings towards the corporate policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "hold" conversation, especially in regards to the outsourcing: keep in mind that the outsourcing is for setting up NEW service, and only for the online chat.  Any current customers, or new customers who call during normal business hours (7am-9pm Mon-Sat, 8am to 7pm Sun) will come into a stateside callcenter, usually within their own state unless call volume is high (in which case they may go to a neighboring state in order to get them on with a rep faster).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean this as an insult, but you clearly do not work in a call center environment.  The single most important number here, from a corporate standpoint, is "Service Level".  Service level is the percentage of customers who reach a rep on their first attempt.  "Holds" as you envision them are directly contrary to that number.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll use the current situation in the midwest as an example.  We're receiving MASSIVE call volume, and many departments are understaffed for the volume.  Because of this, service levels are universally low.  In order to combat this, billing, retention, and tech (all departments that deal with disconnects and existing customer issues) are all working mandatory overtime to raise service levels to &gt;90%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody likes it, but its a necessity to manage incoming calls.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I fully agree that the company is employing shitty, malicious tactics in regards to internet competition, the actual customer-facing side is mostly beset by dumbassery, not maliciousness.

       I do not have a script.  I do not have on-screen prompts to tell me what to say or do.  I listen to the customer, determine the issue, and attempt to resolve it to everyone's satisfaction.  That's it.

      <p>
       During times of exceptional call volume, sure. For most of the year, the call center as a whole sits at &gt;95% service levels across all departments.  This means that 95% of incoming calls are being answered before a customer hangs up.  The past few weeks have seen EXCEPTIONALLY high new sales calls, which then translate into billing/technical questions.  This knocked down service levels, so we required mandatory OT as a result, thus bringing us up to &gt;90%.

       Its no different than living in America, or working for any other corporation.  I don't have to love every single thing about the company to point out that the services they provide are superior.

       Again, I appreciate (and agree) with a lot of the general sentiment you express about the company, but you've got a lot of preconceptions that just aren't right.

       Which is why, other than the speeds of the service compared to other providers (which is, by and large, an objective measure) I've expressed little in terms of actual opinion here.

       This is why I love reddit, it allows people to publicly humiliate themselves. You do realize that you are making an ass out of yourself, right? In a whole forum of people that come together and think of outlandish possibilities in this world, no one (actually a negative amount of people) find you to be any where near relevant. So as I said earlier, go on, continue making an ass out of yourself.

       That is not the point. The point is he should not be sharing anything, as his opinion is biased. Beyond that, he

        did in fact defend the polices

       as boneheaded but not evil. He also claimed that the role of the call center is anything other than keeping consumers compliant.

       Thanks a lot for the info and offer.  A tech did show up about half an hour ago and managed to get everything working to my satisfaction (well, not counting being a victim of the boneheaded policies you described, but that's not his issue).
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now I'm just going to go out and enjoy the day.  And for what it's worth, I live in SE MA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The policies need to be changed across the board.  But when you think about it, they really have no incentive to do that, as I'm sure they're probably hoping customers will simply forget the whole thing and keep whatever they have out of frustration.  The whole process is very confusing and annoying to the customer, and while I'm stubborn enough to push the issue, I know plenty of people who would just give up and continue paying -- which is exactly what they want to do.  They
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       make the process easier.  They're choosing not to because it would cost them money.

       That would make sense if these were limited to downgrades or disconnects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, its an across-the-board thing, same shit happens to new customers trying to set up service.  Its genuinely not a conspiracy to hassle downgrades, its just a shitty system.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the ease of changing it, I think you are VASTLY underestimating what a complicated process this all is.  No less than 6 separate departments have a hand in ANY new install, more if there's phone or internet involved.  We're talking thousands upon thousands of customers and employees, so any change is a glacial process.

       thanks for posting this :| I hated dealing with comcast, but never for any other reason than just their policies that didn't make sense. Maybe I'm just a little uptight because of my networking background, but man I swear I used to speak with people who didn't even own a computer.

       Yes. I too hate comcast. I'm only using them for the broadband
      </p>
      <p>
       Since they took over the local cable a few years ago, every year they would raise prices about 10% and cut 2 or 3 channels from the lineup. I really hate them.
      </p>

       I don't know if AT&amp;T is worse but I'm about to find out.

       If you think Comcast is bad, just wait.
      </p>
      <p>
       Full disclosure, Comcast employee, but I have to use ATT at a vacation home.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tl;dr is that it is a total nightmare. Take any service/customer service issue you've ever had with Comcast, multiply it by 10, and then add a contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good general rule of thumb with ATT internet is to expect somewhere between 1/2 to 1/3 your stated speeds on internet. Expect a fair amount of ups and downs in terms of speed as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I set up the service knowing this, but I've yet to break 4Mb/s on a supposed 20Mb/s connection. 5 tech visits (charged, btw, with 3 no-shows) later and no resolution. I'd write it off to shitty lines but when I hear the same problem coming from multiple areas, its not isolated.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do set up ATT, run a speed test once its running. You'll see what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now for the REALLY fun part: billing. I've yet to have a correct bill in 7 months of service. Each month, I get a bill ~$70 higher than it should be with unexplained charges, and spend an hour or so each time getting the bill fixed. Each time I'm promised the issue is resolved and won't happen again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had Comcast for many years, and I fully recognize that there's a LONG way to go towards improving customer service. With that said, the quality of service is so far above ATT that its hard to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a very good reason that ATT is significantly cheaper.

       Yeah, the pricing structure is a huge pain in the dick.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing I picked up as a customer, and that I pass along to all the customers I speak to now, is that picking up the phone will almost universally result in a lower bill.  Its a pain in the ass, and it might take talking to 10 people, but eventually it pays off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe me, I wish it was a different approach, because its constantly driving away customers (until the other telcoms do the same thing).

       nice try comcast. comcast is far far worse than ATT, and thats saying a lot. plus if you use that shitty cable from comcast you have to use an interface from 1998. But none of that is even the bad part. they rob you. you add fees, bump their bill, all while removing channels. comcast is the worst company in the world.

       The fact that the only good broadband option in a certain area is a conspiracy. But yeah, a monopoly abusing customers is hardly a conspiracy.

       We don't have this problem in the UK - unless you live way out in the countryside, you can choose between at least 8 different ISPs. So something's obviously gone wrong in the US if there are only 2 national ISPs and most people can only pick one of those.

       We are switching from comcat to uverse. Our comcast bill is 250+ for tv and internet. Uverse we will get phone, tv, and faster internet(supposedly) for a little under 150. When i asked if comcast could get me close to that price as 5+ year customer, i was told that their best deals are only for new customers. So i told them they just lost a long time customer. Ungrateful jerks.

       Heh good luck with those internet speeds.  A good rule of thumb for most uverse areas is to expect 1/2 your stated speeds.

       Side note, they should've gotten you to retention.  They'll typically roll you into a new promo on threat of cancellation.

       Hey man I fully concede that I think Comcast is the better service, doesn't mean I'm shilling.  I currently have both services and can directly compare.

       Sure, which is why I stated it up front.  It doesn't take away from something that is a commonly-known fact in the industry, but a fair point nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple test for this, any volunteer ATT customers should post their stated speeds, and then run a speed test and post the results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my hypothesis assuming people do so honestly: there will be a minority of people who are reaching their stated speeds or close to it.  The majority will be receiving substantially lower speeds than they are promised.

       Good thing we're not testing my speeds then, right?  I stated a fact that's well-known in the industry.  I full admit to being a Comcast employee, AND to having a bias (though its based on myself comparing both services, as opposed to the employment).

       I'm not trying to have a scientific conversation here, I just mentioned an anecdotal statement and you are getting your panties in a bunch over it.  If you've got ATT, test your speeds.  If not, no biggie there either.

         Your opinion in everything regarding the internet is potentially biased by your relationship with Comcast, even in ways you are probably unaware of. I am certain Comcast employs operative conditioning in their training (as almost all companies do), to which I can certainly say you have been brainwashed by them.

       I agree. I switched to Uverse and could not believe how sloooow my Internet was. I switched back the my previous provider as soon as my six months were up. Comcast doesn't thrill me, I've also had issues with their Chat feature, bit my experience with Uverse was awful and expensive.

       Its an endlessly cyclical thing.  Comcast pisses someone off, they go to Uverse.  The service is shit, so they go to Direct.  A slight breeze takes out their service so they come to Comcast.  Comcast pisses them off and it continues ad infinitum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had Comcast MUCH longer than I've worked there, and long ago decided it was the least of most evils in regards to internet.  The internet speeds are pretty much untouchable in most areas (though FIOS has some really nice speeds where its available).  Its a pain in the ass but as long as you're willing to pick up the phone and deal with some bullshit, its generally easy to keep the bill where you want it.

       I highly recommend going into a service center, if at all possible. I had an extraordinary experience in Hopkins, MN. The employee took the time to go over my account and apply every possible deduction. If you can find a time when they're not very busy and are polite, they'll probably commiserate with you.

       When I called Comcast in July of 2010 to report my cable line disconnected and laying in my back yard, they said they would send someone out immediately to take care of it. Two days passed and I called them back to find out when they were coming out when the customer service representative told me it was probably not their line that was down and nobody was coming out. I reassured the representative that I have no cable or internet service and I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the line laying on the grass in my back yard. Now that it was approaching the weekend, they rescheduled a technician to come out the next Monday. Wednesday came and I called them back to ask when the technician is showing up and we rescheduled ...again. Repeat the past week again.
      </p>
      <p>
       It finally took 27 days and over ten phone calls from the first time I called until I had service again. I cancelled my service a couple months later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast Forward to late May 2012, over a year-and-a-half since I cancelled my Comcast service. Early in the morning, I hear someone creeping around the perimeter of my house. I get ready for whatever, and open the door to confront the person. It's a Comcast technician that came out to my house to check on a "downed line"! All I could do was stare at him with blank expression and blink at him really, really slowly.

       i worked for comcast sales team they live off contracts that are designed to go up. best action you can take is simply call 1866 comcast the customer loyalty line and tell them a sales rep from dish network or direct tv has come and offered you a much cheaper deal and your going to make the switch unless the can match the offer or lower your bill to its orginal cost. you can do this for ever cause they value your money that you send them. or if you are married or have a roomate simply cancel your service say your moving to a area that does not have them if you stuck in a contract. then simply have the roomate sign up and get the new customer discount. if your married you can tell them you got a divorce and are seperating to switch the name over and get new customers rates

       The #1 biggest call driver that Comcast has is from

      <p>
       When a promotion is about to expire, how much you are saving per month because you're on a promotion, what you're playing full price on, the exact date your promotion expires, it's all on the bill. People so want to think that they're on a promotion forever that I just facepalm when I see posts like the OP.

       To the OP, here it is in plain language:

       I understand. I worked for them for 4 soul crushing years, and it seemed like 1/2 my time there was spent fixing issues other employees had created.

       Check out Comcast's

        online escalation team.

       They should be able to get you in touch with someone higher up locally who can actually help you.

       I have a hypothesis: You and your cohort are nice, honest hard working people, who happen to be employed by a company that is run by evil, baby-eating assholes who seem intent on destroying the internet. In addition to this, they have you convinced they are "boneheaded", so you excuse their obvious attacks.

       And yes that's mostly my problem with you. You were a dick for attacking someone when all they were trying to do was provide a different angle. I'll reply to who ever the hell I want, why do you think you have the ability to just shout at people and they'll listen??

       This is why I love reddit, it allows people to publicly humiliate themselves. You do realize that you are making an ass out of yourself, right? In a whole forum of people that come together and think of outlandish possibilities in this world, no one (actually a negative amount of people) find you to be any where near relevant. So as I said earlier, go on, continue making an ass out of yourself.
