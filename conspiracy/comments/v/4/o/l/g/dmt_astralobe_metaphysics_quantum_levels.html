        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>when i posted i wasn&#39;t sure how to format (newb)...so i edited it and made it cleaner and easier to read</p>

<p>share some interesting stuff if you have any, that&#39;s part of the reason i created this. i&#39;d love to hear any input, and i&#39;m sure others would too.</p>

<p><strong>DMT</strong></p>

<p>i know DMT is rare so not many have tried it, and maybe even heard of it (i did my own extraction since it&#39;s found any man living things, i used the bark of mimosa hostilis since it had one a high concentration). DMT is also the ingredient in Ayahuasca, which is a drink some cultures will make, like how some indians use peyote for example.</p>

<p>if you don&#39;t know what DMT it is a chemical produced by the pineal gland in our brain. it&#39;s responsible for our dreams. but also said to be released as we die. the crazy thing is those who use it all have the same experience. i&#39;m not religious, but i am spiritual, and i always said it&#39;s impossible to know what happens when we die, if anything at all. but after doing this, i&#39;m almost certain there is a higher power (or god of some sort if that&#39;s what you want to call it). it&#39;s crazy to think everyone who experiemnts with this has the same experience (trip to hyperspace, and what you see during this) and then if this is experienced when you die, then that&#39;s just mind blowing. some say it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with dreams or near death experiences though. to be honest i can&#39;t even describe it with words, the video below does a good job. and below that is a full documentary (there is a book with the same title) on the chemical called &#39;DMT: The Spirit Molecule&#39;

<p><strong>astral projection/lucid dreaming/OBE</strong> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.rickrichards.com/astral/Astral2.html">one of the MOST INTERESTING things i&#39;ve read in a long time, some might already know a lot about this stuff, but this tells a lot with minimal reading</a></p>

<p>anyone astral projected? it&#39;s said to be when the etheric body leaves the vital body...it&#39;s believed to be done by raising the vibrational rates...for instance something with a higher vibrational rate is less visible. like gas obviously...something with a lower vibrational rate is solid, like your desk, and you...let&#39;s say ghosts are real, their vibrational rates would be higher than us, but still low enough to see.</p>

<p>the best tips i can give are lay on your back in a quiet room, try looking straight up through your eye lids, and imagine everything black, even yourself not being visible. just imagine the feeling up levitating upwards and don&#39;t move your body. if you have an itch, then itch, then go right back to where you were. also try imagine a string coming from your forehead that you&#39;re following &#39;up.&#39; once your body is asleep, and you remain alert you will feel a violent vibrating/shaking...this is normal. it&#39;ll usually scare the person and they&#39;ll snap out of it and wake up. if you can manage thru this that is the last step. i&#39;m on my phone so i can&#39;t type too much but check out astralpulse.com or some tips on youtube.</p>

<p><strong>some info on ET/alien and government stuff</strong></p>

<p>i&#39;ve done lots and lots of research between the government and ET&#39;s relations...i can tell you they have worked together...from several sources i remember we gave them the ability to test (abduct) our people as long as they returned them unharmed, in return we would be given technology..when i typed this is was all at once so i don&#39;t have every site/book/interview just sitting around...in the last 100 years there has been more technological advancement than ever before.......and alien abductions, they are kept out of the MSM (because it is controlled) so we never hear about them. but there was several major reports....all the reports i&#39;ve read the people describe the same thing....usually they&#39;re driving in the middle of nowhere, then they awake on the side of the road with a huge loss of time and awareness, or often just taken from their bed. nearly all reports involve laying in a bright room and having their genital examined...they always appear to be returned with no major body damage, maybe a bruise or incision, but they always wake up confused, curious about the loss of time, i mean if i was taken outta my car i&#39;d be mind ****ed, but the ones taken during sleep usually just blow it off as a dream....also 51 is thought to be an underground base...but many inside sources talk about there are actual ET&#39;s working down there....there is often weird flying objects seen leaving and entering the mountains....the underground base could be huge....i mean under the denver airport (you should check out the murals, oh and the roof is made of teflon), white house, and many other places there is like a small city, what i mean is their are roads and enough room to drive around...a popular belief is that ET&#39;s have mated with us, or just taken semen or something and that is where we get the alien/human hybrids. which makes sense with the reports on genital examination. i think i remember seeing the animal mutilations are similar....greys are the most common, but some species like the nordics are very identical to us</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIb4mO0ur9Y">lots of famous people have spoke on their experience/knowledge, THIS IS A GOOD WATCH</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.alienvideo.net/0805/alien-abduction-mutilation.php">here is the human mutilation case from 1994</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87PRVP4EQAo">some of the best footage, all in one video</a></p>

<p><a href="http://arcturi.com/GreyArchives/USAndGreys.html">interesting read, extraterrestrials and the US</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rickrichards.com/astral/Astral1.html">the link i posted earlier also relates to this a bit if you read more about abductions, cloaking, etc</a></p>

<p>whether aliens/ET&#39;s are responsible for all the stuff we hear/see, who knows. it could be our government with advancements enough to do such things. then again some of them might be aliens. who knows...also imo the majority of UFO sightings are probably just top secret government stuff.</p>

<p>these are some from just the US. they can be backed up too. some of them will link you to videos/pics</p>

<p>the governement is a joke. the presidential election is a joke. they&#39;re nothing more than a puppet. whoever the president is has to play by &#39;their&#39; rules. look at JFK he didn&#39;t, wanted to go and talk about, and try to abolish the federal reserve...look what happened to him</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbONIQfQmDU">Phil Schneider was a guy who had spoke too much on stuff he shouldn&#39;t have and he was mysteriously found dead</a></p>

<p>i&#39;m not guaranteeing any truth in this thread, you can&#39;t open your mind, or you believe everything the MSM (mainstream media, the ultimate way of brainwashing) says, then i hope you didn&#39;t waste your time here. just don&#39;t be disappointed when you don&#39;t see the pearly gates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pick up a copy of the book, DMT The Spirit Molecule. It damn near changed my perception of a lot of things.</p>

<p>One thing I gleaned from it is that the human body only has two major bursts of DMT, where it floods the brain with the chemical. One, of course, is the moment of death. The other is 40 days after conception. In the Tibetan monks Book of the Dead, it is said that the human soul enters the body 40 days after conception. Coincidence? I think not.</p>

<p>Usually people post a link or a specific topic, comments are posted concerning that link/topic. Then you have comments on that topic that follow.</p>

<p>Posting your complete browsing history makes it hard to post feedback of anykind, and I honestly followed a link or two of your but although the others may be just as interesting I have nowwhere near a big enough attention span (as most Redditors) to spend one hour just following the links of your post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes but no.</p>

<p>if you actually look into near death experiences and obe&#39;s connected with them you&#39;ll find that the difference is that there is no brain activity. The gov and others have done experiments with Ketamine because they report similar experiences. </p>

<p>The difference with that, like I said, is that there is NO brain activity with those who have NDEs. Also those who have had NDE&#39;s and OBE&#39;s have told people about what happened in other places, and other rooms while there was no brain activity. The things they reported, had actually occurred while they were proclaimed dead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a moderator of <a href="/r/UAP">/r/UAP</a>, I feel the need to go through your &quot;ET/alien and government stuff&quot; section and provide some criticism while asking some questions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>from several sources i remember we gave them the ability to test (abduct) our people as long as they returned them unharmed, in return we would be given technology</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is your source for this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all the reports i&#39;ve read the people describe the same thing....usually they&#39;re driving in the middle of nowhere, then they awake on the side of the road with a huge loss of time and awareness, or often just taken from their bed. nearly all reports involve laying in a bright room and having their genital examined</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re basically describing the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_and_Barney_Hill_abduction">Barney and Betty Hill case</a>. Can you reference a second case which typifies this &quot;pattern&quot;? I am not at all an expert on the so-called abduction reports, but I can tell you that from what <em>I&#39;ve</em> read the reports are far more varied and strange:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In 1954 in Venezuela, <a href="http://www.rense.com/general28/hist66.htm">Jesus Paz</a> allegedly was attacked by a small, hairy humanoid. He had long scratches on his right side and along his spine. Police who arrived on the scene saw this short, hairy man running away toward a small silvery disc that was hovering nearby. They threw a rock at it before rushing Paz to the hospital. </p></li>
<li><p>In 1957, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Villas_Boas">Antonio Viillas Boas</a> reported being dragged manually into a flying saucer by three small men who came up to his shoulder (Boas was 5 foot 5 inches). They picked him up and carried him into their eggshaped &quot;craft&quot; while he fought and cursed them violently. They were wearing grey &quot;uniforms&quot; that were extremely tight-fitting and went up to the neck where they met a helmet with big eyes  - Boas even described a red patch or &quot;badge&quot; on their chests about the size of a &quot;pineapple slice&quot;. After &quot;talking&quot; to one another - Boas described their &quot;language&quot; as sounding like dogs howling - they undressed Boas and brought him into a small square room. Then they attached some apparatus to his chin, and Boas reported painlessly observing them draw blood from his chin. Then, most remarkably, he reports that a human looking woman came into the room with &quot;high, separated breasts, small waist, flat belly, well-developed hips and large thighs.&quot; She mounted him and fucked him, all without a hint of intimacy or affection.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, your description of the typical abduction simply does not capture the variation in the reported experiences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they always appear to be returned with no major body damage, maybe a bruise or incision, but they always wake up confused, curious about the loss of time, i mean if i was taken outta my car i&#39;d be mind ****ed, but the ones taken during sleep usually just blow it off as a dream</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above cases do not involve lost time, and the Paz case involves explicit harm done to the reporter&#39;s body.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>also 51 is thought to be an underground base...but many inside sources talk about there are actual ET&#39;s working down there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where did you read about the &quot;many inside sources&quot;? Can you provide references? Again, I&#39;m aware of <em>one</em> allegedly inside source who claims this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar">Bob Lazar</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>greys are the most common, but some species like the nordics are very identical to us</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you link me to a meta-analysis of alleged abduction reports and close encounters of the third kind which both breaks down the reported &quot;occupants&quot; in terms of species <em>and</em> which shows that the &quot;grey&quot; type is the most common? That sounds like it would be an awesome source indeed. Otherwise again, I&#39;ll have to assume you don&#39;t have sources but are rather expressing your impressions. </p>

<p>I have and watched the talk Bill had on it. It actually deals with it in a much different way than the way you are presenting it. </p>

<p>Also if you have read the book I HIGHLY recommend you checking out his radio show <a href="http://www.hourofthetime.com/wordpresstest/?page_id=7576">The Hour Of The Time</a></p>

<p>I really enjoy the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o__D464kGyY">Mystery Babylon Series</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well just some general advice it&#39;s usually not the best idea to cite something if you haven&#39;t actually read it ;D</p>

<p>He touches on these topics but in a completely different manner. I hope you do take the time to read it and if it interests you to keep going with your search. </p>

<p>That song was interesting, but Behold A Pale Horse has much symbology to it, and the semantics interconnected. It&#39;s taken from a passage in the Holy Scriptures and deals with End Times as believed by the Judeo Christian Church.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dopaminedude, I recommend a healthy dose of skepticism. I snooped your posting history, and you make some very strong statements that I do not believe you can back up with facts. </p>

<p>I recommend checking out this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8h-xEuLfm8">Bertrand Russell video</a> in which he offers his advice to future generations: look only and solely at the facts. While Phil Schneider is interesting, I do not believe that much, if anything, that he says can be positively verified as fact. Can you even prove that he worked where he said he worked? If you can verify that, how would you propose going about verifying the <em>experiences</em> that he says he experienced? </p>

<p>here are some stories of abductees...i&#39;m referring to the greys, who are said can be violent, but they;re usually the ones people remember seeing. i mean there are other types like nordics i think it is, they look like humans</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a theory out there that Greys aren&#39;t really aliens but actually humans from the future that screwed there DNA with all that modification they have done to themselves to be all hyper intelligent, but they have screwed there reproductive system along the way and now are dying out or reached a evolutionary end so they need to fix it.</p>

<p>Which makes sense in the context of there interests.</p>

<p>But I think it&#39;s bullshit that they trade with us, then again if you have secret black projects that can kick there ass using reverse engineering who knows,maybe they do have an agreement.</p>

<p>i posted this wanting to hear everyone&#39;s input on this kinda stuff. whether you believe, are unsure, or even if you think it&#39;s complete bogus</p>

<p>The 6 Most Famous Alien Abductions.....what they don&#39;t want you to hear. what they always try to keep under the radar.</p>

<p><a href="http://thefw.com/famous-alien-abductions/">http://thefw.com/famous-alien-abductions/</a></p>

<p>from an earlier post of mine:</p>

<p>&quot;i&#39;ve done lots and lots of research between the government and ET&#39;s relations...i can tell you they have worked together...from several sources i remember we gave them the ability to test (abduct) our people as long as they returned them unharmed, in return we would be given technology....in the last 100 years there has been more technological advancement than ever before.......and alien abductions, they are kept out of the MSM (because it is controlled) so we never hear about them. but there was several major reports....all the reports i&#39;ve read the people describe the same thing....usually they&#39;re driving in the middle of nowhere, then they awake on the side of the road with a huge loss of time and awareness, or often just taken from their bed. nearly all reports involve laying in a bright room and having their genital examined...they always appear to be returned with no major body damage, maybe a bruise or incision, but they always wake up confused, curious about the loss of time, i mean if i was taken outta my car i&#39;d be mind ****ed, but the ones taken during sleep usually just blow it off as a dream....also 51 is thought to be an underground base...but many inside sources talk about there are actual ET&#39;s working down there....there is often weird flying objects seen leaving and entering the mountains....the underground base could be huge....i mean under the denver airport (you should check out the murals, oh and the roof is made of teflon), white house, and many other places there is like a small city, what i mean is their are roads and enough room to drive around...a popular belief is that ET&#39;s have mated with us, or just taken semen or something and that is where we get the alien/human hybrids. which makes sense with the reports on genital examination. i think i remember seeing the animal mutilations are similar....greys are the most common, but some species like the nordics are very identical to us</p>

<p>here is the human mutilation case from 1994 <a href="http://www.alienvideo.net/0805/alien-abduction-mutilation.php">http://www.alienvideo.net/0805/alien-abduction-mutilation.php</a></p>

<p>some really really good interviews...just let the audio play as you misc, it&#39;s worth it.</p>

<p>many celebrities seem to know a lot of some inside stuff. in this video he mentions his phones were tapped at one time. lots of crazy **** with stuff to back it up....i&#39;ve heard the most of it before, but the majority of people have no idea about this ****</p>

<p>here he tells an interesting story...it&#39;s crazy because if you researched as much as i have, there are so many similarities in all the things i&#39;ve read about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIb4mO0ur9Y&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIb4mO0ur9Y&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded</a></p>
