<p>I have fallen asleep in my car over 10 times (parked of course) in the past 2 months.  3 of which in my drive way (including last night).</p>

<p>My ipod is like a truthmachine now hahaha I heard music in the car the other day and was surprised by how moving it was.  I am in a band and my bandmates think im nutts for not listening to music in the car.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listened to the first 15 or so more or less as you posted them, I also watched the Luxor which was a good episode, and listened to a few of the others too, but overall I got bored with his presentation style and the repetition, I found it hard to believe in his interview with a freemason that the guy is for real... never really got what his point was except to spout a bunch of history lessons which we have no way of verifying one way or the other (not saying history isn&#39;t great)</p>

<p>I mean at this point in my conspiracy career it seems he has nothing much to teach me. You say the elite worship the sun, lucifer, and believe themselves of a superior race... I would say these are mostly true, but its also possible than rather than gaining any sort of metaphysical power from these acts its merely a tool for psychological control of subordinates...</p>

<p>Could you expound on the bombshells in his work that you found so intriguing please?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gladly. </p>

<p>They believe that they are a superior race and that through the use of the intillect, they will eventually become Gods and will be able to defy death and do all the things God does.  </p>

<p>Ever seen the movie 2001 A space Oddessy?  That movie is pretty much a story for what they believe and what they are trying to achieve.  Remebmer the moon-baby at the end?  That can make universes?  </p>

<p>William Cooper was also named as the most dangerous man on radio by Bill Clinton.  Which is interesting.  </p>

<p>Oh dude!  You can&#39;t stop!! You gotta go through them all!  It all connects and he connects them all.</p>

<p>You can verify it all too! He sources everything! And we know who belongs to these societies.  </p>

<p><strong>No one else went more into the mystery schools then William Cooper and I would highly recommend you finish listening to that series</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothings wrong with believing in evolution.  </p>

<p>Except survival of the fittest.  </p>

<p>And lets say you take the reins of &quot;god&quot; and start trying to push mankind along to <em>where you</em> think man needs to evolve.  </p>

<p>Who gave you permission? Number 1.
How do you know its going to be a good change? Number 2
Who sets the standards for the evolution? Number 3
And once those standards are set, what happens to those who &quot;Are not fit enough to survive?&quot; Number 4.</p>

<p>Evolution is fine to think about but when it comes into changing the world, the idea that there are people out there that are simply alive to be killed as &quot;not fit&quot; is pretty sick isn&#39;t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow...What are you talking about?  You really have no other sources of information besides this guys ramblings do you?  Evolution of mankind is on a per person basis as they are ready and willing - not globally.  Global evolution only happens when the individuals are evolved enough to make it happen on their own.  Which judging by reactions in major cities during black outs (relative calm and helpfulness), we as a society may be approaching.</p>

<p>In a real mystery school here are your answers:
1) the participant, when they decided they wanted understanding and came to the door.
2) Because a good mystery school uses the &#39;craft&#39; as you called it, to help an individual overcome their demons or troubles or ticks or what have you as they have identified in themselves.
3) The individual evolving.
4) They keep trying until they grow, or decide to give up and leave the school.</p>

<p>You should probably look into this stuff and put all this cooper stuff to the side until you do. You have vast misconceptions about what this stuff is about.  </p>

<p>A real mystery school.  So you mean not Scientology?</p>

<p>I think you haven&#39;t heard enough about the dark side of the secret societies or mystery schools.  </p>

<p>On the front, all these schools pose themselves as good and believe the &quot;work&quot; they are doing is good.</p>

<p>All you have to do is look at their history, track record, and their talk of the future to know that their causes is not righteous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I&#39;ve heard about it. Thats why I started my own research because I was like you.  And when I did it I found out more then the super common &quot;OMGZ they&#39;re all evilz!&quot; stream of thought.  You think you&#39;re perspective is unique? Its dime a dozen amongst those that dont really have a clue from any first hand experience.  Those that fear but fail to actually research.  Those that wont trust themselves to find their own answers.  You are not unique or even innovative in your perspective.  You&#39;re common and unable to govern yourself, because you dont even trust yourself enough to face your fear.</p>

<p>Define righteous so you can show me what their causes are not.</p>

<p>Define good - as in how you are a good person - what makes you a good person.  So I can see how their work is not that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the whole &quot;worship of satan&quot; thing, that&#39;s why.
That was kinda the secret behind &quot;The mystery religion&quot;, It was either the &quot;How to&quot; guide or &quot;What they think&quot; on the worship of &quot;satan&quot; explained. I&#39;m all for advancing our species (or evolving) but this can&#39;t be the only &quot;one&quot; way, I hope we can find more to decide between.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok let me lay something simple out.. the mystery religions were around for thousands and thousands of years before &#39;satan&#39; was invented.  To believe they are linked to this ancient plan of world domination, and also linked to &#39;satan&#39; is pure non-sense.  That is unless you believe the invented satan to control the masses, but even still why worship and invention. </p>

<p>Look it up if you dont believe me, satan is way more modern then mystery schools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gawd! Proving your ignorance.  </p>

<p>In the beginning they worshipped the sun! Amen Ra, the light, the intellect.</p>

<p>As the mysteries moved on through out the ages, Lucifer became the symbol of worship as he was <em>the fallen morning start</em> or <em>the bearer of the light</em>.</p>

<p>So no, of course they didn&#39;t worship satan back then because as you say he wasnt around.  But they <em>do</em> worship &quot;him&quot; in recent times but <em>they do not worship satan they worship what he represents which is mans goal of becoming god!</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just agreed with me and at the same time called me ignorant.  In doing so you showed you have very little idea what you&#39;re talking about.  You have now conflated Satan, Lucifer, the Bearer of Light and the Morning Star.  Any serious research on the topic from as recent as late roman to late middle age period could show you they are not all the same, nor have they been.  I suppose you would throw Bahemet in the same group right?  Might as well put Cernunnos, green man and any other non-Christ figure in the group too huh?Simple ignorance to call everything you dont understand and fear the same thing.  By the way Morning Star - is a reference to Venus, a female goddess of fertility that was, of course lumped in with evil beings b/c the church did not like the idea of females having power.</p>

<p>Additionally you pointed out a very weird paradox in your thinking, you seem to think the goal of evolution, &#39;becoming god&#39; as you put it, is evil. Disdain for pursuing self correction and personal divinity (a lesson of Christ if you have ever read anything about his words) would put you squarely in the school of &#39;everyone should be sheep and know nothing&#39;.  So... which is it should we wake up and find truth?  Or seek to not evolve and stay as sheep?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, </p>

<p>Isaiah 14:</p>

<pre><code>(12)How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
(13)For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
(14)I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.
(15)Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
(16)They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;
</code></pre>

<p>Ok so now we know that Lucifer = fallen star, &quot;son&quot; of the morning.</p>

<p>The goal of self correction and &quot;perfection&quot; is not evil in itself.</p>

<p>In the case of freemasonry, for instance, it is their creed that joining them will help you become whole and they will help you find yourself.  Which on the whole is fine, self-correction is a fine goal to have.  </p>

<p>But when you associate with a group, just like 1 good kid with a gang of hoolagins, you will be brushed with the same stroke as the rest. </p>

<p>And when you look at &quot;who the rest are&quot; and &quot;who started freemasonry&quot; you begin to see that this &quot;benevolent fraternity&quot; isn&#39;t as benevolent and good standing as you thought.  Further more, if you look at the actions carried about by high degreed freemasons, it begins to give a much more clear picture of what Freemasonry is all about.</p>

<p>Oh you should wake up and find the truth of course! Which is what leads a lot of people to the doors of the lodges.  But I personally believe that freemasonry is not where freedom and truth lie, it is where deceit and manipulation occurs all the while being presented as truth.</p>

<p>If I wanted to become one though.  What would I have to do?  Other than put on aprons and go through some initiations?  Hmmm?  Maybe read some books?  Some ancient texts from mason masters of the past such as Albert Pike?  Hmm? Or Adam Weishaupt (the founder of the order of illuminati?) hmm?  </p>

<p>I know a lot about this group, even though I am not a member, because I&#39;ve read what is given to beginner masons, I&#39;ve read works on what the leaders of the masons truly believe and what their ultimate goal is.  </p>

<p>William Cooper revealed more about freemasonry and the mystery schools of the past then anyone ive ever found.  He did over <a href="http://www.hourofthetime.com/wordpresstest/?page_id=7576">1900 SHORT WAVE RADIO BROADCASTS</a> throughout the 90s and even predicted things like 9/11.  </p>

<p>Have you listened to Bill Cooper?  Are you a mason?  Have you listened to this series that I, the OP, reference in the title of this post?  &quot;40 hours of the religion of the Illuminati&quot;? </p>

<p>If not, what are you doing in here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Proof of Cult Leader.  Prove it.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.mason372.org/Docs357/EA%20Handbook.pdf">Entered Apprentice Handbook</a></p>

<p>&quot;This handbook is designed to introduce the new Entered Apprentice to the vast body of
knowledge associated with Freemasonry in a meaningful and understandable way. It is intended
that through the intellectual study of Freemasonry the Entered Apprentice will come to
understand that the application of Masonic teachings in daily life is the most rewarding aspect of
his new journey. The best way to use this handbook is to read through it as soon as possible, but
also to continue to use it as a reference source in one’s continued Masonic development and
study of the Masonic mysteries.*&quot;</p>

<p>So, no, you are not a mason, yet?  I should say?</p>

<p>You have already begun your innitiation into freemasonry and <em>yet you call Bill a cult leader</em>? </p>

<p>Have you even read &quot;Morals and Dogma&quot;? </p>

<p>Oh I am very ignorant I am sure, but it is in this acceptance that I found my drive to discover the truth.  But instead of &quot;knocking on the door&quot; and becoming an entered apprentice, I started by research and found Bill and HIS research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a cult leader </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re opinion.  </p>

<p>Real facts, GO! What are they?  Point form is acceptable.</p>

<p>Just remember that it is YOU that is an entered apprentice and is being passed a lot of information to help you along your way. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAHAHA!  That&#39;s not the official handbook.  What you posted is a quick synopsis of certain aspects of the first degree.  That book does not go into any detail.  If you want to know SO bad why don&#39;t you join and find out for yourself?  Otherwise you should stop slandering people you know nothing about.  Yes I have read &quot;Morals and Dogmas,&quot; twice.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I must mention that you have not provided any proof of Cooper&#39;s Cult Leadership.</p>

<p>Second, :) , I&#39;m glad someone else is finding humour in this.</p>

<p>Third, I never said it was official, but <em>you</em> did say it is a quick synopsis.  Do you have a copy you could post?  What are the resources you have been given as an entered apprentice to study?  May I have a copy?  If not, why not?</p>

<p>I should hope you have read that book, I hear it is what used to be given out (i don&#39;t know if it still is) to all new apprentices.</p>

<p>Some real good information in there, isn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>&quot;Albert Pike [William Cooper: and you’re going to hear an awful lot about Albert Pike during this series] the SovereignGrand Commander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry here in the United States from 1850 to 1891 [William Cooper: theman who founded the Ku Klux Klan and B’nai B’rith] wrote a book, entitled
 Morals and Dogma
. [William Cooper: And whenand if you can find that book, don’t pass it up -- buy it and read it.] Mr. Pike has been praised by his fellow Masons as amember almost without parallel in the history of the Masonic Order. [William Cooper: He was a great friend of GiuseppeMazzini, the ruler of the European branch of the Illuminati.] Carl Claudy, himself a Masonic writer of great esteem, wrote thisabout Pike: &#39;Albert Pike, one of the greatest geniuses Freemasonry has ever known. He was a mystic, a symbolist, a teacher of the hidden truths of Freemasonry.&quot;So the outsider can know that whenever Mr. Pike speaks he speaks with authority and knowledge. He is perhaps the greatest Masonic writer of all time [William Cooper: and I would add, next to Manly P. Hall].&quot;His book is given to each Scottish Rite Southern Jurisdiction Freemason, who is asked to read it. (There seems to be adifference of opinion as to whether or not this book is still required reading for each Scottish Rite Mason. [As we were] told that it was given to each Scottish Rite Mason in Tucson. Other Masons say that that is not true.)&quot;</p>

<p>[William Cooper]: But you have to remember, they’re sworn not to reveal the secrets of the lodge, and therefore you cannever trust them to tell you the truth, no matter what they’re telling you.&quot;[But in this book, Morals and Dogma, Pike] informs the new Mason about the moral teachings of the Masonic Lodge.He instructs the Masonic reader that the Order will eventually be asked to rule the entire globe. </p>

<p>And he wrote [this]: &#39;The world will soon come to us for its Sovereigns...and Pontiffs...We shall constitute the equilibrium of the universe and be rulersover the masters of the world.&#39; &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You yourself are one source of proof that Bill was a cult leader.  Look at how you defend him so:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnNSe5XYp6E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnNSe5XYp6E</a></p>

<p>You quote Bill&#39;s misquote of Albert Pike.  Anyhow, Pike&#39;s book is no longer used anymore.  Next time you link a source make sure it&#39;s the actual source.<br/>
As far as posting a copy of my literature...NO...you are not worthy.
Listen to how you talk...
Again, if you want to know so bad then join and find out for yourself.  But I guess it&#39;s easier to sit back and slander people over the computer then it is to take some initiative in real life.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL.  English translation of Hebrew text = lots of fail.  King James Bible = way more fail in regard to Old Testament and New. I thought you did research on this stuff? If you&#39;re quoting the KJB, you havent done much research at all.  Go ahead and look into the politics that created that book and tell me its an instrument of a free mind... it was developed for the opposite.  As a side note, that you should know: If you aren&#39;t interpreting the Hebrew words through their KEY then you dont know what you&#39;re reading and it CANNOT be taken literally.  Learn to study religion with your mind, not your faith, have faith after your mind is full and in resonance and you&#39;ll get a lot farther - see Jefferson for hints on that one.</p>

<p>So, by your comparison on Freemasonry, if the higher degrees are bad people doing bad things, then all freemasons and those that are seeking to better themselves through self correction or what have you are also &#39;evil&#39;.  By that nature every single US citizen no matter how good, or helpful to the world, is evil and should be put to death due to the extreme corruption and vile acts of agression our highest leaders, which unlike masonry, we actually elected, are responsible for.  Hmm.. more paradoxical displays and cognitive dissonance.  </p>

<p>Your story doesn&#39;t even hold up to your own story.  Didnt the Masons create our Free State and give us a chance at self rule?  So were the founders of freemasonry evil or good?  Helpful or not?  Or could it be, like any human endeavor, they were both and to varying degrees their members have been good and bad, just like every other human and human organization on this planet?  Could it be that people grab the bad examples and hold on to it b/c they are afraid and need an enemy they dont understand to blame the world on?  Could it be that the blame for the world falls fully on all of us, but the weak minded and unsure have to have a &#39;dark knight&#39; to point at, that will just take it silently, until the weak grow up and take responsibility for themselves?  Seems far more likely to me considering how immature the majority of people are in regards to this world, their fellow man, even their own future generations... but who knows maybe its all just a perfectly coordinated conspiracy to do something or another thats terrible.  As if we dont already have genocide, famine, slavery.  You dont need a conspiracy to have those things.. they are happening every day all over the world and will continue until we care enough about others to stop it.</p>

<p>You are jumping here but I&#39;ll play along.  </p>

<p>Those masons who are at the lower levels are being used as picks guards, and defenders of &quot;the craft&quot; by the higher degree&#39;d and elite.  Most masons don&#39;t make it passed the 3rd degree (there are 33 in freemasonry) and therefore don&#39;t get close to learning the true nature of what their organization is.  </p>

<p>If you cover for a lie are you as guilty as the liar?  Probably not.  But it doesn&#39;t make you good either.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to avoid anything here but again I have to ask:    Have you have listened to the entire series he did (the 40 hours)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re quoting stuff I learned when I was 13 like its a revelation.  You&#39;re the one jumping, in the last comment you claimed them all to be evil b/c of their evil overlord intentions... now your saying their covering for a liar and that they dont know what their organization is doing - again cognitive dissonance (do you know what that means?).  </p>

<p>How can they cover for a liar and not know they are doing so, and if they dont know how are they bad people?  You&#39;ve trapped yourself in your own illogic built on a worldview of fear and demons. You are still trying to side step that fact that you keep saying opposite things.</p>

<p>Basically you&#39;ve proven, even to yourself, that these are not the answers youre looking for, because taken as a whole they do not make sense even on the most basic levels of rational thought.  </p>

<p>So go ahead and please explain how the King James Version of the bible written the middle ages to suppress peasants, translated by belabored monks at the sword point of a King is some sort of honest tool of seeking truth.  If THAT bible is what you use to link all these things to &#39;Lucifer&#39;, or which ever evil god you think these people worship... then you are clearly delusional and lack even a modicum of real, open and normal history understanding, much less any real occult history understanding. </p>

<p>Please, try again.  Try all day long.  You just keep contradicting yourself and making your own lack of basic information apparent.</p>

<p>And at this point I dont even care what Bill says, b/c if you&#39;re the result of an avid listener, then its a waste of time and a long series of misinformation.  I mean, you seem to lack basic history on the bible and the Christian church yet you&#39;re talking about mystery schools and secret organizations as if you have some inside information. Clearly a simple biased point of view thats created by some silly and rather internally inconsistant propaganda. </p>

<p>Let me blow your mind:  The bible is one of those evil mystery texts by a mystery schools b/c christianity began as a mystery school and baptism IS an initiation... or didnt you know that?  The reason it got popular is because everyone, whore or leper or king, was permitted to get initiated, instead of just 35 year old male rabbis.  Oh wait you didnt know that?  Christ was in on the &#39;nefarious conspiracy&#39; to evolve mankind through initiation so he could... do something terribly evil in the world, or something.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Friend. I don&#39;t want to diss you but will politely reply to the points you brought up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I watched 15 episodes ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cooper has  a few thousand hours worth of shows and conferences out there. The greater part of it is well researched and still relevant even after all those years.</p>

<p>Do you know of any single other conspiracy theorist that has put out so much information?  I am not talking about  scare-mongering à la Alex-Jones, I mean real-facts where you learn something. I have not seen anyone come close to Cooper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got bored with his presentation style and the repetition</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of his shows are on short-wave radio, and last an hour or more so yes there is repetition sometimes. To be fair, the one I have heard so far (40+) tend to concentrate on one subject for the show.  If the subject requires 2 or 3 shows, he will expand on it as need be. But I agree it sometimes makes for a long &quot;listen&quot;.  It takes a lot of time to go through his stuff.  I listen to him through headphones while working, instead of music.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>never really got what his point was except to spout a bunch of history lessons which we have no way of verifying one way or the other (not saying history isn&#39;t great)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This to my ear sounds like: I am too lazy to lookup all the references he gives on every subject he tackles (as he instructs people to do many times during each show).  History is indeed great. Cooper is especially fascinating to me because he goes into the &quot;hidden&quot; history.  To be fair, though, of course it will sound &quot;unbelievable&quot; at first. That is why <em>YOU</em> have to do your <em>OWN</em> research.  This is where most people drop the ball and hint at his talks being too far-fetched.</p>

<p>I have myself taken the time to validate the stuff <strong>I</strong> felt important to validate: hidden archeology in the states, the fluoride conspiracy, sovereign persons, and a few more. So far all checked out as valid and trustworthy, there is a lot of corroboration on most subjects he has talked about online.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would say these are mostly true, but its also possible than rather than gaining any sort of metaphysical power from these acts its merely a tool for psychological control of subordinates...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe we have not listened to the same shows,  but isn&#39;t that his <strong><em>main</em></strong> point? When he refers to people as &quot;sheeple&quot; for example, I thought it meant exactly that. People were blind to the fact they are slaves being fleeced and led to the slaughterhouse. If that is not a strong hint at psychological control, I don&#39;t know what is. He is always warning that these secret organisations are out for a totalitarian, global state. How do they accomplish this, if not by controlling the masses behind the scenes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could you expound on the bombshells in his work that you found so intriguing please?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, our opinions differ. So far about every show I have listened to has a topic worthy of interest, and I can say I actually learned quite a bit from what I have heard. Of course he is human and has a strong opinion. He has had some controversies around some of his claims but I can easily imagine anyone that puts out so much information on these matters is bound to make a few bad calls. To his credit, I totally feel these are <em>honest</em> mistakes and in no way relates to the usual disinfo we are usually fed by some other conspiracy theorists. <em>cough</em> Alex Jones <em>cough</em>.</p>

<p>Anyways. I have not followed the posting of op, but his incessant postings DID turn me on to Cooper. I downloaded the shows and started listening to them from the first one on, and would very highly recommend it to any curious adult wanting to know more about conspiracies, hidden history and secret societies.</p>

<p>My 2 cents, cheers!</p>

But then I learn about Gnostics and their beliefs from them, and out of anything I&#39;ve ever heard, it sounds like it has the most truth to it. </p>

<p>In the past that they hide to hide their pagan beliefs, that was because at that time the Church was just as corrupt. </p>

<p>So really everyone is stark raving mad lunatics, liars, and out for themselves. With that in mind, it seems like the Gnostics are the only ones willing to at least speak some truth, which is more than I can say for any other &quot;organization&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cooper goes to the root of the matter.  Yes, they are mostly all related if you go back far enough, religions make up a tree sort of and it all branches out.</p>

<p>Most worshipers and adepts of these religions are not even aware of the true roots of their beliefs.  Christianism and Islam, for example both have the same root. And they both derive from older, lost religions that Cooper has researched on (references provided in his shows). You will discover (history books DO back this up) that many Luciferian practices and beliefs were borrowed by both these major religions. Not everyone is stark raving mad for believing in those religions, they simply are not aware of the roots of their beliefs.  </p>

<p>I prefer to think most people have good intentions, they have simply put their faith in something that is totally not what they believe it is.  They were duped and the true meaning of it all has been forgotten by most.</p>

<p>No, he doesn&#39;t. He tries to, but he doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Bill Cooper did not have the basis of knowledge necessary to understand what he wanted so badly to understand - but he had a personality type and a realization of &#39;well it&#39;s all bullshit and we&#39;ve been tricked&#39; that made him think he COULD understand it, and make him sound like &#39;he gets it and you need to get it too&#39;(but he doesn&#39;t, and even if you don&#39;t understand what he&#39;s reading, you can kind of &#39;get that&#39; from the way that he is talking, the obvious lack of real insight, the way he reads it, his demeanor, etc.). </p>

<p>He constantly mistakes the exoteric layer to BE the esoteric behind it, when it most certainly is not. The guy just does not have the foundational knowledge or background necessary to understand the &#39;religious stories&#39; that come out of the &#39;pagan&#39; mysteries.</p>

<p>He basically just takes his christian beliefs and transposes it into a context of &quot;mystery Babylon&quot;.</p>

<p>Seriously. This stuff is WAY, WAY deeper than anything Bill Cooper ever discerned. It&#39;s not about satan or lucifer, it&#39;s not about worshiping the sun, the sun is a concrete, physical representation of abstract, spiritual concepts or philosophies. That&#39;s it. &quot;They&quot;(whoever you think &quot;they&quot; are) aren&#39;t &quot;worshiping the sun&quot;.</p>

<p>I think Bill Cooper was will-intentioned, but listen OP, you are only going to become more misguided and led down a rabbit hole(not one that he was intentionally creating to mislead people - but one created because he is speaking from his own perspective which is very lacking in any of the things necessary to actually understand the stories he is reading), and end up dizzier than you were before if you spend 40 hours listening to Bill Cooper hoping for &#39;the real answers&#39; - because they will not be forthcoming(but Bill Cooper sure will promise you that they are).</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry.  Anyone who tells you all mystery schools are linked and or evil is pretty much just insane or paranoid.  Gnosticism is no different. They never were and still aren&#39;t one group. Due to this disparate nature, each of these groups are different and therefor like the humans that run them they have varying levels of &#39;evil&#39;.  Whatever that means.  Point being they are not all linked by some nefarious master plan and I&#39;m 85%certain that if some of them are linked by a nefarious plan, then the gnostic groups are not in on it.  In fact I&#39;d say the majority of the sun worshippers aren&#39;t either, but that is speculation. </p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t. He&#39;s just reading passages and speculating/offering commentary based in his christian conspiracy perspective. That is it. The books he is reading comes from authors that &quot;broke the story of mystery babylon and it&#39;s relation to the current world stage&quot; long before Bill Cooper was even born.</p>

<p>Bill Cooper is just some guy who came across this information and repeated it back/tried to interpret it(things which he did not have the prerequisite knowledge to interpret) back in a very dumb, blunt, country-boy-american &#39;real man and not a sheeple&#39; kind of way.</p>

<p>This is all much more nuances than Bill Cooper could ever have grasped. This is all much more complex than he could have imagined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are really, really confused about what you are even responding to.</p>

<p>You keep talking about Bill like you have a personal relationship with him - like, you take my post(the long one with all of the actual substance in it), respond with &quot;Hahahahahahaha&quot;, &quot;You just don&#39;t know Bill&quot; &quot;You should be ashamed of yourself&quot; - as if he is your personal prophet.</p>

<p>I think you need to get your head out of your ass, stop receiving any criticism as if it&#39;s a personal affront to the character of your favorite guru, and start acting like what it IS, commentary on HIS INFORMATION - and that&#39;s just it - it&#39;s not <em>BILL COOPER&#39;S INFORMATION</em>, it&#39;s shit that he read in a book, didn&#39;t really understand in the scope of the context it was meant to be taken in because he had never thought that through for himself without his limited view of &quot;America, the greatest nation ever founded, jesus&quot;,  become exposed to a little more information, and realize that Bill Cooper of all people did not &quot;reveal&quot; anything except things that have been &quot;revealed&quot; long ago(and the word reveal is basically &quot;re-veil&quot; - you&#39;re not &quot;unveiling&quot; anything, you&#39;re re-veiling something which is already out there and known, just putting it out all over again with your own personal little spin - which is exactly what Bill Cooper did - yes, he compiled forty sections of it, he had a lot of stuff to render and repeat by rote, adding bits and pieces of his own opinion based largely on christianity.</p>

<p>He reads texts which are written in a language which is not meant to be understood by someone like Bill Cooper, he reads stories which are allegories rather than literal works and takes them literally, he sees symbols and recognizes them for what they are but has none of the knowledge necessary to place them in their proper context and understand what the point of them is.</p>

<p>Shame on me for not knowing better enough to give him a chance? I DID give him a chance, I listened to as much of his self-righteous tripe as I could - some of it is worth listening to, some of it is just him mumbling along passages out of books that he doesn&#39;t really understand(and you can TELL he doesn&#39;t understand it), but he wants to reinforce an idea he is putting across - that the mysteries are out there and they are mystical and secret and working, and x and y and z - this is true but he had a completely misguided picture of almost all of it. &quot;Their books&quot;, &quot;their texts&quot; - WHOSE BOOKS? WHOSE TEXTS? WHO ARE YOU EVEN REFERRING TO? &quot;The mystery religion&quot; is a pretty fucking big thing, and a non-answer, so is &quot;mystery babylon&quot;, you don&#39;t even know what the fuck &quot;mystery babylon&quot; IS. You probably don&#39;t even know what the word &quot;babylon&quot; MEANS, let alone why that name would be given to it. Neither did Bill Cooper. See what I mean? He didn&#39;t know. He wanted to. </p>

<p>The guy didn&#39;t know what he was talking about. He wanted to. He didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the picture: X X X</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what Bill Cooper was able to discern from looking at it: I l l l I l(the lines necessary to make the picture, but not really the picture).</p>

<p>What Bill Cooper knew <em>was that there was something to know here</em> - but as much as he tried before his death(brought about by, you know, shooting a cop in the head), he didn&#39;t know what it was. He thought he did, he didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I did listen. You keep acting as if &quot;if you&#39;d just give it a chance!!&quot; - I&#39;ve listened to more hours of this guy than I&#39;d care to remember, just out of curiosity about him.</p>

<p>Dccable, it sounds very much like you&#39;re defending something you have a personal, emotional stake in. That&#39;s your line in the sand, and it makes you less than rational. </p>

<p>Someone can be misguided but inspired &amp; inspirational, you understand that, right? Someone can have good principles and hopes &amp; dreams, but be completely wrong and misguided about the details, you understand that, right? You don&#39;t need to listen to 2,000 hours of &#39;lectures&#39; to know(if they can even be called that when they are constantly interrupted with bill cooper going off on his supremely childish &#39;wake up sheeple we need to save this country&#39; bit - if he had any idea what the fuck was going on, he would not be talking about &#39;saving america&#39; - it&#39;s not ours to save, and it never was, there&#39;s nothing to go back to except the same system.)</p>

<p>You&#39;re making a bigger deal out of Bill Cooper than what is actually true. No, he did not &quot;break mystery babylon&quot; - he just took a bunch of mythological stories which he did not understand, put them in the context of a conspiracy which he did not understand, and framed that all in books like Pike&#39;s which he did not understand - which just went to reinforce his own religious beliefs, which he really based most of this on while pretending he wasn&#39;t. Bill Cooper was living in a paradigm which stopped him from understanding the things he was reading in &quot;their books&quot;, and &quot;their texts&quot;, and he did not have the ability to place these things in a coherent, proper context.</p>

<p><em>I&#39;ve listened to more episodes of him than I could name</em>, so &quot;which episode did you listen to&quot; is kind of a stupid question*. I don&#39;t need to listen to 1,900 hours of Bill Cooper to know what I know about him anymore than I need to listen to 1,900 hours of any other lecturer when they give you a perfectly clear picture of who they are and their level of understanding in the first 10 you listen to.</p>

<p>WE haven&#39;t &quot;drawn lines in the sand&quot;, you have decided not to really take anything I say into account or discuss it and instead just go &quot;WHICH DID YOU LISTEN TO HAHAHAHA SHAME ON YOU HE&#39;S A GREAT GUY BILL&#39;S A GREAT GUY(which is not at issue) SO YOU DON&#39;T LIKE HIS ANALYSIS OF ESOTERIC TEXTS THAT HE TAKES LITERALLY BECAUSE HE DOESN&#39;T KNOW OF ANY OTHER WAY TO UNDERSTAND THEM BUT DON&#39;T YOU LIKE HIS TALKS ON FREEDOM AND EDUCATION?? HOW ABOUT WACO??&quot; -- &#39;don&#39;t you like his talk on freedom isn&#39;t that great&#39; &#39;don&#39;t you like his talk on American education isn&#39;t that great&#39;  - this is all irrelevant in the context we are talking in.</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t have an understanding of who Bill was&quot; yes, I do - but &quot;who Bill was&quot; is totally irrelevant to his information.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t make sense of you continually taking what I am saying about his information on &#39;the mysteries&#39;(which he had no fucking idea about except in the context of public writings given out by a few people like Pike and Weishaupt) and instead making it about &quot;who bill was personally and what a great guy he was&quot; - except in the sense that you don&#39;t have anything to really say in response to me, but don&#39;t like me being critical of someone you are emotionally invested in, so you keep coming back with &quot;You just don&#39;t know Bill, Bill was such a great guy&quot; - like you don&#39;t understand how that is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Did you know that Bill gave lectures on UFOs in which he claimed to have seen &#39;documents in the navy 20 years prior&#39; that, in reality, had been written as hoaxes in the year prior? When confronted about it BY THE GUY WHO WROTE THEM(as he didn&#39;t write them to be a &#39;hoax&#39;, but to try and set his knowledge of the subject down on paper in the context of a fictionalized account of the pentagon dealing with an alien and having that alien tell them things), Bill wouldn&#39;t budge, and said &quot;well that may be so but I saw them&quot;(sounds very much like a Bill Cooper reaction, doesn&#39;t it?) - the guy in question responded &quot;but me and [x researcher] wrote them and published them ourselves 6 months ago&quot;.</p>

<p>He&#39;s just a guy who got into the world of &#39;conspiracy&#39;, &#39;woke up&#39;(but didn&#39;t, as he was still coming at it from a traditional american upbringing and then a career in the navy, and lots of christianity mixed in) first had very little idea what was going on, then got a little deeper into it, then spent years and years looking through every book he could get his hands on trying to understand something which went way beyond his understanding - he grasped that something deep was going on, and he would regurgitate everything he had read on radio broadcasts, acting as though he had the grand plan and knowledge of all the secrets.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t. Bill Cooper was just a guy. If you remain in this study area, you will look back on this 2 years from now and realize the same thing - that Bill tried, but he did not know what he was talking about.</p>

<p>His views on &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;education&quot; aren&#39;t at issue. They have nothing to do with what we are talking about here.</p>

<p>and seriously, I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve tried speaking to you in such an in-depth way, because you actually still think &quot;they worship the sun&quot;(probably having just recently been exposed to all of these concepts, and just recently been exposed to Bill Cooper, thinking you&#39;ve found some giant secret archive of great things from a great man who everyone should know about) instead of understanding what &#39;sun worship&#39; is actually meant to <em>represent</em>(and guess what, it&#39;s not &quot;worshiping the celestial body we call the sun&quot;, it&#39;s not worshiping anything physical, and it&#39;s not &quot;worshiping lucifer&quot;).</p>

<p>You are still at a very basic level of knowledge if you think &quot;the elite worship the sun&quot;. In 2 years you will look back on this and be like &quot;wow I was missing some serious stuff back then&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to be the one to give it to you. Good luck listening to Bill Cooper trying to understand life and the world. You&#39;re going to need to go elsewhere and use your own mind if you ever actually want to get anywhere.</p>

<p>Are you certain you&#39;ve listened to the mystery school series?  Cause he kinda clarifies some of these things you think I believe, fyi.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>See that&#39;s the thing. Cooper wasn&#39;t &quot;so so wrong&quot;, he was just misguided.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t explain to you why Cooper was wrong in any ways but the ways that I already have in this thread without going into a 2 hour presentation to contextualize what I am saying - and what he said - ABOUT what he said - where he placed it, and how that makes no sense - and where/how the cosmological system and the philosophies of life and nature behind it which he touched on(which is all he did - touched it - he has thousands of hours of recordings in which he TOUCHES things, but you can tell he doesn&#39;t really get much of it - because instead of understanding it as an independent an all-encompassing cosmological system, he takes it in terms of the views he was born into with christianity - which turns a cosmology, sets, systems, and sciences of esoteric philosophy.</p>

<p>and seriously - you can&#39;t get all the answers this way - but go read a Manly P. Hall book, specifically something like The Occult Anatomy of Man(which is also the occult anatomy of the universe in this system we are talking about, which Bill Cooper liked to touch on - one which he most certainly did not understand - just from the way he talked about it this was easy to see), or &quot;The Secret Teachings of All Ages&quot;.</p>

<p>Just get how deep these systems actually go. By systems I mean schools of thought and ideas/concepts/allegories and their varying tiers of meaning hidden behind a literal, exoteric front.</p>

<p>Compare that to the simplistic work of someone like Bill Cooper. Compare that to Bill Cooper reading passages and excerpts from his favorite &#39;esoteric sounding&#39; books. Compare that to Bill Cooper&#39;s analysis.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m not saying he got everything wrong, because he didn&#39;t - I&#39;m saying he didn&#39;t understand the scope of what was happening and what the realities in the philosophy are here - and he couldn&#39;t possibly do so because of the worldview he was using to interpret and color all of the information he took in. It&#39;s that simple.</p>

<p>These people are NOT operating in a paradigm anywhere CLOSE to the one Bill Cooper was taking their works in and interpreting them in, and despite <em>what you read on the internet</em> and in the EXOTERIC LANGUAGE used in the books of people like Albert Pike, they aren&#39;t &#39;satanists&#39; or &#39;luciferians&#39; - or, if they are, then they are not using those words to mean AT ALL what someone like Bill Cooper would assume they meant.</p>

<p>Even to define to you properly what I mean by &quot;exoteric vs. esoteric language&quot; or &quot;written in a language people like Bill Cooper were not meant to understand&quot;, I would have to explain how the language of the mysteries is used to present one story to the uninitiated like Bill, and another story entirely, with another meaning entirely - to those with the prerequisite basis of knowledge - like how the compiler(s) of a book like Revelations wove the esoteric with the exoteric in combining Egyptian, Persian, and Babylonian terminology, symbology, and mythology together to form a story that to someone like Bill Cooper, looks a lot like &quot;behold death, a pale horse&quot;(exoteric language for a man thinking in exoteric terms - <em>even when he understood something deeper was there to be understood, he would mistake that as a literal object like the sun or like a penis of osiris or something, rather than how that fits into an overall philosophy which is out there to learn and know, because it actually makes sense, as it is based on reason and intellect ..eg light.. eg brilliance, eg the sun, eg &quot;lightbringer&quot; or &quot;lucifer&quot; - bringing light to man, &quot;rebelling against god&quot; or against the natural order of things which had man as an ignorant caveman afraid of the darkness and terrified of the winter, with no REASON, no buildings, no city-states, no wealth except the wealth of Eden, or &#39;nature&#39; - but man rebelled against the god - Freemasonry&#39;s unspoken motto is &quot;perfect that which was left imperfect&quot; ..and they lead you and the members of the Blue Lodge to believe that all they mean by that is perfecting themselves as you would grind down a rough Ashlar into a perfected stone.. but really it means to perfect that which was left imperfect by nature - so many rebels *against his lower nature</em> and begins thinking with his upper head rather than his lower head, he has been given the light, and has rebelled against the original state of things toward progress ..which includes everything..), when in reality, it&#39;s a completely different story describing completely different things - and it&#39;s not so much about interpretation as it is about knowing what the philosophical systems of that time dictated certain things be described as and symbolized by in words - then taking that knowledge and reading a work and seeing &quot;oh wait this fits all of that criteria and uses the summer signs of the zodiac to represent the good guys, all of their names end in -el&quot; and &quot;look the bad guys names all bear the Egyptian names of the winter months and end in -On&quot;(an egyptian word for the sun - the sun in winter representing death, evil[&#39;Live&#39; backwards ..which is what winter is, evil, the opposite of life, warmth, growth]).</p>

<p>Even this, the above - it&#39;s like - what else can I type to give you an example of something that seems like one thing actually being something decipherable and way deeper? I&#39;m not saying this &quot;disproves bill cooper&quot;, I&#39;m saying this is an example of something like what I am talking about - and it&#39;s much too large and disorienting to try and go into it in reddit comments because it requires me to lay down foundation to go into further detail and that foundation would make my post an essay - it&#39;s something people need to learn on their own, and if they take my word, they&#39;ll go and keep looking and be like &quot;oh wow, that makes sense now, bill cooper had an idea but no idea at the same time&quot; - it takes time - and Bill Cooper is fine to listen to as a jumping off point, but don&#39;t let him get in your head, don&#39;t let his worldview get into your head - because while it is fine and dandy, it is simplistic and misleading because he just does not have the prerequisite knowledge to GET what he is trying to get. </p>

<p>Cooper had a very small view of what was going on here on Earth - and the thing is, his view is HUGE compared to the view offered by mainstream society - so imagine how deep things really go. I&#39;ve been in this long enough to know that things go much deeper than what even Bill Cooper thought(and I DO NOT AT ALL MEAN &quot;david icke&quot; deeper - I mean really deeper). There&#39;s so much more to know than what Bill Cooper understood - and it is out there, just keep looking for it.</p>

<p>(speaking of making my posts an essay ..just compare my comments in this thread to basically anyone else&#39;s - I&#39;m trying to express things that take a lot of words to make sense and be more substantive than &quot;bill coopers wrong!!&quot; - to go even further into it would take a book)</p>

<p>As for where to look - there is no one source who is going to give you a giant overview of reality, philosophy, the evolution of society, and the evolution of the ruling class and their religions(and they really are religions in a sense - philosophies are the only things which can make people zealous enough to continue on and on through generations in the same tasks and plans - the ruling class have one of their own, they have in all ages, and always give us another). </p>

<p>Just keep looking. If you want me to help you by directing you in a new direction then PM me and I&#39;ll do my best - but this is a lifelong journey that takes years of reading and collating data and concepts in your own head, lots of them, to really even get a sliver of it that is available on the outside of &#39;the inside&#39; - there&#39;s a lot out there to know, but you have to deprogram yourself first - I don&#39;t think Bill ever did that. I think he got into this field too late in his own life, that he held onto things that influenced the evolution of his thought in a direction that stopped him from seeing anything deeper(and by deeper I don&#39;t really mean like ..magical.. I mean philosophically deeper) than what he did see, which I will give him was much deeper than what the typical Navy father-of-however many kids, &#39;patriot&#39; sees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, we all can only understand anything from our own pre requisite understanding of anything... </p>

<p>But for me personally, I listen to Cooper for a jumping point. When I&#39;m sitting down and have nothing to do, I listen to Bill. Even if he&#39;s interpreting it incorrectly he&#39;s still presenting information. I use that as a starting gun shot for my own research. For that I thank him. He puts me on to books I would normally never read. He even says, Don&#39;t believe what you hear on here. </p>

<p>I respect that from him, because I don&#39;t. I use it as a guide for my own research. I recognize that I myself am human, fallible, and finite. How could I ever expect more from anyone else? He is no god, guru, or all seeing eye; he does compile information :)</p>

<p>So you just admitted that you have <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> checked out the whole series which means that you haven&#39;t heard the proof that they are all connected.  They are all connected.  They are! Maybe not on the ground floor, but at the top, they are.   </p>

<p>William Cooper was the one who blew the top off on this subject so if you aren&#39;t getting your intel/info from him, where do you get your information?  Who knew more about the mystery schools then bill cooper?  I think you don&#39;t even know what your talking about when you talk about bill, and thats in my opinion.  It sounds like you don&#39;t know a tonne about the research he did either.  ---Ill continue reading now---</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>People love jimmy page because he showed everybody the possibilities of music on a guitar and was amazing on it.  He loved guitar and music so much that he took the world by storm with his songs and his guitar.  Bill Cooper is just like that, to me.  Bill was an amazing man, who did more research than you or I could dream of I&#39;m sure, and gave to us.  All of us.  He wasn&#39;t selfish.  He gave it up!!  For you to consume and for I to consume.  </p>

<p>The &quot;personality cult following&quot; of Bill Cooper isn&#39;t a following of Bill Cooper per say.  If you are listening to Bill Cooper you are searching for the truth.  And that is commendable.  Bill Cooper fucking broadcasted the truth for years. And that is more then commendable, that is heroic.  </p>

<p>His radio broadcasts are his creed to the world and his PROOF that the world is not how most people think it is.  Undeniable proof.  So if there is a cult following of Cooper it is a following of people searching for the truth, truth-worshippers, and lets just say Bill spoke some deep truths.  </p>

<p>My religion isn&#39;t Christianity by the way.   </p>

<p>Again, it really doesn&#39;t make a difference on here what I believe.  This series was about <em>what they believe</em> because that WILL affect us.  </p>

<p>I think you need to give this series a good hard listen because I personally believe you do not have the proper foundation for your view on the mystery schools.  Like I&#39;ve been saying, Bill dug the deepest for the truth about them.  Listen to his series my friend.  I am not trying to be attacking, <em>he left us the paper trail to the whole conspiracy</em> you just have to listen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what if I told you there are Mystery schools that believe exactly the same things Cooper does?  And what if I told you there are secret societies that are working against such nefarious plots?  How would that fit into the world narrative he built?   </p>

<p>They are not all the same no matter how much you or he wants to believe it.  They never will be because they are as varied as the people who join them.  Its not evil to want to find truth and that at its core is what a mystery school is about.  That at its core sounds like what cooper was about, but he was just too afraid to do more then look at data and connect unconnected things, plus that was probably far more profitable.</p>

<p>Again, some are linked.  Some may even be bound in a nefarious plot to control people.  But not all of them are.  </p>

<p>If you count shared symbols as linked then you can say every human is linked to the same cause b/c we all share carbon as a core component.   Its not the components - its what you do with them and how you choose to share them that matters.  Its always been this way.

    <div class="md"><p>Its a reasonable hang up.  The reality comes down to what the symbol of Christ represents to various groups - answer: it varies!  It isnt often what you&#39;d hear about in church and when you look into Qabala you&#39;ll learn even more about what Christ is supposed to be from a foundational spiritual perspective.  If you ask the well educated Catholic clergy you&#39;ll hear them agree with these assessments b/c they understand the spiritual foundations of their religion (they require a PHD in religion to be clergy).  </p>

<p>There are plenty of christian occult groups (read mystery schools) that look to do good in the world and to give themselves to the betterment of all.  As I&#39;ve said elsewhere in this post - not all mystery schools are the same or connected by a nefarious plot.  Its far to black and white to believe so.  The world is made up of so many grey zones b/c we as humans are made up of so many grey zones.</p>

<p>I can go into depth with more info if you wish.  I&#39;ve read some of Manly P Halls works, and many other of related/similar vein.  You seem as if you&#39;re on the verge of really seeing some of the hidden truths of our world.  Dont waste your time on Cooper and his fear mongering, the answer isnt as simple as he portrays it. Its far more interesting and it is what you bring to it - so only as good or evil as you are.</p>

<p>Bud. We DO need to be ruled, and if we didn&#39;t need the truth hidden from us, then we would have it, because it wouldn&#39;t BE hidden. It&#39;s not that hard to find, what is hard to find is the use of your own mind and the security not to need to look to others for validation and teaching you about the secrets of your own life.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t hide the truth, they hide the way TO individual experience of it after gaining different tiers of insight into life. This is NOT something that most people are interested in, so it is hidden as to prevent it from being misused, trampled on, and dirtied like the masses have misused and dirtied every single good thing which has ever been given to them.</p>

<p>If the masses could rule themselves, if human beings on planet earth could rule themselves, THEN WE WOULD BE.</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t, and there is a reason for it. We can&#39;t, and we do need minders who CAN, because we are incapable, there are many base people in this world, the majority are actually - not so much &quot;base&quot;, but certainly not capable of ruling themselves.</p>

<p>Most people can&#39;t even rule THEIR OWN LIVES, let alone take part in a society progressing through the course of human evolution. I don&#39;t understand how you can look at the world and say otherwise. If we could rule ourselves, we would be ruling ourselves - &#39;conspiracy&#39; or no.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence and the American Constitution along with declaring the states a republic, was the first time in history man was set free.  Completely free.  No other man has been free before or since.  </p>

<p>Ben Franklin didn&#39;t hide from the fact that America was &quot;the great experiment&quot; and was quotes as answering the question of what type of government America would have and he said &quot;A constitutional republic, if you can keep it&quot; and what he meant is that if the people would work for themselves and be free or if they would contract their freedoms away to be governed.</p>

<p>I think you need to wake up a bit.  </p>

<p>William Cooper - &quot;
Ah, yes. A nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are steaks on the table and beasts of burden by choice and consent. Do you fit that description? I certainly hope not. If you do, then it’s time to wake up and change it. And if you really want to know in a nutshell what’s wrong with this country, go in your bathroom and look in the mirror.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im aware masons created this country.  They gave us the freedom to try and rule our selves (guess that was part of their nefarious plot or something).  Mostly we&#39;ve failed.  If we were ready to, we wouldn&#39;t have.  Evolution is as simple as environment and will - we as a people lacked the will to maintain our environment so we are now losing it.</p>

<p>I havent given up but we have more to learn before we&#39;re ready to own our freedom and keep it. This is purely an observation, not a judgement.  As you stated we were given freedom, and we lost it, because we couldnt hold it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re cognitive dissonance is showing through in this particular comment, if that isnt apparent yet then you may want to reread some of what you&#39;ve written today.  You are on the verge of seeing truth, you have the basis for the right mentality, but its all being driven by fear and that will never get you very far.   </p>

<p>Check this: What if the nefarious plot by all those secret groups was really all just a setup for mankind... a conspiracy to get them to grow up and take care of themselves and their world.. and this emerging NWO and all its associated trumpeters (conspiracy theorist sites) are really just part of the big final test to see if mankind seizes its freedom and takes responsibility for itself and each other?  And if they dont, they&#39;ve failed and proven they need masters for a century more, and if they do then they&#39;ll have their free planet, their brotherhood of man.  But what would be the right way to gain that freedom?  If you look to old Ben as inspiration - maybe it&#39;d be a nice free form of press.  To communicate, gather, remove barriers and join each other for the sake of each other in spite of differences or challenges from the evil overlords.  Well that&#39;d be something wouldn&#39;t it?  </p>

<p>So - are you ready to prove you deserve your freedom?  Or are you going to continue fearing every shadow and hiding behind cooper for every thought?  Free your mind of fear and you will begin to find your path to truth.  Cooper isnt wrong, but he isnt right either and relying on him for you answers wont get you anywhere - you&#39;re still depending on someone else, which is the opposite of the freedom you&#39;ve espoused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually something I&#39;ve thought about. One whether or not having us ruled by NWO would be bad, or Two what if they&#39;re just supposed to strip it away so much that we revolt and fight back. They&#39;re pushing us out of the nest hahah. </p>

<p>That&#39;s actually a pretty widely accepted theory. That we once lived on Mars, and tried to remove ourselves from morality and the feminine restraints of our consciousness using land mass Merkebahs and pyramidal energy monoliths but failed and destroyed the atmosphere. Which is why Mars has traces of a sustainable life atmospheric something... hahah I just threw that all together from what I recall. Then we left there and came here. Or at least whoever was there left and came here... whether or not they merged with life already here or they started it. </p>

<p>The only people I see shoving religion down anyones throats is the Christians these days.  Maybe muslims in some far away country too, but I cant say I&#39;ve seen that.</p>

<p>If an organization give to save children from cancer, even if its all a ruse for some evil plot that noone knows about, then isnt the giving to children with cancer still good?  And if the members have served no evil other then to help in this giving, are they not still good?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do not have windows.  Assuming you, like I, am talking about the masonic lodges.  They do not have windows good sir.</p>

<p>Well, I haven&#39;t experienced any of that shoving, but if it is, its because one of the goals of the NWO is to <em>eliminate religion all together</em>.  So assuming that plan is already in the works, we&#39;re supposed to be hearing less and less of religion but the Christians (so you say) are fighting back against the works of Atheism and Evolution.  (im not saying im christian here btw)</p>

<p>If an organization saves a child from cancer, that is a good act.
If that organization&#39;s goal is to bring about &quot;the new world order&quot;, then they are evil, regardless of that one case, due to the overwhelming number of bad things they have done and will continue to do to bring their goal to fruition.</p>

This alone shows your disconnect with reality.  You believe what you&#39;re told as gospel truths and dont seem to bother doing simple research to verify.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re perspective is twisted with fear and what appears to be undertones of bigotry towards something you really dont understand.  </p>

<p>Examples of shoving: abortion policies (whose got a conspiracy to control people now?), gay rights (Repeat on control), family values laws and behavior (whose family, not mine - again more control by the christians).  I dont see any of this as fighting back (against what?) as much as fighting to shove a religion down everyone&#39;s throats.  Thats not freedom.</p>

<p>You and cooper are just bought in to a broken Christian propaganda idea  that everything but blind obedience christianity is evil. This idea is old, anti-masonry is around 300 years old, anti-mystery school goes back to 300 AD when the church fell from Christ&#39;s teachings and became a human organization of power and control. Before that it WAS a mystery school. </p>

<p>I dont think christianity is evil, even it is current form but hating a fearing that which is poorly understood is a sign of bigotry, not enlightenment.  Hilariously - this form of Christianity is actually against Christ&#39;s teachings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you see into the windows?  Because when I &quot;stepped away from the computer&quot; and checked out my local lodge, and it appeared they have windows but upon closer inspection the windows have all been boarded up.  </p>

<p>Have you seen into windows?  Have you checked 360?  Because it could be like a shop right? a store front?  Where they have windows in the front and boarded in the back.  That&#39;s how my local lodge looked.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Normally, an official meeting of the Lodge must have at least seven brothers present. Meetings must be held in a room without windows, and often take place on the second or third floor of a building if possible.&quot;</p>

<p>So if they have windows, then it is not a meeting place.  meetings must happen in windowless rooms.  Did you not know that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started out by scrutinizing the secret societies and trying to understand them, but when I was finally able to break through the taboo of criticically examining the Jews, I was amazed by how much more sense I could make of the conspiratorial state of the world.  I used to assume the brotherhoods were on top, but I currently feel that at the very least Freemasonry is a pawn of elite Judaism.  Jewish leaders have even openly stated this was so, and The Protocols say this, too.  I realize they lie a lot, but I think they were being honest about this.</p>

<p>We can agree to disagree on this for now.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, when I first started questioning the Jews, I was way nicer to them.  However, their blatant denial of facts and downright rudeness inadvertently verified much of the criticisms they&#39;ve received.  With them, the enemy became far more tangible and believable.  There was no longer a mysterious unreachable entity to fight.  Hasbarats were right in front of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much.  I am going to try to keep it up.  </p>

<p>As WC said &quot;Most people don&#39;t want to hear the truth because once you hear it, you have to become responsible and most people don&#39;t want to be responsible.&quot; </p>

<p>Everyday I hunger for the truth, as I know William Cooper did.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I plan on it as time permits. The building I work in is pretty old by the &#39;States standards and there are some very interesting parts of the architecture that have, on the surface, very weak ties to some of this stuff. But I&#39;m sure you can say that about a lot of older buldings.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what I believe, but I&#39;ve always been fascinated by anything involving the occult which natually led me to Mr. Cooper. I wish I could find an expert in my area of Missouri to befriend, or at least sit down and converse with for an hour or two. The symbolism that surrounds our every day life is a little frightening.</p>

The symbolism we all see, all the time but no one recognizes is what really gets to me. These symbols, or sigils if you will, do have effects on us. What are those effects? I&#39;m not sure yet, but I know what a lot of people claim. I do believe that there is usually  a meaning behind the meaning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say that it explains Zietgiest 1 what do you mean by that? Christianity is definitely styled after religions with roots that reach all the way back to Babylon and many of the elite secret societies and religions see this, but its more than Judaism having Babylonian roots, Christianity was a created by Vespasian Romans to undermine Messianic Judaism(and I am no fan of Messianic Judaism or any Messianic religions). </p>

<p>ALL I WANNA KNOW IS WHERE WE COME FROM.</p>

<p>You say that this dude thinks they worship Lucifer. Does that mean that you are Christian? IS GOD REAL? THATS THE ONLY REASON I READ ABOUT CONSPIRACIES.</p>

<p>THANKS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is no. Not your specific god(nor Lucifer - I assume you are asking about the god you read about in christianity or in islam or in hindusim, or one of those particular religious deities). Whether or not the christian deity or the muslim deity or the hindu deity or the zoroastrian deity or zeus is real has no bearing on whether there is or is not a god. </p>

<p>There probably is some spiritual principle within human beings and in the universe - but within these systems, it has nothing to do with our mainstream religions(and in fact they claim to have provided those, and you can see the connections inside the doctrines and mythologies to these religions to the ancient mystery religion claiming to have spawned them) - to these people, in this philosophy, &quot;lucifer&quot; is just an allegory(no more real than Zeus - but what he REPRESENTS is the real thing - <em>you have to understand the distinction, &quot;lucifer&quot; is just a pretense hiding the substance - the meaning behind it</em> just like &quot;Prometheus&quot; is just a pretense, the SUBSTANCE behind the story of Prometheus is abstract, it has nothing to do with &#39;a god named Prometheus and believing in him and worshiping to him&#39;, to them, Lucifer is just an abstract symbol for something more real hidden behind it(a system of thought, philosophy, idea, or concept) masked under the guise of &quot;a god&quot; or &quot;a supernatural entity&quot; - not an actual god or deity they pray to(that&#39;s what idiotic gothic teenagers do, and what people who have zero insight into what is actually going on here or what these actual philosophies are think is going on). Anyway, Prometheus &quot;stole fire from the gods&quot;(see, that&#39;s the literal, exoteric story which isn&#39;t really true - it&#39;s just an allegory for something else which is more real and substantive and higher - an allegory for &#39;created a light which was not there before - which is what these people believe they do and are a part of - the light of human intellectual/spiritual enlightenment, the light of reason and intellect in an otherwise dark, profane world&#39;), this is much like what Lucifer &quot;did&quot; by &quot;rebelling against the god&quot; in the mythological system of Christianity - these people are rebelling against nature, they are going to perfect that which was left imperfect by nature, and nature itself, through the understanding of nature, the laws of nature, and of man himself, even back in ancient Egypt, this is what they thought and knew(CORRECTLY) would give them power OVER nature and the power to recreate everything in a less primitive way - essentially becoming gods themselves.</p>

<p>Do you see how this relates to the story of &quot;Lucifer&quot; as an allegory? It&#39;s not actually about an actual deity named lucifer actually rebelling against some god in heaven and being worshiped - that is just an allegorical representation of a more real, abstract, semispiritual/philosophical concept masked under the guise of something exoteric(the story of a literal god or goddess and it&#39;s mythos).</p>

<p>Think of it this way - before christianity - the exact same concept/idea was represented using the god Prometheus, but no one within the mystery schools or the philosophical schools actually believed they were &quot;worshiping a real god called Prometheus&quot;(THAT&#39;S WHAT THE IGNORANT PUBLIC WAS TAUGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE DEEPER MYSTERIES OF LIFE AND THEY CONSTANTLY DESIRE A GOD THEY CAN IDENTIFY WITH TO WORSHIP, WHO THEY CAN JUST &#39;DO THE RIGHT RITUAL&#39; TO GAIN FAVOR WITH, WHO WILL PROMISE THEM EASY ANSWERS TO INFINITELY MORE COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND QUESTIONS -- because they are not capable of understanding anything deeper, the public in all ages never really want a GOD, they want something just like them, like the christian god who &quot;wants things&quot;, &quot;gets angry&quot;, &quot;tests you&quot;, &quot;rewards you&quot;, &quot;punishes you&quot;, and comes down to earth and walks on 2 legs just like you).</p>

<p>Bill Cooper takes things which are abstract re-presentations of something else in the form of &quot;gods&quot;, &quot;goddesses&quot;, &quot;the sun&quot;, and takes them literally - because he was born and raised in a place with Christianity as the major religion, so he takes everything he reads and hears in that context, even after realizing most of his religion was bullshit, he still couldn&#39;t get past the ideas and the literal stories to make some sense of life and give him a reference point beyond human existence which was familiar to him which he had &quot;faith&quot; in which made him feel good - just like a muslim feels good worshiping his god rather than &#39;jesus as god&#39;, or a Hindu feels good doing rituals to one of the aspects of Brahma.</p>

<p>You people(not you Conwizzlo, but others) would be looked at as SO STUPID by those within &quot;the mysteries&quot; for sitting here thinking they take this stuff seriously in the way that you think they do. It&#39;s WAY beyond what you think it is. It&#39;s WAY beyond &#39;worshiping jesus&#39; or &#39;worshiping lucifer&#39; - you guys all your life have been exposed to nothing but the exoteric, literal, blunt, dumb ideas like this in religions, when really, it is all esoteric and philosophical to the point of almost being a more advanced science than you could even imagine, fitting into real &quot;science&quot;, psychology, spirituality, &#39;mysticism&#39;, etc. - but it all has it&#39;s basis in REASON and intellect - which is another 2 things that &quot;lucifer&quot; or &quot;prometheus&quot; or FIRE(eg, what <strong>the sun</strong> is and brings, what prometheus &#39;stole from the gods to give to man&#39;, what even the NAME &quot;Lucifer&quot; is -- *lucifer means LIGHTBRINGER</p>

<p>Do you see? It has nothing to do with a prometheus or lucifer, it has to do with what they are used by man to RE-PRESENT under the guise of a symbol. That is what masonry is all about. To think as Bill Cooper does that they are actually &quot;luciferian satanist satan worshipers who hate the good lord jesus&quot; is fucking ridiculous. People like him oversimplify things to such a point that no one who actually knows what they are talking about here could take him seriously.</p>

<p>Sorry Conwizzle, there is no simple answer to &quot;IS GOD REAL?&quot; - but listen, the idea of a christian Jehovah like you read in the bible almost certainly is not(it&#39;s just another part of this same system), the idea of a muslim Allah you read about in the quran almost certainly is not, the idea of Zeus almost certainly is not, the idea of Ahura Mazda and Ahriman almost certainly are not - but that doesn&#39;t mean there can&#39;t be a god or something higher - it just means that the various gods of mankind are exactly that ..just gods of man on planet earth that we come up with and worship for a while and then move on to the next one as the ages progress.</p>

<p>If you are looking for an answer to &quot;IS CHRISTIANITY TRUE&quot; - the answer is yes and no. It&#39;s the same thing I&#39;ve been describing with Prometheus and Lucifer - it&#39;s not actually about what it is written about anymore than the story of Prometheus is actually ABOUT a &quot;god named prometheus who stole fire for the use of mankind from the other gods&quot;. There is truth hidden behind a literal story which itself is meant only to convey that to those with eyes to see it(that is the true meaning of the word &quot;occult&quot;) - and for the rest, is meant to give them a little glimpse and a literal story they can relate to and believe in in order to keep a society functioning and progressing and organized under the guise of a priesthood who claims to &quot;represent said god on Earth&quot; and &quot;gives divine authority to rule to X king over X land&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all very complex and nuanced, but no, don&#39;t worry about it, this god is not the god you are looking for. The christian god is not the god you are looking for Conwizzlo - no more than Lucifer is or Prometheus is the god you are looking for. Neither are any of the others that men claim to offer you in a convenient prepackaged, canned, easy, formulaic pre-fabricated ideology. You&#39;re going to have to use your own mind to discern your own way through life like the creator intended - if there actually is a creator - you were given a mind for a reason, you were given autonomy and independence for a reason - don&#39;t fucking use it to fit yourself in to a herd or belief system claiming the opposite &quot;that god wants you to stop using your own mind and just come fit your mind into a box provided for it by us, the priesthood, like billions of other people have&quot;.</p>

<p>To answer you question, No, I am not.  </p>

<p>In my opinion, if there is a God, maybe he made ALL religions because He knew people learn and begin to believe in different ways.  </p>

<p>I have not done nearly enough research into the subject of the bible and other holy books, and I don&#39;t believe in listening to pastors or anything like that.  </p>

<p>I also know that in the New World Order, no one will be allowed to believe in God.  Any god.  Period.  And that&#39;s not freedom.  And I will fight for your right to believe in whatever god you do or do not believe in.

    <div class="md"><p>NO, I want you to cite some evidence.  You reference Bill Cooper&#39;s explanations as if they&#39;re sources.  His is just one man&#39;s interpretation.
Did you look up all the sources he cites?  Some of which don&#39;t exist, are quoted out of context or are interpreted liberally to say the least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm.  You think you can really understand how the world works when your not even willing to listen to a unique perspective on the subject of God and christianity.  </p>

<p>Its not like Christianity has been in the world much longer than you know certain governments and/or leaders and its not like there is any history in that religion, that may or may not be based on truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you read way to much into what i say, and have no idea who i am or what my past experience with the christian religion have been.</p>

<p>Like i said, i wanted to hear what this man had to say, but how can you believe a word he says when you can not accept the basis of his reasons for saying it. I used to be a born again christian, i was a group leader in my church. I have studied religion(especially Christianity) from the spiritual, philosophical, and historical prospective. </p>

<p>you really need to stop talking like you are all high and mighty because you posted a couple of links from some christian nutter, who might happen to have stumbled on a truth or two.  I would love to learn more about the mystery Babylonian religion, as i have made many connections between the various religions of the world in my own studies. however, when a man denounces one religion as the evil ruling class of the world, but then espouses another religion(which is really just a corruption of the same ideas found in every religion) it is hard to take anything else he says seriously.</p>

<p>as i said, i am already familiar with many of the concepts put forth. I just don&#39;t need to hear it from a christian nutter who thinks his own version of religion is the only truth. it is asinine to think you can reach and awaken people by spouting religious lies as truth.</p>

<p><strong>edit: that being said, i do think the points raised by him, from what i have read in the reddit comments anyway, are close to the truth. I just wish he presented it in a way that was less obviously corrupted by his own personal bias.</strong></p>

<p>But if Bill Cooper revealed more information about the mysteries than anyone else in history (as far as im concerned, not including those &quot;within the mysteries&quot;), I am curious as to where you&#39;ve gotten your info from so that I may learn more!  That&#39;s all I&#39;m trying to do here is learn.  So if you didn&#39;t get your info from Bill, who did you get it from?</p>

<p>I am not talking all high and mighty because I posted a couple of links, I am talking confidently because I can&#39;t tell you how many people message me saying that Bill is wrong and that I am wrong for supporting him <strong>that haven&#39;t even listened to 2 hours of his broadcasts let alone 200 hours</strong>.  </p>

<p>Its not that I am better than anyone because I am not.  But if you haven&#39;t listened to the mystery babylon series (or read the transcript i provided), or you haven&#39;t really listened to Bill Cooper, truly listened then why are you posting in my post which is on the two subjects?</p>

<p>Or (and I love this) &quot;ya i got through a couple of hours but I just couldn&#39;t get over the religion thing!&quot;</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to listen to him, don&#39;t listen to him.  But don&#39;t go posting in a post to DO WITH HIM if you have nothing of his to reference. (i don&#39;t necessarily mean you wtfhomie)</p>

<p>He sources his research in a way that makes it easy for YOU to look it up and research it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to make my opinions more factual.  I&#39;m trying to get people to listen to Bill Cooper as he sources PROOF and EVIDENCE of this plot.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine a lot of the info i have read comes from Mr cooper indirectly. I can&#39;t really tell you where exactly I have gathered my info from, as it is scattered across the internet (youtube, blogs, reddit, and other places) <strong>the problem i have is in his presentation, and personal bias.</strong> It is the same reason i don&#39;t listen to Rush Limbaugh, even though i agree with many of his views.  </p>

<p><strong>i posted in this thread because you asked in the title &quot;did anyone actually listen?&quot;</strong> I was just giving you my honest answer. I said before, i don&#39;t think he is necessarily wrong, just that the show itself is bad. I am of the belief that Christianity is just another extension of the control of the population via religion. Another tool of those in power to keep the population stupid and unaware.</p>

<p>when you look at it from an <strong>atheistic perspective</strong>, there is not much difference between the major religions. The similarities between the creator (father god, sun god Ra, the horned god, Allah) the mother (Isis, the virgin Mary, the tipple goddess) and the conqueror of death (Osiris, Jesus, the enlightenment of self) are easy to pick out.</p>

<p><strong>I think religion as a whole, <em>not to be confused with self spirituality</em>, is just a tool those in power use to control the masses.</strong> they take that basic need for understanding, also known as curiosity, inherent in all people capable of self reflection and provide an easy answer. that need to connect to those around us, and feel that we understand our world through confirmation of ideas within our social group, is twisted into a sweeping world view that separates us from each other.</p>

<p>so while i don&#39;t discount what the man says, and <strong>i did follow each thread you posted</strong>, i just couldn&#39;t bring myself to listen to the show directly. I did however enjoy reading the discussion it started here, and on other sites. I just understand my own personal bias, and that i would not enjoy listening to a man talk about being awake, in that non sheeple way, when i could never hear him as anything but another sheeple due to his own narrow (in my mind) world view. It is hard to credit someone as speaking the unfiltered truth when you feel that every other point he makes is based on lies and bias.</p>

<p>now i admit that <strong>i could be wrong</strong>, the bible, and the Gnostic books, have very good philosophical points. The way they set up a society is arguably mostly good, but in the end they were put together by men who directly benefited in personal power by spreading the ideas detailed in them. like every religion, they may have started from a true and good source, but they have been corrupted over time by those in power to become nothing more than population control tools. </p>

<p><strong>Edit: TL;DR --  Didn&#39;t listen because i disagree with religion as a whole, so listening to one man denounce others for their religion, while espousing his own as truth, does not appeal to me.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got sources?  Of where he specifically recanted his statements?</p>

<p>I know one statment he recanted was his belief in Extra Terrestrials.  In the beginning, he said, he believe the alien threat was real and that actually opened a lot of doors for him.  </p>

<p>But he later said he believed <strong><em>that the alien threat was just a ploy by the leaders of this world to eventually bring down a false flag event to unite the world</em></strong></p>

<p>This man searched for the truth and GAVE IT TO US FOR FREE (or almost free, more free than most).  The man lost his leg FOR THE TRUTH, his hosting radio station WAS BURNED DOWN, his family recieved DEATH THREATS, and yet this mother fucker still had the balls to get on the radio and GIVE US THE TRUTH.</p>

<p>What are you dude, 12?  You think everythings going to be alright? Bill cooper is a smoking gun proof example that searching for the truth is a messy fucking journey.  </p>

<p>You scream at me for promoting WC&#39;s research.  Where is YOUR research?</p>

<p>You do everything here except promote the truth.  Where are your facts?  </p>

<p>You sir, sound like a raging lunatic and I am sorry something happened in your life to make you like this.  But if you actually gave Bill cooper a chance, you may learn something.  </p>
