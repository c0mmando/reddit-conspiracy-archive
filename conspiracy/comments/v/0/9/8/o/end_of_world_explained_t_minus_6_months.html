        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m tired of being freaked out and alone on this, it would really help if you were freaked out too. Maybe we can figure this out together. </p>

<p>I have an MS in neuroscience, and I am not using any of my scientific understanding, only patterns I&#39;ve discovered that I can&#39;t keep to myself anymore. </p>

<p>Now, I didn&#39;t freak out when I heard the Mayan calendar ends Dec. 21st, 2012. Maybe the Mayan calendar guy got carpal tunnel from etching almost two thousand years ahead, decided to bang a hot, topless mayan chick and call it a day. </p>

<p>I am a science guy, so when Einstein predicted the earth&#39;s magnetic field reversal was close at hand, like 2012, I took notice. But then how does that connect to end of the world shit?</p>

<p>Then I read about all these rich assholes and our gov&#39;t building underground bunkers, Denver airport, in particular. Makes me think, hmmm, what the fuck do they know that I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Then, bam, scary-ass shit. In 1983 a <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/127658362.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Dec+30%2C+1983&amp;author=By+Thomas+O%5C%27Toole+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post++%281974-Current+file%29&amp;desc=Mystery+Heavenly+Body+Discovered&amp;pqatl=top_retrieves">Washington Post article</a> detailed a planet discovery, Planet X. So what? Well, the idea is this motherfuckin&#39; planet comes back around after thousands of years and wreaks havic in our solar system based on gravitational pull (objects attract each other, like why the moon revolves around the earth and will throw shit out of whack). </p>

<p>But then Planet X disappeared and now there&#39;s this other planet, Nibiru. Now, I don&#39;t know the difference b/w the two or if they&#39;re one in the same, I just know this, if a big-ass, motherfucking planet is about to orbit our system, it&#39;s supposed to cause the sun to have a polar reversal. Here&#39;s a scary ass video of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxRQEB2iCNA">planet approaching</a>. Maybe &#39;chem trails&#39; are designed to hide this red-ass fireball hurling at us. </p>

<p>Okay, so what? Well, here&#39;s where I&#39;m scared (maybe it&#39;s the extra shot in my iced coffee). What if this <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/13/utilities-operations-entergy-palisades-idUSL3E8HD8G320120613">Michigan Nuclear power plant shutdown</a>, which was on the heels of OCDTRIGGER&#39;s post about it being a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/uqlq9/reddit_i_think_there_is_a_giant_nuclear_coverup/">cover up</a> is due to solar flares? The report was that solar x-ray monitors were picking up massive spikes, and not of a nuclear leak or what not. So maybe this fits in nicely with the big-ass-motherfucking-planet-about-to-orbit-and-fuck-shit-up-theory. </p>

<p>If PBS is right in stating that the earth&#39;s magnetic field is protecting the earth from <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/magnetic/">deadly radiation</a>, and that a reversal will lead to imminent fucking death unless you&#39;re hiding from the sun, like in a bunker, then I want to fucking know if we&#39;re doomed so I can start digging a hole, storing food/water, getting a radiation suit, downloading all my porn to something portable that runs on batteries, buying an uzi to shoot you when you try to take my food/water/porn, etc. etc. </p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks everybody! This has made me feel better about dying. It&#39;s the alone part that really gets me, so as long as most of you die too, it&#39;s not so bad. </p>

<p>EDIT#2: This is serious shit. <a href="http://thesatirewire.blogspot.com/2012/06/bill-clinton-having-terrible-time.html">This</a> is not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stay calm. Fear is subliminally implanted into your mind every-fucking-day-all-day. &quot;They&quot; want you to panic. It is the ultimate excuse to place humans into detention camps &quot;for our safety&quot;. If you&#39;re smart enough to hide your bunker well you won&#39;t need guns. I highly recommend against purchasing any. You will just flag yourself for surveillance more than you already have by posting this. Any purchases must be cash only. Otherwise, they will see you stocking up, and you&#39;ll be flagged for that. </p>

<p>You may find solace in another theory of nuclear plants failing, and shutting down suddenly all over the world. The United States and Israel created a super computer virus so strong, that it is now out of control and spreading. </p>

<p>As for the end of the world, no one really knows what is going to happen. Many shamans all over the world are certain that our ancient ancestors are going to return. Your soul will be saved if you are a kind, compassionate, loving human being. No one really knows what that means either, but it certainly does sound a little biblical. I think there is a certain truth to these ancient text, but the Illuminati has manipulated them so much they really don&#39;t make much sense to anyone anymore. </p>

<p>Take it with a grain of salt, take a deep breath, and relax. If you are really worried about the end nearing, &quot;repent&quot;. Go out of your way to help as many humans as you possibly can. Spread love. Spread joy. Your mind possess more power than you could ever imagine. </p>

<p>To an extent we really are living in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The life we&#39;ve been told to live since childhood isn&#39;t a life at all.</p>

<p>&quot;Everything is nothingness, and nothingness is bliss. Rest, and be kind.&quot;</p>

<p>I love you, and many others do too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to struggle with this too. I couldn&#39;t understand why some reach enlightenment quicker than others. A friend explained it to me as a type of Universal Karma, or a learning curve. Some of us reach that peak due to us being &quot;old souls&quot;. Take comfort in that eventually all of us will hit that learning curve. Maybe not now, but eventually a person will at some point in their life.

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree wholeheartedly. This is spoken like a true unassuming optimist. I believe that &quot;enlightenment&quot; is entirely subjective and it shouldn&#39;t be sought after in the first place. I see it more as a goal rather than a finality, and also as something that people should care about with great passion. Without care or passion, how could you expect to bring your full potential into this world? How could you expect to become who you really are meant to become or attain &quot;enlightenment&quot; as you guys call it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rea.. Really? The Mayan Calendar ends because it is cyclically constructed and intended to repeat. In fact, this isn&#39;t the first time the Mayan Calendar has ended. By the same logic, the world should end every December 31st because that&#39;s when our Calendar ends..</p>

<p>Underground bunkers, especially in Colorado, are built in strategic locations and for many different reasons. One of those reasons might be the threat of nuclear war, another might be the threat of massive war. There are so many threats out there that call for strategic underground buildings and bunkers, it&#39;s really simple minded to correlate them with the end of the world to them.. or that they know something we don&#39;t and are preparing. </p>

<p>Planet X? Nibiru? A planet causing the sun to have a polar reversal? Come on man.. Okay, maybe you meant the Earth undergoing a polar reversal. The first thing you should know about Earth&#39;s polar shift possibilities is that it happens often. There is evidence of this in the Mid Atlantic Ridge. The second thing you should know is that its a long, drawn out process and doesn&#39;t happen over night. Hell, it doesn&#39;t even happen over the course of a hundred years..</p>

<p>When you speak of Nibiru and Planet X, this is where misinformation really goes off its rocker.. You say that it was discovered in 1983, but this is a lie. I challenge you to find the original documentation of said discovery. The media was reporting about a NASA infrared survey that found many objects in space, but not one of them ended up being a planet. The truth is.. the origin of the Nibiru misinformation came about in the 1970&#39;s. Someone wrote a book that claimed the Sumerians knew about a 12th planet and called it Nibiru. His evidence was found in ancient texts, which he translated. The only problem is that the book has been massively debunked and proven to be severely mistranslated. Another very big problem with this theory is that actual translations of Sumerian texts show that they only knew about 5 planets, and they didn&#39;t even know that they orbited around the sun. In fact, nobody knew that the planets orbited around the sun until Greece came about. Oh but wait, there is a final nail in this Nibiru coffin.. The end of the world stories involving Nibiru state that that all planets are going to be aligned perfectly on December 21st and that the gravitational extreme will will cause everything to go out of whack and cause polar shifts and all kinds of other the theories.. except the only problem is that all the planets nearly align every few hundred years naturally. Perfect alignment is impossible due to the tilted nature of the planets orbits.</p>

<p>If you really are a man of science like you say.. I beg you, please...... when you read something or watch something that makes very outlandish claims, research research research research. You need to read and research these claims yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know that is but I assume you didn&#39;t read the article I added to my comment. If you did you would have noticed that the agency who produced the original research that your Washington Post link refers to have conducted two further studies and have proven that there is no huge planetary object on the edge of the solar system. Seriously, read the article thoroughly, take notes as you read if you have to and read the original research paper then then the two subsequent studies provided by the same agency. You will realise how foolish you are being. I type this fully aware that you may be out for some trolling kicks but it worth trying to point you in the right direction on the off-chance that you really do believe this bollocks.</p>

<em>&quot;A heavenly body possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this solar system has been found in the direction of the constellation Orion by an orbiting telescope aboard the U.S. infrared astronomical satellite.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trolling along are we? The Washington Post article never broke any news of a giant planet hurling towards us. The fact that you misinterpret an article that&#39;s only 1 sentence long speaks highly of your argument. Please re-read the article again, the whole sentence. It does not say that a giant planet is hurling towards us. It only states that an object was found, could maybe be large, could maybe be close enough to be in our solar system. Now if you read the information I linked to you, you would see that the IRAS not only found 1 object, it found hundreds of thousands of them.</p>

<p>NASA has never been involved with space tourism, it only talks about it as a possibility. You&#39;re thinking of Russia.</p>

To perpetuate an idea like this is kin to perpetuating the idea of a flying spaghetti monster just because someone postulated it even though there is no evidence supporting it whereas there is no evidence against it as well.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you referring to the Pioneer Anomaly? Unexplained apparent deceleration? Gravitational force as the cause of the anomaly has been challenged (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2947">http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2947</a> &amp; <a href="http://hindawi.com/journals/phys/2012/469095/ref/">http://hindawi.com/journals/phys/2012/469095/ref/</a>) because of no apparent effect to the orbit of Neptunian satellites. (He says if the anomaly was gravitational its effect would be large; impossible not to notice.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is what I was referring to. I&#39;m pretty sure that when this was first detected that one of the offered possibilities was a cosmic body - I could be wrong, but back in the early 80s I could swear to reading this or learning it in school. At any rate, you are right - after looking it up I see no mention, and since this anomalous deceleration seems to occur across all craft, well...</p>

<p>Anyway, in looking this up, I came across other things, such as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/01/science/evidence-for-planet-x-evaporates-in-spotlight-of-new-research.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;src=pm">this</a> which discredits earlier evidence for such a body, and much more recent mentions of Whitmire and others who point to new evidence (? perhaps tangential or inferred only).</p>

<p>So, there is a source for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the Planet X, Nibiru was supposed to have come around in 2003, I was concerned about it for a while and maybe it&#39;s real considering historical accounts. </p>

<p>But I think those videos from 2010 of Nibiru approaching would have been way more documented in 2012. And the fact that it was so large then would mean it would be gigantic now in the sky. </p>

<p>It might be real, and might cause havoc but I don&#39;t think we will see it in our lifetimes.</p>

<p>On an interesting note, Plato speaking to the Egyptian Priests as described here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Manly P. Hall, Plato, whose real name was Aristocles, was initiated in the mysteries in Egypt at the age of 49. His tale of Atlantis appears in Timaeus, in which Critias tells Socrates how, visiting the Egyptian capital Plato’s ancestor Solon (c. 640BC) was told by a priest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Oh, Solon, Solon, you Greeks are all children, and there is no such thing as an old Greek. … You are all young in mind; you have no belief rooted in old tradition and no knowledge hoary with age. … In our temples we have preserved from earliest times a written record of any great or splendid achievement or notable event which has come to our ears, whether it occurred in your part of the world or here or anywhere else; whereas with you and others, <strong>writing and the other necessities of civilization have only just been developed when the periodic scourge of the deluge descends, and spares none but the unlettered and uncultured, so that you have to begin again like children, in complete ignorance of what happened in our part of the world or in yours in early times</strong>. So these genealogies of your own people which you were just recounting are little more than children&#39;s stories. … The age of our institutions is given in our sacred records as eight thousand years …...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets think about what this all might mean for a moment. What do you mean by &quot;end of the world?&quot; A &quot;world&quot; can be any number of things, from your relativistic views of the world you live in to the culture and where you life on Earth. So what might an &quot;end&quot; be, maybe a end of the actual physical planet, well no amount of preparation will save you, and my suggestion would be to find a good spot to sit and watch. This could be caused by any number of natural phenomena, but once again there isn&#39;t anything that can be done. But what if its a world view that is ended, what if the world as we see it as a society and a species that might change? Causes could be just about anything, political and social change, Climate and ideology change, religious or spiritual change, or even maybe something more exotic like Aliens or the dead coming back to life. But it might also be something small, like a natural reaction to climate change and the shifts the planet naturally goes though. Or perhaps its some unknown social event via a part of the human experience/psyche that allows us to share subtle thoughts subconsciously.</p>

<p>The problem is that its likely not a single thing, but a collection. Vast powers little known or poorly controlled are almost certainly what is happening. So how does this effect you, is there anything to fear? What should I do? And there is no right answer, your particular circumstances will dictate your response. If it is the end of the world your children will look to you, so gather information and make a smart decision for your family, and not an emotional one.</p>

<p>This is how I feel about the whole end of the world. If it happens or is going to happen, what will you do? Better to accept the end, death and all, than to freak out and have your last moments be sear panic and fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a book years ago called the path of the poles by Charles Hapgood and he predicted a polar shift around the turn of the century and attributed this to the earth developing a wobble in rotation causing it to slide off axis and the poles would shift. Not necessarily north becomes south and vice versa but polar north would move. His theory was that it would happen fast once it began and we would have dealt with the tidal waves and oceans moving before we figured it out. </p>

<p>I read this about 13 years ago so I might have forgotten some other info but it seemed scientific and even plausible even though his timeline was a little off. Even if it happened within a hundred years of the turn of the century his prediction was pretty close. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Biggest problems would be things caused by changes in the spinning core (thus magnetic field), earthquakes, tsunamis, huge storm systems, loss of communications and electronics. I heard another theory by Owsley Stanley on how some mega storm could potentially bring on the next ice age by spweing out liquid helium I believe in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9cApK1O6D0">this interview.</a> It is a little lengthy but he talks about some cool ideas I have not heard before. </p>
