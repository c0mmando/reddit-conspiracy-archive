        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You are WASTING YOUR TIME.</p>

<p>Secret societies are secret for a reason.  You will never find all the information you need to point and say &quot;AHA!&quot;.  The bilderbergs, illuminati, masons, etc... all of the information provided on the net about them can be (and is) controlled.</p>

<p>STOP wasting your time and focus on the issues you can SEE.  Here are the fundamental truths to help guide you:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Knowledge is not power unless paired with rationality. Belief is extremely dangerous when not paired with logical conclusions.</p></li>
<li><p>Agnosticism is the answer: We don&#39;t know if there is 1 god, no god, 1,000 gods, if we came from an ancient alien species, or if WE are gods. Stop dicking around about it and use science to produce your best guesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Money is all corrupting.  It is an ancient concept which keeps you in line.  We DON&#39;T need it anymore; we have the internet.  A resource based economy is the best solution provided now. (Look up Jacque Fresco and the Venus Project.)  The Venus Project is NOT a Utopian society.  If anything, it&#39;s social anarchy incorporated with evolutionary technology.  It IS viable. <strong>LOOK INTO IT.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Your attention is your most prized possession. Even though you may not be actively attending to stimuli, neurons still perceive those stimuli and, thus, ALTER YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS.  Genetics mutate and humans have the ability of neurogenesis.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Added per user request for 4</strong> <em>(For those with more advanced Neuroscience Degrees, feel free to chime in.)</em></p>

<pre><code> Many are enslaved and are unaware. Literally, the Synapses in the brain react to ALL stimuli, not just those within our Active Attention. The more these Synapses are stimulated, the more Receptors they build within either side of the synaptic gap. Further, cognitive rigidity is caused by repetitious use of particular pathways. (Granted, there are millions.) The more you follow along a particular neuro-pathway, the less likely you are to deviate from it.  Every advertisement you see, read, or hear is effecting the operation of your consciousness. They know this. Thus, they provide us with visions of a bloody revolution (The Matrix, The Patriot, Gladiator, V for Vendetta, Equilibrium, A Clockwork Orange, Brazil, and Fight Club... to name a few.)

 Thus, many cry &quot;Give me liberty, or give me death!&quot;... and death is exactly what you will receive. The difference between the American Revolution and now is that they have the ability to pin-point any decent and make it disappear.

 As Gandhi, MLK, JFK, Einstein, and many others have pointed out, violence truly is not the answer. Rational problems require rational solutions. Violence begets violence. Thus, transversely, peace will beget peace. This can be seen within Neuroscience.  Mirror Neurons are those which fire due to any stimuli which is sensed (mostly centered in the somatosensory region of the parietal cortex). If we are trained in violence, violence will occur. Again, Cognitive Rigidity, or repetitious thinking, is the result of Neurons firing along the same pathways numerous times. Thus, repeat violence, violent tendencies occur. Transversely, train and repeat peace, and peace will occur.

 The frontal cortex&#39;s main function is that of an INHIBITOR. It inhibits our emotions and allows us to rationalize them. However, in times of extreme sensory stimulation, this inhibitor may be over-powered by our lymbic system (our emotions). This is why crowds of disorganized/pissed off people will blow up when someone throws a fist. If you&#39;re the government, this means hiring a few people to start some fights in peaceful protests.

 Also, please look into something called Cognitive SELDON (which was originally from Sandia National Laboratory). It is a social simulator which is capable of rendering a populations reaction to any released document. Thus, documents can be fed through it and checked to see if they will produce the desired effect. I know because I helped design it... :/ For that, I apologize.  The good news is, when I left the project it still had a lot of flaws.  It was still able to match readings by human subjects, however...
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this rings true with you.  The Grand Illumination is coming.  <em>Don&#39;t let it go south.</em></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Some people asked for more information. Here you go. <em>(Reposted from below with a few things added in.)</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Question EVERYTHING. &quot;Why&quot; is your most valuable question. HOWEVER: (#2)</p></li>
<li><p>Do not make assumptions (again, belief). For example, many theories have come up about 9/11. I cannot tell you much about that event one way or another other than this: Do you really think that &#39;they&#39;d&#39; make the mistake of demolishing buildings in the open? Wouldn&#39;t it be more logical to simply insert a radical leader into a country and ushered him along until he attacked the US (perhaps, specifically, the towers?)? A lot less trace-able and plus it keeps people guessing. So, bottom line, stop looking at these groups and analyse what you do know.</p></li>
<li><p>The Internet can connect us all. Check out &quot;Ghost in a Shell&quot;. Given some additional stem cell research, research into neurogenesis (Something our brains naturally do.), and the internet, the concept of immortality is not so esoteric anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>Any system which can be made can be unmade. Thus, any law created can be (and will be) broken. Thus, we have the ability to fix the situation we are in. However, this is where it gets tricky: if the understanding of morality (something based in human evolution), that which should define law, becomes so convoluted that people assume that they cannot understand it, they will give up and give in to belief. Additionally, we are battling against many psychological tendencies of people: Cognitive Rigidity, The Bystander Effect, Obedience to Authority, etc. However, again, these can also be used as tools to form a resistance.  In the end, people will listen to what they experience and understand.  The key, then, is to build a society which educates itself and has no laws... because morality, as a concept, is understood.  <a href="http://thevenusproject.com/en/the-venus-project/resource-based-economy">See the Venus Project.</a></p></li>
<li><p>The key is to provide a message to the people which everyone can agree with.</p></li>
<li><p>My Grandfather told me this... and I find it very... un-scientific... and I&#39;d really rather not post it, but I&#39;ll put it out there.  Do not fear 12/21/2012. Whoever &quot;they&quot; are, they WANT you to fear it. It will be some sort of spiritual shift. Free yourself from electronics, alcohol, smokes... all mind altering substances (especially on that day, if not before).  You will need your full attention that day. (Again... probably the most &#39;belief&#39; oriented thing I have.)</p></li>
<li><p>BEWARE OF MUSIC AND MOVIES. E.g. Lady Gaga &quot;Born This Way&quot; = You don&#39;t change; you&#39;re defined by your genetics. You are not controlled by the record industry, media, and all other stimuli around you. False. &quot;Marry The Night&quot; - Things went wrong in my life, so I said &#39;fuck it&#39; and pursued my own egotistical dreams despite what everyone else thinks. She is the embodiment of the over-active ego. As for movies, I mentioned that above.</p></li>
<li><p>Marijuana and LSD can alter your perceptions of reality and so can serve as eye-openers. HOWEVER, Marijuana is extremely dangerous in that different strains have been shown to reduce motivation as well as inhibit short term memory. I fear the day it becomes legal; talk about another fantastic way to enslave the mind. LSD, on the other hand, I&#39;ve yet to find clinical evidence about any negative effects.</p></li>

<li><p>Can you provide more information about Acoustic Space?  And no, intuition is a product of your subconscious. It is a marriage between science and art which is needed (A Second Renaissance) because people use both parts of the brain.  Yes, there are fundamental differences between the halves (e.g. the right is attuned to slower frequencies of sound than the left... as I recall), but both share many common functions.  </p>

<p>You need your right just as much as you need your left; use both. Science has been corrupted, but it is the answer. In the end, all we have are intelligent guesses.  But now we have a means to bring those guesses together into one idea; we have the internet.</p>

<p>I majored in Psychology with a focus in Cognitive/Behavioral Neuroscience. I would be willing to answer your questions as best as possible, but please know that your knowledge of  psychology probably has many faults as many wrongful assumptions have been made over the years.</p></li>
<li><p>I have been watching Jacque. I care not for who he is, but more for the ideals he stands for. Psychologically, his plan is sound.  Seriously, what kind of advice is &quot;watch out for movements beginning in the letter V&quot;?  Names are meaningless. If it&#39;s rational, then it&#39;s rational.  If it&#39;s flawed, then we fix it. Focus not on useless information.</p></li>

<p><a href="http://www.rense.com/general30/illuminatidefector.htm">http://www.rense.com/general30/illuminatidefector.htm</a></p>

<p>*A woman who was raised in the Illuminati cult describes a powerful secret organization comprising one per cent of the U.S. population that has infiltrated all social institutions and is covertly preparing a military takeover. Her revelations cast the &quot;war on terror&quot; and &quot;homeland security&quot; in their true light. </p>

<p>&quot;Svali&quot; is the pseudonym of the woman, age 45, who was a mind &quot;programmer&quot; for the cult until 1996. She was the sixth head trainer in the San Diego branch and had 30 trainers reporting to her. She has risked her life to warn humanity of the Illuminati´s covert power and agenda. </p>

<p>She describes a sadistic Satanic cult led by the richest and most powerful people in the world. It is largely homosexual and pedophile, practises animal sacrifice and ritual murder. It works &quot;hand in glove&quot; with the CIA and Freemasonry. It is Aryan supremacist (German is spoken at the top) but welcomes Jewish apostates. It controls the world traffic in drugs, guns, pornography and prostitution. It may be the hand behind political assassination, and &quot;terrorism,&quot; including Sept. 11, the Maryland sniper and the Bali bomb blast. </p>

<p>It has infiltrated government on a local, state and national level; education and financial institutions; religion and the media. Based in Europe, it plans a &quot;world order&quot; that will make its earlier attempts, Nazism and Communism, look like picnics. One other detail: these people are not happy. </p>

<p>Svali´s courageous testimony explains why our children are no longer taught civic values, why they are being habituated to homosexuality and violence, and why our &quot;culture&quot; is descending into nihilism and sexual depravity. It raises the possibility that George W. Bush and his Administration are Illuminists and much of the world &quot;elite&quot; is engaged in a mind-boggling criminal conspiracy. </p>

<p>In March 2000, Svali began writing a monthly column for survivors of Illuminati ritual abuse at Suite101.com. In December 2000, H.J. Springer, the editor of CentrExNews,com contacted Svali and conducted an extended 18-part interview with her by email, which is reproduced on line and is copyrighted. </p>

<p>&quot;I am convinced she is the real McCoy,&quot; Springer wrote to me. &quot;I have personally relayed numerous email messages to her from other members -- ritually abused, brainwashed, raped, sexually abused people &amp; you name it -- some of them confirming to me her story. So I have absolutely no doubt that Svali has been part of the Illuminati since childhood.&quot; </p>

<p>I also trust Svali´s testimony because it confirms my intuition and intensive research. Everything fits: from the dead hand that seems to suppress humanity to why Clinton gave secret technology to the Chinese, to persistent reports of concentration camps in the US. It explains why people I know behave in a conspiratorial way. I thank Svali for giving me a frightening but incredible key to understanding the world. </p>

<p>A friend urged me to beware of a hoax and offered to help confirm Svali´s personal story. I accepted. I invite you to read her entire testimony and make up your own mind. Read &quot;Part One&quot; to &quot;Part 18&quot; first, starting at the middle of the list and working up. </p>

<p>With their permission, here are some highlights of Svali´s correspondence with CentrExnews.com´s H.J. Springer. I have also included material from her article &quot;Are the Illuminati Taking Over the World?&quot;*</p>

<p>No but we can start finding them, we got some good leads ;) ... You know I agree with you, but I cant agree with the lack of satisfaction of removing these people from the public and using the methods they like to get the names of the rest ;) Because we dont need them in our world any more.

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve seen, it is all conjecture based on conjecture.  One group of theorists will swear it&#39;s the Masons who rule the world whilst another will say that it&#39;s the Bildebergs who control the Masons... and visa-versa.  From the few notes I found in my father&#39;s office left by my grandfather and from my own research, everyone is guessing just like everyone is guessing at the ultimate question; &quot;What are we?&quot;. Is it God? Are there deities? Buddhas? Bodhisattvas? Are we Gods? Are we a God?  We should stop assuming and use science to find our answers because, in the end, science is the only thing which can quantify what we feel and perceive.  The rest is just subjectivity based on belief... which will get us nowhere.  Why else would &#39;they&#39; who control all of network television be airing shows on the History channel about themselves? It is easy to confuse and misguide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How in the world do you expect Statistics, Cognition studies and farming out drugs to fix the problems associated with such a broad problem with apathy and force fed subliminal subjective ignorance to the masses? It&#39;s like you said, people who keep doing the same thing tend to keep doing just that. Patterns of behavior and understanding become nested or burrowed so deep. Some scientists waving around new concepts that few understand are not going to fix what&#39;s wrong. Besides if involves pharms, (Which probably are the only thing that could change so many peoples behavior, I&#39;m not really for it at all, unless it is small doses of DMT to awaken subconscious to the conscious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pervasive Presence </p>

<p>Svali: &quot;The Illuminati are present in every major metropolitan centre in the United States. The Illuminati believe in controlling an area through its: banks and financial institutions (guess how many sit on banking boards? You´d be surprised) Local government: guess how many get elected to local city councils? Law: children are encouraged to go to law school and medical school. Media: others are encouraged to go to journalism school, and members help fund local papers. </p>

<p>Beliefs </p>

<p>Svali: &quot;The Illuminati is a group that practices a form of faith known as &quot;enlightenment&quot;. It is Luciferian, and they teach their followers that their roots go back to the ancient mystery religions of Babylon, Egypt, and Celtic druidism. They have taken what they consider the &quot;best&quot; of each, the foundational practices, and joined them together into a strongly occult discipline. Many groups at the local level worship ancient deities such as &quot;El&quot;, &quot;Baal&quot;, and &quot;Ashtarte&quot;, as well as &quot;Isis and Osiris&quot; and &quot;Set&quot;.... I do know that these people teach and practice evil.&quot; </p>

<p>Weishaupt </p>

<p>Svali: &quot;Weishaupt did not create the Illuminati, they chose him as a figurehead and told him what to write about. The financiers, dating back to the bankers during the times of the Templar Knights who financed the early kings in Europe, created the Illuminati. Weishaupt was their &quot;go fer&quot;, who did their bidding.&quot; </p>

<p>Military Takeover </p>

<p>Svali: &quot;Briefly, each region of the United States has &quot;nerve centres&quot; or power bases for regional activity. The United States has been divided up into seven major geographical regions. Each region has localities within it that contain military compounds and bases that are hidden in remote, isolated areas or on large private estates. </p>

<p>These bases are used intermittently to teach and train generational Illuminati in military techniques, hand- to- hand combat, crowd control, use of arms, and all aspects of military warfare. Why? Because the Illuminists believe that our government, as we know it, as well as the governments of most nations around the world, are destined to collapse. These will be planned collapses, and they will occur in the following ways: </p>

<p>The Illuminati has planned first for a financial collapse that will make the great depression look like a picnic. This will occur through the manoeuvring of the great banks and financial institutions of the world, through stock manipulation, and interest rate changes. Most people will be indebted to the federal government through bank and credit card debt, etc. The governments will recall all debts immediately, but most people will be unable to pay and will be bankrupted. This will cause generalized financial panic, which will occur simultaneously worldwide, as the Illuminists firmly believe in controlling people through finances. </p>

<p>Doesn´t sound pleasant, does it? I don´t know the exact time frame for all of this, and wouldn´t want to even guess. The good news is that if a person is debt-free, owes nothing to the government or credit debt, and can live self sufficiently, they may do better than others. I would invest in gold, not stocks, if I had the income. Gold will once again be the world standard, and dollars will be pretty useless (remember after the Civil War? Our money will be worth about what confederate money was after the collapse). </p>

<p>Next there will be a military takeover, region by region, as the government declares a state of emergency and martial law. People will have panicked, there will be an anarchical state in most localities, and the government will justify its move as being necessary to control panicked citizens. The cult trained military leaders and people under their direction will use arms as well as crowd control techniques to implement this new state of affairs. ...Military bases will be set up, in each locality (actually, they are already here, but are covert). In the next few years, they will go above ground and be revealed. Each locality will have regional bases and leaders to which they are accountable. The hierarchy will closely reflect the current covert hierarchy. </p>

<p>About five years ago, when I left the Illuminati, approximately 1% of the US population was either part of the Illuminati, sympathetic to it, or a victim of Mind Control (and therefore considered useable). While this may not sound like many, imagine 1% of the population highly trained in the use of armaments, crowd control, psychological and behavioral techniques, armed with weapons and linked to paramilitary groups.&quot; </p>

<p>Leadership </p>

<p>Svali: &quot;The national council [consists of] influential bankers with OLD money such as: The Rockefellers, the Mellon family, the Carnegie family, the Rothschild family etc. I know I shouldn´t name names, but I will. </p>

<p>The &quot;Supreme World Council&quot; is already set up as a prototype of the one that will rule when the NWO comes into being. It meets on a regular basis to discuss finances, direction, policy, etc. and to problem-solve difficulties that come up. Once again, these leaders are heads in the financial world, OLD banking money. The Rothschild family in England, and in France, have ruling seats. A descendant of the Hapsburg dynasty has a generational seat. A descendant of the ruling families of England and France have a generational seat. The Rockefeller family in the US holds a seat. </p>

<p>This is one reason that the Illuminati have been pretty &quot;untouchable&quot; over the years. The ruling members are very, very, very wealthy and powerful. I hope this information is helpful. How do I know this? I was on a local leadership council (a head trainer), but I talked to those on regional. Also, every Illuminati child is taught who their &quot;leaders&quot; are, and told to take an oath of allegiance to them and the &quot;New Order to come&quot;.&quot; </p>

<p>Royalty </p>

<p>Svali: &quot;The Illuminati leadership state that they are descended from royal bloodlines, as well as unbroken occult heritage. </p>

<p>See, there were two definitions of &quot;royalty&quot; used. Open royalty that is currently seen now, and &quot;hidden royalty&quot; of royal lineage and extreme occult power. Sometimes the two were concurrent, such as with the Prince of Wales. </p>

<p>I never thought of which country/line held the most power, since I was just a peon busily doing my job. But my understanding was: The Hanoverian / Hapsburg descendants rule in Germany over the Bruderheist. They are considered one of the strongest lines for occult as well. The British line is just under them, with the royal family. Definitely, they rule the UK branch under the Rothschilds in the occult realm, even though parliament rules the country openly.*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False.  The broader of a perspective you expose yourself to, the more you learn. Age assists in that it provides &quot;time&quot; for you to do so, but that does not denote that those of higher ages necessarily have higher intelligence.

<li><p>If you doubt me, I suggest you trace his IP and then trace mine.  While mine will not lead you to who I actually am, you&#39;ll find that they do not match.  Someone should do their homework before making false accusations.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to debunk what I&#39;ve said. Just try.  Other than the unconfirmable data, which I have been forthcoming about (the idea that my grandfather was a 32nd degree mason, any information about The Grand Illumination, and the information about the 12/21/2012 phenomina [which I find to be hard to believe myself]), I encourage you to TRY and prove me wrong. Go ahead.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, after reading your replies to others, I can see you were not boasting, or acting as though we cant win. I am sure several of us wondered that... I am glad to hear that you and your grandfather had better hearts then the others, and there are some that made it to that far, and kept their humanity. But even they do not know the true workings of the top few. I have been studying this every day for far longer each day then doctors study even, I dont take weekends off either, I have had a few breaks, but those were more for sanity then anything else. lol So I&#39;d love to match my knowledge and true understanding against your grandfathers, or anyone around that level. I&#39;d love anything you can recall that your grandfather told you. It is the weirdest simplest of things that have lead to our being awake in the first place... for me, I always knew something was wrong with the world, but their big slip up was letting someone who understands construction and demo, to see the perfectly angled precision cuts on the 2&#39;x2&#39; center core columns. A light went on when I saw them and thought &quot;what person, while trying to rescue people underneath them, would take the time to cut them so perfectly?&quot; and the answer came &quot;NO ONE WOULD!!?!&quot; and ever since then theres no going back. So, ANYTHING you can offer may help more then you know.</p>

<p>Yes I understand they control and are poisoning us with our food and water. Yes I know they are suppressing clean technology and free energy from mankind to maintain their control. I understand how they control our medicine to keep us sick and in an energy level they can control more easily. I even understand that our Constitution stopped them cold in their tracks and they needed all these new laws they made, to get their authority over humanity back. I understand all the politics are designed to crush humanity because a slave who has just enough energy to feed themselves have no energy left to stand up against their masters. And I know and understand they &quot;feed&quot; off this negative energy, both spiritually aswell as financially!</p>

<p>Now allow me to explain something I think you misunderstood, you said, &quot;if we came from an ancient alien species&quot; The alien species knowledge is not for the Masons. They are just like the rest of the human race, they are mixed bloods. The alien descendants are called &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; and they have ruled over mankind throughout history, and beyond. They did not descend in &quot;Christ Consciousness&quot; evolution, when the rest of humanity did, this left us like dumb animals. And them &quot;seeming to be&quot; gods to man, this event is known as the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; in the bible. And other ancient religions call it by different names with differing events. But all discuss this inability of man to work together. According to the Emerald tablets of Thoth, these families came from a planet they destroyed by using the &quot;Lucifer experiment&quot; and then came here, and have gotten mankind into the Lucifer experiment with gadgets and monetary systems, and thereby teaching us greed, and destroying Mother Earth. </p>

<p>I commend your coming forth and saying this, it took some courage. I dont know if this is your first time talking about this, or even if your completely full of shit. And I am sure you appreciate this to a degree, not that I doubt you, or anything you said. Except the &quot;resource based economy&quot; let me pose this to you this way... would you work for free if you could get anything you wanted for free? Mankind would be free to do whatever he wanted and be happy. Yes there are crappy jobs, but most of those would go away, ... cleaning sewers is done by people because the robotics are too expensive... well if everything is free then the robotics would be built, and make that job less disgusting and safer. Going to the moon &quot;costs too much&quot; well not anymore. Farmers will have the absolute best equipment available and plentiful fields. Why do we not recycle like we should? Because the process is &quot;expensive&quot; well here we go, it&#39;ll be free to recycle. This will also open mankind to be able to pursue not profitable ventures, like art, music, entertainment, science, inventing, researching, learning etc. The new value will be &quot;Quality&quot; people will want to work at jobs they believe in. They wont sell crap at McDonalds anymore. Real Restaurants will pop up as places to be and hang out with friends, because the cooks like to cook. Humanity wont be fighting eachother over stupid material things, crime would all but vanish, why would someone steal something if they can go get it for free. Yes there will have to be some restrictions on what can just be taken to begin with, but American jobs (and jobs around the world) will spring up almost immediately. But these jobs will be different, the employers will beg people to come work for them, the workers will have the absolute best equipment. And build the absolute best products, products that they believe in. Things that will last for years and years instead of &quot;hope it breaks down right after the warranty expires&quot; like everything made today. Jobs will come and go as things are needed, discovered, or improved instead of the grind we have today. So I understand your &quot;resource backed&quot; monetary aspect, I&#39;d go one farther and TRULY free mankind, and allow it to expand beyond imagination, without financial limitations.</p>

Or hell teach skydiving, write blogs, help the neighbor put an addition on his house. It really is that simple, we as a species do not help others because it costs us money, we dont give things to others because things cost. And look at all the CEO&#39;s of corporations that do LESS then the 3-10 hours and get FORTUNES for it! Well their fortunes would be as worthless as their contributions to actually contribute physically in those corporations!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not view you as less educated at all; please don&#39;t refer to yourself that way.<br/>
So, other than what I wrote above?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Question EVERYTHING. &quot;Why&quot; is your most valuable question.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not make assumptions (again, belief).  For example, many theories have come up about 9/11.  I cannot tell you much about that event one way or another other than this: Do you really think that they&#39;d make the mistake of demolishing buildings in the open?  Wouldn&#39;t it be more logical to simply insert a radical leader into a country and ushered him along until he attacked the US (perhaps, specifically, the towers?)? A lot less trace-able and plus it keeps people guessing.  So, bottom line, stop looking at these groups and analyse what you do know:</p></li>
<li><p>The Internet can connect us all. Check out &quot;Ghost in a Shell&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Any system which can be made can be unmade. Thus, an law created can be (and will be) broken.  Thus, we have the ability to fix the situation we are in.  However, this is where it gets tricky: if the understanding of morality (something based in human evolution), that which should define law, becomes so convoluted that people assume that they cannot understand it, they will give up and give in to belief.  Additionally, we are battling against many psychological tendencies of people: Cognitive Rigidity, The Bystander Effect, Obedience to Authority, etc.  However, again, these can also be used as tools to form a resistance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>5.The key is to provide a message to the people which everyone can agree with.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My Grandfather told me this... and I find it very... un-scientific, to say the least, but here it is: Do not fear 12/21/2012. They WANT you to fear it.  It will be some sort of spiritual shift.  Free yourself from electronics, alcohol, smokes... all mind altering substances (especially on that day, if not before).</p></li>
<li><p>BEWARE OF MUSIC.  E.g. Lady Gaga &quot;Born This Way&quot; = You don&#39;t change; you&#39;re defined by your genetics. You are not controlled by the record industry, media, and all other stimuli around you. False. &quot;Marry The Night&quot; - Things went wrong in my life, so I said &#39;fuck it&#39; and pursued my own egotistical dreams despite what everyone else thinks. She is the embodiment of the over-active ego.</p></li>
<li><p>Marijuana and LSD can alter your perceptions of reality and so can serve as eye-openers.  HOWEVER, Marijuana is extremely dangerous in that different strains have been shown to reduce motivation as well as inhibit short term memory.  I fear the day it becomes legal; talk about another fantastic way to enslave the mind.  LSD, on the other hand, I&#39;ve yet to find clinical evidence about any negative effects.  </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>It was actually a deeply personal experience and one that I cant explain in words very well... but I guess I&#39;ll try.  This was the result of an LSD trip.  I decided to try it because I had done my research and found that there are no studies which illustrate any adverse side effects.  When I went into it, I was thinking it would simply be fun. Strawberries are forever, unicorns and rainbows, swirly pretty... that sort of stupid shit.  I have never been more wrong in my entire life.</p>

<pre><code> My friends said that when I was going at full blast, they would take me for a walk in a nearby forest.  I thought it would be cool, so I went along.  As we were walking along a path, I felt the need to stop; the beauty was overwhelming.  They laughed, nodded understandingly, and kept walking. 
</code></pre>

<p>I felt the need to sit... and as I did, I saw it.  I saw creation from beginning to end... over and over. From dust to life and back again.  During all of this, something... I can only describe as blinding light, pure energy, spoke to me.  Except, there were no words; it was simply... understanding.  The first thing, above all, is that this energy felt like... love and understanding.  I say felt because that was how it communicated, through feelings.  Imagine the ability to communicate through feelings without words... a transcendence of language. It was the Universe, great and powerful, and I simply a piece of it, but not separate.  This did not make me any less than it because I am it and it is me... as are we all.  I learned that we are blinded by what we perceive as reality. It showed me that I was a guardian.  I remember seeing a breastplate, embossed in gold, but with a dark taint upon it... like... a stain... near the heart.  The taint itself, I can&#39;t really explain... but I would guess that it has a lot to do with the gross amount of pain which has plagued me in this life.  However, I felt myself move to place three things on the ground: my wallet, my phone, and my cigarettes.  It wanted me to discard them.  Perhaps these are the taint.</p>

<p>It gave me the choice of remaining in this realm or ascending upwards and I chose to stay in this reality because I felt that I had more to do. I learned my &#39;true&#39; name and that I would be essential in the days to come, but not they key component.  Ever since, I have been searching for that... person or thing; whatever it may be. </p>

<p>The second came when smoking marijuana, and it was just as powerful as the first.  The strange thing was that there was nothing special about the time I was smoking.  It&#39;s not like I had quit for a while and then started again, that I was smoking anything particularly strong, or that it was the first time I had smoked that batch.  It happened once and it didn&#39;t happen again.</p>

<p>Also, it happened at night, which was equally strange.  The first time was so striking because of the blinding light of the sun and the forest around me... I basically wrote it off as some explainable esoteric experience induced by the drug.  This time, I got the same feeling of magnificence (not my own, but that of creation), but with a sense of urgency.  It was a very short experience, but it basically said that people need to know. They must learn truth, or... I don&#39;t know. I want to say something bad is coming, but that wasn&#39;t in the message.  It was simply: they must know the truth.  And then it ended.</p>

<p>Again, drugs can open your eyes and help you see the reality: you are ruled by your perception and that perception is not what reality really is...  The best example I can provide to support this is the vision of a frog.  It sees only dots and lines and reacts to those. It has no perception of colour and cannot see most form.  Similarly, like a frog, there are many things we do not perceive... and we need to make ourselves aware. </p>

<p>You must be EXTREMELY careful when it comes to ANY drug.  Not just because of the legal ramifications, but also because we are not completely sure what they do. Please see one of my above comments, in my main post, on the matter.</p>

<p>Currently, I do not smoke or use either drug. I&#39;ve gotten my answers and I don&#39;t need to hide in them to escape the reality I perceive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound pretty correct my man.</p>

<p>As for the Grand Illumination, I am still neutral towards this.</p>

<p>Deeply, I know I am leaning towards it being real, but I must withhold that commitment until it is known for sure. </p>

<p>All large ancient societies at the end of the 4th age 5000 years ago were aware of this 25000 year cycle.</p>

<p>This is why they documented it. The pyramid is the most important piece of knowledge on this Earth to this day. The pyramid is the guide towards what is important.</p>

<p>As for what to expect, I am unsure. All I know is be ready for anything. Eat healthy, meditate and think healthy, join <a href="/r/nofap">/r/nofap</a>, exercise stamina and strength, practice your talents and hobbies. </p>

<p>This will pave way to understanding of future knowledge and knowing what to do with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idiot.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that you are wasting time by chasing ghosts; chase what you can see.  You see that the earth is warming. You see ancient icebergs melting. You see dead-zones in the ocean. You see the dangers of nuclear power. You see Blood Diamonds. You see Oil Wars. You see a system corrupted, at every turn, by the concept of money: CISPA, SOPA, NDAA, The Citizens United Ruling, etc. Piece it together and try to prove yourself WRONG.  That&#39;s the only way you can escape belief; that&#39;s the scientific method.</p>

<p>Yes. Most Masons are diluted... and some to the point of what you consider &#39;evil&#39;. Those at top don&#39;t want you to put together what can plainly be seen.  They want you chasing ghosts.  Oh! The Illuminati did this! No! It was the Skull and Bones Society! No! It was the Bilderbergs!</p>

<p>Conjecture based on Conjecture. Belief on top of belief. That&#39;s the machine... and you are, blatantly, a slave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, a quick wikipedia search tells a lot:
&quot;In an 8400-word official judgement issued on 21 July 2008 the British media regulator Ofcom declared that the final part of the film dealing with the politics of climate change had broken rules on &quot;due impartiality on matters of major political and industrial controversy and major matters relating to current public policy&quot;. Ofcom also backed complaints by Sir David King, stating that his views were misrepresented, and Carl Wunsch, on the points that he had been misled as to its intent, and that the impression had been given that he agreed with the programme&#39;s position on climate change.&quot; Apparently, even some of those &#39;quoted&#39; in the video disagreed with its contents. </p>

<p>As for your opinion, I&#39;m going to post the same thing for you as I did for you below.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I actually have no idea who Alex Lugo is. Google doesn&#39;t tell me either.</p></li>
<li><p>I have no idea where you got that name; I assume it&#39;s someone who posts into<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> often? I don&#39;t frequent your guy&#39;s area, to be honest, so I wouldn&#39;t know.  What are the bases of your allegations?   From all that I&#39;ve seen, you&#39;ve drawn no rational correlations between me and this &quot;Lugo&quot;.  Further, you appear to be rather irrational yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>If you doubt me, I suggest you trace his IP and then trace mine.  While mine will not lead you to who I actually am, you&#39;ll find that they do not match.  Someone should do their homework before making false accusations.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to debunk what I&#39;ve said. Just try.  Other than the unconfirmable data, which I have been forthcoming about (the idea that my grandfather was a 32nd degree mason, any information about The Grand Illumination, and the information about the 12/21/2012 phenomina [which I find to be hard to believe myself]), I encourage you to TRY and prove me wrong. Go ahead.</p></li>

<p>My.</p>

<p>Day.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you are misleading this thread and the people who I am trying to reach.  Shut the fuck up and crawl back into the hole from which you came; you&#39;re wasting valuable time.</p>
