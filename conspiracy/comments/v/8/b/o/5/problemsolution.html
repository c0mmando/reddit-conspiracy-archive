<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Install RES (reddit enhancement suite). Hover over commenter username, viola: age of account. </p>

<p>Stop replying to new users. Completely. If the account is less than a week/month old, it is likely a shill. You can then investigate further in their post history. Obviously some people use rolling accounts because tinfoil, but these people should be obvious from their post history and content. </p>

Really, I kind of think reddit, being involved with multinational conde nast, is another data gatherer like facebook, except it is much more specific.  every up vote, downvote, comment noted to make a complete profile of an online individual, which can later be tied to any real person they want.

<p>This is something experienced Redditors need to do as well. Often times there&#39;s a confirmation bias with pretty questionable sources, where people have their minds completely closed to the idea of learning something new whether they&#39;re learning something new for or against their beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><pre><code>why would someone genuinely waste so much of their personal time arguing with an entire subreddit, near-constantly?
</code></pre>

<p>I&#39;ve explained this numerous times. I waste so much of my &quot;personal time&quot; hanging out on Reddit because I have no choice. I have three different heart conditions and I am locked to sitting in a chair, on my couch, or laying in bed. I literally get no time to do anything, so I spend an enormous amount of time on Reddit.</p>

<pre><code>I sure as fuck can think of better things to do.
</code></pre>

<p>Name some better things I can do when I can&#39;t leave my apartment. Here&#39;s the kicker; it can&#39;t include lifting anything more than 10 pounds, or walking around for more than 20 minutes at a time without sitting down.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a shill, not even close, I just speak out when I disagree with something, and I speak out when it&#39;s fairly obvious that someone is simply being ignorant.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been retardedly screwed over by the government due to loopholes in the system nearly my entire life due to my medical conditions, so I&#39;ve had more than enough reason to dislike everything the government does.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean I let a confirmation bias rule my decision making like so many people here do. Critical thinking is the most important part of figuring out the truth, and if you can&#39;t think critically and you can&#39;t look at things objectively, you&#39;re not searching for the truth, you&#39;re just creating fantasies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not being sarcastic. If I were in a similar situation as yourself I can&#39;t say that I wouldn&#39;t do the same. Perhaps I would approach what you do in a different way, but the devils advocate of any conversation can be a really valuable person to keep the concepts and those participating honest about their claims. r/cons should try to work out the contradictions in arguments so that truthfulness or truisms can be found.

<p>Not to my knowledge anyway.</p>

<p>Honestly, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m even 100% agreed on either side when I argue sometimes, I just know if I take the devil&#39;s advocate approach, I can gain legitimate discussion back and forth.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no knowledge to be gained if I can&#39;t have any sort of legitimate debate about a topic.</p>
