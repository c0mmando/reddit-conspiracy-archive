        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>maybe instead of usernames, just assign each IP address a unique identifier.. maybe only allow 10 or so usernames per IP, and after that you just have to use the IP-unique identifier (which is also publicly associated with all user names registered under it)...??</p>

<p>EDIT: maybe limit it to 10 usernames per IP... but make them be active. so if you don&#39;t vote at least once a month, you lose your account, and someone else can sign up on your IP... and then you might not be able to get an account again until someone elses abandons their account on that IP</p>

<p>also, you could just have a system for people who can&#39;t get usernames / are banned but didn&#39;t do anything themself. something more complicated than captcha. like &quot;email your phone number to this email address.. and include this captcha in the email&quot;.. then have mods call those people at their leisure.. and then allow them to sign up for an account..  </p>

<p>if mods start getting too many requests per IP, you figure out what the IP is. if it&#39;s a school, you maybe open a lot more accounts to it. if it&#39;s just some guy in atlanta trying to sign up for 500 accounts, you tell him to go back to digg</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what about the people with dynamic IPs.  You are assuming everyone has a static ip but they don&#39;t.  Some people may one day try to get on and they cannot post because someone who had the IP before abused the site.  And with static IPs those change every so often as well. This will not work with IPv4 (I do not know about IPv6).  Simply said, this would not work with the current setup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it would not be easy to identity duplicates, as with many sites a person could merely use a proxy, and there arre many proxies available.  The new proxy&#39;s IP could also be much different than the abuser&#39;s old proxy IP and from there they could just make a new account.  This would only end badly.  The invite only could work, but typically private servers and sites lose userbase quickly and can recieve hate from other communities.</p>

<p>proxy IPs either all look like the same person.. or are banned (more likely)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IP adress bound? That is just stupid. Then there can be more censorship as once you are banned and on a static adress, its goodbye to you for a very long time.</p>

<p>So someone doesn&#39;t like your posts, you just get banned.</p>

<p>The solution is to have no moderation and votes that work as youtube. You can see how people have voted, but have very little influence on the topic visibility. </p>

<p>Of course the more votes and more green votes the longer it stays visible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm, you have a point. Age doesn&#39;t necessarily denote anything. Well, I would think it would be scored not by traditional standards but by a person&#39;s willingness to engage in thoughtful, contributory, intelligent and polite discussion. </p>

<p>Well honestly I initially had no idea. But now that I&#39;m thinking about it I think a cool test would be to just have 10 Reddit posts, ask the user to comment and judge them based on the content, thoughtfulness, understanding and cordiality of their comments. This does not exclude pun threads, but it does excise useless comments that supplement only trivial humor. Also perhaps on the comments&#39; relevance in the given subreddit. </p>

<p>Ohhh, and I don&#39;t think it would be just one person judging these. I think we should out together a panel to do so. </p>

<p>I never said it sold out, just that it has been infested with young, anti-intellectual people who upvote only the most amusingly banal ideas and scorn long winded discussions and attempts to get at the truth. </p>

<p>There is no guarantee that it won&#39;t. And if does, we&#39;ll create a new place. But the idea of the entrance exam would be to filter out those likely to bring in...idiocy. </p>

<p>I apologize for the lack of specificity in the last word &#39;idiocy&#39;. But on today&#39;s Reddit visiting the comments no longer explains the post, offers any poignant insight or questions logically. </p>

<p>Reddit has consumed itself with inside jokes and blatant hatred that any outsider would struggle to understand. </p>

<p>And to be fair, I was not talking about this subreddit having a test. you failed to read the entire thread closely enough. I was talking about a brand new Reddit. Not a brand new subreddit...A brand new Reddit. </p>

<p>A new site where users could post information, links, articles etc etc with its own subsites. But the entire site would have some sort of intelligence exam to ensure that those joining it would contribute thoughtful or original content. It would ensure that the site would not be full of immature or only middle school educated children who would contribute only to trivialities and useless and perhaps even pernicious inside jokes. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m talking about is a new website. Away from Reddit. One that will attract intelligent, questioning and cordial people. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying any of us are intellectually superior to...anybody else in particular, just that those of us who do wish to search for truth could use a place where we are not disturbed by silly children and mindless memes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like a reddit like site where users could assign a quality rating to other users. It could be, for example, a rating from 0 to 10. All of the rated user&#39;s votes would be weighted by that rating. So the people you respect can have a big effect on submission and comment rankings, and people you disrespect can have little or no effect. </p>

<p>This system would probably require more server resources, since these calculations would have to customized for every user. But it might be technically feasible, I don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit became the most popular, so everyone uses it.</p>

<p>People have a problem with mod censorship, but every sub has it&#39;s own rules, it&#39;s not like Reddit claims;</p>

<p>&quot;Come here and post whatever the fuck you want wherever the fuck you want without any sort of consequence!&quot;</p>

<p>Even Anonymous and OWS subs have restrictions. </p>

<p>The idea that people WANT of freedom reminds me of an old It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode, where they want to turn their bar into a &quot;you can do anything you want&quot; bar.</p>

<p>But they quickly learn that if you allow people to do ANYTHING because you offer no restrictions, things can get out of hand, because people are the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s actually not in context, you quoted part of my comment where I&#39;m talking about a TV show. It&#39;s an episode where they allow an &quot;anything goes&quot; approach inside their bar, and shit starts getting super real because they decide they don&#39;t want to try and tell anyone what they can and can&#39;t do.</p>

<p>I&#39;m only saying; people have this idea of a &quot;perfect&quot; scenario, but there are legal implications with allowing people to say whatever they want without any form of censorship.</p>

<p>Not to mention, there are posts all the time about being &quot;censored&quot; when they go into a sub that has clear rules on the side saying what is and isn&#39;t okay.</p>
