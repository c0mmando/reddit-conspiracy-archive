       Does anyone else feel like this is all too good to be true? All of it. The leaks. The sick revelations about the pedo shit. The Project Veritas video. The MSM changing the way they cover her. The "coup and counter-coup". The rank-and-file stuff with NYPD, FBI, DoJ. Her loss in the election...

       What if this whole thing has been a psyop?

       I've been trying to convince people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump and Clinton work together!!!
The plan was to get the election between them two so it's a fail safe.  Had hillary won, the course would still be set just different steps. But because trump won, were going to see them provoking violence thru protests to declare us in a state of 'civil unrest'
      </p>
      <p>
       However I don't think wikileaks was apart of the plan. They had to create the fail safe in case something like the leaks did happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say it perfectly though.
Divide and conquer is what we are witnessing. Now as dumbass Americans beat eachother up because of differing political opinions tptb get ready for their next move. Paying people to fuck shit up at anti trump protests and possibly trying an assassination attempt on trump before 1/20

       TBH, the people are brainwashed.  It's not their fault- this is a very difficult situation we (as conscious people) are in.  No amount of convincing on our part is going to be able to break the conditioning these people have endured, it will only serve to alienate us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea how to fix this situation, I'd just like to remind you and every other conscious person reading this that we have to be patient with and tolerant of the people that don't see things our way, because it's not their fault that they are brainwashed.  Never lose sight of the fact that your anger should only be towards the oppressive regime and the entities responsible for society's current state.  The sheep people that are merely drones are
       <em>
        victims
       </em>

       If things continue to go downhill, THIS is going to be so so important. We can't get angry with them. It's like dealing with an upset child... If the child is angry and throwing a tantrum, the first thing you do is sympathize and validate their feelings. "I understand why you feel the way you feel." And
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       you try to show them the truth. That it's not their fault or the fault of the people they're blaming - they were all lied to. People are going to need redirection. Redirect them by showing them who the true enemy is.

       I thought this. It was a no brainier that if Trump won the streets of the US would be filled with rage. And where there is war, even a civil war, profit and lessons are made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idea: say US breaks into a civil war and these riots go on for a while. Then the public may be persuaded to vote for another Clinton because they know choosing the wrong "norm" candidate will cause chaos again.

       That's right. And if the dollar wasn't tied to OPEC's commitment to only sell oil in dollars, it would have crashed long ago. That's how we consistently operate annual trade deficits. Our main export is US dollars. Countries need US dollars to buy their oil to power their...everything. 2008 was supposed to be the end. We put a pretty band-aid on it. There isn't a band-aid big enough for what's coming.

       Yes. That's exactly how I feel and what I've considered and commented on here before. Can't do anything but watch this crap pan out.

       Hillary's concession speech was just too damn... I can't even think of the word... Its like giving that speech
       <em>
        was her victory.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       She looked way too damn smug. Like when someone plays the victim with a sob story and then turns around and grins because they secretly got exactly what they wanted.

       Elites (aka sociopaths who just have a ton of material/financial resources at their disposal in this current era's paradigm via corruption, cutthroated organized crime-type ventures and organizations, familial lineages also of either corruption/murder/politics/government/religion/esotericism and mysticism.....an era that we can safely say is over 7,000 years old) are playing a long chess game, following an esoteric game plan called The Magnum Opus, or 'The Great Work'. In knowing that, nothing that occurs under the sun, moon and stars should really come as a shock. The views I see relative to the election are micro-focused, whereas the elite operate on a macro-view that runs so deep, many don't have the want or time to see that level. Hundreds of years are like days to a group of in-the-know people, connected through the above mentioned lineages.

       I understand what you're saying. Observing a macro-view is important--that's why I study the real history of our country and world as best I can. But you must admit, certain events serve as linchpins in that macro-view. 9/11 would be an example from this century.

       I am in complete agreement. They seem to serve as niches in the world's timeline. This entire century thus far has been molded by the resulting effects from one September morning. However, I feel that that morning was contrived and brought about through years of preparation beforehand. By whom? Lots of guesses there.

       That isn't an answer. It's an avenue towards real truth. It delves into esotericism, mysticism and symbolism. Then, capitalizing on the energy of the people.......kind of like what is going on right now with the Trump protests.

       After reading the comments here I'd have to recommmend you people get out more. It is only a surprise that the Don won if you haven't been looking around and don't know Donald Trump. Hilary played to empty halls with photo shopped crowds for much of the campaign while Trump drew millions. Drive around America and see 20 Trump signs for each Hillary. Trump successful building in NYC is a thing only a few people can do and last at. She really did not have much of a chance because she not anywhere near as smart or experienced. Where are leaks from Trump campaign? Email? twitter? This is because he and his people are experienced at keeping secrets confidential, money will    be lost in confidentiality is broken. No psych-op, just a successful man doing what he's been mostly doing for 50 years: winning.
