       How does that work?  Between brexit and the shocking vote count Tuesday, if any of you actually cared about real conspiracies, you'd be looking at how polls got it so wrong both times, how there's clearly a hidden hand at work AGAINST democracy and liberal ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead, you just rant and rave on and on with psychotic anti-clinton propaganda.
      </p>

       You're all pathetic, and this sub is pathetic.  It should be about uncovering real hidden truths, not pushing an agenda.  No better than the MSM.

       The candidate who didn't win lost, in part,
       <strong>
        because
       </strong>
       they were involved in conspiracies and all kids if BS, you mouth breathing, knuckle dragging, spoon fed retard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of throwing around insults and your own delirious interpretation of the facts why don't you spend 10 minutes on research and investigating the actual facts instead of what your professors or coworkers or newspapers or television feeds your neuron malfunctioning brain??
      </p>
      <p>
       Spend 10 minutes in this sub or r/Wikileaks looking at ACTUAL internal communications from Hillary, the DNC, or John Podesta. Look at the corruption and collusion and illegal activities perpetuated by your own martyr.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't trust the Russian state controlled leaks, then go to the FBI document vault and investigate government released documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still not good enough? Then maybe research back pre-2008 and see what news stories come up regarding your candidate.

      <p>
       All of this information was available
       <strong>
        before

       the election and fucking retards like you couldn't be bothered to look anywhere past what was handed to you.

       Thank god there was enough informed democrats and republicans that saw your candidate for what she was and voted elsewhere.

       Yeah, without factoring in possible implications of the sarcasm, I'd say that it's factual.

      <p>
       Your post is rife with ad hominem insults, and worse, spelling and grammatical errors.  Plus, it looks like you're accusing OP of being a Hillary supporter, when nothing he says indicates that.  This leads me to believe that you're a sad, unintelligent man, who is extremely insecure in his beliefs.

       You caught me. My miserable life has led me to r/conspiracy and where I can spend my time debating with people like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me clear the record for you;
OP implies the real conspiracy is with faulty polling data (true) and that there is a hand working against democracy (also true). Furthermore they implied that there was an unjustified thrust of anti-Clinton propaganda, in turn implying Clinton was somehow the representative of democracy and liberty. Finally OP called me, and you and the entire sub pathetic. The overall message conveyed was Clinton was wronged and by supporting the truth of her actions we are somehow partisanly supporting Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have accused my post of partisan support of Trump, and I would like you to cite specifically where I showed that in what I wrote. Please do, because not a single line I wrote shows Trump support. It's you and OP that brought partisanship to the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry my typos and grammatical errors are not up to your own fine construction of the English language.

       Finally eat a dick. I'm pretty sure you aren't r/conspiracy's police man and grammar nazi, so I'll continue to post, hopefully more now that I know it pisses you off.

       I see where you went wrong.  Your jump in logic begins at "the overall message conveyed was-".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        there's clearly a hidden hand at work AGAINST democracy and liberal ideas.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If OP is talking about the establishment being opposed to liberal ideas, he probably isn't talking about Clinton.  She wasn't much more liberal than Trump, and fought against adopting a liberal platform, or at least to the extent her party wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attacks against democracy, I agree with too.  This election was entirely based on personal attacks, I can remember about 5 minutes total of policy discussion from the presidential debates.  Not exactly ideal in a functioning
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I agree with OP's judgment of this sub.  It has become so inundated with one-sided attacks, that it reads more like an op-ed blog than a discussion of conspiracies.  Just because your candidate talks about the viability of conspiracy theories constantly doesn't automatically make him a true believer, either.  We constantly discuss Alex Jones, Snowden, and Assange working for the people they claim to speak out against.  It's part of staying on your toes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Continue to post if you want, I'm just telling you what was praised here before the influx of braindead t_d shitposters.  Right now, you're revealing yourself to be just as willfully ignorant and entrenched in your beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's all kinds of psychotic anti-Clinton rhetoric here.  The thing is, you don't see it, because you're used to articles like "10 reasons Clinton is literally a pedophile demon" from the_donald.

       You ever ask yourself questions like:
      </p>
      <p>
       If WHITE families like Rothschild's helped create and form what is America today, how is it that people believe these people are their enemies?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it that the establishment that is catered and created for whites so bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't every racist white person vote for Hillary so that their establishment could continue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would a white racist, be against the ultimate form of white supremacy while at the same time here in a forum like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       helping expose all of their own elite's details and evil deeds?
      </p>
      <p>
       How did Hillary, who is the epitome of the white establishment (although much more liberal in our time) lose to someone who demonized Latinos, Muslims and Blacks (The Other Half of America) but literally has no backing nor political experience?

       Say "globalist," if that's what you're beating around the bush about.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's exactly what this post is addressing, I think.  Before this election, the controlling elite was seen to be big bankers, weapons manufacturers, and the 1%.  You're just convoluting the real issues and making it harder for people to understand what these people actually do wrong, by lumping them into one category.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump and Brexit propaganda had to call them globalists, because otherwise people would see that the people speaking out were a part of the problem.

       yes the establishment who have no yet defected from that status quo  under the control of soros are globalists in a sense that they are loyal to a foreign entity who believes in global government and no borders.  the people in that category can defect from the status quo to the cause of liberty and many are, in droves, every day.  Freedom will win.

       Way to ignore everything I said and continue with your rant.

       I don't agree with the way you present facts, you should stop regurgitating other people's words and put some research into details of what you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're making us all look like lunatics by just parroting "Soros" and "globalists," start linking events, dates, and names if you actually want to put real pressure on these people.

       i agreed with your assessment (except for the part about the people speaking out being part of the problem) and tried to reexplain my argument in clearer terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       when trump and brexit arguments were made their use of the term globalist was correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       the pressure on soros and his army is from history, i am not trying to win becaus history says we already won and will continue to win, i am simply explaining how victory for liberty will occur over the next 11 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       all my links are from history correlated to now, once the soros army realizes they are fighting against history and providence they will realize their efforts are a waste of time.

       Well, I would urge you to stop describing it in such vague terms.  I don't doubt that we will eventually overcome the issues and people hindering peaceful progress in the US, but I try to provide evidence whenever I make an argument that won't be widely accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever I hear someone repeating "Soros" or "globalist", because of the recent wave of spammers, I generally assume that they aren't very well read on who the people they're talking about actually are, or what they do wrong.

       trump and brexit logic was correct, globalist rule was for exploitation from afar by unaccountable soros controlled puppets.  many of those puppets are waking up and defecting now.

       Sounds like you need to sit down and accept the fact that the democratic candidate was so dishonest, so corrupted, and so disliked that she failed to inspire people to show up to the polls, not to mention the unknown number of people she turned away and to Trump or 3rd parties. The DNC spent the entire election cycle just looking at how many people registered as democrats and just assumed their entire support, when in reality, she critically lacked the enthusiasm to get voters out to the polls.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the "hidden hand" you speak of?  Sounds like the DNC to me, actively colluding against Sanders and conspiring with Hillary, all while they were planning to court conservative votes, even if it lost liberal votes.

       What a jerk. Just look at Trump rallies and compare them to bag lady rallies. Just drive around America and count lawn signs. The bag lady and her pederest slaves couldn't steal enough votes or get enough illegals to cheat their way into the polling booth. Get over yourselves losers.
