       CTR I believe was in full damage control making sure to push the narrative is was fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       People were questioning how they got into a secure area at CERN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, people noted that if you freeze framed and zoomed the knife going into the body came out red as if there were several pixels of blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       An article was then put out brushing it off saying it was just student playing around on campus.

       I don't think it was real. Camera man was there before folks walked in. Ritual was far too quick.  People were wearing sneakers. No actual ritual just come up and stab a plainclothes sacrifice. It's either a joke or disinformation tactic or both.

       Bringing back what we know about the video:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The video was originally uploaded by "Richie from Boston" who wrote on his YouTube account "This is new footage caught on the grounds of CERN, videotaped from inside the building. If it’s real, that’s horrible, if it’s a staged ritual, that’s equally bad."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In an interview later with the media (the Mirror), he said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "So it turns out the origin of the video posted for the sacrifice at CERN has been found – the problem is, the man is dead. Now hoax or no hoax, let me remind you all we have seen this before and we know all that expose this evil are killed or made to disappear."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And then according to some articles (such as
       <a href="http://www.choiceandtruth.com/2016/08/man-who-leaked-cern-sacrifice-found-dead.html">
        this one
       </a>
       ):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After this statement, however, he refused to give any more information about himself or the original source of the video for genuine fear of his own life.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I believe
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/27TUBGUY/videos">
        this is the youtube account
       </a>
       from the original video.  It's full of conspiracy theory videos, and I'm sure that some of them are fun to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't watched them yet, but the description
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-IG2Aj0m8w">
        of this one
       </a>
       says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        KEV BAKER TALKS WITH ANTHONY PATCH ON CERN AND THIER NEWEST UPGRADE ATTEMPT TO TEAR THE VEIL BETWEEN OUR REALITY AND THE OTHER DIMENSIONS.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It may be worth going through some of these videos, and see if he talks about any more about the cult video.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Found
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi2knhoGAks">
        this video
       </a>
       from 2 months ago.  It only has 8,081 views, so I don't think the mass media ever linked to it.  In it, he claims that CERN has done their investigation, and concluded that it was a prank, carried out by people with CERN badges.  He doesn't indicate whether or not he believes the CERN investigation, and reiterates that he stands by his original statement that "If it’s real, that’s horrible, if it’s a staged ritual, that’s equally bad."

       don't forget this video. I think it's a rehearsal for the tunnel ceremony, but Satan shows up and there are bipedal goats walking around and eyes and all kinds of shit. This video has commentary.

       This is the original post. It still embeds the original youtube upload, which has since been deleted. The youtube account was called "cern beyond the truth"

       This clip is just too short to tell. It could well be a few employers or other teens "playing on the whole sacrifice thing", as if it's a joke, and performed this with a retractable knife, just for laughs and attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying either or, but this clip is definetively not evidence - though it certainly drives some emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't there, and neither was any of us (or?), but for the person in white to lay down willfully like this, in front of a masked audience, and the "purpotraitor" holding the knife for all to see, just doesn't seem right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy holding the knife also seems to wear skating-shoes, and has a distinct walk that doesn't seem "posed or diciplined", but rather appears to just to be another teenager - not a man who has done this in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just me and my reasoning, and take from it what you wish, but this clip doesn't hold water for me.

       It's quite likely that someone involved in the video will read this thread. Maybe they already have, since at least 4 of them are redditors.

       was part of the inspiration, as was a lot of stuff on facebook and youtube. The whole point of the video was to see the internet reaction, although nothing will top the fact that the story was covered by the mainstream press in the UK.

       There are some who believe that cern may be opening a portal to another dimension or universe,  and that this is the "abyss" or "bottomless pit" spoken of in the biblical book of Revelation. Im watching this kind of stuff with great interest.

       It was students making a prank. There is no mystery about how they got access to the place, since thousands of students come every Summer and have free access to all the public areas. Frankly look at their shoes (sneakers) and  body proportions, and it is clear these are young people doing a stupid practical joke.

       It's useless to respond to you since you chose already what to believe, without any proof. But it's interesting to note how you mix totally unrelated matters, such as CERNs hoax video, CTR and the Clintons. Wow, r/conspiracy is coming back from the electoral hiatus!

       I think first you need to understand the traditions and the culture of the people living in the alps first.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a yearly
       <a href="https://youtu.be/tA35OeJslWg">
        event
       </a>
       where they dress up as the Krampus (similar to Satan) and beat up people on the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pagan traditions and satanic influences are just how they spend their time. As someone that lives close to CERN this isn't surprising to me (just like the satanic symbolism when they opened that tunnel wasn't surprising to me neither).

       This video could be real, but it could also be just training for a bigger show or something.

       There's a theory that particle accelerators are actually being used to irradiate growth mediums for biological research. And that all that God particle mumbo-jumbo is just a thick smearing of horseshit.

       Of course I may be off on a tangent, but maybe this event was in relation to the Outer Court.

       !
"Details of the slaughtering varied according to the rite involved. In the hono ritual that ended the dedication of a temple, the naked victim was brought already dead to the lele, or sacrificial altar. At other times, the victim would be clubbed or stabbed to death in the outer court of the hieau and then placed on the altar."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cfcindia.com/article/the-meaning-of-the-tabernacle">
        http://www.cfcindia.com/article/the-meaning-of-the-tabernacle
       </a>
       The first item in the outer court of the tabernacle was the altar of sacrifice, which was a hollow bronze enclosure placed on the ground. The sacrifices had to be placed on the ground inside the altar, for God had said that His altar was always to be one of earth (created by God and not constructed by any man - symbolizing Calvary's cross, an altar made by God Himself - Exod.20:24,25).
      </p>
      <p>
       The altar was also not to have any steps going up to it, but only a sloping ramp - symbolizing the fact that there are no "steps to salvation" (Exod.20:26).'
(Visit link to see bird's eye view of the Outer Court)
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing as the people in the video wore black, maybe their "sacrifice" was the opposite of the Tabernacle's symbolism:
"The outer court of the tabernacle was 150 feet long by 75 feet wide. A sheet of fine white linen - symbolizing the righteousness of Christ - enclosed it. That which separates those inside the church from those outside is not a different level of human righteousness, but the fact that those inside are clothed with the righteousness of Christ. The white linen also symbolizes the simplicity that should characterize the church. Babylon the harlot, on the other hand, is depicted in the book of Revelation as being grand and pompous in many ways “ quite a contrast to the simplicity of the Bride of Christ (cf. Rev.17:4 with 19:8)."

       This seems pretty ridiculous. I have a good friend who works for Fermilab. He's been to CERN, they are just huge nerds. They are all about particle physics, why would a bunch of physicists perform human sacrifice?  Also who the fuck performs a sacrifice right out in the open?
