       Just have a look
       <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-win-leads-street-protests-across-u-s-n681906">
        how detailed NBC is reporting
       </a>
       on a few frustrated Clinton supporters that say they do not accept the results. Notice how the views of the crowds are taken to suggest immense crowds, yet in the report they acknowledge this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nearly 2,000 protesters
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        More than 100 people shut down a major highway through downtown Los Angeles
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Dozens of young people chanting "Hey hey! Ho ho! White supremacy's got to go!"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        More than 400 people chanting anti-Trump slogans clogged the streets of downtown Austin, Texas
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They had 2 more important protests:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Police said more than 7,000 people mobilized in Oakland, California
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A crowd that police estimated at several thousand marched Wednesday night through downtown Seattle
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <br/>
       The point here is that yes, there are a few protests, but they are by no means generalized to the entire country. It's as if this is a desperate attempt to ignite a sort of widespread violence to show that the population is in fact against Trump and to deny him the presidency despite Trump won the election fair and square against the entire system.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <strong>
        Is this PLAN B of the Globalists' conspiracy?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <strong>
        It doesn't seem the fascists are those who were described as being so.

       They hardly showed anything when the (bigger) wall street protests were going on.  Now the protests against Trump are all they can talk about.
