       There seems to be a fair amount of effort put forth wondering how the polls were so far off, or what could have been the last minute thing that changed it all. All those early voter tallies and mailed in ballots were already counted. 538, even well into the final count gave the election to hilldogg, but I never believed the numbers were based in reality. Say it enough, and the public should believe it.

       Is this true? People just think "well looks like Candidate A is ahead in the polls, I guess that's who I'll vote for"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would've thought it'd be the opposite, because if you see the candidate you favor winning by a large enough margin then you'd be more likely to not even bother voting, but if the candidate you favor is losing then you'd be more likely to vote to try to help make a difference.

       There are studies that show people want to vote for the winner because it makes them feel good about being on the "winning team". I don't understand it, but apparently it motivates some.

       538 was also part of the machine that put Bernie down, so big surprise when they projected trump would lose in a landslide. You want honest polls, look for the smaller operations who do their own. When the LA times, who was biased and ran 5 or 6 anti trump articles at any given time, showed massive support
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       trump..well, those are the studies  I trust.

       yeah, once the mainstream started showing Trump pulling even, that's when I knew he had the support required to possibly pull it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, the amount of voter fraud necessary to pull her even in the popular vote is undoubtedly mind-blowing.  I would imagine you could comfortably take 10 million people from her total and either erase them (for duplicates, dead people, and illegals) or spread them back to the other candidates.  To be honest, I would not be surprised in the least if it was 20 million.  Her lack of organic support was very real.

       I don't believe in individual vote fraud. Not that it never happens, just that if it does, it is small and meaningless. Now a machine that flips 16% of the vote (like against Bernie in California) is a very real threat to democracy. I don't understand why the whole primary wasn't halted when the audit discovered that! Guess its good to own the dnc.

       I agree that 538 is a total sham at this point.  But just 2 days before the election, Nate was giving Trump a 34% chance of winning.  The media was "predicting" a landslide in a lot of cases.  But if you were actually looking at the available polling, it reflected Trump having a reasonable chance.

       I think youre being a little harsh on 538. The issue they had with predicting the election on election night was their methodology. Rather than looking at votes as they were counted, they relied on their polls+forecast to determine the odds and updated their odds as each state was called.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, the NYT did a much better job in live predicting the election because they kept track of the votes that were counted and an estimation of the remaining votes left. Once 538 realized their methodology was wrong they started designating states as "to close to call" and setting them as 50/50.

       538 famously used a series of polls, collected and weighted in aggregate, then did their own projections and analysis on top of that. They were very flawed.

       I think there were a lot of people who voted for Trump that didn't tell anyone, for fear of ridicule. Maybe a lot of people didn't want to say it out loud to pollsters. I was not a Trump supporter, but I'm anti-Clinton and people were attacking me, blaming me for a Trump presidency. Especially I think people who have to hide it from their spouses, friends, etc. Look up Bradley effect.

       Apparently, this isn't the case. The total number (not percent of the populace) of trump votes were largely unchanged from a month ago..if you trust any of the numbers.

       I'm a big believer in all kind of election fraud, including the pre-election polls.  However, I think there are also all kinds of other explanations, especially considering the polls were not that far off (for PRE-election polls).  I offer you an anecdotal tidbit:  My aunt and my cousin - college educated, middle class, female, life-long democrats in a Chicago suburb - both told me they went into the voting booth intending to vote for Clinton, but "just couldn't do it".  Voted for Trump, apparently didn't even consider a 3rd party option.

       A similar thing happened with Brexit. The polling companies seemed to be tweaking the data to get the desired result, namely that Remain (or Clinton) should always shown to be ahead of Leave (or Trump). A blatant, but unsuccessful attempt at manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US pollsters went too far and got themselves in a bit of a pickle when they pushed Hillary out to +12% a couple of weeks ago, presumably in the hope that Trump (or his team/supporters) would give up. When this didn't happen, they needed some "unexpected event" to push Hillary's artificial ratings back down to something plausibly deniable. Step in FBI Director Comey with his bogus re-opening the Hillary emails case. Her ratings immediately dropped back to "just above" Trump's.

       I noticed a huuuuge disconnect between online polls and those put forth by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I commented as much after the second debate where an online poll asked who won. It was overwhelmingly in favor of Trump. But all media outlets posted polls showing Clinton as the winner.
      </p>
      <p>
       People here scoffed and said, "online polls are notoriously unreliable because people can vote multiple times, etc." While this is true, it should've been a big flag that such online polls were consistently on Trump's side.

       I saw this too. When i was periodically checking during or immediately after a debate or a poll, huge trump response, then very predictably, 5000 pro-Clinton votes would dump, as if by magic.

       First of all, no, the polls were created and run by Clinton Super Pacs and the organizations close to them.  Then they were propagated by the Clinton team news media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, you say that the exit polls are drastically in favour of Clinton, but you're clearly reading something different than the rest of us.  Trump was 53% with men and 42% with women.  Clinton was 54% with women and 41% with men.  Unless exponentially more women than men are voting, then your entire premise goes out the fucking window.  Also the exit polls in NC, PA, FL, MI show Trump with the win.  Then there's the whole fact that Trump won white voters (the largest demographic by a long shot) 58% to 37%

The mental gymnastics required to believe that a billionaire is some kind of savior of the people already qualifies you for the special olympics.

       Last I heard both those reports (citibank and goldman) were plants and were not accurate.  Why don't you want and see who he appoints before making wild-eyed assertions?  But don't think that there won't be a couple people appointed to appease the money men...there will, no doubt.  He will be required to.  Let's see if the entire group is like Obama's was.
