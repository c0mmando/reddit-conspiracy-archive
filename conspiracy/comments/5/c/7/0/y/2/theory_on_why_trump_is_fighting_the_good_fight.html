       So Trump is a multi-billionaire, he has never had to worry about money or fame, most of the time he says what he wants when he wants, and he has suffers from delusions of grandeur (which are know longer delusions). You can safely say he is an elite, even before he won POTUS he had enough power and money to make a change to the world but I don't know of many cases of TRUMP doing humanitarian work or setting up successful charity organisations (not saying he hasn't, it's just not common knowledge compared to other rich celebs)
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect that some time ago he tried to get into the "Illuminati club", to be part of the inner circle of the most powerful people in the world and as much as he tried to meet the criteria these elites (men behind the curtains) looked at him and saw him as a risk to their operation, so they rejected his application "per se".
      </p>
      <p>
       considering Trumps personality and his achievements I see a man that doesn't take rejection too lightly so it is possible that this man has a personal vendetta to settle with the "Illuminati club" sorta like a "If you cant join them, beat them!" mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now he is on a mission to tear apart the Illuminati piece by piece starting with the Clinton foundation heading for the ultimate goal of setting up his own "Illuminati club" where he is at the top of the food chain and only he decides who's in the inner circle or who isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Theory answers alot of the questions we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why he ran for POTUS? 
Why the establishment is against him?
Why he wants to pull out of NATO?
Why he wants to ally with Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes this is pure speculation but I wanted you to understand that as people have mentioned numerous times in this Forum, TRUMP is still the establishment but consider him to be a new kind of establishment rather than part of the current establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that the amount of support he has by the people and the popularity he will gain from "draining the swamp" might be enough to influence him positively to keep pushing and have his name echoed throughout history as the man who opened the curtains and shined the light on the truth.

       Fuck hope.  Hope is dead - or most definitely
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be.  Move toward critical examination.  Hope gets dumb ass 99%ers continuing to give evil 1%ers powers over the masses they do not deserve.

       People may change here and there, but A) they usually don't, and B) although people may slightly change,
       <em>
        corporate systems
       </em>
       DON'T...so stop giving assholes the benefit of the doubt.  This is what keeps getting citizens fucked over.  What I said elsewhere applies here as well:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For anyone to think that Trump is going to be the answer to really anything is to yet again give a level of credence that I thought would have
        <em>
         completely
        </em>
        evaporated from the mind of really any halfway decent, intelligent, thinking individual after witnessing first hand the total and complete sham that Obama and his corporate presidency proved itself to ultimately be.
       </p>
       <p>
        How anyone can keep going through this same bullshit every.  Fucking.  FOUR YEARS - and believing the same sham over and over again (

         "This time for sure!  It'll really happen!"

        ) - is beyond me.

        It’s like America is literally the equivalent of an abused wife who just KEEPS getting the shit beat out of her and somehow just KEEPS coming back for more.  I mean I don’t even…

       Hope is the person that says there is no hope but continues to live life happily and "speak" out through actions of good deeds and not turning a blind eye when evil doesn't directly affect them. Hope is saying, "I'm going to leave 'this' better than I found it and not brag about it." You still leave your touch, hope is not tangible and has no size limit on its influence.

       , I most certainly DON’T just roll over and say “we are all fucked so why bother” and do nothing.  My general motto and m.o. is to
       <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/c8/3b/d9/c83bd9ab24fee0ede523eb8469b7a9f1.jpg">
        be the frog.
       </a>
       That frog isn’t “hoping”.  That frog is DOING SOMETHING regardless of how hopeless the situation may be.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        or I could keep going and keep living my life, providing for my family and hope that the world I leave them with is not the same world you describe.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But hope alone isn’t going to keep the world from
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being exactly as I describe it - and that’s my ultimate point.  I’m not being a jerk to you by saying this, mind you, but it’s actually really a very irresponsible thing to just rely upon hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again,
       <em>
        fuck
       </em>
       hope.  It’s the cowards m.o.  If you’re in a shit situation and your choices are either to get fucked badly and die or at least TRY to fight your way out of it…then sitting there w/your hands over your head afraid and “hoping” that things turn out right will NOT get you out of that situation.  You might end up dead regardless, but at least FIGHT to get yourself out of there!
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope constitutes nothing but someone saying “Ohhh…I hope things don’t go badly!”  Uh…well…if it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       going badly for you, then you gotta stop hoping and start DOING at that point.  Hope is done at that point.  It’s time to ACT.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hope is not lost, Hope fuels change.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So then don’t talk about hope!  Talk about and advocate CHANGE!
      </p>
      <p>
       You see the difference with that?  Change can constitute ACTION.  Hope is further removed from it and doesn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps this is just a semantic quibble on my part, but I don’t entirely think it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by the way - and
       <em>
        again
       </em>
       I stress - I’m not actually using “fighting words” w/you here, okay?  If we were talking in person, you would know that I’m not being an irate asshole toward you.  I’m just trying to really state that hope alone is empty.  When you said “change”, however, that’s more likely to constitute actual ACTION - which is what’s needed to do something about the shit situation that exists.  That’s all.

       dont worry, I'm not taking what you say badly, in fact you make a lot of sense, and I agree hope alone doesn't do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       you have to understand that from the position of some people "across the pond" we can action or influence change as much as possible, you can do everything thats in your power to shift the future into the direction you deem the positive one, but there is a limit to what 1 individual can do. We cant all run for president in our countries, we can inform the public and investigate the corruption using the resources made available to us but ultimately when it comes to the most important job in America and possibly the world all we can do from this distance is Hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that the American public make the right choice.
Hope that Trump sticks to what he says.
Hope that he isn't pulled in by the globalist groups.
Hope that America Allies with Russia.
Hope that the MSM get whats coming to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say hope fuels change I'm thinking of examples where I'm having a discussion with someone on a forum I dont even know, and I'm sharing my thoughts like "I hope he wins" which sparks conversation - Why? leading to logical discussion and then "HOPEFULLY" providing this person (american) with enough information to "CHANGE" his original choice if it is no longer the logical choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope is far from dead, once again hope fuels change, and just because people have hope does not mean they don't take action, you can take as much action as you want and still hope for the outcome. So as much as I agree with most of your sentiments I think the whole "Fuck hope" idea is a negative energy you portray that does not help or influence change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone who has lost hope will not take the time to Vote, or get out of bed in the morning, they wont care about their careers, its hope that drives people, you might argue this point and say something like "well I lost hope and I still do all these things" but again I will disagree with you, the absence of all hope for a better future would be a contradiction to action.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've worked with people who have lost hope, war vets who are in homeless shelters no longer supported by their governments and feel like the establishment has forgotten about them even thought they were willing to give up their lives for it, you can see when someone has been drained of all hope and its not a pretty site, I work hard to give them hope and show them that all is not lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you understood this.

       I typed out a long response, but ultimately, I generally agree w/what you’ve said and that long response isn't really necessary to send at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope is okay so long as you also ACT on that hope.  Otherwise, it’s completely empty and it’s better if you just not hope at all.

       I think its pretty probable that Trump has been part of TPTB for quite a long time, will continue to be part of TPTB for quite a long time, and that the elections outcome was going to favor TPTB, regardless of who "won".
       <br/>
       We will see in time if Trump is legit or not, but so far i have heard him praise HRC in his acceptance speech, and read articles about leaders in Israel being thrilled to have him in the white house.

       I get what you saying, I'm just thinking that praising HRC must have been really hard for him and it was a result of his advisers who convinced him to walk the high road, it would have looked really bad if it went the other way especially since it would be a personal attack on Clinton Supporters too who were still in shock.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Israel being thrilled I haven't read anything about this yet but if its true I would imagine its somewhat like whats going on in the rest of the worlds countries, ministers and politicians who spent a good part of the election run badmouthing TRUMP are now covering their tracks and switching sides not to muddy the waters with the US, its just a natural defense mechanism kicking in as every poll everywhere suggested it would be a landslide victory for Clinton, hell some newspapers still went out with congratulation to the first female president. lol.

       As both are normal human behavior on a spectrum, theoretically a narcissist could become a psychopath if that person would score high on both spectra. Unlikely, but not impossible.  An event or a series of events (POTUS) impact could result in this change.

       Depends on the definition of psychopath being used. A narcissist has a severe psychological issue in which they create a false sense of self in which they believe with 100% potent delusion, as a defense mechanism against unbearable shame. Whereas by psychopath, I mean someone born with brain abnormalities that would make them incapable of experiencing something like shame in the first place. A narcissist could become a pseudo-psychopath via their false self, but they would still be a narcissist beneath it, and thus still manipulated very easily by an actual psychopath.

       Trump will be easier to control than Clinton and the Republicans now have full control over government to push through their neoliberal corproate agenda. As long as he personally benefits and enriches himself he wont give a flying fuck about 'The People'.

       Depends on the definition of psychopath being used. A narcissist has a severe psychological issue in which they create a false sense of self in which they believe with 100% potent delusion, as a defense mechanism against unbearable shame. Whereas by psychopath, I mean someone born with brain abnormalities that would make them incapable of experiencing something like shame in the first place. A narcissist could become a pseudo-psychopath via their false self, but they would still be a narcissist beneath it, and thus still manipulated very easily by an actual psychopath.
