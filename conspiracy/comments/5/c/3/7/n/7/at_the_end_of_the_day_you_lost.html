        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Indeed, you still lost. Me? I&#39;m apolitical and recognized many years ago that the global elite are NOT going to allow the common joe to decide the leadership of the richest and most advanced country on the globe, by filling in bubbles next to names printed on paper. I also know they aren&#39;t gong to let &quot;electorates&quot; (stooges they have in check) decide anything either. </p>

<p>Me? I checked out of this shit mentally years ago. You can say I&#39;m in the same boat as you are, because I&#39;m physically here and under their thumb, but they have a lot of you mentally. Go ahead and celebrate, cheer that Clinton lost, rejoice in it, share gifts, go to LA LA Land, lol. It doesn&#39;t matter because Trump will do nothing for you. It&#39;s the cycle of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer that will continue on. </p>

<p>Those who are truly marginalized and disenfranchised, will still be exploited for their gain and/or benefit. Innocent people will still be bombed, you&#39;ll still enjoy your pleasures. Economies will still take hits. You&#39;ll still enjoy your pleasures. Disease will still spread. You&#39;ll still enjoy your pleasures. Enjoying your pleasures will continue until they decide they have no need for most of you and then the culling will begin. It will be on your porch. You&#39;ll look to politicians, preachers/pastors, people you looked up to, law enforcement, etc but no one will lift a finger to help you. </p>

<p>Live now because the tomorrow that was promised to you isn&#39;t going to be quite like you expect.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not saying any of this to put any of you down. It&#39;s ok to have a difference of opinions but the division that has been created in this country, on this planet, in recent years, is something we all need to look into but something I feel we won&#39;t correct. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing as you&#39;re not the only person that&#39;s ever figured out that the elite likely owns both sides, I&#39;d recommend not acting all high and mighty about it?

<p>I actually agree with the crux of what you are saying, however , given the extreme scandal and myriad of felonies that were already surrounding Clinton, let us have a day to just be thankful she is not the next president and then we&#39;ll figure it out get on from here? This movement certainly isnt dying just cause Trump won. </p>

<p>Whether Trump is establishment or not, is relevant, but not as much as you may think. His supporters, and most of America right now, largely, are not. He will be as scrutinized as any president has ever been. The efforts of theorists will not cease, nor go unnoticed. </p>

<p>The elite / corruption / media collaboration / hidden agendas / propaganda / everything we take on is actually coming to the forefront of attention, more so than it ever has in history. Big moves are being made, not just on the side of TPTB, but against them to. Give it some time. </p>

<p>Revolutions don&#39;t happen over night, and there&#39;s an ever increasing number of people on it, which seems to at least be making an impact now. That&#39;s a good thing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m certainly cautious, and will always remain so, but it&#39;s okay to be hopeful sometimes too. </p>

<p>So now that we have that settled let&#39;s move on.</p>

<p>Do you want to know why many business fail? In many instances it&#39;s the wrong team, no definitive go forward plan and no exit strategy. I want you to think about that and then compare it to your &quot;figure it out&quot; statement.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Incorrect for several reasons. Will people scrutinize his birth certificate? Will they call him a Muslim? Will they refuse to work with him due to the color of his skin but pass it off as something else? I&#39;m no fan of Obama, he&#39;s with them as well, but NO president in the history of the US faced more scrutiny than he did. The first &quot;black&quot; president of the US? <strong>None.</strong></p>

<p>Give it time? Time against people with nukes? With chemical weapons? With the power to put you and your children in debt with the stroke of a pen? With the power to make you disappear? See, they know who you are. Do you <em>really</em> know who they are? I&#39;m going to ask that question again, do you really know who they are? If so, who are they?</p>

<p>Too divided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally get what your saying, so forgive me if my response seemed combative (I wasn&#39;t trying to be). </p>

<p>My point is just that we are all aware that the game is still rigged and there&#39;s people working to fight this system that will not stop just because Hillary didn&#39;t win. These movements will continue, and intensify given everything that has been brought to light recently. Last night was just a much needed, however temporary, sigh of relief for the millions of people like myself that were extremely worried about the outcome of a Hillary Clinton presidency. This year has been awful, and even though Trump may not be the greatest alternative, he&#39;s still an alternative (and one whose base actually really hates TPTB and establishment) so thats why your seeing all the excitement. But we all know there is still much work to be done. Even on Trump should he prove to be establishment. </p>

<p>I agree America is extremely divided... I wish we could come together but ya, I doubt that will happen, especially with someone as divisive as him in office. </p>

<p>Anyway, long road ahead, for sure. But you are among a growing number of peers on here, not sheep. Stay woke :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not set in stone. There are many different possibilities. Trump is surely a member of their club, but so was Hitler; he tried to go it alone and look what happened. In today&#39;s age, anything&#39;s possible. His &quot;movement&quot; is based on 50 million + Americans who are pissed off AND armed. </p>

<p>Now that&#39;s the largest military in the world. </p>

<p>Not to mention the military loves Trump, and the country; and wouldn&#39;t (most of them) do what your saying unless they we&#39;re mind controlled (certainly a possibility, though the extent would be unknowable in some circumstances). </p>

<p>Anyway, I agree with most of what your saying I just don&#39;t think it will be as easy for them to pull off this &quot;culling&quot; as you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can appreciate your opinion, this is America after all. I feel it&#39;s little bit of a defeatist outlook. We are only in the beginning of any type of change in this country. Trump now has both the House and Senate. The past few administrations have not had that luxury. What remains to be seen is if he holds up his end on his promises. In my opinion what is happening world wide not just in the U.S. is the uprising against oppression of the people. We can find our way to restructure our society for the good of all. I believe there are technologies for free energy, medicines to cure cancer, and other things that would release our need for any type of monetary system that enslaves us. Stay tuned to see if we as a nation have the courage to manifest that type of true freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate you taking the time to respond and respect your opinion as well. No, I don&#39;t see it as a defeatist outlook but simply accepting reality and history for what they are. Where do you see uprising against oppression of the people? Palestine? Egypt? Libya? Syria? Sudan? Iraq? Saudi Arabia? Wherever you see an uprising, you&#39;ll see a puppet government ready to take control. </p>

<p>Yes, there are technologies for free energy, medicine to cure cancer and other things we can utilize aside from fiat currency. However, who owns the tech patents? Most medicine patents? Who is trying to regulate bit coin? Who requires your ID when you deal in tangibles at certain dollar values?</p>

<p>We&#39;ve dug ourselves in a pit, I don&#39;t see any coming back from it. Look at the reports of global warming. Look at the recent studies showing animals dying off. Look at the people out there protesting this new pipeline. What will it take for people, specifically those in this country, like some of those who feel entitled, who have been responding here (not you) to wake up? </p>

<p>In my opinion all these countries have been raped by those elitists that have pillaged their lands for $OIL$ and other resources at the same time creating terrorism by oppressing them to the point of extreme hate. That in turn creates $WAR$. I may be naive and uniformed in my opinion, however have these countries ever had a true chance to find their own way without that type of oppression?</p>

<p>&quot;However, who owns the tech patents? Most medicine patents? Who is trying to regulate bit coin? Who requires your ID when you deal in tangibles at certain dollar values?&quot;</p>

<p>The same elitists that have done what I stated above. That is what is going to make this difficult, but not impossible. When we can peel ourselves away from big corporate dependency and understand there needs to be local, and regional resources for the things we need we can step away from that. At some point this type of movement will disintegrate that corporate reign.  </p>
