       There's a secret society within our own government (shadow government / intelligence junta / intelligence coup / fifth column / illuminati, whatever you want to call them) called the
       <strong>
        7th floor group
       </strong>
       , which seems to be based upon the 7 society, which is a secret society like the skull and bones.  This 7 society exists in more than 5 ivy league universities--they are a secret ruling class of political elites, so we don't really know what they call themselves...G77 or something..but they are everywhere, we just know that when they make financial transactions they use a bunch of 7s and 33s and 55s so that you know it was them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe
       <a href="https://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/A4276BA6-CF6E-8995-4C91-9ED993EC7D98#-46">
        from my research
       </a>
       that this group is an interface between Jesuits and Freemasons, because of Bill's connections to paramasonic orgs american legion and demolay, and because of the very close ties of people around them--gingrich--and the intelligence community to the vatican (catholic intelligence agency--all heads of the intelligence agencies in teh national security council are jesuits--google "obama national security council jesuits")

       These people are so dispicable, but also so VERY arrogant and VERY sloppy, that they think their cute little occultic / spycraft numbers game is something we're not going to figure out.  Except that we're finding out faster than we can even imagine and it's snowballing.

       There was a 7 society at my university. Definitely the most secret one there. Also, Obama said he talked to Trump at 3:30am last night.

       33 is a significant number for them because it's a direct homage to the percentage of fallen angels who became demons upon Earth. According to the legend of Lucifer's fall from heaven, a
       <strong>
        THIRD
       </strong>
       of the rebellious angels who attempted a coup were caste from heaven to the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1/3 of 100% = 33.3%
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So what they are surreptitiously encoding and conveying when they utilise and honour this infernal number is that they are humans in the service of Satan's crew of the original 33% of demonic angels. This is also linked to why 33° is the known and admitted highest degree within Freemasonry.

       Look up MNKD stock and the 05 gang. Some random person has been posting about the "05 gang" on the yahoo financial message board for MNKD for years and how they manipulate the price of that one stock. The key thing is, when they make trades, they never do it in blocks of 100s, they always have a 5 at the end of whatever number of stock they are selling/purchasing.

       I seriously wonder if this is a shoutout to the other members letting them know when they are selling/purchasing. Speaking in code to a degree.

       g=7 also it has the same  spiritual significance
      </p>
      <p>
       numerology is old method numbers 1-9 each have an energy a planet and a process that chain around us whether we are conscious of what our numbers are or not
      </p>
      <p>
       they never lie
      </p>
      <p>
       i do not think they can be used for black magic purposes
      </p>
      <p>
       but other arts can that still have numerological reference within usually the illumies like the double number effect ..

       777 is a jackpot.  I've only heard of stories where they win a jackpot and it becomes a curse not a blessing.  777 creates gambling addicts, who will trade their car in to buy some lotto tickets.  Gambling is a very negative thing, not positive.  I've only seen it destroy families.  I'm not taking a dig at Trump btw, I just don't like it..I'm anti stock market for the same reason: it's gambling (it's actually worse, because intelligence agencies and high level corporatists can do insider trading because they can control world events that affect the stock market)

       I know you're trying to have an occult conversation here, but I think our problem int his particular conversation is I'm talking about spies and you're talking about magic.  I'm not saying I don't get what you mean. I don't think "magick is bad" or anything like that.  I don't think wiccans are bad people  (unless they supported hillary to the end, because she is a cirimnal).
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly believe in america you practice whatever weird magic rites and rituals--whether religious or otherwise--you want; you can do drugs in your own home and you can play with numerology and magick and have rituals and stuff.  Just don't use fresh blood unless it's yours, and don't rape kids, jail black people for drugs your friends brought in from afganistan in body bags, or steal money and rights from everyone and use 7s to do it--that's all!

        Oh, you most unaware of all the clueless. You have entered the boat very late and have noticed that we are on the high seas. This is about the Clash of Civilizations. It has been planned and has been going on for years. The left is triggered and the rights are triggered. It is about arm against empire, old vs. young, woman against man, black against white, right against left, Christians against Satanists, Christians against Muslims, Jews against Muslims, Alpha Male against Nu Male, heterosexuals against homosexuals etc., etc. They all have their own triggers on which they walk like Pawlow dogs like Schmitzkatze and they fight the other side with vain arguments and often without the will to the other side, or want to understand them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only when we can get rid of it, we realize who has stirred us up against each other. Those who have most of the fact that we are not a homogenous mass that can take care of the really important problems of the world and ultimately override those in the shadow governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Refugees are just a trigger to make the stupidest point clear that something in Denmark is a bit lazy. It has, of course, started with cultural marxism, with the EU's dictatorship, EU propaganda, the senseless wars, the hostility of Russia, the proxy war in Syria, whose refugees we must take up for unsettling reasons, with the support of ISIS, the False Flags , The Color Revolutions, Soros sponsored terrorist groups (often left / Muslim groups), the brainless nation building, the NATO East expansion, to mention just a few highlights. Do you really think there are still refugees? For the Michel, who sees rape and crime rising in the neighborhood of refugee shelters, this may be the case, but some recognize a system behind it consciously undermining and corrupting our economy and our sovereignty. These are not ideological improvements, if we are to accept non-culture, ill-trained and non-adaptive war invasions. This can only be pushed out of pure hatred against our culture. So do not stand behind them, but rather tell us how a mass of people without education and language skills in such a short time want to integrate and why the German population must pay for their social benefits and what they should have it. After all, we have not been asked whether to start a pro-war with Russia in the Ukraine. We have also not been asked whether the US, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Qatar should overthrow the dictator in Syria and support an endless civil war. If these countries want to get rid of their muck themselves and do not want to talk to our conscience as we have to kuschen otherwise we are again the evil Nazis of '33. This does not really impress me personally at all what politically underscores hold of it. They have not noticed the shot and are unaware of the fact that they consume poisoned media, which do not explain to them the true circumstances and extent. This leads to the complete absence of an objective and critical opinion. And because this is a cycle, the media turns to the media again and gives the opinion of them. These confirm what you believe to know because it is identical to the previously instilled opinions. Congratulations on being slaves. Individuals think for themselves and come to opinions, which are sometimes very much against the politically motivated and filtered reporting. For me, Trump Sieg was pretty clear five months ago. I just thought that Hillary's Satan Podesta and Soro's electoral machines could falsify the election, and the election might be rumbling, but the Lügehillary is so unsympathetic that even the entire press could not speak it.

       FB stands for Facebook, which I hate. 777 is just a counter to 666. No reference was intended to

       or some other groups which may or may not use these numbers. I am no believer in numerology or kabbalah. If anything I am a Steve Vai fan and I like his 7 string

       . He uses the 7 a lot and had an album with a compilation called

       with all 7th songs of his previous albums. All spiritual songs.

       Well that's your opinion but i disagree.  I've been studying these 7 people for a while.  It's high level freemasonry, that's why the 777 and the Gs, 7
       <strong>
        <em>
         is
        </em>
       </strong>
       a "G" and vice versa  1A 2B 3C...7G  So GGG or good guy greg is 777 and so is german goo girls--both masonic, both signals.  We know they play with numbers in all aspects of life from media, politcs, music, film and even pornography. We've traced them to their involvement in 9/11 through numerology around WTC, which--most people don't know this--was a work of islamic architecture by a japanese fellow, and the memorial are 2 black 'cubes', like the kaaba, and when you visit the memorial, you walk around them in an islamic ritual fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is done to fool christians into participating in an islamic ritual.  Keep in mind, EIR of larouche publishing, an intelligence group, has a testimony of high level masons confessing that Freemason Albert Pike and inspiration for the masonic splinter org the KKK, among southern dixiecrats was a manichean. We know they're a mafia from their involvemnt in many intrigues most notably p2 and gladio (and now isis or gladio2)
      </p>
      <p>
       Manicheans were mystic persians from before the time of christ, during the time of the vedics and indo-aryans--basically meaning he was a type of paleo-Gnostic.  Gnostics are the so-called "heretics" to traditional Christianity because they believe "you can become God", and masons built DC, so when you look up in the capitol building there's an artwork there called "The apotheosis of George Washington" who was--in fact--the messiah of the masons.  There's a theory that Adam Weishaupt of the illuminati was George washington which I say only because it's intereting not because it's true.  I would like to see evidence of this however, because it's so very odd that the bavarian illuminati and america were both founded in the same year of 1776, which is essentially 777 if you add 1+6.
      </p>
      <p>
       So everything around you has been a masonic trick--they own the world and rule it, and they get away with murder and pedo, and once you have "the eyes to see it" you will be able to help fight it and take down the elements of their org that are hurting people, tricking the past, trying to trick the future and take away your money and your rights and create deep suffering through the chaos they create for us through wars, psyops, and leverage.
