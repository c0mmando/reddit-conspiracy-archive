    <div class="md"><p>These guys are missing the point.  Obama <strong><em>is a part of the emails--he used an alias and was communicating on her private server</em></strong>.  They were using this server to avoid FOIA requests, and god knows what else (probably illegal arms dealing).</p>

<p>This is conspiracy against the public US Governemnt and more importantly against the public.  This is an act of subversion and that&#39;s treason.  They&#39;ve made deals allowing illegal substances to fall into the hands of foreign nationals that ultimately made their way to Iran, and they did this with purposeful, intentional opacity (that&#39;s conspiracy there), by degrading and subverting US intelligence security protocols.  Each email they sent unsecured is an act of wire fraud. Since this server was going and was left in out there for hackers like guccifer and guccifer2 and wikileaks to hack into and compromise also, that&#39;s thousands upon thousands of charges of wirefraud.  Since each mail went unsecured over multiple unsecured systems, that&#39;s 10s to 100s of thousands of instances of wire fraud.</p>

<p>They cannot escape what&#39;s coming to them.</p>

<p>Not unless you want to undermine the entire public US governement and all of it&#39;s laws and consider the FBI wholly irrelevant</p>

<p>I already think they are irrelevant but wait until the larger public really groks what I&#39;m saying here.  </p>

<p>This is why, regardless of whether or not FBI regrows a backbone, I&#39;m already starting my own open source intelligence agency.  I know that sounds retarded to many of you, laughable maybe, but you just wait. I&#39;m going to make it a fre(mium) dotcom, it will be distributed, it will be mirrored through a proxy network on darknet (.onion sites) so it can&#39;t be ddos or fucked with in a way it can&#39;t come back from,  and I will open it up for collaboration for all of you and then we&#39;ll see whose fucking laughing by then.</p>

<p>it will be a site similar to <a href="https://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/D36749F1-3A40-09FA-957F-41294B88CB70#-4902">webbrain</a> because I like how it works and i think doing it in nodejs, meteor with owl/rdf and graphing libs ought to do it.</p>

<p>this is brilliant actually like bitcoin the more we take back from them in trasnparent fashion the more we reclaim our collective destiny .... we should be thinkitanking all sorts of processes we want back in our lives how about HONEST ELECTIONS the fact that we were frauded without bernie this is also treason against the american people we need an attorney general who is not afraid that her granchildren will get raped and eaten  </p>

<p>the goevernment we have right now is depraved out of their collective minds and someone who honors our constitution and has oathed to it needs to round them all up and perc walk them before the american people and straght into jail</p>

<p>let them heel for once</p>

<p>obama is guilty ok just like the others and they need to be accountable for their deeds i also think the bushes and all involed in 911 need to have the same treatment.... </p>

<p>we are at the point where we really dont need out of date institutions like the house and senate we can represent ourselves in the here and now collective.... doncha think</p>
