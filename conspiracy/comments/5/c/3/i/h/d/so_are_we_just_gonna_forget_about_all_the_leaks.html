       did.  Trump looks like he has a good, functional family despite divorce (I mean, who isn't a child of divorce these days?); The Clintons are a hot mess of a 70s style open marriage that includes bisexuality, mysticism, possible child rape, sexual predation, heavy-heavy cocaine use, adultery and sex competition "I've fucked more girls than you, Bill" type of thing

       They said they have 10 weeks of leaks, and I don't see them slowing down anytime soon. She still needs to be brought down, and just because she isn't president doesn't mean she'll be let off this easy. People are still working on it, plenty, and I'm looking forward to her indictment.

       These guys are missing the point.  Obama
       <strong>
        <em>
         is a part of the emails--he used an alias and was communicating on her private server
        </em>
       </strong>
       .  They were using this server to avoid FOIA requests, and god knows what else (probably illegal arms dealing).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is conspiracy against the public US Governemnt and more importantly against the public.  This is an act of subversion and that's treason.  They've made deals allowing illegal substances to fall into the hands of foreign nationals that ultimately made their way to Iran, and they did this with purposeful, intentional opacity (that's conspiracy there), by degrading and subverting US intelligence security protocols.  Each email they sent unsecured is an act of wire fraud. Since this server was going and was left in out there for hackers like guccifer and guccifer2 and wikileaks to hack into and compromise also, that's thousands upon thousands of charges of wirefraud.  Since each mail went unsecured over multiple unsecured systems, that's 10s to 100s of thousands of instances of wire fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       They cannot escape what's coming to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not unless you want to undermine the entire public US governement and all of it's laws and consider the FBI wholly irrelevant
      </p>
      <p>
       I already think they are irrelevant but wait until the larger public really groks what I'm saying here.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why, regardless of whether or not FBI regrows a backbone, I'm already starting my own open source intelligence agency.  I know that sounds retarded to many of you, laughable maybe, but you just wait. I'm going to make it a fre(mium) dotcom, it will be distributed, it will be mirrored through a proxy network on darknet (.onion sites) so it can't be ddos or fucked with in a way it can't come back from,  and I will open it up for collaboration for all of you and then we'll see whose fucking laughing by then.
      </p>
      <p>
       it will be a site similar to

       this is brilliant actually like bitcoin the more we take back from them in trasnparent fashion the more we reclaim our collective destiny .... we should be thinkitanking all sorts of processes we want back in our lives how about HONEST ELECTIONS the fact that we were frauded without bernie this is also treason against the american people we need an attorney general who is not afraid that her granchildren will get raped and eaten
      </p>
      <p>
       the goevernment we have right now is depraved out of their collective minds and someone who honors our constitution and has oathed to it needs to round them all up and perc walk them before the american people and straght into jail
      </p>
      <p>
       let them heel for once
      </p>
      <p>
       obama is guilty ok just like the others and they need to be accountable for their deeds i also think the bushes and all involed in 911 need to have the same treatment....
      </p>
      <p>
       we are at the point where we really dont need out of date institutions like the house and senate we can represent ourselves in the here and now collective.... doncha think

       It will continue. It will likely lose some steam as people let it go, but there are a lot of people that are dedicated and that number can still grow.

       Absolutely not. If anything we should double-down on the research on the off-chance that the FBI thinks it can continue not to do it's job.  At some point, we'll approach Trump with a request to be deputized as a reinstatement of posse comitatus or internet based USMS agents
