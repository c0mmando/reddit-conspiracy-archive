       There is no 'deep' for what has just happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       America just got hoodwinked.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        edit - interesting - you people, sheep actually, think that because I lament the hairy orange paying his way into the white house that I must be for "the other side", and THAT is truly interesting to me! This entire election was decided a long time ago and the person who won, either way, is placed there in order to do the bidding of the people who put him, or her, there. There's no "choice". You didn't vote for the person "who thinks most like you". You haven't elected a president who is going to do what they said they would do.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This elections WAS rigged (and that to me is the funniest thing considering the 'rigging people' telling the public it's rigged - that will keep us laughing for a long fucking time!)... Remember Victoria Vinciguerra in the recent "Man From U.N.C.L.E." movie? When she had Solo pour himself a drink? And he realized, after he had taken a drink, that the drink had been spiked and asked "but how did you know I was going to drink the scotch?" and she replied "I didn't... I laced all the drinks".
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have the money to buy an election, you make sure that everything is bought. I realize most of you have no concept of the amount of money that was pissed away on making sure that whoever you voted for will NOT be working for you.

       Wikileaks has a 10-year record of never releasing a single falsified document, and is not connected to Russia. Everything they released were the actual e-mails of Hillary Clinton and her campaign staff. You had the opportunity to look through a window into the Hillary Clinton campaign, but you didn’t.
By ignoring the leaks, you ignored reality.
By not listening to your fellow Americans, and accusing them of being “conspiracy theorists” and trusting the corporate media, you ignored reality. By only following other liberals on social media, and only reading liberal or corporate news, once again ignoring reality. When Hillary Clinton was caught rigging the primary against Bernie Sanders, and Democrats nominated her anyway they ignored reality.

       If Wikileaks was REALLY a serious and reliable source they would have leaked stuff about HRC (I ve read some of her emails, and I am not especially proud of it just saying... sneaking into somebody privacy/reading somebody else emails without auth is to me a serious matter btw) AND about Trump. Also if Assange had to disapear for some reason / his life (not) compromised, whatsoever, then he could have said/tweeted something such as "he had to go off radar for a while and might continue publsihing emails etc when he could resurface/after election, more quiet/his integrity ok/whatever". Assange not doing so is I believe either Wikileaks is some kind of fanatic group (lol) who doesnt care about its leader (Assange) neither its sources (Bradley Manning) when it matters. Or else that wikileaks has been somehow "compromised" at least since Assange disapeared.

       Not maddening at all! Quite the contrary. I would hate to have any number of people take what I have to say to heart because that would be counterproductive to the goal.

      <p>
       The beauty of addressing a bunch of 'like thinkers' is you can say anything, even the most dire of truths and warnings of imminent destruction, and they'll go on with their agenda until the very end!

      <p>
       I believe this election points that out in grand fashion!
