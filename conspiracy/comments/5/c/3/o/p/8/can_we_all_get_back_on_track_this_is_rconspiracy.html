       They're retooling for the next election. But I'm not sure what their power will be like now that Clinton is done because her connection to Brock was why they had prominence. We could however, see a remanifestation from an organization like Google or Apple.

       I fully expect the left to come out swinging now that we've got the house, senate, and presidency. They'll surely be called something different, but CTR is here to stay.

       After this election, this phrase needs to die.

       NO. It is not politics as usual to have a private email server. It is not politics as usual to pay protestors to incite violence. It is not politics as usual to take donations from countries that support terrorism.

       Uhh... Yes it is. How long have you been following politics?
      </p>
      <p>
       And even though email is relatively new, Colin Powell set the precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only things that weren't politics as usual this cycle was Trump threatening not to heed the results of the election, and threatening to jail/kill his opponent (first times in the US, at least).

       OMG ok, yup CTR is alive and well in your soul. Sorry if you're not getting paid cause that would be uber pathetic.

       You can say he threatened to jail her, or you can say he called her a career criminal. You can say he threatened to not heed the election results, or you could say he reserved his right to challenge them if they came back unusual. The way Trump acted was politics as usual, and if you want citations, all you need to do is reply. :)

       Fair enough. Call me a hopeless romantic but I hope the next four years make Trump and America look awesome. I hope people quit being lazy whiners and actually do something to help that country rather than sitting on their asses blaming politicians for the poor standards of their society. To let it get to this point, the populace had to stop giving a shit.

       I can bet many that you're pointing your finger at have done as much if not more, not everybody is a lazy and entitled whiner, and sometimes there is plenty of reason to whine, and seriously you're in r/conspiracy, open up your damn eyes the politicians
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       at fault. There are so many different factors at work and most of them point to the corruption, ineptitude, and greed of the political class. Why should we suddenly "stop whining" when the problem is still there, and we re-elected many of the worst of them this past election, like Marco Rubio for my state. Also we can't forget the issue that is gerrymandering either, which is another corruption that the political classes have used to keep things broken.

        NO. It is not politics as usual to have a private email server. It is not politics as usual to pay protestors to incite violence. It is not politics as usual to take donations from countries that support terrorism.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Actually that is politics as usual, the examples that Hillary set are a little extreme for that phrase but they all still fall well within that phrase.

       If you've heard it from 800 people but you're the one that still has a problem with it maybe you are the person not getting it, just maybe..

      <blockquote>
       <p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No using it as an excuse needs to die, I can agree on that, but that doesn't make normal every day shady political practices anymore of a conspiracy, it's only a conspiracy when there is an effort to silence, hide, or deny what may or may not be happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point is now I'm seeing posts about Rand Paul repealing Obamacare in this sub and similar political posts, there is no conspiracy there, unless you want to go into how the Right had completely undermined our government in order to fuck over Obama's presidency, now that can be a conspiracy, and should be, but once again most of that falls into politics as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       The newcomers to this sub really need to learn the difference between actual conspiracies and everyday politics, sometimes they aren't too different but there is always a difference.

       First, It wasn't my job to help OP support his claim. Obviously you did it for them. Otherwise, considering the election was plagued with ridiculous claims, solid evidence of illegality and conspiracy...I think, the above links can be excused given the pulse of this sub. It's been mostly politics for some time now (even before the election got going). That's why places like
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T
       </a>
       have gotten more traffic, as well as more specific conspiracy-oriented subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying I agree with it, but it's the direction the community went. Also, I'd throw a lot of credit to this sub, actually. Coupled with 4chan,
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       ..I firmly believe this sub helped get the email stuff out there to people on social media. Those who don't normally entertain such ideas, etc. So, there's something to be said for that. A collaborative effort took place and I think it helped keep Hillary out of power and defeat the silent media at their own game.

       I guess my hang up is that if people let their political opinions get in the way too much, it makes it difficult to have an honest and open conversation about conspiracies IMO. So much of being able to see the big picture and look past the bullshit requires the ability to consider ideas that may challenge your worldview/partisan bias.

       I could agree with that. Matter of fact, just 5 minutes ago I seen one somebody posted here as a "big fuck you to the media". No substance. It's pretty much just that. So, I can understand..though I don't think the sub will clean up much. At least not anytime soon after the election hangover. It's become a safe place to vent:

       Do you have a preferred conspiracy list? as far as this sub is concerned most conspiracies are politically related. If you are  interested in non -political conspiracies like aliens, lizards and flat earth no one is stopping you from bringing that discussion on the board. The sub has become been politically skewed as it remedies censorship in many Reddit subs. The best way to engage the sub is to post a discussion you want to be included in.

       IMO there's a difference between purely political posts and posts that are political but relate to a conspiratorial subject. For example, there's a post on the front page of this sub about how "Hillary doesn't have the emotional stability to give a concession speech but wanted to be the president":
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5c0p9j/clinton_doesnt_even_have_the_emotional_stability/?st=IVBRE6SM&amp;amp;sh=aa375e36">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that Hillary isn't liked around here but I don't see how that post was relevant to any discussion on a sub meant to discuss conspiracies.

       Trump’s positions are not far-anything anymore. They are CENTRIST. They are the status quo. Our job is to hold him to task and to push things further right than him now.

       I am, I'm just responding to all the off topic posts on this subreddit, it's
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , it's for conspiracies, but alot of the posts are just solely politics. I respond to any post I see that is trying to paint trump as a racist, but this subreddit is for conspiracies not politics, if you see people trying to paint trump as a racist in this subreddit, respond, but don't just post your political opinions on a subreddit meant for conspiracies.

       Almost all truthful politics... belongs in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . There is a natural ebb and flow to the topic set, but I'm just happy to see very few flat Earth topics.

      <p>
       I hope
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       goes back to the way it was in the days of Swartz, but I'm not holding my breath.
      </p>
      <p>
       People up and downvote content based on whether they find it relavent to the subreddit. That's enough to bring us back online.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you, of course... but I've always enjoyed
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and it will naturally veer back to aliens, yeti and the flat earth in time. For now, I'm just enjoying the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was never a time where I preferred another subreddit, since I joined. I've never had a problem with the content on this page. 20-40% has always been bullshit... but the rest is GOLD.

       I love this subreddit.
