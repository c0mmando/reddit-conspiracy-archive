         The mother, not the accused father, is attacked by the establishment and blamed for coaching the kids. The physical abuse is also blamed on her and her boyfriend. Talk of satanic rituals is completely brushed aside. Custody of the kids is handed over to social services, members of which were included in the children's accusations. [

       I would like to inform you, that if you believe this, you probably only read the titles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched the interviews.  There is one very specific liveleak of the mother and her boyfriend coaching the kids on what to say.  (which is somewhere in here -&gt;
       <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/browse?q=hampstead">
        http://www.liveleak.com/browse?q=hampstead
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       These kids, were without a doubt, being coached.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they were asked questions, they answered in unison.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one, 100%, they went after the correct culprate, which makes me happy, except, people want to believe the insane story, instead of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going to attempt to find the video, inside it shows the children being coached.  Perhaps you linked it with the material.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mother and stepfather raped them, then made the satanic cult story, along with accusing the father.

       Because they would each tell it in their own words, as opposed to scripted behavior.

      <p>
       Let's say you and your buddy saw a murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask you both aloud, "What happened?".
      </p>
      <p>
       Will your words match?  Or do you each speak in your own words?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what if I told you what happened, then i told your buddy what happened, and I said "A car came down the road, stopped, two men got out, and the tall one shot the other."
      </p>
      <p>
       if someone then asked you what happened individually, would your words match, or be different?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine i drilled the story into your head over and over.  How long before you are repeating exactly what I told you?

       Kids were raped and your main goal is to firmly, officially, and undoubtedly assure everyone on here that they were lying about the satanic cult...because they spoke in unison...you know how that looks right

       Every time someone uploads or links to videos with identifying imagery of those kids' faces, those children have their privacy rights violated. If you want to show those videos, have the decency to at least use blurred footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, this story is bogus. The kids were coerced into lying on camera and to police by the mother and her boyfriend as part of a custody battle. The mother's boyfriend violently abused the children, and the mother knew. And they starved the kids on a diet of pure hempseed, causing the school to contact social services because the kids were desperately hungry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aanlrfan and anon, who relentlessly promoted this story, and all their sycophants, got it horribly wrong. This is not a case of satanic pedophilia. Or baby murder. And the tanning of baby skin. Or drinking of baby blood ritualistically, as claimed. It's just a badly executed smear campaign in a custody battle that backfired.
      </p>
      <p>
       And these poor kids will have that video spread all over the internet for the rest of their lives. Because assholes care more about their religious and political agenda than about those kids' privacy.

       That's not what I am saying.  THEY WERE RAPED.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the mother and stepfather.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know the grandparents even came out and said they thought it was 'nonsense' - luckily those close to the kids, other than the rapist mother and stepfather have some fucking common sense.

       This sub is full of morons, and for my own sanity, I can't be a part of it.  It's fucking aids. I'm sad people like you exist.
