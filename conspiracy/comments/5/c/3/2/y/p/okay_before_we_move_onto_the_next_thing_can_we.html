       we need to do something about Podesta and the elite trash that harm defenseless children.  They may have everyone from FBI to CIA to police force in their pockets.  But if it saves 1 child it's all worth it.

       We need to shine a spotlight, we need vigilance, we need to terminate with extreme prejudice!

       This shit is 100% real.  There is a code in the spam.  The spam is the same spam that was used in shitty online game spamrooms in the mid-00's.  They have hidden in plain sight, and then switched over to email because it's "more secure" but they didn't change their code.  They hide codephrases in the URLs of legitimate spam, the URLs go to real places and it all looks fine.  The codephrases are then SEO'd to get you to yahoo chat groups where they talk in code, see below:
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I need someone to look at this and tell me if I'm just being crazy, or if this may be something...
It all started with this email:

John, Brennan is interested and thinks he can sign forms. can he proceed as proposed below?

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok? That's a pretty glaringly horrible breach of protocol if they're using some sort of code. I mean, not only did the original message imply that the random link below contained important information, but podesta later confirms it by responding with Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are quite a few seemingly nonsensical emails in podestas inbox, usually containing links that only seem like genuine urls as long as you don't look at them too hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find quite a few of them by just searching for "games.com".
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't have any luck trying to load "
       <a href="http://www.games.com?ncid=emlcntusgame00000001">
        http://www.games.com?ncid=emlcntusgame00000001
       </a>
       ". However, doing a google search for "emlcntusgame00000001" turned up a couple of very sketchy yahoo groups and various other websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first one I found was this:
       <a href="http://classics-l.lsv.uky.narkive.com/Q42Y0ahx/the-boy-who-read-between-the-lines">
        http://classics-l.lsv.uky.narkive.com/Q42Y0ahx/the-boy-who-read-between-the-lines
       </a>
       Go ahead and read it. More nonsensical conversations that stress the importance of "reading between the lines".
This next one made me a little uncomfortable:
       <a href="https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/MKBreeders/conversations/topics/6715">
        https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/MKBreeders/conversations/topics/6715
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       SOMEONE NEEDS TO APPLY THIS TACTIC TO ALL THE EARLY PODESTA EMAILS!!!!! The ones that made people say shit liek "damn these peopel get a lot of spam"

       Due to the topic you don't need your IP address on some list somewhere as someone who accessed a pedo site, even if by accident. And I feel that even worse if the offenders are somehow able to target you. That's scary to me.

       Nobody seems to be focusing on these two emails, which are extremely bizarre, explicit, and disturbing (seems to describe at least one instance of violent abuse. also notice how there is no noted sender or receiver):

       Just a thought regarding the bizarre anonymous email (first link). Consider this snippet:
      </p>
      <p>
       "thepictureswill help. youwill seethat theyhaVeagroupof sexual predators, deviants ruftil rampantoverthere. no, theyarenotjammingguysintheasspersay, buttheyare shay/C.1;"
      </p>
      <p>
       does anybody think there's any sort of advantage to conflating the words together in this way? i considered that it might make searching a little more difficult, only crude/naive searching algorithms would get tripped up by something like this, so i kind of doubt it.

       It's seemingly unrelated although it shares the same case number..? It could just have to do with the army's categorization techniques, no idea, but if that's true then they don't seem very sensible, or they're intentionally ambiguous

       It's just tough - if internet sleuths spread their net wide enough, we'll be attacking random businesses and individuals with any passing resemblance to any supposed symbol or code word possible. I get the desire to seek out signs and new "dots" to fit into the picture, but it can go downhill pretty quickly...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and what's worse, if the Internet sleuths are wrong, legitimate businesses and ordinary people are harmed. IMO people should be a lot more careful with throwing this sort of language around, but on this sub, anyone who suggests anything like that is flagged as a shill or disinfo/cointel agent, so we've sorta built our own perfect machine for creating these situations.

       Yeah, totally agree, innocent until proven guilty should be a key priority. One could argue that most of this lies on the shoulders of those who uncover the original information and how they deal with it, but I think it's also up to everybody to remember the potential ramifications of propagating that information across the web. For better or for worse, these emails and images have shown the world far too much blatantly / borderline pedophilic content to simply turn a blind eye - something very "off" that involves children has happened here.

       I honestly hope that nothing evil is happening and everything is in some way coincidental, but the links are very difficult to ignore (admittedly the exceptionally deranged nature of these links/allegations makes them more emotionally intense), and we unfortunately cannot always rely on traditional systems to take the initiative required to find real, hard evidence.

      <p>
       In any case, people should try to keep this concept in mind:

       That 2nd email sounds like a kid emailing "Sir" to report a problem of some other kids giving him a problem. Maybe these kids have access to computers but only get to send emails/use the computer within the network at where ever they are?.
      </p>
      <p>
       They give these kids alcohol (but it seems it's regulated by "signed"/ "not signed". I feel like it's just a big private school-like place and the higher ups get to leave whenever. And do whatever to the kids.

       100% agree.  Supposedly it's about munchkin cats or some shit, but w/e.

      <p>
       Another good poitn that someone has made is that the group itself might not be in on the ring, but the term "MKBreeders" might also be another level of indirection that you're supposed to follow.  LOOK FOR MORE SPAM EMAILS! FOLLOW SECRET TERMS LETS DO THIS GUYS SAVE THE KIDS!!

       There is mention of both kittens and alters

       Cathy O'Brien claims to have been a kitten in MKUltra you can look her up on YouTube. She does sound insane( but after a childhood of trauma who wouldn't be)
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also see a video of her mutilated vagina (they carved a face into her vulva) which she claims was performed by her captors. It's pretty disturbing and I find it hard to believe someone would do that to themselves

       can you post about this? explain the steps people would need to take to repeat your sleuthing, how to find new search terms, and suggestions on keeping yourself protected (ie tor or what not).

       sounds like something that needs crowd sourcing. and maybe a therapy group.

       I'm fucking too scared to click on anything i think this is 100% real, someone else did this and I realized they're a fucking genius and need to share it with everyone.  Imo here it is:
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 1) Find spam email
Step 2) Find link that spam email is trying to get you to click out to
Step 3) find term in spam link + google it
Step 4) find group + look for weird messages 
step 5) ???
Step 6) prfoit

       Looks like it might be a legit cat breeding group.  It looks like they sell kittens/ adult cats.  Alter would refer to spayed/neutering.  Some of it sounds weird but I think they are using arcane cat breeding terms if you look through more of the messages there.  I can't believe people breed cats to look like this though.

       Sounds like your typical dope smoking English majors.  I don't say that to discredit anything, its well known, or maybe not, that Intelligence services recruit bright young minds in liberal arts as they consider them "well-rounded" and "very adaptive".
      </p>
      <p>
       Could be the case with these folks and we are getting a peek into a circle of operators who have been in the game for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anderson Cooper is a fine example, although his major was officially PolySci, he came from an established liberal arts secondary school and "travelled" extensively before embarking on his collegiate career.  Even has an established "illness" that excused his abscense from the country for the duration of his training.

       Many of Susane Rice's emails from her computer end with these "game.com" spam links (she also sends them from her phone but those have a signature and have no spam). Might be worth seeing the rest of these links?
      </p>

       Edit: think it's just her that has the spam but I'll check the rest of these recipients.

        Susan Rice's other emails

       . They all have advertisements added to them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        However, doing a google search for "emlcntusgame00000001" turned up a couple of very sketchy yahoo groups and various other websites.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I just did that search. They were all email messages from people using AOL in October of 2008 that had the same advertisement added to their emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you have found that one of Podesta's correspondents used AOL email and is thus linked to the millions of other people who used AOL email in 2008.

        1)  notice the name in the URL - MKBreeders ! Does this have to do with rings of familys that willingly produce MKULTRA victims?

        which reads "This list is for everyone that loves Munchkin cats, both the shorthaired (MK) and longhaired (ML), pet owners and breeders alike. This is a tightly moderated list and will not tolerate any form of abuse towards it's members. This includes the forwarding of emails with the intent to do the author "harm". Open partcipation by all is encouraged, there is no need for ugly words or comments about or towards other members to get a point across. No warning will be given, the person(s) being unfriendly and ugly will be moderated..if subsequent emails show more antagonistic responses or comments they will be promptly removed from the list. These kinds of responses and attacks keep others from participating in discussions. Advertising a personal business is not allowed. You may discuss anything related to the Munchkins and their future. Limited discussion will be tolerated of the new hybrid breeds being developed because they are borrowing the dwarfisim gene from the Munchkins. Cat husbandry, cat food, diseases, deformities, litter choices, and other topics cat related are welcome. Encouraged are: litter announcements, show wins/brags are a pleasure to hear about, and any problems with litters or individual cats. We need to openly discuss any problems encountered with the Munchkins so that we, as a group, can improve our precious cat's lives. There is no such thing as a stupid question except the one that is not asked. If it is discovered that a person has joined under false pretenses they will be immediately banned."
       </li>
       <li>
        5) notice the misspelling of participation - "partcipation" par-tcip-ation - I believe I remember something from WikiLeaks or somewhere about a misspelling of participation ... a lot of websites, computers, and phones have autocorrect so it may be interesting to note this

        6) also on info page "Founded: Feb 24, 1999"
       </li>
       <li>
        7) ok I have been looking over it for a while - either this is boring and just about breeding short legged cats which is weird in itself .. or idk but I agree the links to weird not 'game' sites is strange ...

       This is weird but I got curious and randomly looked up the reading between the lines link, and I saw the "swimming pool library" under the person's name and i found that it comes from a book, this is the wikipedia description from the book:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Swimming-Pool Library is slang for the changing-room to which he and his friends would slip in the middle of the night for illicit sexual activities. Also, at Charles Nantwich's home there is a room that has served as a library and was once a Roman bath. And, Will borrows trashy homoerotic novels from one of the lifeguards at the Corinthian club. The club, then, is a swimming pool library."

       Jesus fucking christ.  Like, I'm super aware of the fact that brains try to make everything related and find patterns where there are none, but the fact that everyone comes back around to child rape in some form or fashion is just too fucking coincidental for me.  Coupel with that the fact that elite pedo ring stories have existed for YEARS and always come up with nothing leads me to believe that this is the fucking real deal.

       Yes yes yes. More light. Can't let them run and hide. I've been seeing more people making YouTube videos and more news sites picking it up. We shouldn't stop until every single person in the country knows about this  – and the MSM will still be silent, which will be the last straw.

       A prosecutor who was presented with the evidence available right now would definitely have probable cause to issue search warrants and launch an investigation. But yeah, since redditors don't have the ability to 'obtain search warrants' all they can do is look at the information that's publicly available. If you don't think that information warrants at least worth launching a formal investigation then you need to look a little deeper.

       It's called circumstantial evidence and it can be used in court. While not enough to convict on it's own, it's a start. It could be used for probable cause in order to obtain a search warrant to gather additional, more concrete evidence.

       One could presumably find an expert to confirm the language in the emails is typically used by pedophiles. Then you'd just need a judge to sign a warrant.

       I notice that you, on another post, did actually take the time to check whether the Andrew Kline that owns Uptown Pizza was the same one who had been at the DOJ. So, I know you're not completely hopeless. You're still willing to look at evidence.

       Look back at the "evidence" that Podesta is a child molester. There's
       <em>
        nothing

       there. People are just making shit up. Anything that's out of the ordinary (and plenty of ordinary things) are being construed as having something to do with pedophilia.

       You can zoom in less and see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might have to look at you screen on the right angle as LCD screens are very angle dependant, but even in the unaltered image with only 200% zoom or less it can be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, I can see it without even zooming in looking at the original image on a 15.6 inch laptop screen, it doesn't stand out as much, but if your vision isn't poor it's plain to see.

       The sad thing with social media is you have lots of clueless people who take a passing interest in politics but only have time to digest sensationalist headlines before bleeting their uninformed opinions at the top of their lungs, then you have lots of other people who dont really care either way but parrot the vocal minorities and MSM because 1) its less likely to lead them in to a debate that they have no real knowledge about and 2) it gets them 'likes'

       As a Brit it was a nice break to have them talking about your elections rather than Brexit for a change but im sure they will get back to it soon. Im sorry to say but if Brexit is anything to go by you have most likely got many more months of it to come, people trying to subvert democracy, blaming old white men and praising assasination attempts while claiming to hold the moral high ground. I feel your pain brother, stay strong!

       Jacob Rothschild is still walking the streets. Dick Cheney, George Bush, Netanyahu, WJC, the list goes on... Jeffery Epstein is a fuckin' Bourgeois Gentilhomme. Hell, with the pedo thing, Jimmy Sevile got to walk the streets until he passed on.

       Pedosta is a veiled reference to John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's chairman of her campaign and Bill Clinton's former chief of staff. My purposeful misspelling of his last name was a pun in reference to the pedophilia accusations being levied at him based on some strange coded emails uncovered by wikileaks
      </p>
      <p>
       Its best to get information about correct the record directly from itself: "Correct The Record is a strategic research and rapid response team designed to defend Hillary Clinton from baseless attacks". Which in non-political jargon, means its her personal misinformation team that infiltrates social media sites (like reddit for example)

       Im not too clued up on the subject myself but what i could gather from reading the 4Chan thread was that the person who gained access downloaded two (i think) of the files of different sizes and when opened they both contained the same pizza menu but the size of the pizza menus didnt match the size of the files themselves, meaning there is a good posibility something else is hidden within those files. There was also a screenshot of the page before it was blocked, some of the files had VERY strange names for something you would find on a pizza website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately the site owners got wind of the access and blocked it, people on 4Chan were trying to find ways to re-gain access and ways to find out what was really in the files but hadn't had any luck since i last checked yesterday

       that is an excellent idea.  I've been cautious with my wording on how to discuss the pedo stuff with people, because even someone who is "awake" politically doesn't usually consider the darker side of the country's leadership.  we joked about it, but this gets pretty real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though I always knew clintons were connected with scandal, watching the clinton murders documentary and reading on arkancides messed me up for a couple days.  I'm pretty desensitized personally, I imagine most couldn't handle this, so how can we "handle" it for them.

       Yes. Please please please do NOT stop talking about this. This is more important than our reputations. We cannot afford to let this sink into darkness again. Please do not allow another "conspiracy of silence" to take hold, if people forget about this. Then the topic will be relegated back to shrugs and dismissal. People are slightly receptive right now. They NEED to hear this. There has never been a better time.

       We need to ask for help because we can't do it all ourselves. We need to arrive with humility and explain what we are doing is difficult and uncomfortable, but ultimately necessary, and that it is for the greater good.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to summarize the main points in an easy to digest infographic/meme/video or whatever it is. Jesus... it's gonna be an undertaking, but I agree with you.

       wow.  amazing approach.  I got chills considering reaching out to the religious communities in this way.  Even if it's a semi-mass anonymous email to community leaders/members.  This approach expresses dire importance and tragic-ness to the situation.

       I believe that humility is key when trying to communicate. It's very hard to get your point across if everyone is yelling.
      </p>

       Calm, concise and direct... but with humility and understanding and reverence towards the spirit of Truth and Good.

       Remember, many religious "leaders" of different faiths and denominations are involved in this type of ring/abuse as well. They may try to bury this as much as your average corrupt politician.

       I think even getting the support of wikileaks is huge.  I know they've been sharing a bunch of different outside articles now, but if we get it to everyone that will run it.  But I think we need to do some more digging, and our talented coders more cracking.  Wikileaks aren't turning away neither should we.

       It's true. It's so dark, people
       <em>
        want

       to believe it "can't be true" because it's so painful. They turn away. It's going to take a big awakening and probably some pretty hard evidence.

       The problem with this is the cognitive dissonance. The Catholic church and it's ties to pedophilia are pretty concrete. Podesta is a Catholic Jesuit Homosexual.. So what, right?

       The primetime entertainment on tv, movies, have been flooded with shows like Lucifer, Salems Lot. Vampires were popular. On the  surface they are just shows but the dark realities with which they are portrayals of are blown off as fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can show America the Olympics, and have themwatch it with their children. And then inject a
       <a href="http://usagymnastics.zenfolio.com/p201689933/h79dcd438#h7a9baf84">
        symbol like this
       </a>
       into their consciousness, and they wouldn't even notice or believe it was a Satanic one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just like pizza is a code. There is ' The Satan Code' for lack of a better term. Which is throughout media. Disney has it, their Logo has 666 in it for starters. But it's entertainment for children. But it's there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we are dealing with codes in plain site. They have to communicate over their channels. They own the tv, the movies. They communicate their programs. They cover you in their news, and saturate your entertainment with their coded messages.

       and seeing this more and more with podesta emails and comet-ping-pong stuff.  It's scattered across instagrams and the web in plain sight.  I assume law enforcement and agencies won't touch it because it's their elites who pay their bills and hold the high offices.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if the powers that be had it their way they would censor the entire web, have TPP created companies "enforcing" internet control.   The spotlight now allow our country to clean house, drain the swamp if you will, before it gets too far from us.  If we can do that i think that would be long lasting victory for net neutrality.

       I actually kind of disagree.  I think that and the occult labeling puts it in the 'conspiracy only' bubble for a lot of people.  It kind of did with my religious upbringing.  It was just part of stories of fantasy, witches and magic, and things to watch out for.

       Satanic Occult label should take a back seat, but 'child murder/mutilation' that needs to be at the top.  But addressed gingerly as not to send the average person running in disgust.

       I think he had personal drawings that showed stuff like electro torture on the mind and body. He was also pushed into showbiz from early age, he spoke out about a group of powerful people controlling everything before the pedo allegations (IIRC), some of his videos have the standard questionable symbols in them and if you're clued up on human psychology; abuse/trauma victims can fall into a state of mind where they take on the role of either protector, perpetrator and there's another state of mind one can go into. I forgot the last one but in psychology they refer a triangle to it. It's been awhile since I read into it but if I find a link, I'll make an edit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Mike Jackson went protector mode and built a huge safe haven for kids, knowing what shit was being done to them? Idk.
      </p>
      <p>
       But If you go deep into the rabbit hole, Hollywood and the music industry are most certainly linked with MKultra or MK sub programmes. There's just far too many coincidences when looking at different pieces of the picture. 
Disney club and Brittany Spears infamous "strawberry" video come to mind too. Even more so with comet pingpong, pizza place, Podesta's emails etc. coming to light.

       Also that protector mode seems to fit with Michael song Heal the World, also with Neverland ranch, or at least the consept of it(neverland, safe haven for children that dont want to grow up)

       Yeah the concept of Neverland ranch could certainly fit the protector behaviour. Not just that but MKultra trauma creates alters/split personalities and it can take the victim into a childlike state of mind. 
We'd never know so this is just pondering but perhaps Michael was in that childlike state of mind quite a fair bit?
      </p>
      <p>
       My MKultra knowledge needs refreshing but yeah the duality imagery is linked with it. I'm unsure as to why though? Is it something to do with conscious awareness?

       I think it had something to do with creating DID, aka Multiple Persona Disorder, and that the victim is so abused they kinda create a second persona, probably around there.

        The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when they seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins as two.

       I've yet to seen any real proof of the satanic aspect. Only one line about "Spirit Cooking" which has nothing to do with Satanism and a Google search from before this month comes up with nothing but an art exhibit.

       Then you need to look harder.  Abramovic was asked if it is art of Magick. She responded if it is in public it is art, in private it is a magical ritual, a terrible disgusting sick one.   Look here:

       In addition to all that and the Jeffrey Dahlmer thing, someone said that in an inviewiew he visits the Donnor party location every year!  They ate each other. Look he is SICK and twisted.  plus the picture with the goats head.  Look, what does the word satanic een matter at that point?  They have a kill room in the pizza ping pong place!

       That's still a post leak video. Show me proof that exists before the leak that Spirit Cooking is based in Satanism. I'm a former Satanist and have all of LeVay's books and there's nothing about it.

       Take a look at the work started by former Georgia State Senator Nancy Schaefer, who was of course found dead in 2010 as part of a "murder/suicide" with her husband.  Her published report, The Corrupt Business of Child Protective Services, showed how far this reaches into nearly every single community in this country.

       I am starting to wonder if women (as a whole) are pawns in all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The division of man and woman at the level we are seeing is probably resulting in a HUGE decline of educated children from non-broken homes.

       Coupled with the possibility of them having operations for 'breeding,' it makes my blood chill.

       Agreed. I recently read Dave McGowan's "Programmed to Kill" which has a chapter on the pedophocracy, but it's uncomfortable to talk about when nobody has reason to believe it is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we wait and don't keep harping on this issue, it will quickly become us who are the freaks and degenerates for wanting to expose the pedophocracy.

        In 1998, another large-scale international ring was discovered operating out of the Netherlands and Berlin, Germany. The New York Times reported that investigators called the case “nauseating,” in that “images of abuse of even babies and infants were peddled via the Internet and other media.” Police discovered “voluminous records of what appear to be clients and suppliers from countries including Israel, Ukraine, Britain, Russia and the United States.”

       the legal/justice system has failed those kids an unforgivable amount. And trusting the agencies that swore to protect them has gone out the window.

      <p>
       I remember hearing a rumored story about a town in Ireland that after watching the movie Taken, became so inspired and moved that the entire town came together and shut down the illegal brothels in their town that were involved with human sex trafficking.  I feel that what we need, angry mobs, not about peaceful protest, but about protecting innocence.

       The legal and justice systems take their orders from people that are just as vile as Hillary. I dream of the day those higher end members of the PTB are put down like the animals they are. Evil hates what's good, pure and innocent. If society has any soul left, we won't let this rest.

       They may well be all controlled and in bed with one another in government but when enough people come together: change is possible.
Enough of the peaceful protests which provide nothing but a few 'low level' resignations and/or child porn consumer arrests. It's about damn time we throw the big fish in the fryer.

       WHAT IF these pizza related things we keep finding are the government's own honeypot for capturing pedos? Seems like the FBI would be all over this "pizza" evidence right? But as far as we know, they are not. Or are they?

       I was pondering it the other day, and then I saw this article today which makes it seem very plausible:

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you thought the FBI's admin efforts for two separate child porn websites (in two investigations spaced a couple of years apart) were questionable, you have to wonder about the morality (or legality) of the US government becoming one of the world's largest distributor of child pornography. Researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis notes that, according to her numbers, the FBI could have been operating close to half (if not more) of the child porn websites in existence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       But..WHAT IF the government's own CP honeypot is a cover or staging ground for their own secret child trafficking atrocities?

       Wouldn't be surprised but collusion with stuff like that makes me sick.  Even if it's a dirty cop paid to look the other way.  At least with Wikileaks, anonymous and us on Reddit, we have a chance to balance the scales a bit.

       To those who understand, this was a huge part of the victory of this election. Though it cannot be explained to those not ready to hear it, we can't give up on this. These monsters are now panicking. There are some in law enforcement who recognize what is going on. Much respect to the redditors who helped expose this. Keep digging everyone. Don't let anyone tell you you're crazy. Keep talking about this until everyone knows.

It's sourced from this pizza gate, we can all agree its tabooo.... but the people tagged are named c o h e n .. thats a very serious/important name/lineage to those of you who know a thing or two about a thing or two. It's quite clear to me why someone named c o h e n is inolved in this circle.

       I'm usually here expressing my frustration with r/conspiracy turning into a nutjob factory, but this is something I can really get behind. This is an actual conspiracy that's more troubling than any Hillary related one and it extends much farther than the US. Anyone remember the Westminister and BBC pedophile ring coverups?

       I want to ask you an honest question and I would really like to know your perspective. If for example, Trump does end up in court (as he is meant to be in December) for the rape of a 13 year old girl, and it turns out he is guilty... would you really believe he is going to "drain the swamp" as everyone keeps saying?

       Are you fucking kidding me, of course not. The fact that you even felt the need to ask shows how disconnected from this election you were. We had thousands and thousands of emails that show laundering, pay to play, pedophillia, and every crime in between and some still voted for her. If the same direct proof comes out against Trump you bet your fucking ass there will be another movement. Quit playing politics. I voted Obama twice and it turns out he's a crook too. That fucker should be in jail as well. It's just fucked up to me people didn't read the emails. It's their own thoughts and actions, had nothing to do with politics. They are just bad fucking people.

       I'm not playing politics. I was actually just interested. I have no politics to play on this at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why you would think I'm playing politics, all I was doing was pointing out that neither side will get rid of the corruption. How is that playing politics? It's full on non-partisan.

       a lot of these ppls communications w/ each other was done via public lists//groups so as to minimize the amount of "me talking to you." They're hiding communications in spam messages, and weird coded messages to mailing lists (beanie babies to law@georgetown for ex, i bet there's a ton of shit hidden in some of the spam to any mailing lists that podesta has)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is such a fucking smart way to communicate in code. Embed yourself inside another subgroup//culture, adopt their prose//style of speech, speak in a similar manner but encoded, and voila! you've got a nearly undetectable code, that only the most astute members of some obscure subculture will know that your'e not using words right. Fuckign fuck.

       I think a lot of this is lunacy but I do think the police sketches are dead on. I imagine the best way to pursue it is to contact Interpol. They can probably check things like John and Tony's travel records, ie passports and air travel, most easily.

       I REALLLY Didn't want to believe this was real. But it's literally written plain as day folks. There's too much going on right now that it will not get political attention. One day this shit will be front page. But let the election die down a bit. I know that is hard but seriously just give it a bit more time. We have the proof.

       Somebody mentioned below that laypeople who are "awakened" politically still find this information hard to believe. But what if we send this information to nonprofits and NGOs fighting human trafficking? You could go to organizations as big as International Justice Mission (IJM) and the Polaris Project or you could go for local/state organizations. The smaller organizations also have pretty close ties to their local/state law enforcement usually. These people have more resources and they're already familiar with how human trafficking works. Not to mention that IJM, Polaris Project, and I'm sure some other big groups have headquarters in D.C.

       we should do some investigating on the non-profits that fight human trafficking.  because the New Life Children's Refuge (NLCR) w/ Laura Silsby was that weird case where they were trying to transport 30 kids out of haiti, some not even orphans - hillary showing interest with their case specifically calls a red flag.

       Author Senator Nancy Schaeffer had the typical mysterious murder-suicide occur which seems so common when people get too close to this issue or threaten to stop it. She was a senator so she actually had the potential to voice opposition to this type of syndicate if she had lived.

       There is a lot of other evidence he took her.  The question is not so much if he took her, but is she still alive (or was she recently anyway).
This shows a girl that is a match superficially and now just happens to have the same eye flaw (presuming it isn't an aberration).
Even without this, it was already well established that it was probably her for other reasons (the FBI guy of 4chan saying cards).

       To pursue charges now has proven futile as the DOJ is unwilling to pursue charges and any charges brought would likely be pardoned. It is prudent to spend the next couple months collecting evidence until the current protectors of the criminal elite are removed from power.

       linking to illegally transporting kids out of Haiti.  Then wikileaks searches involving "pizza" all emails clearly coded and cryptic.  It's dark disturbing at there has been amazing investigating done by our own cyber sleuths here on reddit. lots of disturbing stuff right under our noses.  tread carefully.

       with my friends who aren't looking at any wikileaks I've just said "there is a lot implicating stuff in there, even connections with sex trafficking and prostitution".  If they ask questions then I mention stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       but I did get somewhere with friends today when I brought up the rape lawsuit brought against trump.  the lady claimed to have been raped back in the 90s.  but i discussed that "I don't think anything will come of it since it's linked with Jeffrey Epstein, an alleged sex trafficker closely tied with that one ex-president who has a long tattered history with sex assault on women...?" and they can say.. "oh yeah Bill Clinton has had his scandals".  So there's a point of reference.  And they can google Jeffrey Epstein, so there is a solid point of reference.

       Thanks for taking the time to put that together.

       I suggest removing any curse words you use that aren't factual and to clean it up and make it more technical/professional. Then people will read it and not stop thinking "fucking lunatic blogger". Anything we do against these corporate facists needs legitimacy from here on out. That's something we're trying real hard for with the Green Party in my area.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I would never share this on Facebook because I know some people would refute it based on those things, where as a professional looking article sways opinions.

       2013[edit]
"[As of 2013] the U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually. Now everything is linked together using Palantir."
— TechCrunch in January 2015[27]
A document leaked to TechCrunch revealed that Palantir's clients as of 2013 included at least twelve groups within the US government, including the CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED-defeat organization and Allies, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

       I'm pretty sure we need trump to get in before action can be taken. we are really counting on him to press charges (those of us whom voted for him) against all those who are protected in the elite class.
      </p>
      <p>
       that was probably a large motivation to vote for an anti-establishment candidate (Bernie or trump -- and trump represented a little more anger, especially after they clearly tried to rig the election, which we should be proud of obfusticating)
      </p>
      <p>
       for now, they are protected by the DOJ and the rest of the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       many of us worry they will now move to pardon themselves with their connections in such a way trump cant undo it.

       If you're already discounting wikileaks and think russian behind it maybe this isn't your fight, but please support those seeking out hard truths.  Everyone likes a good underdog story, rag-tag redditors, investigated where other agencies have been blocked.

       So Food Network magazine is complacent in this and is somehow advertising places with pedo ties in one convenient map?  Come on man. Get a grip.

       I am not saying that there isn't something VERY strange here with all the "pizza" references in the Podesta emails, but please try to stay on track here. Comet Pizza is a real pizza restaurant...so they do have real reviews.

       Can we reach out to the team from the Boston Globe that released the  story that uncovered the catholic church pedo coverups (Spotlight)?  Maybe ask for some guidance on the matter. If the legal system and law enforcement are actively working to cover it up, when need to work around them.

       That the world's biggest con and crime against humanity is these 'rings' encircle WHICH themselves around EVERY facet of our society and they're simply to be 'taken care of' before moving on to the next thing is frankly A ROTTEN TOKEN GESTURE.. As nothing can compare to that amount of wrong.

       linking to illegally transporting kids out of Haiti.  Then wikileaks searches involving "pizza" all emails clearly coded and cryptic.  It's dark disturbing at there has been amazing investigating done by our own cyber sleuths here on reddit. lots of disturbing stuff right under our noses.  tread carefully.

       sickening.  Since the people running this are untouchable, we have to combat them anonymously with a spotlight, and hopefully we can inspire vigilance that can save some children's lives.

       Pedosta is a veiled reference to John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's chairman of her campaign and Bill Clinton's former chief of staff. My purposeful misspelling of his last name was a pun in reference to the pedophilia accusations being levied at him based on some strange coded emails uncovered by wikileaks

       Its best to get information about correct the record directly from itself: "Correct The Record is a strategic research and rapid response team designed to defend Hillary Clinton from baseless attacks". Which in non-political jargon, means its her personal misinformation team that infiltrates social media sites (like reddit for example)
