I was on a flight from Baltimore to Las Vegas today and was seated next to a man who swears he met a time traveler on election day.  According to him, the man was a relative of Trump&#39;s from 2214 or somewhere thereabouts and had come back in time to help swing things in favor of Trump as he had historically lost the election.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying for sure that this DIDN&#39;T happen (the guy did seem fairly normal aside from this story...), but I would think that, if time travel exists, it would be used to prevent Trump from winning, not to ensure it.</p>

Or maybe it was clear from the future that we needed someone to shake things up so that real change could take place  (after the revolution). People think that Hitler should have been killed for example.  WWII  was the catalyst for so many good things. America was isolationist and not a great power before the war.

    <div class="md"><p>We would be a lesser society if we didn&#39;t invent/have help in inventing the things that we currently posses - not if we didn&#39;t have wars.  Wars may have helped in the creating of certain technologies, but given that we created those technologies (and/or they were given to us from elsewhere), the fact of the matter is that we had the capacity to create them regardless - wars or not - which in itself means that wars weren&#39;t necessarily needed in order to bring those things about.</p>

<p>I understand that &quot;necessity is the mother of invention&quot;, and if you&#39;re at war, the necessity of fighting and defending yourself often time brings about certain technologies, but the mindset and the thinking and the ingenuity that brought those technologies about existed (if even abstractly) well prior to a war motivating their creation.  As such, if the ideas were already existing in the mind beforehand, they could be brought out without the external stimulus of war.</p>

<p>Discipline, intelligence, and wisdom is needed - not war.</p>

<p>Nothing motivates like fear of imminent death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personal identity is a pervasive constant existing independent of the physical, however.  Knowing this makes moot any real consideration - let alone fear - of imminent death.  Various human inventors on Earth have been aware of this, making any fear of imminent death an un-needed motivating factor behind invention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the quiet times people dream and think about things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can be stimulated in such a manner that it propels the invention of things far beyond that which sprout from war-time fear alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in the crisis the urgency makes things happen that otherwise wouldn&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Crisis can be artificially generated in such a manner that actual war is not necessary.</p>

<p>War should never be unnecessarily aggrandized or looked upon as any type of necessity in the evolution of a system.  Conflict can and does happen - yes - and it is understood that it can be the motivating factor behind evolutionary development, but it should never be confused for the <em>only</em> or even main or most important factor involved.  That’s all.</p>

<p>Well, that may be true with a currency system similar to the existing one, but if you take the federal reserve out of the picture, the picture changes dramatically.  Currency may be created by the Treasury and used however the government wants, it doesn&#39;t need to come from taxes at all.  Without the federal reserve, you only need to tax to <strong>destroy</strong> excess currency in order to control inflation.  When you need currency for social programs, you just create more.  In this way the Government can shape society by pumping money into desirable objectives and programs and taxing the hell out of undesirables (e.g. vice) to the degree that inflation must be controlled, destroying the tax revenue rather than recycling it, which drastically simplifies everything and completely removes the linkage between taxes and spending.</p>

<p>Only because we have an ever increasing debt burden to a private banking institution.  It&#39;s like a tick that keeps growing until it is consuming as much blood as the host can produce.  Extremely parasitic and caustic to society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a baseline of economy that emerges from the production and trade in necessities such as food, textiles, real estate, raw materials and so forth.  But those don&#39;t create wealth.</p>

<p>Wealth is an illusion created by the concentration of ownership and that depends on the abstraction of contract and other paper instruments (such as currency).</p>

<p>While a government cannot itself create labor, real estate or natural resources, it does manage exactly those things.  When currency is then lain atop those, a government can print as much currency as the system can handle, which is related to the size of the population and the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money">velocity of money</a>.  To keep currency stable, more money needs to be created during deflation (eg expanding population, increasing velocity of money, or decreasing access to money) and more money needs to be taken out during inflation (eg decreasing population, decreasing velocity of money or increasing access to money).  The most straightforward way to do this is to create currency as necessary and tax and destroy currency as necessary.</p>

<p>It is here that government finds its most important creative ability.  Unfortunately, it has been hijacked by central banks who convince us that the government must deal with zero sum economics and borrow to survive.  This is not true.</p>

<p>Not really, man.  As I&#39;ve said elsewhere, a Trump presidency brings the country closer to civil war.  That&#39;s obviously very bad.  However, a Clinton presidency would have brought the <em>entire world</em> into WWIII in a &quot;US vs Russia/China&quot; global meltdown.</p>

<p>And the US would have lost the fuck out of that war.  Additionally, the <em>entire planet</em> would have been the real losers of that - what with the world&#39;s three biggest superpowers fucking trying to kill each other?  Jesus.</p>
