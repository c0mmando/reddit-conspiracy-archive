        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump is also a puppet from the elite. Here some facts:</p>

<p>– In 2004 he was the Grand Marshall of the Salute to Israel Parade in NY</p>

<p>– Netanyahu has reffered to Trump today as a “true friend of Israel”. Which is good. Unless you are a zionist. Then it is not good</p>

<p>– Ivanka (his daughter) converted to judaism in 2009 so she could get married with Jared Kushner</p>

<p>– Jared Kushner is the owner of the New York Observer. I’m sure you will appreciate some cool symbolism in it’s logo</p>

<p>So it’s pretty obvious for me that Trump has something to do with the elite. A few hours ago I read that the Simpsons predicted Trump’s victory in year 2000 in season 17th episode 11. Nothing will escape to the elite’s plan to build a NWO. They are a bit more intelligent that what we are and have been building this for centuries so everything has been tied and planned, weather we like it or not.</p>

<p>Also we have to think that in order to unite the world we have to divide it first and we are currently seeing this division in Europe with the brexit (not only that but also some extreme right movements that are happening now and that also want to get outside Europe like in France, Greece, Holland) and also we are seeing the division inside the USA. After this election the country is more divided than ever since the civil war. Although Trump won, around 200.000 more people voted for Clinton so if it wasn’t for the weird election system she would have been president.</p>

<p>We have to wait and see what Trump does inside and outside the US. Specially what kind of relation he wants with China. Because he has “attacked” China many times during the campaign. So we will see. In any case the elite will win. Sorry…</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is from the same bloodline as Hillary .. A royal bloodline. 19th cousins that share a great grandfather.</p>

<p>No doubt after all the wikileaks, this bloodline has been practicing ritual sacrifice and in many cases cannibalism for millennia. </p>

<p>See: <a href="/r/operation_Berenstain">/r/operation_Berenstain</a></p>

<p>For more details on Spirit Cooking and child sacrifice and rape uncovered in recent emails.</p>

<p>Trump is implicated too due to his connections with Jefferey Epstein, convicted child molestor.</p>

<p>Let us not forget about the dentist chair and torture tools found on the island. Its not just about rape, its about torture and satanic sacrifice too.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

(and also a crazy person with a loose grip on facts and logic).  Trumps also constellated by Jesuits, as Obama has been (natn&#39;l sec council) and a Hillary would have been.  They are both pals with Jesuit Gingrich, but both families have ties to Jesuit universities, though both families claim not to be Catholic--probably for political reasons (we saw how the last / only catholic fared)</p>
