       I remember when they started showing up, this sub became polarized by shills warring with each other, not really realizing that NO ONE in this sub was on board with either candidate. So do we get to come out again and be a conspiracy community now?

       Have you looked into his advisors? The ones he named
       <em>
        during
       </em>
       his presidential campaign... he's surrounded by neocons and zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard people say he's anti-zionist, to people calling him anti-semite. Which baffles my mind, since

        all his children

       are either married to or dating Jewish partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, I've heard people saying Trump knows the truth behind 9/11. Meanwhile he's best friends with Rudy Giuliani, one of the key architects of the 9/11 cover-up.

       Not really. Trump has promised to destroy a lot of the government bullshit going on, maybe not all of it. But ending TPP and ACA alone makes his election worthwhile.

       We got to watch several political conspiracies unfold in front of us.  It may all be theatre, but I don't think it's so wrong for otherwise normal sheeple to see what conspiracies are really all about.  This election cycle was a giant, 6month constant dose of redpilling for many people.

       The problem with this sub is that it isn't a true conspiracy theory sub. Conspiracies involve candidates from both the left and the right. This sub mostly focuses on the conspiracies of DEMOCRATS, especially the clintons and obamas. For example, right now there's a woman who claims Donald Trump raped her when she was 14 years old, why isn't this stickied at the top of this sub? Why isn't the independent journalist and free thinkers of this sub trying to expose this? Where is info wars and the free thought project at on this subject matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       How come no one is exposing the republicans and democratics that were voted into the House and the Senate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also this sub claims to hate mainstream media and place value on media that isn't afraid to expose corruption, however, this sub is in love with the Russians and Putin, where if you dare even think to expose Putin you'd likely end up dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is just a republican fanboy sub, not a real conspiracy sub.

       You seem to have no understanding of what this sub is actually like as a result of your only having seen it recently. During election season we were swamped with Wikileaks stuff which largely drew our attention to players that happened to be in the Democratic party. We go where the info dictates and in normal circumstances the things we discuss have no regard for partisanship or party lines at all.

       Yes, only seeing it recently has given me an overwhelming concern that this sub is not about conspiracy theories - it's about finding as much dirt as possible on the Clintons while Trump gets away scot-free under the radar because everyone was too busy looking at pizza parlors and fucked up artists who "worship Satanic cults" with the Clintons and Podestas. I haven't seen a convincing, beyond reasonable doubt e-mail from Wikileaks posted on here in weeks. I bet half the people in this sub could find as many conspiracies with as solid proof as the Clintons on Trump if they actually tried, they just don't want to, and that's very clear to newcomers to this sub.

       no, it's very clear to a certain variety of newcomer, one who whines about nothing, one who has an inappropriate conception of what this board is and what it's supposed to look like. Just a heads up, that variety of newcomer is welcome to get the fuck out....

       Some of the Trump supporters might have been "conspiracy theorists" before supporting Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because so many things are faked doesn't mean they all are–example, moon landing happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I initially disliked Trump and took him for a joke. I then researched him after hearing some of the things he said. I came away with the understanding he was a good man. Sure, billionaire who had a knack for offending people, but a good man nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would never claim to know 100% he's legit. I however choose to hope he was, as his winning is the only chance to avoid massive bloodshed.

       Most people here are only interested in political style conspiracies, anything too 'tinfoil hat' tends to get criticised.

       my point was that neither trump shills nor hillary shills are anti-establishment. look at the republican numbers, they have a senate and congress majority and a president, they ARE the establishment. Lets talk about the billionaires, the federal reserve, how this situation could make the UN decide that our currency shouldn't be the standard anymore.

       Presidents generally do the opposite of what they promise.

       Obama promised to end racism, but racial tensions have worsened.

       Trump promises to end globalism, so I assume globalism will march on forwards.

       Nop, we were here long before the_donald, we just saw the movement and decided to be a part of it. You can't control the narrative; that's what people wanted to talk about, at least the majority. Look at the great proofs that have been uncovered through detailed independent wikileaks studies, internet sleuths has done more for this community than we could have ever imagine. We need to drive the blade through the heart of the corrupt establishment, those that conspire against the people, or should we go back to talking about the fake moon landing and the dark side of the moon crater bases?

       Curious, what do you have on Rudy that links him to the coverup? I see him as the way Dr. Wood does.
