       the pedo ring may be the very reason hillary wasn't allowed to steal the election, for all we know, it was nearly about to be blown wide open, maybe especially if she did get elected, there would be great motivation to find connections. I personally think all the riots and shit are just to distract from all the emails and the info within

       I agree. They want to just move forward and disappear from the stage

       Lolz, grow up.  You think anything's actually gonna happen, you think this will really deliver change? How bout u ask Obama voters about the torture prosecutions against the Bush administration.  Or the promises he made to dismantle the surveillance state.  You voted for the republican party, plain and simple.  No more, no less.  This was their same tactic to put Reagan in.  He also tricked working whites to vote for him by being a "straight talker" and then his bosses just spent 8 yrs cutting taxes on the rich and robbing the poor.  HWBush and Donald Regan were the ones actually running the show, and people fell for the smokescreen of a famous actor.  Say what you will about Hillary; I'd rather vote for a millionaire than a billionaire every day.  I thought it was obvious when the GOP put up Mitt, the oligarchy's lawyer and broker.  This time they just put up an oligarch himself and you couldn't help but slobber all over him.  You've been smokescreened.  There are two parties in the USA- oligarchy and diet oligarchy: the dems who are corrupt by stealing millions, and the pubs who steal billions.

       How do you all of a sudden assume I'm a Bush or Trump supporter because I don't want to end a child pedo ring and lock up those directly involved with terrorism and corruption?? I'm not seeing it and I didn't even vote for bush, trump, or Obama
