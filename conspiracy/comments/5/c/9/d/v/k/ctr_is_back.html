       There is a new tone on the front page. The comments are back to bashing Sanders and his supporters and propping up neoliberal lines of thinking. The establishment still controls the democratic party and they are not going to just let that slip away. We must remain vigilant.

       CTR has been working for over 2 years now, they are not just going to suddenly cease and desist all operations.

       Why would CTR be attacking Bernie now rather than Trump? Doesn't make any sense. I see pro Bernie posts on here every other minute and honestly it needs to stop. He's been out of the race for a long time and people are in denial.

       They aren't in denial, they are in assurance that their candidate would have won.

       That being said, CTR attacking Bernie does not make much sense currently and I haven't seen it for months.

       They have been here since early this morning to stoke the fire. I really hope they still arent being paid. Many dems are being exposed as exactly what they were trying to project on Trump supporters to be. But who's really suprised that liberals are playing the victim, and not taking personal responsibility.

       Yes, they do in fact do that.  Right after the Romney loss last time, it was widely reported that Romney left a lot of his closest workers stranded.  Their business cards stopped working literally during his concession speech, and they all had to fly home on their own dime after working for years for him.  CTR has almost certainly been disbanded, with maybe a skeleton crew left to attempt to make her not look too bad on the way out the door.

       Podesta, DNC, Hillary emails - CTR news items were sent out as early as 2014. I'm sure there are also some sort of FEC filings somewhere if you care to search since I think its a 501c. Astroturfing to correct the Clintons' record has been going for even longer though, Brock has been in business a long time.
