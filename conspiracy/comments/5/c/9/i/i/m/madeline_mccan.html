       Collage that has photo in question:
       <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1478699332032.gif">
        http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1478699332032.gif

      <p>
       That girl in the photo is 100% Madeline. The ears match, the age matches, and the look on her face is so far gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why? Control. Was reading posts about eyes wide shut this AM and one user mentions the scene where Nicole + Toms kid goes missing. It's the same thing. Either unruly members or occasionally a member at random has to give up their firstborn. And then the Pedostas kidnapped her. That's one of the many ways these people keep people quiet: they have their kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the pedostas? Has anyone read The Chocolate War? Maybe the cult functions similarly? Like the group decides on an action, and then a member is chosen somewhat randomly to have to commit the crime. Like the marble jar in the chocolate war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally that photo is extremely important. It doesn't come from an Email (it looks like it was casually dropped on 4chan by an insider), and it looks a lot like it's a "proof of life" photo to keep someone in line.

       I wish this could get mainstream attention, it's incredible. Those artist mock ups are such dead ringers, I don't know how this could be ignored.

       Wikileaks shows no emails around the time McCann was abducted suggesting a "wipe" on his part, but earlier emails show he was traveling around this time:

       It's actually really scary.  It's being forcibly ignored.  The day there were revelations there were MULTIPLE posts about not going into this.  On 4chan there are multiple users actively trying to force people down dead ends and quashing this and other very real things.

       No doubt. Personally, I know I've been afraid to click on things. Attention to this would be such a nail in a coffin for the vilest power players. They're behaving like they're scared though, I think. Rightly so, this snowball will keep on rolling no matter how slowly.

       Correct, IMO what it looks like is that she was kidnapped to keep her parents in line.  The photo I linked is basically a "proof of life" photo to make sure the parents stay in line. (completely conjecture, I have 0 proof)

       Totally agree. There are a couple of very interesting documentaries which make the entire kidnapping theory somewhat implausible. Just figured if OP is fairly sure of it being her, telling the parents (or police) would be a good place to start.

       Just another part of the smoke-screen, they run all of this bullshit, that's how they get away with it. Every "charity" is run by these freaks so they have complete control, the judges and courts are all a part of it too.

       It's the one where they're all playing a game and she is just staring off into nothing with no emotions. The same one someone thought her sleeves were zip ties. I've seen it and I'll try to find it, she just looks so damn empty. Just not even there.

       Nobody knows where the photo came from.  It's a photo that is very clearly of Podesta and his family? maybe? but it's not from the emails.  It looks like it could've been dropped on one of the chans by an insider.  And as visco says the girl looks like she has seen some shit.

       Well everyone else is happy and the girl in question looks like she hasn't smiled in years in that picture, just an observation I wasn't stating anything as fact. It's creepy, candid or not, it's still creepy.

       Do you have any pictures of your son, daughter, niece or nephew looking like they were just slapped while everyone else is ecstatic?

       Wow, very peculiar indeed.

       The ears are basically an identical match. That may seem trivial to some but it is absolutely important.

       I'm confused about the look-a-like photo taken in 2016 of the little girl with her arms taped to the ping pong table though. That girl looks identical.

       Dear all,
      </p>
      <p>
       She is not Madeleine.
Please be aware that the girl in the card-playing photo at Thanksgiving day is a totally innocent and normal child, and we should respect the privacy of her and her family. Her private details are all retrievable from wikileaks, and she is almost the same age as Madeleine though.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put an end this speculation, check for yourselves that she is not Madeleine by investigating the other published photos of her in
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/
