        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Collage that has photo in question: <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1478699332032.gif">http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1478699332032.gif</a></p>

<p>That girl in the photo is 100% Madeline. The ears match, the age matches, and the look on her face is so far gone. </p>

<p>As to why? Control. Was reading posts about eyes wide shut this AM and one user mentions the scene where Nicole + Toms kid goes missing. It&#39;s the same thing. Either unruly members or occasionally a member at random has to give up their firstborn. And then the Pedostas kidnapped her. That&#39;s one of the many ways these people keep people quiet: they have their kids. </p>

<p>Why the pedostas? Has anyone read The Chocolate War? Maybe the cult functions similarly? Like the group decides on an action, and then a member is chosen somewhat randomly to have to commit the crime. Like the marble jar in the chocolate war. </p>

<p>Additionally that photo is extremely important. It doesn&#39;t come from an Email (it looks like it was casually dropped on 4chan by an insider), and it looks a lot like it&#39;s a &quot;proof of life&quot; photo to keep someone in line. </p>

<p>My $.02</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, very peculiar indeed. </p>

<p>The ears are basically an identical match. That may seem trivial to some but it is absolutely important.</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused about the look-a-like photo taken in 2016 of the little girl with her arms taped to the ping pong table though. That girl looks identical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree.</p>

<p>Super fucked up interpretation is that it&#39;s her kid.  She&#39;d be like what? 12//13?  Not the youngest that some has had a child before.</p>

<p>Please find a way to get this out to everyone you can possibly think to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear all, </p>

<p>She is not Madeleine.
Please be aware that the girl in the card-playing photo at Thanksgiving day is a totally innocent and normal child, and we should respect the privacy of her and her family. Her private details are all retrievable from wikileaks, and she is almost the same age as Madeleine though.</p>

<p>To put an end this speculation, check for yourselves that she is not Madeleine by investigating the other published photos of her in <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/</a> 
Search for:</p>

<p>IMG_20140608_080520_397.jpg</p>

<p>IMG_20140524_160434_394.jpg</p>

<p>and a photo of her on the same day, without the fatigue: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//fileid/54409/15366">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//fileid/54409/15366</a></p>
