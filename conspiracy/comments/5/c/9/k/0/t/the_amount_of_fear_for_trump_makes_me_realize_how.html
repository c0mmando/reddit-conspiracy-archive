       It doesn't make sense. How are they more scared of Trump than they are Kilary? Trump may be questionable based on his financial shortcomings in the past but Hilary is a proven criminal. Watching everyone cry and protest is an absolute disgrace. I'm not trying to shit post but I have just had this on my mind this week. It's startling how much propaganda has been shoved down this countries throat.

       The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.

       Kinda sad reading this...I hope you guys know this was all planned...Trump was allowed to win...he didn't sneak in...Wikileaks did there best to show it, but sadly it was too one sided and people dismissed it...except for the Hillary haters, but they missed the point...did you even notice that the Rothschild's were managing part of her campaign? Did you even care? No...because you did what they wanted...they gave the Christian Sharia law fans there candidate...then they gave the to weak and stupid to help ourselves liberals there candidate...and laughed all night long...one day, and hopefully not to far away...this country will wake up...and quit fighting for the crumbs...because make NO mistake, they won last night...this country will be to busy tearing itself apart for the next 4 years to even give a shit about what's really going on.

       I think it's more of they think hes offensive and thinks that he's out to destroy all minorities. They also refuse to actually look at his veiws and realize he's not gonna start a Holocaust of gays. I see gay people posting suicide hotline all over the internet as if their lives are in danger. They are only focusing on the thought that he's out to make some Americans lives hell. His faults are that he doesn't say things in a diplomatic way , offending the easily offended.

       In the UK, we had millennial snowflakes literally crying after Brexit was announced.
      </p>

       We use the word brainwashing too often, but millions of Britons were indoctrinated by the MSM to believe that the economy would collapse if we voted to leave the EU.

      <p>
       Similarly millions of misinformed Hillarybots truly believe Trump will be a catastrophe for them personally. These poor idiots can't help it - their emotions are genuine, even if the reasons behind their fear are not.

       Why would you be surprised? Clinton is the status woo. We have all been told Clinton would win for a year plus. Clinton is a known quantity that the media has been grooming the whole nation for. Trump says himself that he's the change candidate and constantly talks about shaking things up, breaking some things, rebuilding others. People are naturally scared of change, and thanks to media and the candidates own words, this shift represents the possibility of immense change. Propaganda aside, actual political positions aside, and potential for real change aside, it shouldn't be supervising that many people are terrified for the future.

       It is the new immigrants from countries that are corrupt and uneducated that believe everything the government says. The spokesman for the government is the MSM. They think trucks are going to come around, round them up into camps. They think if they have their own "Arab Spring" that Trump will resign. However, Homie don't play that way.
