Did you even care? No...because you did what they wanted...they gave the Christian Sharia law fans there candidate...then they gave the to weak and stupid to help ourselves liberals there candidate...and laughed all night long...one day, and hopefully not to far away...this country will wake up...and quit fighting for the crumbs...because make NO mistake, they won last night...this country will be to busy tearing itself apart for the next 4 years to even give a shit about what&#39;s really going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you be surprised? Clinton is the status woo. We have all been told Clinton would win for a year plus. Clinton is a known quantity that the media has been grooming the whole nation for. Trump says himself that he&#39;s the change candidate and constantly talks about shaking things up, breaking some things, rebuilding others. People are naturally scared of change, and thanks to media and the candidates own words, this shift represents the possibility of immense change. Propaganda aside, actual political positions aside, and potential for real change aside, it shouldn&#39;t be supervising that many people are terrified for the future.</p>
