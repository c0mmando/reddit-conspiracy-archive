       I have been lurking in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for a long time, and I have posted here from time to time in the past. Lately, I have noticed how easily you guys have turned to pedo-hysteria and also satanic panic. What's worse, is that you have no hard evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not OK simply because these people are your opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       False accusations of these crimes can ruin lives. Hell, the way we treat sex crimes in the US is utterly inhumane and part of the reason people never seek treatment for it. As far as the occult stuff, this is a nation where we have freedom of religion. Period. This reminds me of the satanic panic of the 1990s. Read about it if you weren't around then. It ruined the lives of innocent people. There are many
       <em>
        legitimate and proven
       </em>
       reasons to dislike the Podestas and the power they have in government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the people here, and you know who you are, who are at the front of all this are the first people to come out against false rape accusations when they occur, so cut the fucking hypocrisy. This is the same kind of thing, and it's equally as wrong and dangerous of a precedent to set.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm beginning to wonder if this isn't an elaborate ruse being used to discredit the other, very much true, things people have found in the wikileaks about these people. COINTELPRO was a program by the government to infiltrate and basically discredit movements by making their followers look like fools. It's not like there is not history of this happening. Hell, it might not even be the government. The Podestas and people like them are sufficiently powerful and connected to make this happen. Evidence was found in the wikileaks that the Podestas communicate regularly with George Soros. Remember when the Hillary campaign paid people to instigate Trump supporters to make them look bad? Soros is behind many of the protests we saw this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm rambling. It simply feels wrong how easily you guys have accused people of some really serious shit without any hard evidence. What's worse, is I think some of the people being accused are gay, and LGBT people already have to deal with enough people being afraid of them being around kids. All over the US, people used the threat of trans people going into girls bathrooms as an excuse to discriminate against them even though there is zero evidence of this being a problem, and statistics show "stranger danger" is not a problem. Fear of strangers has caused a generation to be raised that were not allowed to go outside and explore the world. It's like many of you collectively forgot how to think critically once you saw a chance to accuse your opposition. It's wrong.

       There's mountains of circumstantial evidence that needs to be addressed. This is a decades old story that has never been properly investigated. Until the mainstream press and authorities confront this real and ongoing problem, we will never quit fighting to expose the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks blew this wide open and its fresh again. We will never relent. The safety of thousands of children is on the line. Imagine if one day a child from your family is snatched by this ring? This has happened over and over again to normal peoe whose lives have been ruined

       Ok, but this further proves my point about the dangers of a moral panic. Someone out there might be convinced enough that this is real, that they will ruin the lives of provably innocent people in the belief that they are still doing the right thing.

       That's why the proper authorities need to take up this case IMMEDIATELY. When people don't feel that justice is being done, they start to act out. We have to nip in the bud because your completely right. But brushing it under the rug ain't gonna work anymore

       Smearing your opponent with as much dirt as you can; fuck the facts. This has been a favorite tactic of conspiracy theorists for centuries if not millennia. Think about the tales told about Freemasons, Jesuits and Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pizza-pedo bullshit slingers, though, do not even warrant the appellation of conspiracy theorists. It's the same clowns who talk about every mass shooting being a hoax, who post videos of them laughing at the victims.

       You know, I dated someone that was taken away from her parents and put into foster care because she didn't like to color in her drawings as a kid. A child psychologist said this meant that she was being abused at home and the state took her from her family. It was bullshit and there was a huge settlement.

       Nothing anyone has found so far is hard evidence of anything, and it's dangerous to try to interpret it as such. You posted art. It's not great art, but that's my opinion.

       So... if the folks here really care about "the children", why are they not trying to stop an actual proven conspiracy instead of making shit up out of thin air? You forget that nobody has found a single piece of hard evidence. Not one piece. This is nuts. I have a hard time believing you people are real.

      <p>
       Eyewitness testimony? Live action pedo snuff films? Suspiciously expired investigators? Do you need to rape a child in Joe Biden's lap before you'll abandon your belief that people actually practice these taboo rituals?

       I think you're just uncomfortable with the notion that ritualistic child abuse occurs with startling regularity in the highest echelons of our hierarchical power structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'd reevaluate your claims of zero evidence. Circumstantial evidence is evidence. Coincidences are meaningful. There is no circumstantial evidence that transfolk rape children in bathrooms. There have been no incidences whatsoever of that happening. Ritualistic child abusers have connections with politicians and plutocrats and there's loads of evidence that is otherwise entirely meaningless in the absence of that context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either some plutocrats are absurdly oblivious that their actions make them look like a bunch of satanic child rapists. Or they are a bunch of satanic child rapists.

       NO SHIT. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
       <strong>
        <em>
         YOU WANT TO FUCKING KNOW WHY?!

       In the United States, homosexual activists are more circumspect about their efforts to gain access to children than they are in Canada or Europe. While NAMBLA has regularly marched in homosexual pride parades in New York, San Francisco and other major cities, homosexual activists publicly disassociate themselves from pedophiles as part of a public relations strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet homosexual groups are actively recruiting gay youth through such groups as The Sexual Minority Youth Assistance League, the HettrickMartin Institute, AIDS service providers, and various agencies that assist runaways. A concerted effort to change age-of-consent laws has not yet emerged, but some ominous signs portend an eventual effort. When Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an attorney for the ACLU, she co-authored a report recommending that the age of consent for sexual acts be lowered to 12 years of age [1] The paragraph reads as follows: “Eliminate the phrase ‘carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of 16 years’ and substitute a federal, sex-neutral definition of the offense… A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person… [and] the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old…”
      </p>
      <p>
       The public still has a revulsion against child sexual abuse. In fact, whenever there is an attempt to show a connection between pedophiles and homosexuality, the standard response from the activists is that as many as 97% of all pedophiles are heterosexuals and/or married men. Thus, they deflect attention away from their own proclivities to have sex with children.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some truth to the claim that many pedophiles are heterosexually oriented men. To be accurate, pedophilia is the crime of sexually molesting a child of the opposite sex. Pederasty, on the other hand, is the crime of molesting a child of the same sex. The term pedophile is used as a general term to describe a person who molests any child, and the term pedophilia, however, is commonly used to refer to child sexual abuse in general. The homosexual who molests a child of the same sex, therefore, technically is guilty of pederasty, rather than pedophilia–yet both are child sexual abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homosexuals deny that there is a high incidence of child molestation among them, but the statistics tell another story.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, we need to look at the statistics on child sexual abuse in general. The National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse (NCPCA) has published the following information:
      </p>
      <pre><code>1. Reports of sexual abuse are on the increase in our nation.
2. Between 80 and 95% of all child molestations are committed by men. The NCPCA notes, however, that there is a “dramatic increase in the number of adolescent offenders who have committed sexually aggressive acts against other children.”
3. Girls are more likely to be the victims of molestation than boys. Males account for 25 to 35% of child sexual abuse victims. [2]
</code></pre>
      <p>
       How prevalent is child molestation among homosexuals? The Gay Report, published by homosexual researchers Jay and Young in 1979, revealed that 73% of homosexuals surveyed had at some time had sex with boys 16 to 19 years of age or younger. [3] Although homosexuals account for less than two percent of the population, they constitute about a third of child molesters. [4] Further, as noted by the Encino, California-based National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), “since homosexual pedophiles victimize far more children than do heterosexual pedophiles, it is estimated that approximately 80% of pedophile victims are boys who have been molested by adult males. [5]
      </p>
      <p>
       A nationwide investigation of child molestation in the Boy Scouts from 1971 to 1991 revealed that more than 2,000 boys reported molestation by adult Scout leaders. (Note: The Scouts, who have 150,000 Scoutmasters and assistant Scoutmasters, ban hundreds of men each year from scouting out of concern that they might abuse boys.) [6] A study of Canadian pedophiles has shown that 30% of those studied admitted to having engaged in homosexual acts as adults, and 91% of the molesters of non-familial boys admitted to no lifetime sexual contact other than homosexual. [7]
      </p>
      <p>
       Judith A. Reisman, Ph.D., and Charles B. Johnson, Ph.D., conducted a content study of the personal ads in The Advocate, the national gay and lesbian newsmagazine and discovered that “chickens,” a common term for underage boys sought for sex, were widely solicited. Many of the advertisements in the magazine solicited boys and teens from within a larger pool of prostitution ads. [8] The authors also note a statement from a book review by homosexual activist Larry Kramer that the work, “like much canonized male homosexual literature, involves sexually predatory white men on the prowl for dark-skinned boys to gratify them.” [9]
      </p>
      <p>
       In a 1985 study of the rates of molestation among homosexual pederasts compared to heterosexual pedophiles, Dr. Paul Cameron found the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        153 pederasts had sexually molested 22,981 boys over an average period of 22 years.
       </li>
       <li>
        224 pedophiles had molested 4,435 girls over an average period of 18 years.
       </li>
       <li>
        The average pederast molested an average of 150 boys, and each heterosexual pedophile molested an average of 20 girls, a ratio of 7.5:1. [10]
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Gaining access to children has been a long-term goal of the homosexual movement. In 1972, the National Coalition of Gay Organizations adopted a “Gay Rights Platform” that included the following demand: “Repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent.” David Thorstad, a spokesman for the homosexual rights movement and NAMBLA, clearly states the objectives: “The ultimate goal of the gay liberation movement is the achievement of sexual freedom for all–not just equal rights for lesbians and gay men, but also freedom of sexual expression for young people and children.” This goal has not changed since it was articulated in 1972. [11]
      </p>
      <p>
       Homosexual organizations around the world have embarked upon a vigorous campaign to lower actual age of consent laws by claiming that current laws are discriminatory against homosexuals. In England, for example, a major push is underway to lower the age of sexual consent for homosexuals to 14. OutRage!, [12] a homosexual organization that operates much like ACT UP in the United States, has been leading the crusade. In a statement published on the Queer Intelligence Service website, OutRage! claims that “…underage queers have rights, too. They are some of the most vulnerable members of our community. We have a special responsibility to protect their interests and welfare.” [13]

       Katy Faust, Dawn Stefanowicz, B.N. Klein, and Robert Oscar Lopez who were all raised by homosexual parents, each submitted briefs to the 5th Circuit opposing the legalization of homosexual “marriage”. Recounting childhood memories of households made deeply dysfunctional by their parents’ sexual appetites and the radical subculture that went along with their “gay” identities, all four argued that redefining marriage to include homosexual couples will likely lead to the exploitation and abuse of countless children for political and personal gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       “While I do not believe all gays would be de facto bad parents, I know that the gay community has never in my lifetime put children first as anything other than a piece of property, a past mistake, or a political tool to be dressed up and taken out as part of a dog-and-pony show to impress the well-meaning,” Klein wrote. She added that as a child of a lesbian mother, she was pressured to pay “constant homage and attention” to her mother’s gay identity, taught that some Jews and most Christians were stupid and hated gays and were violent,” and told that homosexuals were “much more creative and artistic because they were not repressed and were naturally more ‘feeling’.”
      </p>
      <p>
       While Klein classified her upbringing as abusive, Robert Oscar Lopez told the court that his own childhood upbringing by his mother and her longtime partner represented the “best possible conditions for a child raised by a same-sex couple.” Even so, Lopez testified that the lack of a father figure in his life combined with the influence of the radical gay culture in which he was raised gave rise to a devastating confusion about his own sexuality and ultimately led to his becoming a homosexual prostitute in his teen years in order to fulfill his craving for acceptance and love from older men.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I experienced a great deal of sexual confusion,” Lopez wrote. “I had an inexplicable compulsion to have sex with older males… and wanted to have sex with older men who were my father’s age, though at the time I could scarcely understand what I was doing.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Lopez said that he has spoken to dozens of other adult children of homosexuals, and that many of them have similar stories of pain and damage inflicted by the absence of a biological parent and the unwanted “step-parent” type relationship demanded by their homosexual parents’ lovers. Lopez included testimonies from nine of them in his brief, but said there were many more who were afraid to speak out for fear that the homosexual lobby would target them for harassment like they have Lopez himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       “When we institutionalize same-sex “marriage”… we move from permitting citizens the freedom to live as they choose to promoting same-sex-headed households,” Faust wrote. “Now we are normalizing a family structure where a child will always be deprived daily of one gender influence and the relationship with at least one natural parent. Our cultural narrative becomes one that, in essence, tells children that they have no right to the natural family structure or their biological parents, but that children simply exist for the satisfaction of adult desires.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The special-interest homosexual groups and so-called support groups for kids sometimes act, or function, as fronts for a far darker side that silences, intimidates, and threatens the children who want to share the truth, allowing only a politically-correct version of our childhoods to be heard,” Stefanowicz continued. “These special-interest groups support political and legal objectives toward same-sex “marriage”, ignoring the horrendous inequality, permanent losses and prejudice to children in the name of adult sexual rights. Children lose forever their rights to know and be raised by their married biological father and mother.”

       In research with 942 nonclinical adult participants, gay men and lesbian women reported a significantly higher rate of childhood molestation than did heterosexual men and women. Forty-six percent of the homosexual men in contrast to 7% of the heterosexual men reported homosexual molestation. Twenty-two percent of lesbian women in contrast to 1% of heterosexual women reported homosexual molestation.

       While antidotal stories are cute, they don't represent reality. Studies show kids are no worse off with same sex couples PERIOD. The studies that do show kids had issues growing up with same sex couples also included children of broken homes - a much larger risk to childhood development than having a LGBT parents. In fact if we're going to yell "wont somebody think of the children" in our best Maude Flanders voice, I would suggest outlawing divorce before same sex unions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally your other diatribe referencing pedophilia forgets to mention the age group - which is UNDER 12. So all those nifty studies don't apply

       So studies about pedophilia don’t matter in a discussion about the literal definition of pedophilia. Thanks for playing.

       Pedophilia: Sexual attraction to the lack of sexual characteristics. Birth to menarch.
Ephebophilia: Sexual attraction to the growth of sexual characteristics. Menarch to maturity.

       You sure seem to talk lot about pedophilia and your hatred for LGBT people. It would be a shame if some armchair psychiatrist around here interpreted that as projection and evidence of you being a gay and a pedophile. That would be a dangerous precedent to set, don't you agree?

       Yes, I know that liberals are mentally defective, as proven by studies of the makeup of the brain. Yes, I know that they think that actually passes for a real argument when they have absolutely no refutation whatsoever to the facts that HURT THEIR FUCKING FEELINGS and they lash out because they just want to make the bad man who tells the truth go away so they don’t have to feel bad, ever.

       Theres no woosh. you are implying that he's a child raping pedophile because you have no argument. We all get what you are trying to say in order to attack the person disagreeing with you, and it isn't witty or smart.
      </p>
      <p>
       you've carefully guided this thread in the manner that you wanted. First you demanded that we all stop talk about politicans raping children, then you segwayed it into talking about how gays are being oppressed, then you got called out on that bullshit and then you went straight for attacking other posters rather than stay on the topic you started because that was your intention all along.

       I like how the left has trained people like you to believe that the word antidotal some how means 'lie'. Apparently if a transgender person of color with a degree in government fact checking didn't personally witness something and put it in a peer review journal, then it never happened.

       I'm not from the left - I just like scientific studies when making generalities over the stories of a few. If we are going to say same sex parenting harms children then let's rely on facts. Not the stories of a few people who obviously had shitty parents  - parents would have likely been shitty if they were in a traditional relationship.

       While Klein classified her upbringing as abusive, Robert Oscar Lopez told the court that his own childhood upbringing by his mother and her longtime partner represented the “best possible conditions for a child raised by a same-sex couple.” Even so, Lopez testified that the lack of a father figure in his life combined with the influence of the radical gay culture in which he was raised gave rise to a devastating confusion about his own sexuality and ultimately led to his becoming a homosexual prostitute in his teen years in order to fulfill his craving for acceptance and love from older men.

       “I experienced a great deal of sexual confusion,” Lopez wrote. “I had an inexplicable compulsion to have sex with older males… and wanted to have sex with older men who were my father’s age, though at the time I could scarcely understand what I was doing.”

       Lopez said that he has spoken to dozens of other adult children of homosexuals, and that many of them have similar stories of pain and damage inflicted by the absence of a biological parent and the unwanted “step-parent” type relationship demanded by their homosexual parents’ lovers. Lopez included testimonies from nine of them in his brief, but said there were many more who were afraid to speak out for fear that the homosexual lobby would target them for harassment like they have Lopez himself.

       “When we institutionalize same-sex “marriage”… we move from permitting citizens the freedom to live as they choose to promoting same-sex-headed households,” Faust wrote. “Now we are normalizing a family structure where a child will always be deprived daily of one gender influence and the relationship with at least one natural parent. Our cultural narrative becomes one that, in essence, tells children that they have no right to the natural family structure or their biological parents, but that children simply exist for the satisfaction of adult desires.”

       The special-interest homosexual groups and so-called support groups for kids sometimes act, or function, as fronts for a far darker side that silences, intimidates, and threatens the children who want to share the truth, allowing only a politically-correct version of our childhoods to be heard,” Stefanowicz continued. “These special-interest groups support political and legal objectives toward same-sex “marriage”, ignoring the horrendous inequality, permanent losses and prejudice to children in the name of adult sexual rights. Children lose forever their rights to know and be raised by their married biological father and mother.”

       In research with 942 nonclinical adult participants, gay men and lesbian women reported a significantly higher rate of childhood molestation than did heterosexual men and women. Forty-six percent of the homosexual men in contrast to 7% of the heterosexual men reported homosexual molestation. Twenty-two percent of lesbian women in contrast to 1% of heterosexual women reported homosexual molestation.

       Aside from the fact that this is the most disgusting and bigoted thing I have read in a long time, you posted this shit much faster than you could have written it, as I only just posted the thread.

       <em>
        you posted a massive two comment rant about how horrible LGBT people are, how they are mentally ill, and for them to get out of society.

       Theres no woosh. you are implying that he's a child raping pedophile because you have no argument. We all get what you are trying to say in order to attack the person disagreeing with you, and it isn't witty or smart.
      </p>
      <p>
       you've carefully guided this thread in the manner that you wanted. First you demanded that we all stop talk about politicans raping children, then you segwayed it into talking about how gays are being oppressed, then you got called out on that bullshit and then you went straight for attacking other posters rather than stay on the topic you started because that was your intention all along.
