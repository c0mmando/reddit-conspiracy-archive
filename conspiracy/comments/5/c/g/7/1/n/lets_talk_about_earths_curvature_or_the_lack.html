        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you want to know what the main point point of contention for the flat earth is, it would be that the supposed curvature that is supposed to be there, simply cannot be found. </p>

<p>I know that a lot of people believe that the earth curves at roughly 8 inches per mile. This is incorrect. Using that formula will give you a steady linear gradient, but remember we are working with a sphere, therefore the gradient has to get exponentially more the further you move along the curve. </p>

<p>The generally accepted formula (in the flat earth community) for calculating the amount of curvature drop-off over a given distance is 8 inches x distance(miles) squared.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/SwjJZB.png">But why all the hassle when you can just draw it out on AutoCAD and measure it for yourself?</a></p>

<p>So... if you fly a plane straight and level at treetop level for 500 miles, at the end of your flight you should be 31.7 MILES high. Keep in mind that airliners cruise between 30 and 40 000 feet (6 - 7 miles)</p>

<p>So... where&#39;s the curvature? Where? ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Observe the scientific method&quot;</p>

<p>That is why most of us don&#39;t believe it.  Even putting the science aside for a second, you&#39;re talking about <em>all</em> governments, militaries, space programs, private citizens on high-altitude flights, and even educational and private organizations as being part of this.  There are conspiracies and there then are wild, fantastical claims that require a certain amount of proof to substantiate.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re right that many governments, like the US government, are not to be trusted.  But you&#39;re not just saying this is the US government alone perpetuating the &#39;round earth lie&#39;, you are including every single government or group of individuals capable of launching satellites (which, aren&#39;t even real, apparently), weather balloons, etc as being part of this conspiracy. </p>

<p>How and more importantly, why, would every government on earth combined with every private and public organization that can put a camera into high elevation lie about the earth being round? Where&#39;s the benefit to them?</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t &quot;break&quot; the force of gravity. Making that claim only demonstrates once again that you have no idea of what you&#39;re talking about. Tell me, does throwing a ball upward &quot;break&quot; the force of gravity (or &quot;density&quot; as you flatheads like to call it)? Pitching the plane upward merely balances the force of gravity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The theory of gravity is indistinguishable from the theory of Magic.</p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t understand it doesn&#39;t make it magic. It&#39;s got a lot more science and observation behind it than the flat earth &quot;model&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Look up at night. You&#39;ll see this scary object called a Moon. Gravity keeps it up there. </p>

<p>Look for comets. They are attracted by gravity - and in such a way that their appearance can be predicted by <em>gasp!</em> math! Last I heard, flat earth didn&#39;t have any way to predict when they will arrive or their behavior in the sky.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And somehow they work to predict the behavior of everything we observe. Something flat earth cannot do in any way, shape, or form. </p>

<p>Pot, meet kettle. Call me back when flat earth can actually predict anything we observe. Let me know when it has a formula or a model to predict eclipses. Let me know when it has an explanation for the fact that stars (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard%27s_Star">Bernard&#39;s Star</a>) actually do move in the sky over time - unlike the oft-repeated claims of flat earthers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Relative vs absolute motion has absolutely everything to do with your nonsense claims. The plane (and you and everything else) is moving at 1000 mph along with the earth. Inertia is the reason you don&#39;t fly backwards when you jump up in a plane (or on the surface of the earth). You continue to move at the same speed as the earth spins because of your inertia. It&#39;s why planes flying opposite the rotation of the earth have the same flight times as those flying with the rotation. Everything is relative to your frame of reference. </p>

<p>Your claims of it &quot;not factor[ing] in&quot; are complete and utter nonsense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of your facts and evidence rely on completely faulty science.  I&#39;ve said this before on these boards and I&#39;ll say it again: Science as we know it today is like a sudoku puzzle that is completely empty: you filled in a 6 in one square and now you&#39;re fitting the solution around it.  You keep having to go back and readjust numbers because the solution isn&#39;t working, but you&#39;ve gotten far enough along so that people just accept the basic principles upon which you&#39;ve founded your later assumptions.</p>

<p>Whether you agree or (most certainly) disagree, don&#39;t you find it uncomfortable that your space agencies have never once provided you with a 360 degree view from space?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interesting interview from your so called &quot;astronauts&quot; (more like astroturfers) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp9Y8I6v_Ds">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp9Y8I6v_Ds</a></p>

<p>They&#39;ve also admitted that even today we cannot get passed the &quot;Van Allen Belt&quot; (quotes because it doesn&#39;t exist) but somehow we did it in the fucking 60&#39;s.</p>

<p>Talk about ignoring inconvenient facts and evidence...never does a ball earther ever have an explanation for sooooo much that&#39;s been stated.  They always just run back to fake math and say shit like &quot;disprove gravity&quot; even though they literally cannot &quot;prove&quot; gravity.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m really saying is that you guys are way too fucking confident in your assertions.  I have to assume you&#39;re ss members (or morons who propagate info that isn&#39;t yours because you need to feel some sense of superiority or righteousness.)</p>

<p>I mean look at the redbull jump: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZyIVaZXDhho?t=447">https://youtu.be/ZyIVaZXDhho?t=447</a></p>

<p>You can check 4:13 for the round earth pic, but doesn&#39;t it seem suspicious that the earth is round all the way to the ground?  These are parlor tricks! And you&#39;re either on the inside or you&#39;re buying it hook line and sinker.  </p>

<p>Please...feel free to run back to your equations while you hyperventilate.</p>

<p>You mean like flat earthers do when inconvenient facts like Coriolis  force (which flat earth cannot explain), comets (which flat earth cannot explain), moving stars (such as Bernard&#39;s star)(which flat earth cannot explain) and other examples are mentioned? Those details come up and suddenly flat earthers go mute. </p>

<p>Regardless, why don&#39;t you go ahead and actually address the Red Bull jump and it&#39;s fishbowl lens.</p>

<p>This is easy. Red Bull was doing that jump as a <strong>promotional exercise</strong>, not as a scientific experiment. They were under no obligation to make it look perfectly like reality - they were trying to make it look as dramatic as possible. It&#39;s not that hard of a concept, which would explain why you apparently have such difficulty understanding it. </p>

<p>Do you have Russians on the brain for some reason? That&#39;s rather a non sequitur, but than again considering what you believe, occasional bouts of nonsense should be expected. </p>

<p>Oh, and your video conveniently leaves out a lot of points - number one being that it is a <strong>belt</strong>, not a solid shield. And it is not uniform in thickness or strength - meaning that there are parts of diminished radiation. A normal thinking human would go through those areas. But apparently in your twisted worldview, you think the only way through is where it is thickest. For a <strong>scientific</strong> discussion of what level of radiation the astronauts of the Apollo program actually experienced, check <a href="http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/VABraddose.htm">this</a> out. </p>

<p>The same reason people (including myself) accidentally call hotels or other locations home unintentionally. People are human - they misspeak for a variety of reasons. Reading a monolithic global agenda to hide a mythical &quot;edge&quot; of the earth into a misstatement like that puts you into tinfoil territory. </p>

<p>Tell me - have you ever been out far into the ocean, beyond where cell phone signals will reach? Have you taken a GPS receiver out there with you? How does that work without ground-based towers?</p>

<p>Have you ever looked at the direction satellite dishes point, particularly as you get further south? They start pointing further and further up. Kind of hard to have them get signal from ground-based towers if they aren&#39;t point at them, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>This is plainly not true as it is often on the other side of the sun.  You should at least understand the model you are criticizing.</p>

<p>Mercury is always visible shortly after sunset or shortly before sunrise.  The &quot;daylight&quot; is below the horizon, it&#39;s almost as if you&#39;ve never observed this yourself and are simply gleaning your knowledge from incorrect Youtube videos.</p>

<p>Did you observe the Mercury transit earlier this year?  How do you account for that?  What about the visible positions of Mercury months prior to an after the transit in April and June which positioned it according to what we would expect by tracing the line of the transit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Refraction effects are the only <em>mildly</em> interesting thing about flat earth nonsense.  However, the refraction effect is accounted for and clearly understood.  </p>

<p>Check for yourself.  Fill up a large, clear glass of water.  Drop a straw or utensil in it.  Look at it from different angles.  It moves!  Looking through a dense atmosphere will have a similar effect.  It&#39;s called refraction, and causes most or all of the optical effects you guys like to cite.</p>

<p>A fish eye lens is being used in the video you linked to.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t dispute there is such &#39;space&#39; photography taken with powerful telescopes. But anyone with half a brain can look at all the pictures of our supposed globe earth and tell that they&#39;re fake/doctored.

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all.  Flat earthers, specifically, are morons.  I&#39;m not talking about the people who casually check it out, and realize that it&#39;s nonsense.  It&#39;s the &quot;crusaders&quot; who have such an aggressive form of stupidity that it boggles the mind.  They ignore mountains of evidence as it&#39;s presented.  Even the easy stuff, that you can go outside and check yourself.  </p>

<p>Just yesterday, I had one of them tell me that pole stars don&#39;t really exist.  They&#39;re disinformation.  Yeah.  Try to wrap your head around that one...</p>

<p>But he got mad at me, because I didn&#39;t address his silly FE video.  He went on for a half hour about how the earth wasn&#39;t moving, because the wind doesn&#39;t move fast enough.  And, since planes have to move, that means the earth isn&#39;t moving.  Because they should just be able to stay still, and let their location come to them.</p>

<p>This is the level of stupidity we&#39;re dealing with here.</p>

<p>On the ball model, It can not reflect sunlight, because it has a convex surface. A convex surface can not focus light in the way the moon supposedly does. Also covered with sand, which is not known for its reflective properties. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t dispute there is such &#39;space&#39; photography taken with powerful telescopes. But anyone with half a brain can look at all the pictures of our supposed globe earth and tell that they&#39;re fake/doctored. NASA admits themselves that they photoshop the images of the earth from satellite photography. And there&#39;s blatant video of the apollo astronauts faking images of earth by manipulating the window in their airplane. (<a href="https://youtu.be/mCHG6uJH5L8">https://youtu.be/mCHG6uJH5L8</a>) We haven&#39;t yet been shown an undoctored photo or video of the globe earth from the thousands of so-called satellites &#39;orbiting&#39; our  ball home. Yet there&#39;s supposed to be spacecraft flying to planets millions of milles away and they&#39;re sending photos back from there? </p>

<p>Come on, people. Think for yourselves and wake up.</p>

<p>How so? with all of the moving around a plane does in the sky, a 1-2 degree pitch downward would be just about unnoticeable. Care to provide any figures for just how much is &quot;a lot, and very often&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>And yet the pilot can pitch the nose up at any time and break the force of gravity?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He doesn&#39;t &quot;break&quot; the force of gravity. Making that claim only demonstrates once again that you have no idea of what you&#39;re talking about. Tell me, does throwing a ball upward &quot;break&quot; the force of gravity (or &quot;density&quot; as you flatheads like to call it)? Pitching the plane upward merely balances the force of gravity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The theory of gravity is indistinguishable from the theory of Magic.</p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t understand it doesn&#39;t make it magic. It&#39;s got a lot more science and observation behind it than the flat earth &quot;model&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you show me an example of of one object in nature attracting another by sheer virtue of it&#39;s mass alone? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look up at night. You&#39;ll see this scary object called a Moon. Gravity keeps it up there. </p>

<p>Look for comets. They are attracted by gravity - and in such a way that their appearance can be predicted by <em>gasp!</em> math! Last I heard, flat earth didn&#39;t have any way to predict when they will arrive or their behavior in the sky.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravity and relativity and theoretical and philosophical concepts created to back up the heliocentric mode</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And somehow they work to predict the behavior of everything we observe. Something flat earth cannot do in any way, shape, or form. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>have no basis in reality whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pot, meet kettle. Call me back when flat earth can actually predict anything we observe. Let me know when it has a formula or a model to predict eclipses. Let me know when it has an explanation for the fact that stars (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard%27s_Star">Bernard&#39;s Star</a>) actually do move in the sky over time - unlike the oft-repeated claims of flat earthers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is ridiculous, you can see Mercury because it&#39;s reflecting the sun&#39;s light.  You can see a plane from far further than 7 miles away when it&#39;s reflecting sunlight.  Heck, from an airplane you can see small windows reflecting light below, you can see street lights, this is absurd.</p>
