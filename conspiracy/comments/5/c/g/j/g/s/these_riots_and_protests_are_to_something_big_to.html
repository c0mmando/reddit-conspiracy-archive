       We know our politicians are owned. We know our media has an agenda to control what we see and hear. I was surprised to see Trump win. Hillary is owned just like the rest of us. I think Trump was a plant to keep us distracted and divided for something big to come. We just had a decades old record breaking munitions delivery to Germany for us and our allies to put in Eastern Europe. I fear Obama is going to rev up the military front on Russia and Syria in his remaining couple months before Trump takes office. Leaving him with a disaster and a military conflict that can't be reversed.

       I don't think many people who kept up with alternative media was surprised by Trump's win.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how liberals "rioting" in any way makes Trump a plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying you are wrong, I'm just saying your reasoning in this regard is really flawed. It seems like you're trying to fit pieces together, which is a good start, but this is thin and is no way meaty enough to share as a complete idea. It's very sloppy and incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, to add to this, Trump's "victory" does not divide me. What divides me is the incremental, non-stop encroachment of liberal policy and behavior. It is within the rhetoric of the masses who've been the engine for propagating ideals that simply aren't compatible with the USA is a country or an idea. (useful idiots who don't understand the ramification of their mind-controlled actions and feelings)
      </p>
      <p>
       Leftists had a huge opportunity to show the nation that the virtues they preach weren't just fodder they used to steal the ideological moral high ground. The very things they claimed to fear prior to the election are the very ways they are behaving now that their smugness has been stripped of them. They complain about gender equality, but it was the liberal/democratic party that got in the way of women's rights. They claim to be about racial equality while black men pull white people out of their cars and beat them in the street in broad daylight on film and then post it on youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone ever wants you to explain to them what you think liberalism is and why it's fucking social cancer, just send them

       Voila. You have liberalism in a nutshell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither Trump nor his election plays any part in this division for my part, for this division existed in my heart long before Trump was an idea. Or even Obama for that matter. And right-wing policies haven't been much better with acts like the Patriot Act and beefed up surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been a disease in American rhetoric, politics and people that stretches back further than either you or myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not Trump is a plant, it is in no way an issue whatsoever, for he is just a man and merely a president. The real issue lies in the apathy and mind-controlled motives of the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       My default stance right now is that we've elected someone who is not a career politician and who, for all intents and purposes was not molded from birth into this system. And that, whatever Trump does, shows progress to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I need to tell all of you something right now, and it's something you should take to your heart. This country has significant problems that are deeply embedded into our political culture. A revolution is necessary. It will not be fixed by one man, nor one term, nor without incident. To barrow an allegory everyone likes to use: "It's always darkest before the dawn." I want to tell you right now, and I'm not certain of much, but I'm certain of this, the darkness hasn't yet even arrived.  It's not even dusk.

       I feel like you and I share similar views, but you have been conservative for as long as I have been progressive. I base that just on the way you write about liberals. Trump was your guy. Bernie was my guy. Correct?

       Question.. We are all on the conspiracy thread right now. A main tactic of the TPTB is 'divide and conquer'. That being said, I consider people on r/conspiracy to be awoken.. but why then do you all classify yourselves in these groups: Conservative, progressive, liberals, etc... It's all a tactic to divide people. We are but one thing, humans! Start seeing yourself as sentient beings rather than classifying yourself with these labels that divide us.

       Not necessarily. Trump was my guy this election for various reasons. In the current climate and the way the country was going, it can't take 12 straight years of a liberal agenda, there needs to be balance. But my support of Trump was based on the fact that he wasn't an establishment guy, and he blocked Hillary. Anything but Hillary was my mantra this election, and that would have been true even if she was right-wing/conservative. Which, she actually probably is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only politician I've had strong feelings for based on his own merits is Ron Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       But generally, yes, I am probably what people would call conservative. Though, I think I'm more libertarian. I believe in small government, 1st and 2nd amendments as being damn near sacrosanct, and I'm pro-life. But I don't get into the religious aspects of the right wing, or any totalitarian measures of either party.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot about Trump that makes me cringe. But it's far less than Sanders. I don't think there's anything about Hillary that DOESN'T make me cringe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I despise what liberals have done in the last 16 years as far as culture goes. And I hiss at almost any suggestion of socialism and reparations.

       What exactly do you think "this system" is?  The wealthy are the ones who benefit from this current system.  The wealthy are the ones who bribe politicians to perpetuate this system and keep others down.  Trump was very much molded from birth into this system.  Trump is a life-long member of the .1% who benefit from and perpetuate this system.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has a lot of work to do to prove he is who he claims he is: someone who supports the people and does what is right for the country as a whole, not just the .1%.  Maybe he will keep his word, but I definitely  don't think that it should be the assumption.  The assumption should be that he will be just like every other politician in recent memory, and he should have to work tirelessly to prove that assumption wrong.

       No he wasn't. Comparing Donald's wealth to the Rothschilds' is like comparing a McDonalds worker to Lebron James and saying they're the same class. Just because LeBron was on a McDonald's large coke cup doesn't mean they have anything in common. And Trump hasn't been embedded in politics through countless terms, and rotten with the system's corruption.

       not a plant, a rep of one side in a 2-sided conflict.  he's representing the masonic good guys vs the papacy/jesuit/cia/et.al .  that's why he has the mil support and the police support.

       was all of this stuff planned?  designed it seems.  things were put in place and then circumstances nudged.  very long timeframe, because look at how elaborate a key you have to build to open the lock the church put us all under.  this pizzagate key is a hell of a thing.

       Pizzagate is insane. I applaud everyone exposing that. It's the connection to the people behind many other conspiracies. I hope we can come to a conclusion with it. I fear it may take decades.

       i think the conclusions are clear.  it could be a super elaborate setup with thousands of moving parts, or it could be a threes-company-esque misunderstanding, or it could be real.  the latter reality is completely conceivable.  and thus our systems require transparency.

       At first I thought, Hillary is going to win because they want a war with Russia. Now? I think they let Trump win to destabilize the US. For example, if situations like that Trump supporter being beaten at a traffic accident continue? We will have HUGE civil unrest. I think the game is now to make us weaker.

       The destabilizing of us all is spot on. Why put this to the front page just to incite further anger, rather than the pedo ring and leaks?

       We are living in very interesting times. Just saw a graphic that Soros backs the protestors (of course we knew this), I always thought he wanted Hillary in the White House. Today I'm seeing the board as him wanting Trump, creating chaos, and trying to crash the dollar. The next few months could be very crazy. Or, we'll teeter on the brink and level back out like we always do. There are so many hands in the manipulation, it's hard to see the game.

       If they knew a Trump win would cause this backlash, I could see that they possibly rigged it for Trump. This will destabilize and start the beginning of civil war. All we need will be a little push!

       I don't. I wanted Trump the conservative to win for the betterment of humans. I am very awoken to being a single human of many chilling on a rock that floats in space.
