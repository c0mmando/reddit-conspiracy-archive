<p>Wikileaks just has not been the same since the silencing of Assange, in October</p>

<p>They created a PGP key for the very purpose of validating their authenticity, and have yet to sign a press release since this election fiasco...</p>

<p><strong>The Deadman&#39;s Switch</strong></p>

<p>October 16, 2016: The official @Wikileaks twitter account posted a series of cryptic tweets:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787777344740163584">pre-commitment 1: John Kerry 4bb96075acadc3d80b5ac872874c3037a386f4f595fe99e687439aabd0219809</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787781046519693316">pre-commitment 2: Ecuador 
eae5c9b064ed649ba468f0800abf8b56ae5cfe355b93b1ce90a1b92a48a9ab72: ecuador</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787781519951720449">pre-commitment 3: UK FCO f33a6de5c627e3270ed3e02f62cd0c857467a780cf6123d2172d80d02a072f74</a></p>

<p>This is something that Wikileaks has not had a history of doing. People have interpreted this as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme">encryption commitment scheme</a>, and that these are SHA256 hashes, but none of the files on the wikileaks site, nor do the files in the <a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/torrent/2016-06-03_insurance.aes256.torrent">wikileaks insurance torrent,</a> check with any of these hashes.</p>

<p>The other speculation is that these are the actually keys or passwords to the encrypted files within the <a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/torrent/2016-06-03_insurance.aes256.torrent">wikileaks insurance files</a>. This however, is also false.</p>

<p>I think that the hash itself is a signature to the tweets that can be verified by WL partners who see the messages. I think that it is possible that precommitment is being used, in this sense, as a deterrent to a retaliation from an opponent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precommitment">(See Wikipedia/Precommitment)</a></p>

<p>It is possible that Assange had intercepted communications between Kerry and Ecuador. Or that he had caught wind that Kerry was going to leverage the FCO against Ecuador to extradite/give-up Assange. These tweets could have been the message for help. Was everyone who could have interpreted these messages also compromised? Is that why we have no official statement from the new controller of the WL twitter? No explanation except: <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787889195507417088">Julian Assange&#39;s internet link has been intentionally severed by a state party. We have activated the appropriate contingency plans.</a> They pretty much acknowlege a deadman&#39;s switch...but there seems to be more that we weren&#39;t told.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>John Kerry, the coup, and the Guantanamo Express</strong></p>

<p>It is highly coincidental that the cryptic tweets talk about John Kerry. The Secretary of State just happened to be in Londan, near the time of the cryptic tweets.  He was supposedly there in an effort to renow Syrian peace efforts. Any news on any treaties from that day? Nah...Kerry wasn&#39;t there for that. He was organizing a coup on Wikileaks.</p>

<p>Supporters responded to the dead man switch by meeting at the Ecuadorian embassy. One of the supporters setup a <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/w/1OwxWrZbMQDJQ">periscope live stream</a> that had thousands of live viewers, when suddenly the stream was cut, and there were rumors that an &quot;unnamed crew&quot; entered the embassy during the outage.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/789493599121604609">Wikileaks even tweeted this photo...a few days later: PHOTO: Heavily armed &#39;police&#39; appear outside Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Julian Assange has political asylum (photo, Tuesday morning)</a></p>

<p>I had come across several other tweets and articles indicating that other people in the area had been met by armed SWAT that confiscated their phones, and barred entrance into the streets neighboring the embassy. If someone can find links, I would appreciate this.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the deadman tweets, and the rumors of a heavily armed extraction team, we have a jet that mysteriously takes off from London and speeds off to the United States.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/57xrk2/autism_alert_julian_assange_is_possibly_being/?ref=search_posts">/u/JasperPennybottom posted a detailed explanation of the jet that mysteriously left London around the time that Assange was least heard from.</a></p>

<p>It looks as if a jet, that has ties to the CIA, had been tracked from Assange&#39;s location to Raleigh, NC. Raleigh is a stone&#39;s throw from several detention facilities known to be used for court-martials, war crimes, and other spook related stuff. The post by <a href="/u/JasperPennybottom">/u/JasperPennybottom</a> has server good links, that give serious credibility to this theory.</p>

<p>Wikileaks tweeted: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/788369924175441920">BREAKING: Multiple US sources tell us John Kerry asked Ecuador to stop Assange from publishing Clinton docs during FARC peace negotiations.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/788373930910314496">The John Kerry private meeting with Ecuador was made on the sidelines of the negotiations which took place pricipally on Sep 26 in Colombia.</a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>in regards to a meeting that Kerry supposedly had with Ecuador to turn off Assange&#39;s internet.</p>

<p>Was it just the internet getting turned off, or was Assange in custody?</p>

<p>What sources does wikileaks have for this? I&#39;m feeling like this was high up enough to where it was on a need-to-know.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>Pamela Anderson and the last meal</strong>
So, how does Pamela Anderson fit in to all of this? She apparently visited Assange relatively close to time of Assange&#39;s disappearance.
Some people are speculating that she was sent there to make the conspiracy folks look way out there.

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>The new feel of the Podesta email leaks, and the new attitude of the WL Twitter</strong></p>

<p>For over a decade, the @Wikileaks twitter was pretty non-opinionated and was almost robotic in the release of leaks. Post deadman keys and &quot;contingency plans&quot;, the twitter has re-tweeted bias articles by Politico, and even made veiled threats. It was almost like watching @KimDotCom</p>

<p>The Podesta dumps started to feel like they might be moderated. The dumps started out strong, picking up steam every day. It seemed like every day something BREAKING or SMOKING GUN was getting released. The post deadman releases seemed like...something was missing.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ca6by/the_missing_wikileak_emails/">Speaking of missing: /u/Cellseat seems to have found a discrepency day-to-day on the email counts. It seems that a number of the emails get removed or hidden. This seems like someone is moderating the emails, and removing anything of substance.</a></p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>The Massive DDOS attacks</strong></p>

<p>Packets have been flying, and breaking the internet, in record proportions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/10/24/10-things-know-october-21-iot-ddos-attacks/">http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/10/24/10-things-know-october-21-iot-ddos-attacks/</a></p>

<p>Were these attempts at silencing the deadman switch and the other private deadman&#39;s switches?</p>

<p>Supposedly 4chan is being DDoS&#39;d as we speak: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5celwx/4chan_under_ddos_after_finding_link_bw_doj_and/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5celwx/4chan_under_ddos_after_finding_link_bw_doj_and/</a></p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p><strong>The lack of cryptographic verification (PGP Signature)</strong></p>

<p>Wikileaks predominantly displays their PGP Public key on their website and their twitter. Why aren&#39;t they using it for validation that Wikileaks has not been compromised? We saw the deadman&#39;s switch tweets, we heard the rumors, the leaks became bland, and we are supposed to just take the new twitter user(s) word for it? Why would they even create the PGP key to begin with?
This is from Wikileaks&#39; website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/WikiLeaks_talk:PGP_Keys">Why not Digitally Sign press releases, volunteer emails etc ?
wikileaks.org seems to have forgotten that PGP is not simply about encryption for privacy purposes, but that it also provides a mechanism for Digitally Signing and verifying that, say, unencrypted plaintext wikileaks.org press releases or volunteer list emails have not been tampered with or forged.
Surely a project which claims to be trying to be transparent and trustworthy, but which will inevitably come under technical and disinformation attacks by those who fear it, should make use of this cheap yet sophisticated technique?
</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So...none of the press releases have been signed, should we assume that the author does not have the ability to sign, and validate the authenticity of the posts?</p>

<p>I know there are going to be people who don&#39;t know what PGP is, but you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">read the wiki</a>. From the Wikipedia page for Pretty Good Privacy section Digital Signature:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP supports message authentication and integrity checking. The latter is used to detect whether a message has been altered since it was completed (the message integrity property) and the former to determine whether it was actually sent by the person or entity claimed to be the sender (a digital signature). Because the content is encrypted, any changes in the message will result in failure of the decryption with the appropriate key. The sender uses PGP to create a digital signature for the message with either the RSA or DSA algorithms. To do so, PGP computes a hash (also called a message digest) from the plaintext and then creates the digital signature from that hash using the sender&#39;s private key.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikileaks had started using cryptographic authentication for the Podesta dump:<a href="https://wikileaks.org/DKIM-Verification.html">https://wikileaks.org/DKIM-Verification.html</a> But can&#39;t verify one of their own press releases? This sure seems...odd.</p>

<p>Many people have been pressing for a PGP signed statement, and it is continually met with silence. The sole reason they created the PGP key was to verify that they are indeed not compromised. It is far time that they do it. It seems like they may be buying time, while a large cluster of servers chip away at cracking the private key.</p>

<p>*<em>The RT John Pilger Interview and the &quot;Live&quot; phone interview to UMET *</em></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/_sbT3_9dJY4">Julian gives an interview to John Pilger.</a></p>

<p>In this video, there is no defining shot to indicate that John Pilger is even the one interviewing Assange.</p>

<p>There is no dialogue on Assange&#39;s part that would indicate that this interview even took place after &quot;Julian&#39;s internet was disconnected&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/6iO8YZLwqlY">Julian gives and interview to Confrencia Internacional De Software</a></p>

<p>This sounds genuine...for the most part. But there are the parts that sound very robotic. His speech does not flow well, and it reminds me of the soundboards we used to use to make prank phone calls. Manipulating audio is not a very technical feat. I don&#39;t trust it.</p>

<p><strong>The AMA, the lack of proof, and the overall fail</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5c8zxs/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/">Yesterday, the &quot;Wikileaks team&quot; did an AMA.</a>
The proof was a couple of tweets and a failed attempt at uploading a selfie to imgur. The Imgur proof was never updated, and a mod by the name of {mod deleted their accoutn} verified that the image had also been emailed to the moderators of <a href="/r/IAMA">/r/IAMA</a>. I created a dialogue with this mod, and they had told me that Wikileaks had never offered a PGP signature for proof. The mod has since deleted their entire reddit account. This is a <a href="/r/IAMA">/r/IAMA</a> mod, so basically a reddit employee. They didn&#39;t just remove their comments...the account is deleted.Please see: </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9vtmh1/?context=3">https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9vtmh1/?context=3</a></p>

<p>Unreddit also seems to 404 on this page...can anyone try to find the deleted comments?</p>

<p>There were lots of unanswered questions, and the AMA basically fell apart. Very unlike the AMAs that Wikileaks had done prior to this one...</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>I know there is a lot more. I am traveling, but I wanted to get this going. Mods, please sticky this is an important conversation that needs to be had. I have been notified of subreddit dedicated to this: <a href="/r/WhereIsAssange">/r/WhereIsAssange</a>, but we have a whole lot more subscribed critical thinkers, here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. We need to get the attention of wikileaks. They need to sign a simple message with their PGP.</p>

Then when you do, because it might be illegal for you to say it you just remove that line.  So in this case they add in the PGP key and then remove it to say that it&#39;s been compromised.</p>

<p>A signal in a document that&#39;s absence can be construed to indicate a flaw. </p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>Apple used to write: &quot;to date we have received no warrants for user data from the federal government&quot; in their annual reports. They no longer do so.</p>

<p>Discussing whether or not an investigation is taking place is a no-no; but now one can assume Apple has had to hand over keys to the Feds.</p>

<p>A bit of a loose example, but canary just means &quot;small signal&quot; - from the coal mining days as the other fella mentioned. </p>

Since there is a gag order on the NSL, they cannot explicitly say that a NSL was issued to them. Instead, they use some kind of message that can then be removed if an NSL is issued. For example, Reddit &quot;killed the canary&quot; earlier this year. In their annual privacy report, there used to be a message that went something like &quot;Reddit has never received any sort of National Security Letter from the Federal Government,&quot; however this message was removed in their most recent privacy report.</p>

<p>And is anyone able to extract meaningful EXIF data from any of the photo attachments?</p>

<p>I swear I used to be able to get geodata, but not any more. I&#39;m talking about the 14 Fish Podesta pic he sent three times. One of them has (had) geodata coordinates. </p>

<p>Can someone confirm if any of the 14 Fish pics have geo data coordinates?</p>

<p>If all three versions of the 14 Fish pics have zero geo data in them, I&#39;d say something is up.</p>

<p>Whey the hashes released there was a lot of discussion about the timing of the DMS. A lot of people (myself included) thought/hoped it would go off on a fairly quick timer. If the timer is longer, as many have suggested, then it may still fire off. Perhaps at the 1 month mark? 2 month mark?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, here is my solidly tinfoil theory (I&#39;m also submitting it for the next Bond film)...</p>

<ul>
<li>someone in the know tips Pam Anderson that Assange is going to be raided.
-Pam scrambles to London to visit Assange to tip him off. The only 100% way to ensure the info is delivered to Assange.</li>
<li>Assange quickly assembles the data dump and corresponding hash files. The hash files names are targeted at us, the people, to let us know who was involved in the raids.</li>
<li>TPTB realize Pam was a tip off and organize the raid quickly before they are ready. This is why is was a little sloppy when it happened.</li>
<li>Assange releases the hash files and initiates the DMS just before losing his internet.</li>
<li>Assange, and all of Wikileaks is raided.TPTB find passwords to twitter and the WL website. Unfortunately for them the Stochastic Terminator is a program running on multiple servers whose locations are mostly unknown to Assange and the WL staff. TPTB are unable to lockdown the entire Stochastic Terminator network.</li>
<li>because the ST is still dumping data, and presumably also holds the DMS key TPTB assume operation of the WL twitter and website. They do this in order to buy time for investigators to locate and hunt down all of the ST server locations. They need to stop the entire network incase someone learns Assange and WL is compromised and instantly trips the DMS.</li>
<li>They thought they could end the network well before the election was over hence the misinformation we were fed.</li>
<li>The Nov.17 meeting and also IAMA thread are attempts to buy more time to find the servers.</li>
<li>** added;** Anderson returns Nov 15. TPTB recruit her (under duress?) to maintain the alive illusion</li>
</ul>

<p>I also have a theory how the Stochastic Terminator is running...</p>

<p>Basically it&#39;s a program running on multiple hidden servers that is using torrent files to store and retrieve the data. The ST is using fake movies or something like that to hide the data. Randomly one of the servers on the ST network torrents some data, leaks the data, then sends a message to the entire ST network where the data leaks are in the queue. The next day another random servers runs ST and repeats the process. This will continue until the scheduled data leaks are complete. When no more data leaks are available the ST requests input from Assange and if none appears...bam! DMS key. </p>

<p>I&#39;m probably wrong on all of this, but as I said, it&#39;s at least a good movie script I&#39;m developing lol!</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> added more Pam theory</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had to know the possibility of being tortured, this guy is privy to the leaks so he probably knows exactly what the gov(s) will do to him, with written proof. Chances are the data exists both online and offline. Plus who&#39;s to say that the public file dumps aren&#39;t a red herring? Maybe they&#39;re just  decoys files with garbage data that can&#39;t be cracked just to waste their time while the real DMS is a person or persons who are holding the real dumps offline just waiting and watching for any news on whether he is dead or alive. When you&#39;re going to play cloak and dagger might as well go all in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. He isn&#39;t a stupid guy so he knows this too. It&#39;s why WL doesn&#39;t want to know who his sources and why the WL system is set up as it is. It&#39;s also why I think the ST runs the way it does, because that meathod jives with what Assange does with his sources. He likely doesn&#39;t know where the location of all the ST servers are or what file names the data is stored as. The password to the ST network likely changes also and would require something unique from Assange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your public and private keys are a pair, the math works both ways. If I encrypt a piece of information with your public key the only way to get back to that text is to decrypt it with your private. But it is also the case that if you encrypt (or more properly, sign) a message with your private key I can retrieve that message by decrypting (verifying) it with your public key. </p>

<p>The second one is what we&#39;re discussing here. If wikileaks tweeted a message encrypted with their private key that said &quot;Assange Lives&quot; and we decrypted it with their public key we would know that the person controlling the Twitter account has the original private key and thus is likely real (assuming they intend to protect their keys even under duress which seems increasingly likely as more time goes by without them signing something).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Three things are missing from the summary..</p>

<p>An airport in London (not Heathrow?) was evacuated due to multiple people coughing all of a sudden the same day armed officers were reported at the embassy. It was shortly reopened after. There were local press releases and then there weren&#39;t..</p>

<p>FBI Anon posted right around the time of the Wikileaks hash tweet.. I do not have a screenshot, but it was something to the effect of
&quot;This is horrible! US Gov&#39;t has simultaneously captured Jullian Assange and 14 other Wikileaks staff. He is most likely dead or being tortured right now. Wikileaks is compromised. Everything you read from them after this point will be filtered or changed. I am most likely a dead man.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, the next morning, (a Friday.. don&#39;t remember what day) the Internet was more screwed up than ever for the US. They said it was a dyn-dns server failure.. but I think it was more of a state-controlled propaganda system that seemed to send old copies of social media to people in order to prevent dissemination of information. For example, Drudge report didn&#39;t update for me from 8am until after 2pm.. That never happens.</p>

<p>That&#39;s basically what I remember.. I&#39;m wishing I would&#39;ve grabbed screenshots. Maybe others can back me up or correct me if they remember otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he did say that. That doesn&#39;t prove anything. For starters, he had the leaks before they were leaks, and could have formulated that opinion before we even saw the leaks. Furthermore, the leaks incriminating Hillary were released almost immediately, and well before Assange&#39;s disappearance. None of the dialogue leads me to believe that the interview was recent.</p>

<p>The other guy makes the point that Assange said that the Hillary corruption was the meat and potatoes. So regardless of what time it was, if they were suppressing emails, it wouldn&#39;t be to protect themselves because there was nothing more damning than the Hillary bombshells. I think though, that Assange may not have made the pizza gate connections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were the worst in Assange&#39;s eyes. It&#39;s possible he missed something bigger but I think the establishment would try to block that bit of information too to protect Hillary.</p>

<p>But we received that information, which leads me to believe Wikileaks likely isnt compromised.</p>

<p>And if even the FBI has internal conflicts about this whole election and rebelled against Comey, quite sure the CIA would also rebel against their boss if something like a huge underground pedo ring was being covered up. </p>

<p>The people working in the CIA are also fellow Americans.</p>

<p>I doubt that your average CIA worker is aware of the big picture. Imagine a massive pitch black hangar where building is being constructed. You are given a board, couple nails and hammer. Your job is to nail that in place but you can only see the wall you are working, everything else is hidden in the dark. In fact, you don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s floor, wall, or roof you&#39;re nailing the board on. Divide and rule. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-sweden-assange-idUSKBN1320UV">MSM</a> on Nov 7 reported that Assange is to be interviewed on Monday, Nov 14 at the Embassy by an Ecuadorian prosecutor, as well as a Swedish assistant prosecutor, Chief Prosecutor Ingrid Isgren, and a Swedish police investigator (possibly Cecilia Redell who was scheduled for the original interview).</p>

<p>That date has apparently already been bumped once. It was originally scheduled for <a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/32609435/ecuador-sets-october-date-for-assange-questioning/#page1">October 17</a>, the day after the three hashes were posted.</p>

<p>Two years ago, Sven Grundberg tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/svengrundberg/status/489380799511543809">Ingrid Isgren from Sweden&#39;s prosecutors&#39; office says conducting interviews with Assange in London is impossible. He needs to come to Sweden.</a> Not sure what has changed.</p>

<p>This recent <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/20160907/i-saw-no-reason-to-give-assange-special-treatment">article</a> indicates that in addition to the Swedish charges, a US criminal investigation against Assange &quot;could&quot; be ongoing.</p>

<p>It sounded like a pre-recording that they spliced up, and that they asked for the questions before (and there are only 2 or 3 of them towards the end). Don&#39;t rely on the stupid transcript that started getting posted. It doesn&#39;t capture the nature of this bizarre appearance.</p>

<p>There are times where he talks over the panel and just keeps going without skipping a beat.</p>

<p>Some of his stopping points seem very abrupt, and a few times, mid sentence, like they paused the recording.</p>

<p>Towards the end, there are not expected pauses where the questions are translated to him. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s fluent in Spanish. How would he know what they are asking? (easy, they got the questions beforehand and edited together a recording)</p>

<p>It&#39;s an extremely scratchy recording. Good if you&#39;re covering something. </p>

<p>WL&#39;s Twitter never tweeted it (maybe they did like 1 week later, I forget). I found that suspicious, because they know we were desperate for proof of life at that point. Why wouldn&#39;t they say &quot;finally, here is proof of JA&quot;. It seems like they were uncertain if the UMET would work.</p>

<p>There are some lines in the appearance that also appear in other JA videos on YouTube and Vimeo. It&#39;s possible they cut from these older videos, there are hundreds of unique ones out there to choose from. Since some of his comments indicate recency, it&#39;s possible they cut from the full John Pilger interview, which was never aired in full on RT. </p>

<p>After they posted it, a whole bunch of new YT accounts started posting a condensed 30 minute version of the video. The original is about an hour and 20 minutes of JA talking. Listen to the original, not the 30 minute versions, if you want to see what I mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that Pilger is comprimised. Why won&#39;t he tell us the date/location of the interview? I understand why the MSM is covering this up (bc Kerry &amp; Clinton are implicated), but the alternative media is covering it up as well. I&#39;ve tweeted Infowars, WND, Real Strategy, Drudge, &amp; Breitbart to name a few and none will touch the strange facts in the case. I think Trump is keeping it quiet? At first I thought this bc Assange being alive added validity to the wikileaks. But now that Trump won the election, what could possibly be the reason to cover up the facts that Assange is missing? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok let&#39;s do some critical thinking. </p>

<p>For quite some time, WL was dominated by DNC leaks. Absolutely nothing on the RNC or Trump. Sure, they say they only publish what you have (although JA did say they have stuff on Trump but didn&#39;t release it because it wasn&#39;t as damaging as public comments) but you believe that only because it&#39;s what they&#39;ve said, and up until now, you&#39;ve had no reason not to trust them. </p>

<p>Russia and Putin were vocal Trump supporters and called on full cooperation with the US as soon as he was elected. Aka, Russia wanted Trump to win and would benefit from leaks that hurt the DNC and Hillary. </p>

<p>A month ago, the leaks were nearing their end and Russia decided it was time to end their friendship with WL and take JA out. Or Russia snuffed out that their new buddy actually had shit on them and was planning on releasing it. </p>

<p>Also I remember about a year ago (could be wrong?) JA said he had massive stuff on Putin but it never came out. </p>

<p>Right now I&#39;d say there&#39;s about as much connecting this back to Russia as there is to Kerry or the US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting perspective. If a jet that had ties to a Russian rendition operation, were to have sped off with Putin, in tail, then I would travel further down that rabbit hole.</p>

<p>All of the tangible evidence leans towards a US based operation to snuff wikileaks.</p>

<p>Russia is being pretty transparent about their opinions. From the DMC and podesta leaks, we know that the secret government of the US likes to keep a private vs public opinion.</p>

<p>Also, let&#39;s be careful here with saying the Russia government is transparent. Over here in the States we get a very limited look into their operations. I&#39;m sure they have plenty of behind the scenes corruption, some of which probably goes well beyond that of the DNC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read that out of context. Alex Jones was making the hype train, and threats, no Assange. Alex Jones is controlled opposition. He has credibility as a man who breaks down in tears, and over sensationalizes things to make you look like a nut to investigate &quot;conspiracy theories.&quot;</p>

<p>Russian hackers were responsible for the email leaks? According to who? That is speculation based off of propaganda.</p>

<p>Plenty of articles about Russian influence</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m Canadian so I really don&#39;t have any stake or allegiance to the American political system; however, Canadian media HAS covered Russian online influence.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen that in the Podesta dumps, so they werent holding back what were in his words the most damaging stuff.</p>

<p>The other stuff in your post are suspicious for sure, but I&#39;m not convinced Wikileaks is compromised. </p>

<p>I doubt that your average CIA worker is aware of the big picture. Imagine a massive pitch black hangar where building is being constructed. You are given a board, couple nails and hammer. Your job is to nail that in place but you can only see the wall you are working, everything else is hidden in the dark. In fact, you don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s floor, wall, or roof you&#39;re nailing the board on. Divide and rule. </p>

<p>I added couple cents more but yeah, who knows. Couldn&#39;t agree more with that. </p>
