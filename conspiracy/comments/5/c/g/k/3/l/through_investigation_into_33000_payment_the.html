        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>HMA</strong></p>

<p>Found an interesting email when searching for HMA (Health Management Associates), the company run in the 80s by a crony of the Clintons who gave 33,088.777 hemo kids AIDS and HepC, only to have her brag about her support of AIDS decades later, as a campaign talking point (dispicable!).</p>

<p>Instead of HMA, I found a doc on Huma Abedin.  Isn&#39;t that super, DUPER curious?  Huma =&gt; <em>HMA</em>.  I guess that makes them blood-sisters.  Rofl.  Anyway: turns out Human Abedin has been under investigation for a very long time by the OIG, who informed the FBI and they did <strong>nothing</strong>.   Maybe the $33,000 informed them that this was a Obama-level thing and they should look the other way, lest they step on the feet of the global freemason mafia (that&#39;s what 33,000 means...it&#39;s 33 on a global 1000 level scale). Basically, the FBI didn&#39;t want to be embroiled in geocryptopolitics and looked the other way.</p>

<p><em>We won&#39;t though.  Enough with this triple agent spyshit: If the FBI and CIA can&#39;t do their job, the open source intelligence movement will...</em></p>

<p><strong>UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES RELATED TO INVESTIGATIONS INTO MS. HUMA ABEDIN’S TENURE AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Ms. Abedin ended her full-time employment with the State Department, she received...</p>

<p><em>a payment of approximately</em> <strong><em>$33,000</em></strong><sup><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58s3xa/statistics_come_in_33000_flavors/">[33k-1]</a><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5b8rb8/numbers_come_in_33000_flavors_part_2_the_podesta/">[33k-2]</a></sup></p>

<p>[...] to compensate her leave time that she had earned but not used.  In the late summer of 2013, the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) opened an inquiry into that payment to determine whether Ms. Abedin had been overpaid. Ms. Abedin cooperated fully with OIG’s inquiry, including by providing a recorded interview on October 10, 2014. On January 26, 2015, the OIG finalized a report in which it concluded that Ms. Abedin was overpaid approximately $10,000.</p>

<p>Relying on the OIG’s report, the State Department’s Global Financial Services Center’s Office of the Comptroller (the Comptroller) sent Ms. Abedin a letter on April 30, 2015, requesting repayment of approximately $10,000 for alleged overpayments that she received.  In response, Mr. Rodriguez requested copies of all records relating to the alleged overpayment.  At that point, Mr. Rodriguez was provided a redacted copy of the OIG’s January 26, 2015 report for the first time.</p>

<p>On May 29, 2015, Mr. Rodriguez, sent a letter to the Comptroller stating that Ms. Abedin would exercise her right to appeal.  (Exh. 1)  Mr. Rodriguez’s letter detailed factual inaccuracies and methodological deficiencies in the OIG’s report, including, for example OIG’s miscalculation of the time Ms. Abedin spent working after giving birth to her son.  Mr. Rodriguez also noted that the OIG had refused to provide Ms. Abedin or Mr. Rodriguez an opportunity to inspect and copy documents that formed the basis of the OIG’s report.</p>

<p>Ms. Abedin’s appeal is currently pending.  In the interim, there have been at least three unauthorized disclosures (or leaks) relating to OIG’s investigation and Senator Charles Grassley’s parallel inquiries into Ms. Abedin’s tenure at the State Department.  Information about these leaks is provided below.</p>
