       George Soros finances neo nazis in Ukraine, and Black Lives Matter in the US. BLM operates on the idea that black people can't be racist, and the white devil is responsible for everything wrong in the black community.
      </p>
      <p>
       This creates extremely dangerous, angry black people, who would chill the fuck out if they became aware of their own prejudices, bigotry, and racism, and started looking at people as fellow human beings.

       BLM is a terrorist group.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't help that the last eight years the president (proven ties to soros) has steadily  worked to implant the idea that whites are responsible for black suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what's amazing is even when you point out the truth here people are being good little dogs and saying "durrr you perpetuate divisiveness" as if whites are supposed to come out and say, OK blacks, you got us. We will stop making you suffer now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their brainwashing hasn't just reached BLM, it's here too.

       BLM doesn't just create dangerous, angry black people.  It creates much more dangerous, white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason is, they are being put into a corner, and you know what they say about dogs in corners...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm of the belief, that if they attempt to harm you, you have every right to kill them.  Some idiots will say, no, you can't kill someone for being violent, but that's pure idiocy.  What, let them harm you, but you have to sit there and take it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'm more dangerous than they are.  I'm willing to die/be imprisoned just to kill one of them.  ( radical blacks/whites who attack others).

       As a black man, it's clear this shit is bigger than how blacks (might) view themselves. There is a racial divide occurring right now and making generalizations like that aren't helping.

       The American middle class has been gutted. What you think of as the large, vibrant white middle class is a thing of the past. The black middle class has been gutted as well. But keep ignoring suffering based on skin color.

       Everyone is this thread has communicated in a logical way besides you. Do you do this to every argument that you don't agree with or know anything about?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's so clearly illogical, shouldn't it be easy for someone as intelligent for yourself to make him look as wrong as ever? Instead you have posted meaningless keyboard puke.

       I don't think you are an unintelligent person at all. I just want to point out that you have posted like a child simply because you don't understand/agree, or because even entertaining the idea makes you uncomfortable.

       Yes. "Others" are feeling safe enough to express their attitudes towards white dudes. Most white guys aren't overtly racist. But if you're a person who suffered racist attacks from a white dude, you're going to view all the other white guys who didn't speak up in your defense to, at the very least, implicitly condone the racism. You can't allow actual racist comments to fly around and claim exemption with an "I didn't say it" mentality. If we don't start calling out racism when it happens--and we have to do it publicly--we'll be in for a world of butthurt when white men eventually lose their grip on the majority.

       I'm not gonna get into parsing the difference between "oppressed white males" vs "everyone against white males".  With a few moments of free time, though, I dug up some stats on this most recent election season.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of 33 of our new senators, 25 of them were white males.  6 women.  1 black.  1 cuban.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our most recently elected president is a distinctively offensive version of a typical white male.  He won against a pseudo-liberal female.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, 76% of the senate elections were won by white males.  The new president is a white male.
      </p>
      <p>
       If "everyone" is "conspiring" against white males, they're doing a spectacularly terrible job.

       Terrible examples with one sided statistics. How many South American or black people are running for those offices? And white people in government are your best definition of oppression?

       The American middle class has been gutted. What you think of as the large, vibrant white middle class is a thing of the past. The black middle class has been gutted as well. But keep ignoring suffering based on skin color.
