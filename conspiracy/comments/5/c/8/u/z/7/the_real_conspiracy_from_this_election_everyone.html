    <div class="md"><p>George Soros finances neo nazis in Ukraine, and Black Lives Matter in the US. BLM operates on the idea that black people can&#39;t be racist, and the white devil is responsible for everything wrong in the black community.</p>

<p>This creates extremely dangerous, angry black people, who would chill the fuck out if they became aware of their own prejudices, bigotry, and racism, and started looking at people as fellow human beings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BLM is a terrorist group. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help that the last eight years the president (proven ties to soros) has steadily  worked to implant the idea that whites are responsible for black suffering. </p>

<p>And what&#39;s amazing is even when you point out the truth here people are being good little dogs and saying &quot;durrr you perpetuate divisiveness&quot; as if whites are supposed to come out and say, OK blacks, you got us. We will stop making you suffer now. </p>

<p>Their brainwashing hasn&#39;t just reached BLM, it&#39;s here too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>BLM doesn&#39;t just create dangerous, angry black people.  It creates much more dangerous, white people.</p>

<p>The reason is, they are being put into a corner, and you know what they say about dogs in corners...</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the belief, that if they attempt to harm you, you have every right to kill them.  Some idiots will say, no, you can&#39;t kill someone for being violent, but that&#39;s pure idiocy.  What, let them harm you, but you have to sit there and take it?</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m more dangerous than they are.  I&#39;m willing to die/be imprisoned just to kill one of them.  ( radical blacks/whites who attack others).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. &quot;Others&quot; are feeling safe enough to express their attitudes towards white dudes. Most white guys aren&#39;t overtly racist. But if you&#39;re a person who suffered racist attacks from a white dude, you&#39;re going to view all the other white guys who didn&#39;t speak up in your defense to, at the very least, implicitly condone the racism. You can&#39;t allow actual racist comments to fly around and claim exemption with an &quot;I didn&#39;t say it&quot; mentality. If we don&#39;t start calling out racism when it happens--and we have to do it publicly--we&#39;ll be in for a world of butthurt when white men eventually lose their grip on the majority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not gonna get into parsing the difference between &quot;oppressed white males&quot; vs &quot;everyone against white males&quot;.  With a few moments of free time, though, I dug up some stats on this most recent election season.</p>

<p>Out of 33 of our new senators, 25 of them were white males.  6 women.  1 black.  1 cuban.</p>

<p>Our most recently elected president is a distinctively offensive version of a typical white male.  He won against a pseudo-liberal female.</p>

<p>So, 76% of the senate elections were won by white males.  The new president is a white male.  </p>

<p>If &quot;everyone&quot; is &quot;conspiring&quot; against white males, they&#39;re doing a spectacularly terrible job.</p>
