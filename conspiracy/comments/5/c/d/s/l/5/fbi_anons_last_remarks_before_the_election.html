       That's a hell of a read! Thanks for the link, but now with a skeptic's hat on, can you provide a single piece of irrefutable, non circumstantial proof that this FBIanon was actually from FBI and not some random 4chan troll(s) who threw enough shit on the wall to see that some stuck? I'd love to dig into this, but I've not seen any conclusive proof that this anonymous person who posted on 4chan pretending to be from the FBI is actually real.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, before I get gishgalloped with "proof", please keep in mind that I'm asking for THE definitive proof, a smoking gun, that this FBIanon is actually from the FBI or has released credible info that he's the verified primary source for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find the use of "FBIanon" for all the "leaks" and further discussions suspicious. If you had used "Real FBI agent leaks damaging stuff etc.", your post would be removed from this sub, or at best if it gets traction before mods notice it, get a "misleading claim" flair, because it would have made news elsewhere.

       If this existed he would be an official whistleblower and the people like Assange would be taking notice. It would be all over the alt media.

       This is only ever going to be circumstantial/confirmed after the events happen and we can look back to check accuracy.

       I'm not sure, honestly I haven't been following it close enough to answer that accurately.

       I just know there is no definitive proof, because if there was it would be an entirely different story. It would have either been squashed instantly, or it would be the biggest story out there.

       Everything he said came true, down to them hoping for a Trump presidency so that they could start arresting people without fear for their life.  He did mention one person died already so they don't want to release more info until all people are safe.

       You will never get this kind of proof if FBIanon is really FBI. The best we ever got is the words from FBIanon being true and the

       I believe in the original FBIAnon. He may have been throwing shit at a wall to see what stuck, but it was damned accurate. Things like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Q:  Will she be indicted?
A:  There is intense pressure for us not to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        The real point of interest is the Clinton Foundation, not the e-mail server.
She had SAP level programs on her server
Comey has been trying to stall because he does not want to face the Clinton machine,
They are attempting to distract by putting the focus on Hillary's emails and not the Foundation.
Lynch has also given to the Foundation, and has many ties
Soros is at the heart of all of this.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These are all statements that have had information about them in the wikileaks. Everything else FBIAnon talked about was answering speculation and random questions. To which he provided some of the most level headed answers I've seen. Also, remember the timing of this. DNC Leak hadn't happened yet. Bernie was still campaigning. Based on this info, I believe FBIAnon is real. I don't htink the person who wrote the above is FBIAnon.

       There are forensic methods examining writing style. The look a word use, sentence length, interpunction etc. It is pretty effective in identifying and distinguishing  anonymous writers from what I've heard. Not sure if the software is available and accessible to us but asking around in the sciency subs might help those who want to know further.

       It doesn't matter... It doesn't matter if he is real intelligence either. It doesn't matter if it turns out FBI Anon is the Philippines government with Dueterte shit posting on 4 chan. FBI Anon is just the moniker that stuck. The fascination on his/their true identity screams of misinformation and misdirection to me. Whether organized or organic. We should focus on what they said not who they are.

       I don't think this is the same as the first guy. But I think they are both LARPers. The first one seemed more legit but didn't really give any new information. The stuff this guy provides is readily available on a Google search.

       To be fair and play devil's advocate, if he were a real agent he would certainly not want to be exposed and would likely be very cautious. We simply don't know.

       One thing you be should alert on is when FBIanon said he put disinfo into his answers. Why do such a thing? We're constantly getting thrown disinfo by the Elites onto the* masses, how are we suppose to know what's the truth? Any smart person would just avoid questions if it would "reveal them".

       He can't do this without some insiders. He's not a career politician so he will need experienced political guidance and there are not enough people with the political experience he needs that are clean from the swamp.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am hoping is that he is likely picking people he knows are part of the problem but have knowledge and experience he requires and simply using them as a means to end.

       These are not statements I think FBIAnon would make, nor any FBI agent under any circumstance. Sounds like any other regular here. FBIanon was RELUCTANTLY supportive of Trump. That's a far step from spouting the drain the swamp rhetoric. FBIanon's grammar and punctuation were surprisingly good. Never resorted to caps. FBIAnon never came to us for info. He has the info and is providing to us. FBIAnon knew how corrupt DNC was. FBIAnon never used leading questions.

       We already got all these people in the street confused about what to be mad at. Give them something real to be mad at.

        What is ironic is they appointed Jack Lew (Hillary's right hand man, according to the article) to look into it. DynCorp has a history of stealing money. "1991 State of the Nation It appears that Dyncorp broke the original investigation on this. Dyncorp was the accountant for

       amazing research and insight. Wherever you look it appears that Hillary is at the top of the chain of all things going on children exploitation wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is literally hiring people for key roles who are corrupted and evil like her self.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is actually happening is my true belief. I am a very skeptical person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, id like to add weight to your theory, because there was a tweet from somebody fairly high up in the chain of command on Hillary's side saying something like
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "If you see any massive stories from Wikileaks in the next few days, its probably false."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There was major confusion and backlash about this tweet, because they were literally owning up to something huge that is or might be coming, they were in a state of panic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing massive ever dropped however, we have enough pieces of the puzzle now to form a picture, or at least of a 3 dimensional shape appearing. We just do not know its 4th dimension, which is time. WHEN will it come out, and for god sake i hope it comes out soon.

       Excellent post, thank you for your service.

       This is what I suspected. I think the the FBI was able to convince the NYPD to hold back on the nasty shit because the more typical corruption was enough to prosecute.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police know, especially with all the rioting/protesting lately, how terrible it could go if the entire elite class was exposed for child trafficking.
      </p>

       Do you think wikileaks is claiming ignorance to the cheese pizza thing for the sake of preventing unrest as well?

       The whole point of this evidence is to bring down those people in control of the ring, at the top, not a few participants!

       Do you have a link to some of these? I don't go too deep into some of these things but if there are wikileaks emails providing evidence for her being a high satanic priestess I will read them.
