       Civil unrest helps the liberals push their legislation involving gun control and the stripping of rights and freedoms and sovereignty. They want a police state. They want a nanny state. They want to control every aspect of human life. They are the puppets of the corporate and banking elite who don't ever want to see the 1700's-1900's happen again in the West. When leaders like Napolean and Hitler were able to rally the disenfranchised and tear down the economic monopolies and stop foreign influence. They want world government and permanent imperialism. They want cheap labour and they want outsourcing to be the standard even on a domestic level through multiculturalism. They want the bottom fighting with each other. Genders, races and classes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal governments have no policy that will help improve quality of life. They are only interested in distraction. They mask their agenda with the appearance of improving quality of life. The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists.

       There are not many dogs. Some ignorant students brainwashed by equally ignorant teachers emerging from safe spaces to cry and threaten suicide. Who cares? Only the fake media addicts who follow this. Soros paying thugs to incite violence is something that should be stopped as the convicted felon belongs in Prison for his advocating the violen t overthrow of the  gov. He's hoping the cops shoot some students in response to his thugs.

       Elections are not a once in a lifetime deal, the campaigning for the next one has already started and the first thing that democrats want to get across is that Trump is one of the most unpopular Presidents in US history before he has even got into office.

       Can you do arithmatic? Seems not. Common core your problem? Hillary cheated and had the whole facist media behind her, illegals cheating their way into the polling booth at Obama's direction and she still lost. If you think the electoral college will deny they Presidency to the man voted for by 50+ million gun ownning Americans, you are sadly dillusional.

       The thing about martial law is .... it takes an awful lot of military and police to corral 350 million armed gun owners, especially when a LOT of those military and police are big time believers in not having martial law.   How can you trust your military and police to keep people corralled when you're asking them to corral their own people, to deny their own neighbors their lawful rights?  It can get kinda "iffy" quick.   Okay, so you want to use "foreign" troops.... do they really think that'll go over any better?   Tell us aliens are invading and we'll beg to have troops in our home to protect us but take away our guns to make us safer?  Probably not going to work. At all.

       Because it helps them to build a fear based narrative.  Something like, "Oh look what you idiots made. We told you Hillary was the future Pres. and you didn't listen. Now you can deal with the fallout on your own."

       One thing the French and Russian revolutions taught the upper class was even if the ruling class is terrible and revolution is good for most people, it is bad for the rich. So no matter how bad Trump is, they prefer him to real change. So want Hillary to make it stop.

       Simply because the Electoral College isn't ratified yet. The more political unrest the better for her. Gore had nowhere near this kind of nationwide sympathy on his side so he never had a chance to sway an electoral vote. Hillary doesn't either now but she is clinging on to the hope of it. The dnc is relentless and if they can find a way to break the system they will do it.

       Nothing is wrong with peaceful protests. Protesting (rioting) because "he's not my President" is rather sad. Sometimes your candidate doesn't win. That's how democracy works. Now is not the time to divide this country any further.

       The DNC had every chance to put Bernie into the ring and avoid this nonsense, but due to a corrupt DNC they picked Hillary. Now everybody is pissed at Trump.

       These protests are not for a cause. They are not productive and have no actual goal. They're only destructive and appear to be fake grassroots, funded by people like George Soros. That's messed up.

       Nothing but this sub is run by alt right cunts who always point out false flags but when its a "leaked video" to showcase them in a negative light makes the entire protest seem discredited but then defend all cops when ppl point out their criminal activity by saying not to generalize them This place is much more compromised by these "victimized"right wing types that dont like change them drop George Soros name enough that the cynical ppl just accept it as fact because they link to Breitbart site which has been compromised. They claim they are pointing out the corruptness while not disclosing who they work for under the guise of just being random posters expressing their opinion
