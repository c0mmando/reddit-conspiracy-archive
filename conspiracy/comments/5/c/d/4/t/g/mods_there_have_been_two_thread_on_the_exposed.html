<p>The first, we don&#39;t know why it was deleted. The second, the user says the post was deleted/shadowbanned without his consent:</p>

<p>Shadowbanned from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>: Bill Maher, Dan Schneider, Corey Haim, other rumors</p>

<p>What is going on here? Because it really looks like you&#39;re protecting pedophiles. Please clear this up. Thanks.</p>

<p>edit: I did try PMing the one mod I trusted. Twice. No reply, but maybe he&#39;s just afk.</p>

<p>edit2: And you know I&#39;ve screenshotted this post, so... yeah.</p>

<p>This first one below was deleted by the user him/herself. You can tell that because the submitter name says [deleted]. </p>

<p>The second one was submitted this morning by an account less than a day old. All posts and comments from new accounts are automatically quarantined by Automoderator, and have to be manually approved by a human mod. Since the mods are just ordinary users like you, there are actually periods when all of us are doing other things, and the modqueue isn&#39;t dealt with immediately. I am here now, and have approved the post below.</p>

<p>In future, please message the mods and wait for a response before descending into hysteria with a post like this.</p>

<p>If you tell me who the user was, I can check if it was an admin, or if they deleted the post themselves. All I can tell you is that it was nothing to do with the mods.</p>

<p>He said &quot;it really looks like you&#39;re protecting pedophiles.&quot; </p>

<p>I think it would have been sensible to wait for a response from the mods before making this accusation. Since the mods of this sub do NOT delete any posts due to content, there was likely to be a rational, and much more mundane explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still not convinced that that was really WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>But I agree, the problem comes when people start with the yelp reviews and pedo remarks all over the internet.</p>

<p>If they are actually involved in dark shit like that, then good, fuck em. But if they&#39;re not? God damn how much would that suck?? Seriously think about it. You&#39;re just some family who owns a pizza shop (or daycare) who hand drew some random logo that you thought looked fine. Then all of a sudden, you see 14 new yelp reviews saying you fuck kids at your establishment! I can&#39;t even imagine how much of a PR disaster that would be.</p>

<p>I think we should keep up the research and don&#39;t stop digging, but we do need to encourage people to cut out the doxxing shit until there is some concrete evidence of wrongdoing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Then good, fuck em&quot; ???  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the kind of attitude that will not bring upon any sort of change. They should be held accountable for their actions and called out. Even if it is just a yelp review, it&#39;s bringing attention to those unaware. Those pizza shops need to be brought to the ground. If you&#39;ve done your research, the evidence is there that places like Comet Ping Pong are involved in pedophilia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have done the research, and there is no evidence. There is a ton of sketchy pieces of information that certainly INFER some fucked up shit, including pedophilia. But to say there is concrete evidence of anything is just disingenuous.</p>

<p>My entire point was, you can&#39;t just go around publicly convicting people of the darkest crimes imaginable without actual evidence. If anything, all this &quot;calling of attention&quot; to it just gives them time to cover their tracks and tie up the loose ends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One way to derail and bury any stuff like this is to launch unfounded accusations &amp; vague innuendo based on the word &quot;pizza.&quot;  Which may be an intentional &amp; brilliant security measure by a pedophile ring.  But reactionary partisans &amp; hysterical ideologues on this subreddit -- or agents posing as such -- are making this a conspir-a-tainment amusement park ride to have a fun Hillary witch-hunt, accusing anyone who ever used the word &quot;pizza&quot; of being a cannibal pedophile, not to mention ignoring decades of documented history &amp; cases that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> isn&#39;t including, because it&#39;s just Hillary that&#39;s the motivation &amp; target, conveniently aiding the larger global organized operation.</p>

<p>In the context of the overall pedo-ring timeline, it&#39;s not merely idiotic to propose that Hillary or Bill are operating such a ring, it ignores the most famous U.S. glimpse of the iceberg (revealing how little this subreddit really gives a fuck about the topic), because according to the central witness (go read John DeCamp&#39;s book, the whole fucking thing and not a YouTube clip through a pundit&#39;s filter) it&#39;s a global U.S. military operation running for decades and started by the Ratlines, another term I&#39;m not going to explain to people who are just exploiting the topic for excitement, fun, hysteria &amp; bloodsport.</p>

<p>If you really give a fuck about the topic, educate yourself beyond one contemporary ounce of the iceberg, before you help them discredit the whole historical data with your &quot;Pizza Panic&quot;, which is what you are helping Snopes bury it as.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just making fun of OP. I didn&#39;t really expect it to get deleted. It is funny that it&#39;s been explained to him but he hasn&#39;t deleted it either. It&#39;s pretty clear that drama is his goal. You guys should keep an eye on him in the future. I bet he&#39;ll do it again.</p>
