<p>the conspiracy was that the election was rigged. It still may have been, just not in the way we think. I still don&#39;t buy that Clinton and Trump are on different teams. </p>

<p>Obama still has presidential power for another 2 months. plenty of time for another power play. </p>

<p>We have proof of pedofiles, traitors, liars, and cheats. If we say we&#39;ve won now, they all walk. Bill Clinton passed an executive pardon on Marc Rich at the last minute. Obama could still do the same.</p>

<p>The FBI and the MSM now have no benefit for shilling for Hillary they way they have in the past year. Watch to see if they turn on her or not.</p>

<p>There is still plenty of time before the Trump Presidency for something new to hit the fan. If anything, this will be when it does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I asked this also in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5c0im2/the_fact_that_last_nights_results_come_as_a_shock/">here</a></p>

<p>What do you make of</p>

<ul>
<li>   PA was TRUMP&#39;s 1-2 hours before they called it. You had commentators saying things like, PA is going to go TRUMP&#39;s way, but we&#39;re not calling it yet.</li>
<li>   The NYT suddenly changed their percent of vote counted in PA from 98% to 89% about 1/2 hr before they called it</li>
<li>   hillary did not concede.</li>
<li>   The Dow Jones was down 800 pts. then suddenly it was only down 300 pts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Were they planning to / trying to rig PA for hillary?</p>

<p>I keep reading about the markets imploding; and the looming bust of Obamacare. Are those factors going to be propped up until Trump is sworn in, or will the shit-storm start just before? So he is forced into a precarious situation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order for him to pardon her, I would assume she would have to first admit guilt. I feel like any way they have to play this would involve - no...REQUIRE some kind of truth to come out.
Edit: Phrased poorly, not admit guilt but be accused or charged of a crime. But my point remains - there has to be something they can stick - the question is whether they want it to come out or not.</p>
