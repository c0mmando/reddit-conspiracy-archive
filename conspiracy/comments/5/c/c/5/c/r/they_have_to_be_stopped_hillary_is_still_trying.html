       First you need to know that ctr have not left.  Keep that in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that remains to be awarded are Michigan's 16 electoral votes, with Trump leading by a mere 12000 votes. If she is successful in "winning" Michigan, then all it takes is to claim that vote totals in Florida were tampered with (likely through hacking)... they will recount or award it to Clinton outright and the White House is hers.
      </p>
      <p>
       They cheated to get it this close and they aren't going to let it die.  They need to be stopped. We need to start focusing the narrative on how she performed in Colorado, Michigan, Nevada, Florida, New Hampshire, Maine, and Virginia.  Start up the discussion of whether she cheated to get the totals she got, especially the popular vote.  Do it in as many forums as you can.  She can be stopped.  Do it now before they finish tampering with the results and award her the White House.
      </p>

       edit: r/The_Donald is compromised.  I was banned in the middle of October for 3 days.  Without posting again, I now seem to have a lifetime ban.  I created a new account and posted it there.  It was removed.  CTR is alive and well.

       edit 2: r/HillaryforPrison is compromised too.

       Chances are we live in a simulation.  We know that the Universe is too big not to have other intelligent life, since that is the case some of them must be trying to simulate worlds and the universe, That means there is only one real universe and lots of simulations.  So all things being equal its more likely that this fake than it is that it is real.

       Well, you can't say it's
       <em>
        more likely
       </em>
       when we don't have accurate numbers for how many civilizations there are that can simulate a universe. Also, we don't know how big these simulations are? But with quasi-infinite storage/processing power, I could concede your statement to be true. Upvoted regardless for interesting comment.

       Actually she can win them. Only 23 states have laws that force their electors to honor their electorate vote. If she bought them off in advance it could be a done deal in her favor already.

       Clinton will not fight this now that she has conceded publicly. I was worried before her concession speech, but not anymore. Another probable reason why she wont fight it is because there would be an investigation into the votes, and that would expose her fraud. I have no doubt that she has massive amounts of votes that should not be counted....felons, illegals, dead people, and voting machine manipulation. Shes done. Focus on what Trump does now. He owes his voters a prosecution on her, and a lot of other things he said he would do.

       Donald Trump is not the President of the United States until his inauguration.  Until then, he is President "elect" --- KEY WORD: ELECT --- and has won nothing.  If the electoral college swings back her way, she wins.  It's that simple.

       Well, people seem to think she conceded makes the situation a Triple Dog Dare in which she cannot challenge the results.  It's like that movie A Christmas Story in which the power of "Triple Dog Dare" leads to ridiculous outcomes of behavior, the idea of "she conceded" seems to make some people mistakenly think that the law or the constitution bind her future behavior leading up to the Electoral College.

       It's true that honor is a concept and would suggest obedience to a concession, but it's not a given in the black and white of the law that concession means anything more than any other bs.

       She has no honor whatsoever, and the whole point is that they will drop "new information" implying the Russians hacked the election, or some other bullshit.  They may just scratch and claw their way there by paying for electoral votes...

       You guys need to actually read what I wrote.  If she wins Michigan and they "find evidence" of tampering, then they can recount and award her the state (a state just big enough to give her the win, like ...say.. Florida???) and then she wins.  Trump is not President until he is sworn into office.

       If Trump is somehow made "unfit" before the electoral college votes, then all the Trump votes are thrown out.  It would be less work to "unfit" Trump than to fake rig florida and really rig michigan.

       It looks like things are moving in that direction, but they would have to orchestrate a coup to put her over the top.  If that happened, the red states would start a civil war.  I think they will try to buy off the electoral college, because they are that stupid and desperate for power.

       This could also be a ploy to try to frighten Trump into not prosecuting them if they leave him alone for a year.
