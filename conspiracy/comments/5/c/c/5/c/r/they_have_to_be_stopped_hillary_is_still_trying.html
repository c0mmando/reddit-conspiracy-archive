<p>All that remains to be awarded are Michigan&#39;s 16 electoral votes, with Trump leading by a mere 12000 votes. If she is successful in &quot;winning&quot; Michigan, then all it takes is to claim that vote totals in Florida were tampered with (likely through hacking)... they will recount or award it to Clinton outright and the White House is hers.</p>

<p>They cheated to get it this close and they aren&#39;t going to let it die.  They need to be stopped. We need to start focusing the narrative on how she performed in Colorado, Michigan, Nevada, Florida, New Hampshire, Maine, and Virginia.  Start up the discussion of whether she cheated to get the totals she got, especially the popular vote.  Do it in as many forums as you can.  She can be stopped.  Do it now before they finish tampering with the results and award her the White House.</p>

<p>edit: r/The_Donald is compromised.  I was banned in the middle of October for 3 days.  Without posting again, I now seem to have a lifetime ban.  I created a new account and posted it there.  It was removed.  CTR is alive and well.</p>

<p>edit 2: r/HillaryforPrison is compromised too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton will not fight this now that she has conceded publicly. I was worried before her concession speech, but not anymore. Another probable reason why she wont fight it is because there would be an investigation into the votes, and that would expose her fraud. I have no doubt that she has massive amounts of votes that should not be counted....felons, illegals, dead people, and voting machine manipulation. Shes done. Focus on what Trump does now. He owes his voters a prosecution on her, and a lot of other things he said he would do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, people seem to think she conceded makes the situation a Triple Dog Dare in which she cannot challenge the results.  It&#39;s like that movie A Christmas Story in which the power of &quot;Triple Dog Dare&quot; leads to ridiculous outcomes of behavior, the idea of &quot;she conceded&quot; seems to make some people mistakenly think that the law or the constitution bind her future behavior leading up to the Electoral College.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like things are moving in that direction, but they would have to orchestrate a coup to put her over the top.  If that happened, the red states would start a civil war.  I think they will try to buy off the electoral college, because they are that stupid and desperate for power.</p>

<p>This could also be a ploy to try to frighten Trump into not prosecuting them if they leave him alone for a year.</p>
