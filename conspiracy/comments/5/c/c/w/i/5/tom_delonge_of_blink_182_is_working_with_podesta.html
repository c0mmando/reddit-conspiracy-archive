<p>edit- source: interview with Todd Matthews, director of communications for the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2012, we had 661,000 cases of missing persons; and that&#39;s just from that one year. Very quickly, 659,000 of those were canceled. So that means those persons either come back; in some cases, located as deceased persons, maybe never an unidentified person; or just a total misunderstanding.</p>

<p>I agree that pedophilia and human trafficking is a huge problem worldwide, but you guys are so chubbed up over it that you&#39;re way, WAAAAY overblowing the facts.</p>

<p>I blame the lingering Donald enthusiasm when the &quot;investigation&quot; began.  Everyone was so excited that they started exaggerating bigly, like they did on t_d.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and you do realize that &quot;reported missing&quot; is not the same as &quot;disappeared and was never heard from again,&quot; right?  </p>

<p>Plenty of people report their kids missing when they lose them in a park or public place.  Or after thinking that the kid ran away, when they&#39;re taking a nap under a bed.  The latter actually happened to me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m seeing sources that state there were 800,000 cases in 2013, but over half were determined to be runaways.  Besides, the number seems like a ballpark figure, derived from rounding way up.  You&#39;re going to find a lot of alarmist articles about child abduction, because for so many years, MSM news outlets tried to bank on them as ratings-grabbing horror stories.  Don&#39;t get caught up in the hysteria.  I&#39;d like to see your articles that support Satanism and Pedophilia being rampant among the elite, I&#39;m sure they come straight from abc too lol.  And I&#39;m not talking costume parties like Bohemian Grove, if you celebrate Halloween then you have no right criticizing someone for having stupid make-believe theme parties</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even doubt that they would use UFO disclosure as a way to cover up child or teen abductions, I just strongly disagree with the hyperbolic nature of every conversation that has to do with Podesta or Hillary.  These are people who very likely have ties to bad things that have happened, and any exaggeration will doubtlessly reduce the strength of a case against them.</p>

<p>And half of 800k is how much? &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot;??</p>

<p>You act like &quot;estimated to be runaways&quot; can&#39;t be a blatant coverup for what is really happening.  Just look at McCann&#39;s parents...there are millions of people like that in this country. </p>

<p>You also seem to be under the incorrect assumption that the MSM worries about ratings more than controlling the message.  All mainstream media is heavily infiltrated by the ci a.  The same ci a that is responsible for the majority of the world&#39;s drug trafficking, terrorism, and missing people.</p>

<p>I agree with your last point though.  It may not be beneficial to go around spouting exaggerated figures to non-believers, but to the people on these boards, it shouldn&#39;t be a big deal, especially when the figures could very well have some basis in reality.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong.  Things are posted here before they become accepted as common fact, and they need to be well put together in order to make the transition into the mainstream.  Credibility is critical if you want to move a conspiracy to the front page of the news.</p>

<p>Did you actually read the rest of what I posted?  661,000 cases reported in 2012, and 659,000 immediately canceled.  People are so worried about things like these happening, that they often jump the gun.  The MSM churning out stories about it to scare people just compounds the effect.</p>

<p>David Icke cites that figure and has given talks to the general public using it, correlating it with satanists and the world&#39;s power brokers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Icke also believes in Reptilians, and is generally ridiculed for being so adamant about putting forward his ideas without proof.  </p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t believe the guy, and I would challenge you to convince people of your original points while using him as a source.  You have to consider that people are going to try to dismiss your evidence, so pick some that is more credible.</p>

<p>If I were buying in to the specific case of pizzagate or Hillary/Podesta&#39;s involvement in human trafficking, I would begin by plotting where they were on the dates of suspect kidnappings.  Should be easier with emails and news articles to go on.  Then, try to find any ties to the family, suspicious elevated government involvement with their families, or common traits between children, family members, the houses they live in, time of day the child could have gone missing, time until reported, etc.  More details will probably stand out once you&#39;re looking for common traits between unsolved cases.</p>

<p>Remember, these people can afford good lawyers, and are used to being in the public eye, as well as under investigation.  You&#39;re going to really need to finger them, without a shadow of a doubt, for charges to stick.  It&#39;s going to be tough, but if there&#39;s a logical and methodical search for clues, I have no doubt that something can be found.</p>
