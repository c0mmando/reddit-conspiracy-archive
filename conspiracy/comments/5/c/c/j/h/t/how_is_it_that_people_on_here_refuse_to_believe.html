       I feel like I am one of just a few atheist, liberal leaning conspiracy theorists on this sub. One thing I've noticed is that sooooo many posts are related to "Satanists" or "Satan worshiping." It seems backwards to me that people cling so strongly to blind faith in one very important issue but refuses to have faith in another important issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       When 9/11 happened, we wanted facts. We refused to believe what was being fed to us - that a primitive terrorist organization all the way around the world had pilots with such amazing skill to maneuver airplanes with more agility and speed than the best pilots in our country, or that burning jet fuel would collapse buildings designed to resist fire destruction, and coincidentally, withstand jumbo-jet strikes. Still we demand proof and have not been given it, therefore; we refuse to accept the official story fed to us by government and media alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do this same critical thinking with every major event. One thing that seems to slip through the cracks is the existence of God or that specific religious beliefs are correct and others are wrong. There is no reliable evidence given to us to back this up. So, why do you think blind faith is okay for religious beliefs but not what our own government tells us?

       This is the exact far extreme I was trying to explain in the post. It's taking small circumstantial pieces of evidence and drawing a grand conclusion based only on that. The equivalent I see would be you find a banana peel in your yard so there must have been monkeys there earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stars depicted with every number of points have been depicted in every culture that ever existed. To say that a six point star or 5 point star necessarily shows one particular belief is a pretty far leap of logic. The same goes for the rituals that have been filmed or depicted. Who knows what the depiction actually was based on robes and owls etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, if the super rich and powerful do worship specific Gods (which are not really Satanic/Christianity based) don't you think they may have better information or understanding of who the creators actually are? Wouldn't you want to know a bit more about their system of religion rather than God/Satan?

       People equate behavior or alien belief systems to what they know. Calling something satanism is just a term for what the elites do behind closed doors. Just because you are athiest doesn't mean these people don't exist. Ancient religion is all around you and obfuscated from your perception. Call them what you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wanting to know more about a belief structure handed down behind closed doors through bloodlines isn't really that appealing to myself. I'd just rather stop their plans.

       I also have no belief in a god. But even without a belief in a god I'm ruled by people where I can't buy alcohol on Sundays due to their beliefs.

       In no way was I trying to "justify these rich fucks" as you put it. I'm simply saying that the personal beliefs of many people on this subreddit seem to be inconsistent with its primary purpose, to reject what we are being told without adequate evidence of its truthfulness. Then again, most people on this subreddit don't discriminate in accepting as true everything they hear from non-establishment entities. To me, this show of gullibility is detrimental to the public's willingness to consider evidence of crime that we have acquired and compiled. I have yet to see any evidence that could even establish it is more likely than not that these individuals practice a certain religion. The Bohemian Grove Human Sacrifice video is not reliable evidence in the slightest. Even assuming it's actual video of the Bohemian Grove gathering, it's obviously a production of some sort. Do you think the rich and powerful don't like entertainment by plays, operas, musicals etc.?
      </p>
      <p>
       The jumping to conclusions about what the purposes are of these meetings or events that take place is incredible. Super-rich and super-elite tend to congregate together... When they demand (or acquire), you can't automatically assume that they're conspiring the dominate the globe, or seize absolute power over all life on earth. If the claim was that the purposes of these gatherings were to discuss or plan future business events that could obtain them more wealth, I'd say it's more likely but there still isn't enough evidence to say one way or another what the purpose is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy is an agreement to violate the law and taking substantial steps in achieving it. If it happened to be true that these elites worship satanic figures, it gives no further evidence of guilt for conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing that the focus on god/satan ... other religious beliefs by conspiracy theorists is a direct consequence of having a lunatic like Alex Jones being our most widely known and domineering spokesperson.  This guy is a worse fear monger than mainstream media. The duty that he has taken upon himself is to compile evidence of conspiracy and report his findings and conclusions to the world. The problem is that he allows his ideologies and belief systems play an integral role in this process. His argument style is "A is true, and B is true... We all know about unrelated C... That means the government is doing Z with Satanism!
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, there are always leaps of logic. When you see a person point a gun at another person and you see the gun fire, then you see the victim fall. You can make the logical leap to determine that he was most likely shot. This logical leap is related enough to the evidence at hand to be sound. A logical leap that is not sound is saying: "This ancient writing says the earth is 10,000 years old. It was also written by several authors separated by hundreds of years. Therefore, scientific data and evidence showing it is billions of years old must be false!" Even if you wanted to say that the Bible is evidence of anything, the value of it is extremely weak and mostly unsubstantiated. Just the fact that events were separated by the writing by hundreds or thousands of years is enough to show that the reliability in the factual nature of the writing is questionable at least and completely unreliable at most. Regardless which you chose, it doesn't provide adequate evidence to prove your beliefs based on those writings are founded.

       There is no judgment from my post. I used to be one of many such as those I was describing. Literally, the only thing I intended to ask is why people have a double standard with regards to needing/wanting proof to verify official narratives told to them by those in power but accept as true religious beliefs without demanding such proof. The only person judging here is you. Right from the first post, your only goal was to insult and restrict me or others from getting answers to an honest inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an honest inquiry and I still believe a good one. I knew there would be many that would take offense but why should they? It's nothing to them or you if I believe or don't believe the same they do.  However, when people such as yourself immediately go into attack mode over such things, when people lose their rational senses over such silly things, it shows their insecurity in what they believe. I get it... I used to be one too. Now with you being insulted that I didn't know your own religious views and beliefs, you're a child... Honestly, I've never heard anyone claim Jesus was a Buddhist. My religious quotes were teasing around with you because you immediately jump to the conclusion that my intent was to insult.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone asks a question and does not overtly try to offend, to call them stupid or idiot or any other insult is attempting to bully someone into discontinuing their search for more understanding. You're an online bully. Your happiness or self value seems to be tied to ridiculing others or suppressing their speech/learning to make yourself feel valuable. You are absolutely right, I haven't checked out the wiki or know who 911Bodysnathers322 is, nor have I investigated all of the religious bs thrown around this subreddit because there are far more productive conspiracies to focus your attention on. Prove 911 and it's mission accomplished for just about everything else. Prove sandy hook - same deal. Proving that someone worships a sun god... okay. Who cares?

       The problem I have with religious people is that they act as long as they believe in Jesus or whatever their belief is, it doesn't matter what the bad people do.

       Yes it does fucking matter if they kill/torture/rape innocent people including children and to deny that whilst burying your head in the sand is cowardly !

       For the most part, religion seems pretty harmless. Obviously there are always an extremist few that will go way overboard in acting out what they believe their gods want, which is problematic. I definitely share your opinion. Those that are godless inherently have more to lose so they live they often live their life in much more productive ways. If you believe there is no afterlife and this is your one and only chance to be in existence, you tend to live as though you've only got one chance to make a difference, to be a good person. But the religious person can make mistakes and be forgiven and live eternally no matter what they do or how they live.

       Just to let you know I am a total liberal religious free zone. And while I still wonder about a belief based life, I stopped worrying about believers. There are though people who harbor sincere religious belief and still maintain an ability to think logically* and rationally  and seek evidence in other areas of their life.

       Perhaps I think differently than most but I think the fact that we question what we are told should be a universal undertaking. What I mean is because we do question what has been said and demand sufficient evidence of its truth before accepting it, why wouldn't we demand the same from those who tell us of our reason for being?

       Godels incompleteness theorem is the scientific rational answer to your question. The truth of religious belief is beyond the provability of the material world and therefore no amount of logic or axiomatic thinking will ever prove or disprove anything regarding the higher realms of existence or lack thereof

       At the very least we can use reason and probability to make informed decisions. You're right that no evidence could absolutely prove either situation, but if the religious beliefs and factual events actually did occur, you would think there would be a wealth of evidence pointing to its truth. Why then elect to believe one religious belief over the other 30,000 religious beliefs?

       Probably the most popular atheist explanation of the origins of Christianity is that the ruler(s) of Rome at around 60 A.D. began spreading rumors, stories and books around the empire to help regulate the dissenting Jewish community. At the time, because Jews believed that their God was the only entity that had authority over them, they refused to bend to the rule of other men. By creating Jesus and allowing the stories to travel through the empire, converted believers would turn the other cheek, obey the laws of the land, love one another unconditionally, give unto Caesar what is Caesar's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming that both explanations cannot be proven or have no evidence of their truthfulness, which one seems to be more probable or likely?

       If you are asking what I believe, I believe in God 100%. I think that Martin Rees book Just 6 Numbers, and other cosmological facts prove Gods existence. I mean prove it to me, not prove it in an absolute sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe the origin of life cannot be explained by Darwinism, another book I would recommend on that would be Thomas Nagel's, (an atheist btw) Mind and Cosmos Why the Materialist Neo Darwinian Conception of Nature is Almost Certainly False.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last I would quote Godel "I believe in the theological world view, this worldview being that the world and everything in it has meaning. This is exactly analogous to the concept that everything has a cause, which is the foundation of all of science."
      </p>
      <p>
       What he is trying to say by that is that cause and effect is not just a concept we should apply to the physical world, we need to apply it to abstract mental world we live in of ideas, numbers, values morals etc. He believes that the abstract mental world is just as real if not more real than the physical world and that if there is no God or afterlife then human existence is completely meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the modern atheists has an extremely difficult time separating the implementation of religious belief in God throughout history in various forms and cultures, all of which are human and finite and thus obviously flawed, from the abstract concept of God which is not in anyway damaged by human religions and their obvious flaws.

       I believe in the absolute, but religion will never be able to claim exclusivity on it, that is obviously a fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is another quote of godels about the absolute that is fascinating to me and illustrates this point quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Language does not allow use to describe the absolute, because anything we say about the absolute is true for something that is not the absolute. Thus we cannot define the absolute. But isn't that interesting? That we can know something important about the absolute just by logic, just by reasoning."

       Mr atheist, have you ever listened to atheist scholars (men with phds) in new testament histeriocity?  Well..they say at the very least 1st corinthians is reliable and true.  That book said 500 witnesses have Jesus raised from the dead..and many were alive at that time the book was witten (possibly 6 months but more widely accepted at 3-6 years aftee Jesus' death).  That means you could just go to Jerusalem and talk to them to verify the source....the bible stood this challenge and exploded in popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not even begun to talk about paul, prophesies, james, ancienct historians like tacitus, the dead sea scrolls, or archelogical findings, or alexander the great...but my evidence and research is not blind.

       You probably meant to ask for 'abiogenesis'. Evolution is just a process of change, it doesn't exactly have a beginning or end - Life is constantly changing.

       The one with the most evidence that points to His existence, Jesus.  His resurrection is a fact when you dig into the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is what evolution stemmed from and what its goals are.  The goal is perfection...aka godhood.

       Atheist is a little strong. What I should have said was Diest. Basically, I believe that there is a higher power that set energies and molecules in motion but beyond that has allowed the forces created to run without interference or supervision. Beyond that, I don't believe we were meant to worship/follow him or that he is eternal in nature. A relative example is that we as humans can use our hands and tools to create structures like the Pyramids. Though we know how man-made structures came to be, the microbes, insects, birds and many other life forms do not. If they are capable of thinking or communication, it's likely they would think that these were created by gods. Generationally, they have been there for millions of generations for ants. They seem to be never ending... Why then would we be different? My beliefs are based on personal observations and understandings, as well as use of logic to determine what seems the most likely explanation for life.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the proof you cite, the evidence that exists is incredibly weak. The fact that the manuscripts/books of the bible were written hundreds/thousands of years after the fact is further evidence of its weak nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this is an honest question, saying Mr. Atheist is an obvious attempt to insult. Let's be a bit more cordial and enjoy some analytical discussion and reserve ad hominems for those without a valid argument but really want to win the debate.

       170 years after Jesus death....we have the new testament.  Some manuscripts ee have as early as 3-6 years after Jesus death.  Do you realize how this compares to other historical manuscripts?  Just watch that video i posted earlier and research it.
      </p>

       This is r/conspiracy , so you should be searching for truth.   The obly truth that matters is whether Jesus is God and if the bible is true.  Do some digging....cuz everythibg else is slavery.

To the jews that believes in him Jesus said,"if you told to my teachings then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free"

       Know and hold to Jesus teachings, and you will knownthe actual truth.

       religious faith and secular belief are two different paradigms of knowledge. apples and oranges. study the bible-- especially the first five books and the New Testament to see for yourself how the transmission of knowledge is different in a faith based epistemic system, read fear and trembling by kierkegaard, too-- really good study of religious faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm not religious but have spent a lot of time studying abrahamic traditions. the faith thing you have to really get on a gut level to fully understand, i'd imagine, but we can still poke around the edges of the systems and see how they behave.

       I was a christian believer for 23 years and an active one at that. It was when I realized that my coming to Jesus was no different from emotions obtained through music, art, movies etc., that I began to think logically about why we believe what we believe and how some of the beliefs transmit to what we as humans inherently find to be immoral or wrong. I may still read the book but at this point I don't feel that religious faith and secular beliefs are different paradigms of knowledge. It would be much easier to let yourself believe that to be true to justify belief in a system that has very insufficient evidence to compel a reasonable person to accept as true.

       Atheistic Materialism is just as improvable as the biblical narrative is. Many of us (myself included) have lived experiences that contradict the Atheist Materialistic world view. These types of experiences can't be duplicated in the same way that other types of events can however, so they will likely never fit into this view. Hundreds of millions, if not billions of people have these sort of spiritual experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stating that the experiences that all these people have are categorically false is an extrordinary claim. As such it requires extraordinary proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more to a religion than just a narrative. Religious narratives are a tool to be used to access the expanded world of spiritual connection. The deep content of religion isn't just beyond logic, but also beyond language. All sort of mystical writing works right at the edge of language to try to turn language against itself and portray the world outside of the box of mental conceptualization. Often these texts become commentaries on the limitations of language itself. Religious narratives become essentially a language of experiences and events where the nouns are people and places and spirits and the verbs are their actions. These narratives are polysemous, finding the reader at the level s/he is able to interact with it on.

       Not really. Its more the idea that there are 30,000 religious belief systems in existence today. Historically, there are millions. My point is why does it matter that so and so worship Bael or are Satanists? It seems nearly as worthless as saying "Jimmy stole this candy bar and he was seen at a private event with another candy thief eating caviar. He worships Zeus!!! He rejects Christianity!" It doesn't seem to matter whether the claims that others follow one religion are true, or if it is true, how it matters at all. If one personal trait is shared by a few criminals, it's not proving that all criminals have that same personal trait. Even if they did, is it causation or correlation? Does this alleged belief system help prove that the person or group has done the alleged crime or is it an irrelevant factor.

       I'm not sure how deep you've looked into this but people don't just say that because they're referring to evil deeds. In many cases the crimes are literally carried out in the name of satan or other 'gods'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just an included detail, like "oh and they're satanic too", but that the actual acts are. It's fanatically ritualistic and I don't think it's a detail that should be left out.

       At the very least we can use reason and probability to make informed decisions. You're right that no evidence could absolutely prove either situation, but if the religious beliefs and factual events actually did occur, you would think there would be a wealth of evidence pointing to its truth. Why then elect to believe one religious belief over the other 30,000 religious beliefs?

       Probably the most popular atheist explanation of the origins of Christianity is that the ruler(s) of Rome at around 60 A.D. began spreading rumors, stories and books around the empire to help regulate the dissenting Jewish community. At the time, because Jews believed that their God was the only entity that had authority over them, they refused to bend to the rule of other men. By creating Jesus and allowing the stories to travel through the empire, converted believers would turn the other cheek, obey the laws of the land, love one another unconditionally, give unto Caesar what is Caesar's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming that both explanations cannot be proven or have no evidence of their truthfulness, which one seems to be more probable or likely?
