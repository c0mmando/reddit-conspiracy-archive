        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It now just seems like a bunch of lazy, self privileged millenials protesting against Trump for Hillary....</p>

<p>....But beware strange and nasty things are going to happen and will SHOCK America.</p>

<p>As quickly soon Agent Provocateurs will be fermenting mass violent riots....</p>

<p>....Police and National Guard will be discredited and blackmailed like Berkut or Czarist Russian Police....</p>

<p>...And Academi snipers will quickly mix into the fray.</p>

<p>Remember that The Russian Revolution, French Revolution, Maidan, Arab Spring or ANY OTHER violent coup started as PEACEFUL PROTESTS. </p>

<p>They only become violent because of agent provocateurs or snipers and this will be blamed on Army/Police/National Guard.</p>

<p>Note that during coups the Police are ALWAYS discredited in order to give way to more chaos and division.</p>

<p>And after it is over....they are KILLED, their uniforms are stolen and their bodies are dragged thoughout the streets. (Remember, not a death threat; This is what happened in Czarist Russia and Venezuela.)</p>

<p>And do not expect the National Guard to save you, they will be blackmailed and dismantled by the CIA.</p>

<p>But back to the Second American Revolution.</p>

<p>This will quickly go big, ugly and dangerous.</p>

<p>I am sure that around 2 weeks to a month violent protests will begin and destroy America.</p>

<p>And when Trump is ousted....Prepare as Hillary will take LIFETIME presidency and commence the purge of a hundred million of Americans with the help of ISIS and Mexican Illegals.</p>

<p>And at the same time, prepare for the end of all rights and free speech once it happens; All Internet platforms will be destroyed or censored.</p>

<p>Dissendent internet records will be searched out to purge them.</p>

<p>A path to Russian and Chinese takeover in World War III will be opened with Hillary attempting to take over Hong Kong and seperate it from China.</p>

<p>Civil War might commence.</p>

<p>Stand up and Wake up....</p>

<p>....It&#39;s NOW....</p>

<p>....OR NEVER!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at Soros web site, a spider&#39;s website. It dangles tempting candy, money, funding, grants, employment. It is a purpose built sociopath magnet, couched in high <em>sounding</em> principles. We probably need to hack the shit out his network as well as freeze his finances.</p>

<p>Take Soros&#39; money and fill some pot holes or build some veteran facilities, house the homeless, or just use it to pay down debt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is he will be immediately replaced by someone just as evil. I don&#39;t believe this one man has personally amassed all the billions required to run all of these organizations, rather he&#39;s pulling that money from a larger pot controlled and protected by some &quot;noble&quot; families that have been around and kept their lines going since the 1500&#39;s.</p>

<p>If Soros was really the string puller, we wouldn&#39;t know his name. Or anything about him, for that matter. But he&#39;s public for a reason. Same goes for the Rothschilds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Figurehead or puppet, doesn&#39;t matter. Take it OUT as it&#39;s part of the whole. In so doing we will expose the mechanism as they scramble for a replacement. One actor expunged, others may question the wisdom of assuming the role. If it&#39;s &quot;noble&quot; families, they are not immune to criminal charges, Marie Antoinette anyone? If it leads to other <em>abusers of the public trust</em> regardless of station, shut them down! Expose them. If the rampant rumors of pedophilia point to the same &quot;class&quot; then, I&#39;d say, it&#39;s time to go back to old fashioned public executions. Obviously, the plot to concentrate the wealth is itself a crime. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not disagreeing with your points, it&#39;s just that it sounds futile. The perception of futility is, itself, a control mechanism. I&#39;m sure Mussolini, at his peak, cross armed posing, jaw jutting could never imagine swinging upside down from a light post. Let&#39;s hope the mad oligarchs choose a different path if they&#39;re as smart as they pose.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not to me. It looks like the same strategy that the &quot;Orange Revolution&quot; employed in Ukraine which did topple the Government. Hillary&#39;s creepy purple dracula looking outfit for her concession speech was a direct message that they were kicking off the Purple Revolution which I think is going to turn into more of a &quot;Project Mayhem&quot;. </p>

<p>It may result in domestic terrorism to force a response from the Government which they hope will create some casualties and show how bad DJT really is.</p>
