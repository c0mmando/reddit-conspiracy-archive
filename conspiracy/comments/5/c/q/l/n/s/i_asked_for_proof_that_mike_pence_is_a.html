       Just in case you are like me and want to know the validity of the infobytes shoved in your face by the mainstream media and thousands of parrots, I wanted to dig into the claim that:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Mike Pence is a diehard creationist!"
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, a "creationist" is a specific term, it is a not a person who believes that God, or an intelligent design, created the world. It is the belief that God created the world (the biblical account) and that God
       <strong>
        didn't use evolution
       </strong>
       as a means.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what creationism actually is. Google it if you don't believe me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to know the extent of the proof that has allowed media outlets everywhere and oblivious redditors to shout "Pence is a creationist"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here it is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        MATTHEWS: Okay, you want to educate the American people about science and its relevance today. Do you believe in evolution, sir?
       </p>
       <p>
        PENCE: Do I believe in evolution? I embrace the view that God created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that’s in them.
       </p>
       <p>
        MATTHEWS: Right. But do you believe in evolution as the way he did it?
       </p>
       <p>
        PENCE: The means, Chris, that he used to do that, I can’t say. But I do believe in that fundamental truth.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The more I questioned this answer as proof enough to scream "Mike Pence is a creationist" the more replies I got saying "he could have said yes but he didn't, thats proof!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Really? He also could have used that opportunity to say "No Chris, I don't believe in evolution as the means."
      </p>
      <p>
       See how that works?
      </p>
      <p>
       When I started
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/5cqfb9/i_would_like_to_be_provided_with_some_actual/">
        an entire topic about it in r/atheism
       </a>
       I was not only provided with no further proof, but mods actually locked my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought other people would be interested in this. I do despise Hillary, but I didn't vote for Trump as well. But I do like to follow the "facts" that are being spouted off by both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one is disappointing. I figured that such a "die-hard creationist" would have plenty of things on the internet proving him to be just that. But no. Basically nothing. And if not answering a question the way that some people wanted him to is your only proof, then your conclusion is sketchy as fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr: Unless Mike Pence says that he doesn't believe in evolution he cannot be defined as a "creationist". Because if believing in God or entertaining the theory that God created the universe automatically makes you a
       <em>
        creationist
       </em>
       then Joe Biden is a creationist, and so are the Bushes, and Obama, etc...

       Does it matter? Like practically speaking. Who cares what he labels his belief as?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is political rhetoric. The point of political rhetoric is to portray your idea in a light that is more well received than if it were phrased in an alternative way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution is a theory that directly contradicts intelligent design. To suggest an alternative theory be held as equal is to imply that alternative theory holds just as much grounds for justification as evolution does.
      </p>
      <p>
       So look at the facts? Pence DOES want an alternative theory taught that involves intelligent design. Look at the sources in this thread. He advocates for that openly. Political rhetoric displays this as a broadened horizon in education.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that it's factually incorrect to hold any rival theory of evolution as equal to evolution. There is overwhelming empirical evidence for evolution. In science, like biology, a standard is set that demands empirically verifiable theories be seen as "better" than metaphysical arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intelligent design is a metaphysical argument. It cannot be empirically verified. Period. If it involves god, it's metaphysical and therefore not empirically verifiable. Making it not science. Making it have no place in a textbook for a biology class.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it illegitimate? That's a matter of opinion. But it's not science. That's a fact by definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is pence a creationist? I don't know. But he believes severely lacking theory should be taught as equal to evolution. And creationists historically fit that description pretty well. So people appropriate that to him. If you're still hung up on the fact that he hasn't explicitly said he's a creationist, then you're getting hung up on something completely meaningless. There's words, and then there's meaning behind words. I can say a lot of things that aren't explicitly shown in the words I choose to portray whatever it is I'm trying to say. That's part of why language is so powerful. You can't look it at so 2 dimensionally.

       No, I am pointing out media propaganda. You cannot spread the infobyte that Pence is a creationist just because he believes in a God. Because then Obama, Bill Clinton, GWB, etc... are all also "creationist".
      </p>
      <p>
       So the word choice actually matters a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of saying "well Pence never actually says he is a creationist but I chose to believe he is one" you should be saying "if Pence never actually says he is a creationist then why is the Western mainstream media shoving the idea that he is one down my throat?"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is called "Interpreting the media" and the fact that people are so bad at it is a huge problem.

       People are using the word creationist to mean "someone who believes in an intelligent designer as opposed to evolution"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a bit of a misnomer when you define everything properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should people be calling him a creationist? Maybe not. But that's not the point, you see. The point is they are saying he denies evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when evolution is the ONLY serious scientific theory, serious as in widely accepted, you can't just say "this should be treated as equal"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the equivalent of denying it. It's an implicit denouncement. An obvious one. And if you disagree with that, you aren't reading between the lines again. Hence, getting caught up in "something meaningless." By that I mean youre trying to focus on the language he chooses for his message rather than the message itself. He could have said a LOT of different things. But he only could meaningfully portrayed a handful of responses
      </p>
      <p>
       Same deal with the "creationist" label. People don't really know the true full definition of 'creationist.' They shouldn't use that word, sure, but if you read between the lines youd realize they are denouncing him as being a denier of evolution as the primary acceptable theory. It doesn't matter if they call him a creationist, a priest, a religious follower, a zealot. Whatever. call him whatever. His literal label is totally beside the point.

       The point of my argument is not to defend Mike Pence's belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of my argument is that "Mike Pence is a creationist" turns into "Mike Pence is a creationist who wants to.... [insert alarmist rhetoric here]."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how propaganda works. It uses half-truths, then makes jumps in logic to sensationalize, then when the lie is an established "fact" in the minds of the public, it creates a false foundation for even more sensationalism and exaggerations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is exactly what we are seeing. I was told by so many people that "Mike Pence is a diehard creationist who wants to rip the theory of evolution from our schools!". So I decided to look into the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I cannot say I was surprised to find that all of that rhetoric is based on flimsy bullshit. And the entire time I was asking, people were acting like it was "such an obvious fact" and "how stupid are you, you cannot even use google!".
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out I am not the sucker here. So I want to point it out so that other people with functional brains capable of media interpretation can see it all laid out. Unfortunately, a large group of people are still missing my point, but that is unsurprising. They are the exact people the media targets.

       Like I said. I don't defend the thought that Mike Pence is a creationist by definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he wants something to be taught alongside evolution which is not at all justified to be true. There's no factual basis behind intelligent design teachings. 
Creationism also has no factual basis behind it. It's all analogy and anecdotal evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So really- it doesn't matter what he says. The point is He's arguing for something to be taught as equal to something that it is not even close to equal with. And the point is that it's a detriment to our system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally. If he WERE a creationist. He would be arguing for basically the same exact thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal doesn't change. So the tactic to raise awareness doesn't either. It's ALL political rhetoric. People don't give two flying fucks about how to actually define creationism and whatnot like we have been doing here. People want to know what he
       <em>
        means
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And so this rhetoric battle goes back and fourth. And if that's how the media has to portray it then so be it. People should have more understanding of this shit. But they don't. Hence- political rhetoric.

       People are being told what he means by the media. And that is a problem. Because as I have said ad nauseum, the media is creating hysteria.

       Not everything the media says is false just because it came from the media. Pence being anything but fully supportive of Evolution is a massive step backwards in education. This is the man who's 2nd to one of the most powerful and influential people on the planet. The president and Vice President of the United States should not support a rival theory of evolution that isn't grounded in any verifiable fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       It IS a big deal. It seems like your problem with this is that you don't realize how important that is.  You want people to be more educated, to the extent they can realize this "hysteria" as what it is. But you mock claims against something that will directly and possibly dramatically influence how educated people are. Where do you stand here? Are you arguing just to argue or what. I don't see the point in this.

       No it isn't, because Pence doesn't decide the nation's education. Even the President himself would have a hard time reconfiguring the education system and not getting tremendous blowback.

       It doesn't matter about legislation at this level. Damage is done even by him announcing any lack of support for evolution, implicit or not. People like the VP have influence. For crying out loud Donald Trump of all people won over the votes of nearly half the voters because of things he thought were right. And he had NO power over legislation. Plenty of the things he has said has been proven factually false. Yet people LIKE the idea of it. So they stick with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's exactly what would happen with more widespread support of an intelligent design or creationist theory. And that's anti-progress. You underestimate the power of faith in the western world

       Thanks,  good post, and Pence disgusts me.    But lets be honest here.    Otherwise,  we have no credibility,  and don't value the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until someone catches Pence talking out of both sides of his mouth,  we have to go on what we have.

       Or,  religions and faith,  belief,  can be whatever you make up and pretend.   He could flip flop 10 times a day,  and wouldn't be the only believer that did that.    After all,  the Bible also says not to kill,  and Pence is a war monger genociding promoter of war and death.

       I enjoy debating with religious folks, especially Creationists, and Pence is using a very common tactic that shows his ignorance:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Evolution is just a theory" that he thinks stands on as much or less ground than his religious beliefs. He doesn't understand what a theory is in the scientific community. It's a testable, falsifiable claim that is rigorously tested and stands up to any and all scrutiny presented to it. The Bible falls apart quickly under scrutiny. Creationism is not a theory. A hypothesis, sure, but not a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how he's denying evolution. By saying that religion (See: Pence's religion) should be taught as a theory along with evolution, he's denying the likelihood that evolution is true, and promoting religion as truth.

      <p>
       Saying that an entity of intelligent design created the universe does not deny evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people believe in both. Even many atheist believe that there is
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       larger they just choose not to call it "God". So what if Pence believes in God, the entire concept of "God" is literally different for every single person.
      </p>
      <p>
       And most importantly, none of this gives the media the right to call him a die-hard creationist and then attempt to trigger people into drawing the conclusion that Pence is going to change the entire school system into a bible-study. Its alarmist. And frankly, its propaganda designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Labelling someone a
       <em>
        creationist
       </em>
       means that they believe God created the world and that evolution does not exist. It has to be both and it is not. He has never said evolution didn't exist and it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       called the theory of evolution so of course a non-scientist isn't going to know the "scientific interpretation" of the word "theory". Theories evolve. For all we know people who say that a higher form exists could be right and it also wouldn't have to disprove evolution if they were.

       Because that is a main ingredient in defining someone as a creationist.  Otherwise you are just making assumptions and then broadcasting your assumption as a fact, and that is dishonest and wrong.

       No.. just learn on your own.. this is ridiculous.  You want to see him say "I am Mike Pence and I am a creationist!"  Cause you'll never see that.  He's a politician.  He will never flat out say that.  He will just push the idea that god created the world and when asked about evolution he'll dodge the question.  That's a creationist.  Ask anyone who isn't a creationist if they believe in evolution.  There is no dodging.  The answer is YES.  Period.  If you can't say that you are a creationist.  If there is any doubt in your mind that it's 50/50... could be evolution.. could be god did it by just poofing everything into existence... you are a creationist.

       How the fuck should I know?  I haven't read everything ever written by or about him.  I have seen him talk about God creating the world.. he believes the Bible and he won't say evolution is real.  That's enough for me.  What does it even matter anyways?  His policies have always been garbage.  I don't care if he believes in the tooth fairy if he is a smart guy with good policy ideas outside of that.

       It shouldn't be enough, it just means that he entertains a higher design, what some people call "God" means something different to each person so you can't exactly say that believing in a higher power makes someone an asshole.
      </p>

       And it matters a lot actually, this is how you stay informed and weigh how strong the facts are. An infobyte repeated to you hundreds of times on reddit and by peers and in media, yeah, you should care about how strong that claim is.

       Then email the guy and ask him yourself.  I bet he dodges the question.  If you can't use common sense and personal experience to infer what that means then that's on you.  I don't see him or his staff coming out to fight any of the "infobytes" calling him a creationist though.

       I do worry that pence is a left plant. And the reason nobody suspected pence for vice has a deeper sinister meaning. I agree this needs to be looked into.

       Reading through your comments about the article and video posted many times, I have to ask: what's your point? This is in no way a conspiracy and offers very little for meaningful discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of your interpretation on his stance, how much does it really matter. You said yourself that many people believe in both. I don't really understand the point you are trying to make aside from debating semantics. As
       <a href="/u/scytone">
        /u/scytone
       </a>
       stated, Pence is a politician and it is in his best interest to be as open to as many people as possible. For him to unequivocally state he does not believe in evolution is to lose political support from a certain demographic. The point is moot my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you weren't already aware, the theory of evolution offers no explanation regarding the origins of life unlike ID or creationism. It only addresses the way life changes with time.

       You posted shit, made up bs easily debunked claims about creationism, and are still claiming a guy who says god created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that’s in them, yet never says he supports evolution, even when specifically, and your conclusion is that he believes in evolution?
