       I first became interested in these since he had one email that had Antarctica pictures attached.  All of his emails are missing the sender/receiver addresses.  A few days ago, I saw the posts in this sub related to steganography.

       Those posts related to the picture file attachments.  t struck me yesterday that more data/pictures could be hidden in other files like PowerPoint.  Here’s one of those emails from above.

       There is a PPT attachment.  I ran an older steganography detection tool (StegSpy) on it.  Results came back “Steganography found at marker position 481237 Hiderman program detected!”
      </p>
      <p>
       Through elimination, I determined that there is one specific slide (Slide 2) that is causing the hit.  “Steganography found at marker position 88493 Hiderman program detected!”
I downloaded Hiderman but it doesn’t show there being embedded information.  I believe my issue may be that StegSpy is an older program.  I could be using the wrong version of Hiderman.  It could be a false hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody have this program?

       i thought i was the only person on earth considering that weiner/democrats used steganography to leak secrets to americas enemies, very encouraging sign that someone else is looking at the possibility that steganography was in use, and soon it should go mainstream, that is how the criminals in our government were running their entire operation and the fact that the fbi might know that also is why kerry and hillary have left the country/disappeared.  The foreign controlled criminal establishment just wanted to see what they could get away with and for how long, they didnt care if they went to jail.

       No it's not only you. Admittedly I made something of a joke about it a few weeks ago but it really does need checking out and preferably by someone with some experience. There's just been so much these last few weeks honestly it's been nearly impossible to do everything and I think this bit needs the attention.

       steganography is difficult because the messages within can be encrypted, also if the hidden message is a picture of a moon that could be a pre agreeed upon sign for "meet at the location x" so even cracking into the encrypted hidden message doesnt guarantee understanding what they were doing.

       true, but think all the emails are so generic, maybe the encrypted messages are like "pulse nightclub 6/12/16 coordinate false flag w/ msnbc". maybe they didnt have time or intelligence to encrypt the messages or be savy about it.

       OP here.  So I reviewed the options in the Hiderman program.  There's an option to hide the fact that Hiderman has been used.  So you need to enable option "Force to unhide from any files."
      </p>
      <p>
       So even though Hiderman gives "The file doesn't hide any files". it's meaningless.  Perhaps StegSpy picks it up since its made to sniff this out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm stuck without a password.  The Hiderman trial version only allows you to use "trial" as password.  Of course I found a user/pass for the Hiderman program.
      </p>
      <p>
       StegSpy is showing other attachments from the Podesta emails as having been manipulated with Hiderman.  Only a few hits so far.

       The serial is easily found on the net.  I don't think I should post it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I ran the original PPT file and the separate PPT file I saved with just the #2 slide in it.  StegSpy hits at the same data in a hexadecimal editor.  The dec is different due to the second file having only the single slide in it.

       I haven't been able to make sense of the data.  I'll be offline until tonight.

uMany tools can be used for viewing and comparing the contents of a hidden file.

       uWe then view the end of the file, comparing the virgin file to the carrier file

       So you save an image file from the PowerPoint file as like a JPEG image, and then rename the JPEG image to have a PowerPoint file extension, am I understanding you correctly?

       I have a powerpoint file, presention.ppt. I open presentation.ppt and extract the image from slide two, calling it supercar.jpg, and save that image to my Desktop. Then I rename the image file supercar.jpg to supercar.ppt and run it through the steg detector.

       I think they mean they only get a hit when the ppt slide with the image is run. From what I can tell they didn't run the image by itself, plus changing the ex to ppt wouldn't do much.

       Unless "slide 2" contains an image that has encoded data, it seems very unlikely that there is hidden data there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stegonography works by making slight changes to each pixel's bits in an image. It seems unlikely someone would make a tool for such a specific file format, especially one that is not mutable like an image.
