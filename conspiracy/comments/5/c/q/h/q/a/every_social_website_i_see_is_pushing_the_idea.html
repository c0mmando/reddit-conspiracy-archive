        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The narrative being pushed on social sites (facebook, reddit, tumblr, instagram), is that Clinton truly won the election but the corrupt system stole it from her and gave it to Trump. But never fear! We the people can rally and riot and convince the electoral college to reverse some of their votes! It&#39;ll be democracy in action! The people TRULY speaking!</p>

<p>I&#39;m nervous that this was either the plan all along or a backup plan. Fake riots (&quot;see what the people truly want?) and fake stories about &quot;Trump&#39;s America&quot; will get everything ready for the race to be handed to Hillary after all. Even Trump&#39;s own &quot;the electoral college is broken and it&#39;s the popular vote that should rule&quot; may be a part of setting the stage.  I&#39;d look out for major gaffs from Trump over the next month, and suspicious of vague, emotional news stories about things &#39;Trump supporters&#39; are doing.</p>

<p>What better way to make the worst candidate ever look like the truest, purest, choice of the people than to change the &#39;corrupt&#39; system just for her? Democracy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Relax.  It&#39;s just a fantasy on the side that won the popular vote but will lose the presidency because of an arcane set of rules. </p>

<p>Ironically, in early 2001 Hillary vowed to reform the electoral college after the Bush-Gore fiasco.  Too bad for her she didn&#39;t keep her word. </p>

<p>The real conspiracy are all the lobbyists and bankers Trump is eying for key posts.  It will be business as usual in Washington. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>relax, its not gonna happen. sure, the electoral college COULD vote differently, but they most definitely wont due to the severe consequences of doing so.</p>

<p>for example,
I have a gun. I COULD go out and kill someone or go on  a rampage, but I most definitely will not because of the dire consequences as well as morality.</p>

<p>its even illegal in some states for the electoral college to vote differently.</p>

<p>Its not going to happen.</p>

I don&#39;t think they can steal it that way though; there&#39;s no way to hide the corruption after there&#39;s been an obvious landslide, and the landslide isn&#39;t going to change its mind based on some riots. I see it as an experiment to see just how powerful their social media network has become, not necessarily expecting a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo the election was stolen when Burney S. Was put of the race. After all trump vs hillary....seriously? Not even mentioning that the media &quot;gave a freeride&quot; to hillary and trump and shut down all other candidates like burney. So the system is rigged, so might as well let trump fuck it all up rather than hillary continue to run the country into the ground, whilst pretending everything is fine. </p>
