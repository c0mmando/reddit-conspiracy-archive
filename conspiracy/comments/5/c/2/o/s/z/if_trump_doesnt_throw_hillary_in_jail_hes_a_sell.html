<p>I agree with everything you said. I still hate Hillary though and I also believe what you said is an oversimplification. The &quot;elite&quot; aren&#39;t always one unified group and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re as perfect as we seem to lean toward in conspiracy circles. </p>

<p>They&#39;re human. They have limited power and resources. They have heartbeats and lungs. They die like the rest of us. They feel emotion (some of them).  It&#39;s a bit dismissive and unrealistic to suggest they have complete control over every aspect of everything. They surely vie with one another.</p>

<p>If nothing truly matters then there&#39;s no reason for us to be upset anyway. Just make money and enjoy life and don&#39;t worry cuz the elite and the deep state control literally everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is unqualified because he has no prior experience or training in any form of politics. Regardless of personal feelings, to be qualified for anything, you need experience in that field. You can&#39;t become a doctor just because you tell everyone you&#39;re the best at being a doctor.</p>

<p>He is an idiot for many reasons. Climate change denying is just one of those reasons. This one is a much more personal opinion, and I find both Trump and Hillary to be idiots. </p>

<p>Since you don&#39;t want it me to say he&#39;s an idiot for one stance, here&#39;s another:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/immigration/">Begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border, on day one. Mexico will pay for the wall.</a></p>

<p>As much as I hate her and want her to be put in prison, I begrudgingly admit that Hillary does have actual political experience. Which is why I&#39;m happier with Trump, since Hillary would have been able to weasel her way through even more shit. Even though I&#39;m happier with Trump, I&#39;m not super happy overall. </p>

<p>And thus, I said it was a lose-lose election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s what the media would have you believe. They never get anything wrong though. You can tell who the corporatist media really feared based on who they covered and who they tried not to cover. Trump basically owned the media throughout much of the race. Yes, he was painted as the bad guy, but he wouldn&#39;t have gotten any coverage if he had been saying things that actually threatened them. Hillary got the rest of the coverage, painted as the hero, because she&#39;s a corrupt corporate shill. Bernie Sanders however, was played down and marginalized by the media from <strong>day one</strong>. They were threatened by his populist economic plan to help the middle and lower class by having the uber rich to pay their fair share. They fear national healthcare. They fear tuition free education. They fear having to pay taxes. That&#39;s why they rigged the democratic primary against him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus. Thank you. Socialism is the initiation of force - same for communism, fascism, et al. These very constructs are the direct result from the perversion of law and government. They genuflect at the altar of &quot;Authority.&quot; Initially, I believed this sub was truly behind the ideals of freedom... but... no one understands. Like, no one. You cannot support Bernie and simultaneously believe in freedom. Socialism is legal plunder. It is the acquisition of another man&#39;s property BY FORCE, under the threat of violence or imprisonment. <em>You people who believe in enacting force against a sovereign individual (who, also, has committed no acts of violence or theft)</em> <strong>are</strong> the problem. The ONLY reason this Globalist fucking Cabal has power is because you fucking idiots sanctioned authority over and over and over and fucking over again. JESUS. You don&#39;t get it.

<p>However, to respond briefly to your stupid fucking comments:</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a <em>single</em> fucking country on this planet right now that truly respects the rights and privacy of the individual. In fact, there never was ... UNTIL ... <em>drumroll</em> ... the USA. The USA was founded, <em>strictly</em>, on libertarian principles, AND GUESS WHAT!?!? It resulted in the most economically powerful, militarily powerful, highest-standard-of-living country on the fucking planet (until, you stupid fucks began electing your authoritarian, law-perverting, gun-pointing zealots into office.) USA had its flaws, yes, and we&#39;re paying dearly for them today... but the ONLY country on Earth that was EVER founded on libertarian principles grew into the greatest superpower on earth. Tell me why that is...</p>

<p>And don&#39;t fucking tell me what I do and do not acknowledge. I know the fucking &quot;function&quot; of taxes, but GUESS WHAT - <em>FORCE</em> isn&#39;t the ONLY way to form a society, fucktard.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;ve responded to your lame fucking comments. You haven&#39;t respond to a single one of my refutations to socialism and authority. You do not believe in freedom. I do. Therein lies our impasse. You believe in threatening violence. I fucking don&#39;t. Therein lies our fucking impasse, you fucking retard.</p>

<p>THE RULE OF GOVERNMENT AND THE THREAT OF FORCE HAS HAD ITS SAY FOR FUCKING MILLENNIA... and look at the fucking mess we&#39;re in now, because YOU gave YOUR power away. Fuck you and your gun-pointing, authority-craving, fucking retard dumb stupid fucking pussy ass. </p>

<p>Proud of that, buddy?</p>

<p>I pointed out to you the virtues of libertarianism already. You have no argument. You believe in initiating violence, and you KNOW that&#39;s wrong, but you stand by it anyways, because you&#39;re a pussy who wants what he hasn&#39;t earned.

<p>I like it here. It&#39;s the only country on Earth with a libertarian constitution. I don&#39;t like <em>you</em>, or people like you, who believe in threatening violence. So, just say it... say it for me please... just say the words, &quot;I believe in threatening violence,&quot; and then... BAM, we have nothing more to discuss. But you won&#39;t say it, because you&#39;re a pussy.</p>

<p>Telling me to go kill myself - or to get someone else to help me kill myself - is... lame. <em>I should have you reported.</em> Just kidding. I don&#39;t get offended.</p>

<p>And yes, there would be plenty of jobs in a libertarian dreamland (another edit: why the fuck do you think the Mexicans are coming here? Because their country is so libertarian, they just had to get out!?!? GOD, YOU HAVE NO ARGUMENT.) But I don&#39;t look for someone else, or demand that someone else give me a job (or give me college, or give me healthcare, or pay me I wage I couldn&#39;t negotiate for myself.) I create my own opportunities.</p>

<p>(Just say it, dude... Just say it.)</p>

<p>Edit: Actually, I&#39;d probably like you. Liberals are pretty cool if I ignore their political ideology. I&#39;m sure we&#39;d get along.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t we all. Did you know there are 30k Jews in Iran? Israel offered large sums of money to them if they agreed to move to Israel. They refused. This shows that even from amongst the Jews they know Israel is an occult creation. Look at the flag. It is an occult symbol. There is no evidence that the star on the Israeli flag is actually the star of David. It&#39;s straight up satanic.</p>

<p>Trump is from the same bloodline as Hillary .. A royal bloodline. 19th cousins that share a great grandfather.</p>

<p>No doubt after all the wikileaks, this bloodline has been practicing ritual sacrifice and in many cases cannibalism for millennia. </p>

<p>See: <a href="/r/operation_Berenstain">/r/operation_Berenstain</a></p>

<p>For more details on Spirit Cooking and child sacrifice and rape uncovered in recent emails.</p>

<p>Trump is implicated too due to his connections with Jefferey Epstein, convicted child molestor.</p>

<p>Let us not forget about the dentist chair and torture tools found on the island. Its not just about rape, its about torture and satanic sacrifice too.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Chaffetz said he was going to charge her with that but he didn&#39;t because, unlike you, he knows what the word means.</p>

<p>She was cleared of that.  The FBI tried to find any evidence of that and found none.</p>

<p>Deleting a copy of a document is not a crime.  It happens a thousand times a day in every government office.</p>

<p>Huh?  She had the highest clearance in government.  What was she not authorized to possess?</p>

<p>Dude, read all of your replies.  You have no proof of anything, except &quot;I want every red cent I earn, because I deserve everything.&quot;  Try providing examples of libertarian countries that are doing so amazingly well right now, if your views are truly superior.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t acknowledge that you use roads built by taxes, and enjoy peace and a higher standard of living because of our military.  You pay taxes to make your country better, dumbass, not just to prop up lazy people.</p>

<p>I feel bad that you&#39;re so closed off from society, people must hate you.  If you really hate everyone on the planet, Colorado just legalized assisted suicide.</p>
