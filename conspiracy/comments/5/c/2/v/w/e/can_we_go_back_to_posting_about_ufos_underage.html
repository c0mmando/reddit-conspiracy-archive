       I keep seeing these damn posts by people saying "Can we go back to UFOs and Lizards and stuff"?  These are the same people who complained about politics all this time, ignoring the fact that the political battle we just won
       <strong>
        <em>
         was a huge conspiracy
        </em>
       </strong>
       .  We just started (maybe) the beginning of overturning an ongoing military intelligence coup d'etat of neofascist fifth column on both sides of the fence, who've been above the law and out of bounds and controlling our minds through a corrupt media that lies to us so profoundly it's unreasonable to think we're NOT going to talk about it for a long time.  All of this ends now, maybe, if Trump wasn't with them all along, which doesn't seem to be the case. At the least, he's not a criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still possible--albeit maybe remotely--that steve piecznick person and others were telling the truth and we're going to put some of these bastards in jail.  I for one, hope so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no, let's NOT stop talking about politics.  Or at least not stop talking about Hillary and Podesta and Pizza.  Let's take down this network as hard as we can.  And bring these fifth columners to justice finally.  I mean it's only been 15 yrs now.  Keep diggging for connection through the podesta emails, post them here, keep adding more to the bonfire.

       I'd prefer that the sub return to its roots a bit, though I'm not big on the lizard people posts :P However if people that are interested in talking about political conspiracies are doing so with evidences and sources and
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       information, to me that is of high practical value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Endless speculation that Trump is a plant, or now that Hillary has lost the people have won, etc. etc. etc. I find futile without data to back it up. This sub is at its best when people have been digging for things of substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope to see this place focus more about conspiracies (political or otherwise) and focus less on political opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also hope to see more of your well researched posts in the near future, my friend. I appreciate your efforts.

       Here here.  More evidence less speculative arguments. Thank you for saying this.  I think the pizza research people are doing is great...and I can't even keep up with it.  This is a good thing if it can be verified.  I'm still making my way thru non-pizza-related podesta mails with a focus more on

       because I want a pretty map that shows me who I can instantly discredit in the future.  I'm making a point to go after Rachel Madow though.  Not because she's gay, I don't care about that.  But because she attacks conspiracy theorists like it's her job.  Oh guess what?  It WAS

       There's still too much information to process and everything under the umbrella still needs a resolution before we can say case closed. If we let up now we lose. People still need to come to justice and our jobs as truthers is needed now more than ever. Continue to threaten the status quo and be prepared for the distractions. r/politics is now a ghost town,  CTR, although now has evolved into some other title, has made its way in here, r/DNCleaks and other subs that challenge them. This sub has gained credibility and now we will see more disruptions and view control.

       Agreed in general.  On Trump though, I think he is already being put in his place.  Pence idolizes Cheney as his model for VP, ffs.   But we'll see what happens.  I really, really hope the Clinton Foundation investigation bears at least some fruit...
