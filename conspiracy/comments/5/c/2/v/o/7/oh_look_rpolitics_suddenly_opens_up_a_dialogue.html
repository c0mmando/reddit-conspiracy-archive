<p>The U.S. Department of Defense&#39;s definition, which is &quot;the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological objectives&quot;.[6] </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really we need to transition to a new platform before the next election. Something built from the ground up to be resistant to shilling, and to facilitate cooperation. </p>

<p>The best strategy I know of to harden against shills is to make the forum pay to play. Not much, you want an extremely low barrier of entry, a few dollars per account. You want to make it prohibitively expensive to sockpuppet and game voting and comments. Use registration fees to pay for hosting so there is never a financial side to be beholden to, accept payment in bitcoin because some things needs to be said anonymously. Culture of extreme transparency in moderation. More speculative, but I think deep learning is advancing to the state where a neural net trained to sniff out shills is feasible, make it easier to take their bitcoins and use them to fund actual free discourse.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pay to play is the cornerstone of the defense against shills, the only way to prevent them from drowning everyone out and blaring their own narrative is to make it cost prohibitive. SA forums were very successful back in the day, and an account costs $10. In the age of shills, $1-2 is cheap for a lifetime subscription to a forum designed to be as transparent and structurally resistant to shilling and manipulation as possible. </p>

<p>If it were really hurting for members, you could have something like an existing member could sponsor in a known real person at a reduced rate. But honestly I think we&#39;re in If You Build it They Will Come territory here. A window in which CTR and reddit complicity is fresh in the mind.   </p>

<p>SJW/PC President,</p>

<p>which is what we have had here for the last eight, apart from a few very visible adjustments, most &#39;SJW&#39; complaints which could be the modern versions of Labor and social fighters, ie race and inequality and poverty, human and civil rights,  have been totally fcuking ignored.</p>

<p>we still have people in tent cities, still have whole cities and towns and burbs where people despair and leave if they can. jobs are being destroyed by NAFTA and TPP.</p>

<p>SJW/PC is just leverage and psychological levers to make a few idiots feel like they are achieving something, the reality is they are not.</p>

<p>BLM, Bundys, pipeline protesters try to achieve something, they get roasted and pissed on by the MSM and the payrolled politicians, some of which are known to be pedos and/or protectors or blackmailers (London and Washington).</p>

<p>drain the swamp, human and civil rights for everybody, worldwide.</p>

<p>Actually it came close to working. If there weren&#39;t any wikileaks and the corporate whore has a cleaner look and kept her baggage hidden, they would have won it. Or if Bernie was the leading DNC candidate and he had CTR he most likely would have won it with all the Socialist illusions he was spewing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but exactly what you listed, there wouldn&#39;t of been a need to use CTR. If a candidate is so bad it takes 6million dollars and an army of paid astroturfers to spread false narratives they&#39;re probably not fit to run in the first place. Hillary also had the media in her pocket  (including fox news), every establishment politician on both sides of the isle supporting her, a boat load of money from every which way, and the whole &quot;first women president&quot;, but she still lost. </p>

<p>I also had a creepy interaction with the mod where he 1st gave me a permanent ban and said that he will reduce it if I message him saying &quot;I read and agreed to their rules&quot;. I thought it was weird at 1st, but messaged him nonetheless.</p>

<p>Then, after I figured out that the reason they banned me was factually false, and started messaging them to review it, they 1st warned me that they&#39;ll send be back to &quot;read the rules&quot; and then made the ban permanent again.</p>

<p>Russia is freaking crazy. They&#39;re considered an oligarchy for a reason, because all politicians created this huge fire sale of all publicly-owned resources, transferred it to themselves and their buddies, and then profited enormously. </p>

<p>Bill Browder wrote a book about what happened out there, only his was from the petulant child&#39;s perspective that Russia tried to stop him as a foreign investor taking part of the fire sale. </p>

<p>Astroturfing is some shady fucked up shit and so many people just outright deny that it happens. If not for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> being a sort of central hub for these kinds of discussions, so many more people would have fallen for their tricks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good idea, many people are still completely unaware of CTR and Astroturfing in general, getting a large discussion started on the matter definitely be of use to a lot of people, especially since Brexit and Trump have shown the unreliability of using MSM to control the narrative.</p>

<p>The liberal elite have built their rhetoric up slowly over the years, using social media and the MSM to socially ostracise anyone who dared to say or do anything that could be perceived as targeting a minority group whether or not there was any basis or intent behind the accusation and that rhetoric has definitely peaked around the Brexit and Trump situations but Astroturfing is something else entirely.</p>

<p>People need to know because next time they will come with more money, more people and better tactics and as someone who is dubious about peoples intent at the best of times, that scares the crap out of me. </p>

<p>Considering how many people make fun of conspiracy theorists its funny to think that over the last few weeks so many people have had to come here to make sure that they WERN&#39;T the crazy ones. If r/conspiracy had been infiltrated i wouldnt have had a clue where to go.</p>

<p>No kidding.</p>

<p>For about two months, my Reddit engagement was solely limited to the_donald, conspiracy, and DNCleaks. It was like a bunker and I began to question my sanity. I wondered if the rest of the world believed the pushed narrative and <em>I</em> was the crazy one, or if the narrative was being manufactured and I was the sane one. This election proved the latter was true, thank god... and as a result, we all should be eternally vigilant to let the actual truth prevail. Whatever that truth may be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how to do it, but we need a space of online assembly protected by our 1st amendment rights. Censorship has been justified under the guise that it&#39;s a corporate-owned, privatized space. </p>

<p>But absent a place considered &quot;public property&quot; in the cybersphere, I&#39;m not sure how to ensure these rights are protected.</p>

<p>I guess the only consolation is that such assembly spaces are so easily created and at low costs that we can keep migrating, but that&#39;s a huge pain in the ass. </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna hope this person doesn&#39;t have kids.</p>

<p>It reminds me of a poster on here who said, &quot;I&#39;d rather elect a competent person who stole the election than a buffoon.&quot; That person is more comfortable having a dictator who they think they like, than a president they don&#39;t who they can kick out of office in 4 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I think is amazing is that this election was the most aggressive propaganda war ever conducted by the media, I mean no attempt at even token objectivity. There was no other option available to the public. Hillary is ubiquitous, Hillary is anointed, there is no other outcome possible.</p>

<p>...and it failed, it wasn&#39;t nearly enough to thwart the anger the working class have at the political classes.</p>

<p>In 1984 Orwell describes the immense potential power of the proles, the working class if they just banded together and heaved.</p>

<p>The working class in America just heaved.</p>

<p>Now in the aftermath don&#39;t just forget about those outlets and platforms that bet their souls, their last meager shreds of credibility on the wrong horse... don&#39;t ever forget a single one of them as they squirm and weasel their way back into business as usual.</p>

<p>Edit; Since making this post I notice some outlets including the New York Times have actually apologized for their biased reporting. Considering the Times was pretty much acting as the Ministry of Truth for Clinton I find this bemusing until I realize of course they are trying to reset to #bsnzasusual for the next 4 years (back to giving the required flak, re: Chomsky) and when the next election rolls around they will choose their candidate and proceed to propagandize with all the same shameless, utterly one sided zeal they had this time around.</p>

<p>So excuse my language but fuck them and fuck their apologies. Why would I bother returning to them now? The sources I turned to during the election are still there so I&#39;ll keep using them cheers and you can bet I am just one of MANY.</p>

<p>Stick a fork in CNN, Sky News, the BBC, the NYT and all the rest because they are done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump and Bernie supporters have had common ground for a long time.  Specifically, the HillaryforPrison subreddit, being created as a clear extension of The_Donald, had to debate allowing the influx of anti-Hillary Bernie supporters who were showing up to shitpost against Hillary.  They decided that anybody who was into the basic Hillary for Prison premise was welcome, and became something of a unifying point for the more angry Bernie supporters, and the Trump supporters who were unhappy with how dominant Hillary was during most of the election.</p>

<p>I may go back to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> because I&#39;m not sure what alternative exists. I liked <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> but I&#39;m not sure how many of those supporters are willing to have an open mind when others point out Trump&#39;s serious flaws.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sort of hoping all of the conservative Hillary haters can open their eyes and realize all politicians are the same and suck equally. This sub is thankfully good for that--it&#39;s something most of us know. Only problem is that we here are more inclined to be apathetic and not do anything about it knowing it&#39;s a broken system. This election has actually renewed my sense of faith that the peoples&#39; voice can be heard. This belief, however, is usually decried as naivety in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate that the term &quot;progressive&quot; is now going to be in reference to this. It&#39;s unfortunate because it&#39;s co-opting a valid movement. As I call it, there&#39;s &quot;Progressives, Inc&quot; (Soros/Podesta) and &quot;Progressives&quot; (Sanders). The latter exists, but unfortunately it&#39;ll now be equated with the former corrupted version. I want to identify as a progressive but I completely understand how people will want to reject that label owing to what happened.</p>

The weak point of reddit is that it&#39;s a centralized organization. If a candidate wants to manipulate it they go to the few people in charge and either threaten them or bribe them to let them make changes. We should push for decentralization and transparency in reddit.</p>

<p>Once the election boiled down to Hillary V. Trump, many people (and I am one of them) still hated Hillary, but saw her as at least more stable than Trump.  So while the leaks were still interesting as exposés, people in this group didn&#39;t want these revelations to get Trump elected, because HRC was still viewed as a safer pick.</p>

<p>Now that the election is over, we don&#39;t want to be faced with this kind of decision again, so by all means let&#39;s go back to Reddit as usual and point out he flaws of the establishment so we have better choices in 4 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really we need to transition to a new platform before the next election. Something built from the ground up to be resistant to shilling, and to facilitate cooperation. </p>

<p>The best strategy I know of to harden against shills is to make the forum pay to play. Not much, you want an extremely low barrier of entry, a few dollars per account. You want to make it prohibitively expensive to sockpuppet and game voting and comments. Use registration fees to pay for hosting so there is never a financial side to be beholden to, accept payment in bitcoin because some things needs to be said anonymously. Culture of extreme transparency in moderation. More speculative, but I think deep learning is advancing to the state where a neural net trained to sniff out shills is feasible, make it easier to take their bitcoins and use them to fund actual free discourse.   </p>

<p>Two good things that came out of this election, hand-picking the nominee and correct the record both had negative consequences, so maybe they won&#39;t be repeated forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No more so than repeating some written script at the call center 10 hrs a day for fractions od a penny in comparison.  Or C&amp;P work for CSA emails. Or back in the day data entry all day 120 wpm copying papers into the computer.  That last one was probably the worst except if they let me listen to music and not having to talk to angry people all day.</p>

<p>And with my CTR buds up voting each other its easier.  Push some buttons on people and cash cow as we debate each other and I c&amp;p my rebuttals changing a few words. Could even make the bot and set up to proof read quickly and change a few words</p>
