       Over the past year, some of the largest and most popular "political/current events" sub-reddits were seemingly taken over by well funded political interests, but not
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Places such as
       <a href="/r/SandersForPresident">
        /r/SandersForPresident
       </a>
       , where people had been free to discuss peaceful revolution, were unceremoniously shut down.
       <a href="/r/Politics">
        /r/Politics
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       were seemingly overrun as old mods stepped aside and were replaced en masse, ushering in what amounted to era of censorship. Even
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       was seemingly brought to its knees, when it had been dedicated to nothing but relaying truthful information leaked about the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       These giants of reddit, fell in a most spectacular fashion while
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       not only walked the path of truth but it was rewarded for it.
       <strong>
        Our subscriber list now approaches 400,000 people
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This it is in large part because the mods stood by our community and listened to our concerns. It didn't matter how one was politically aligned, this subreddit remained an open arena for debate, conjecture and fact finding. Our mods provided a haven where truth seekers could present nearly any idea for discussion without fear of getting censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for giving us a sanctuary for free thinkers!

       Hijacking top comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So from a mod's PoV I was convinced that the community felt like the mods were being biased.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a thing that happens frequently where a post/comment violates our rule on civility and thus we remove it.  Upon removal, if the post/comment happens to also be about a specific issue or topic, as well as breaking a rule, the author frequently assumes that the issue or topic was the reason their post/comment was removed... Regardless of the fact they also told someone that they hope their children all die in a fire (just a made up example).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is little chance of ever convincing the author that we moderate solely upon behavior or format (such as no memes) without consideration of the subject/issue/topic they are entwined with.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you who fall into the above category, now this this election is over with I hope that you will reevaluate your frustration with the mods if you've had any and understand that if every one of the 400,000 subscribers here behaved as poorly as possible (as we would allow without mod action under our current rules)
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       would be a miserable place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason that conspiracy is the insightful, intelligent and entertaining community that it is, is solely because 99% of you guys are conducting yourselves WELL ABOVE our established standards.  This place is nothing without you guys.  So thank all of yourselves above all else, even the minority of you who have had frustraitions with the mods.  Emotions fly sometimes (especially with election traffic happening) and we understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep on keeping on.

       Hijacking this comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wanted to thank you guys as well and give you all the respect I can for how well this sub was handled and moderated. I believe this sub was
       <em>
        vital
       </em>
       to the outcome of the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       CTR discovered real fast that they weren't going to come in here and run shit. Anytime a thread was posted by those shills, it was gone. Anytime one of them commented, it was downvoted to the 7th circle of hell. Yet, through all of that, 95% of us remained civil, and focused on the goal of spreading information and then either confirming or debunking that info.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a chef, and we are taught about word of mouth and how powerful it is. 1 person turns into 10 turns into 100, and so on. So if your meal was good or if it sucked, 100 people will know about it before you're done mopping the kitchen. That being said...
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy has 400,000 subscribers, so just sit back for a minute..all of us..and realize that while 400,000 isn't a huge number in relation to hundreds of millions, the number of people who all of us helped to wake up and inform may have very well numbered in the millions, which isn't too shabby.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pat yourselves on the back mods, and redditors of r/conspiracy. We did a thing. A pretty damn big thing. And I applaud ALL OF YOU.

       Just remember this post the next time a concern troll brigade knocks on our door and tells us that one of our mods needs replaced. The threat from these type of brigades is real. The only reason why this place functions is due to the community not falling for the bullshit.

       (hardly a reddit giant) wasn't compromised. A top mod simply disliked some aesthetic/design changes that were made and acted perhaps a bit rashly in undoing them.

       From my short time on reddit, I learned that judgemental approach on people will demise that community. 
Reddit rules are best and simple. Upvote and Downvote.

       Personally I believe we have one of the strongest moderator teams on reddit,  all of us believe in the freedom of speech and thought..

      <p>
       Our beliefs will not change, even if sometimes we disagree.

      <p>
       Posts like this are always welcome and appreciated for what can sometimes be a thankless job.

       I do not have enough time to reply to each and every comment here but I know that r/conspiracy is in great hands..

       We offer a free forum for thinking and civil discussion.  We listen to your suggestions and we do not see ourselves as power mongers or arrogant masters.

       Probably a lot, but earlier this year admins tried to clean out dead accounts site-wide. They sent us a modmail letting us know which said we would lose around 20,000 subscribers (IIRC).

       Let us not forget they did it with absolute transparency as well. Not only did they stay the course but they empower the user base with an assortment of tools to make sure there is no behind the scenes fuckery. Kudos for doing a good job while subjecting yourselves to scrutiny.

       I'll admit that I have been a subscriber only recently (passed few months) and this rapidly became one of my favorite subs.  Ironically, I came to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       in search of truth.
Now that this is nearing the end of this stage, I am looking forward to more discussion and debate that make this sub great.

       9 years of thanks to you guys. There's been ups and downs but r/conspiracy never broke. It helps when the mods are of the same mindset as the users and don't give into knee jerk reactions or the urge censor or delete simply because they personally disagree like the
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       subs...even if it's the god damn flat earthers.

       There have been some truly controversial subjects that show up that drive people nuts or incite anger, but you've kept your hands off and let the community deal with it as we see fit. But, youve done what you supposed to do when it comes to extreme stupidity or extreme nastiness. I still love this place.

       Im relatively new to reddit, in fact this election is the entire reason I joined reddit. I came to find meaningful discussion on topics that truely mattered, but I quickly knew I wouldn't find that where I thought i would : r/politics . r/conspiracy have me a home, albeit a home I don't quite completely understand (but that's not too  uncommon for new redditors) and for that I will be forever grateful.

       I'd like to say thank you to all of them as well. This past year has been a MAJOR eye opener for me. I wen't from really only getting my news sources from MSM and some TYT to finding you guys and doing research on my own. It's a much more comprehensive way of attaining knowledge on current events, and NONE of it would've been possible were it not for the moderators sticking to their guns and letting us do our thing un-adulterated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So once again, thank you to the moderators as well as the community for everything. I feel like we've had a major victory last night, and once all the celebrating is done it'll be time to get back to work. The ball is rolling, and we need to keep striking and informing others of whats REALLY going on where MSM fails to do so.

       Agree.    This election period,  the r/conspiracy sub retained a degree of restraint from heavy handedness that we should remember as a gold standard.   Yes,  this place is always a minefield,  but the users helped by doing a fairly good job of referring to the "NEW" list,  and so the front page was usually digestible as well.   There really is no better way to stay informed than on r/conspiracy,  as imperfect as it may seem.    Each of us has to take some responsibility for telling shit from shinola.

       People talk about the Left and Right being the same.  If Reddit has taught me anything, it is that that is not the case.  This is a conservative subreddit, with conservative moderators; and that means that they are more likely (not certain, but more likely) to possess genuine integrity.

       I don't think so. I came here a few years back as a frustrated leftist. Only in the past year or so has the sub become political. Mainly because of censorship throughout the mainstream subs. This has always been a good place to discuss topics in a neutral way.

       Plain and simple, this subreddit has been taken over by the_donald and unfortunately there's nothing the mods can do about it. I'm not a CTR yet I get accused as being one on a regular basis. I hope that with time it dies down a bit but still I look at the first two "hot" pages and it continues. Will we ever be objective of the new president elect? Not going to happen until
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       go back to their hole.

       It's because we don't censor based on ideology.

       We stick to the rules in the side-bar and our mod-log is public.

       We're one of the very few popular places on reddit where that kind of integrity is maintained so we're of course going to be a bastion for people who feel disaffected everywhere else (in this case Trump fans in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and most defaults). Natural social dynamics.

       The Clintons being corrupt is a valid reason for people to be pissed off, tis the season. So much so that the dead horse has it's own subreddit
       <a href="/r/HillaryForPrison">
        /r/HillaryForPrison
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not asking that it be censored I'm just concerned that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       (a subreddit that used to be much more objective) has become the antithesis of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       when they already have 3 other subreddits they heavily brigade. I just hope they lose interest now that they have their POTUS so the intellect around here evens out.

       Politics did something about it.  Here the political posts could be forced into a couple of stickied post thus leaving the rest of the sub free for conspiracy.

       actively censored content, we did not. Mega-threads are how mods diminish the impact of a particular news story they don't like.

       No. You just let the shills and bots run wild.

       But no matter. I've unsubscribed. At least for now. I don't need a sub full of posts that lack any evidence and where everyone caters to a Hitler loving Nazi. God, but I remember when I thought his misogyny was his worst trait. But the Trumpkins win. Evil wins. Unfortunately we'll all suffer for it.

       You know I believe the software in electronic voting machines has been and can be fixed. I started questioning it in 1980. Now I'm sure.  Have lots of major articles about it.  Even written essays. I believe that's why the polls and results are so different. Even Donnie Orange said it can be rigged. Surely you believe your Führer.

       I liked him during the Bush administration because he was trying to get Bush out of office. Since then I've read a lot of negative stuff about him but I don't know if these articles have any credibility. In the end wealthy people are all our enemies. There are better and worse individuals but they are all our enemies. They may be fighting each other and trying to draw us to one side or another. We need to resist that, remembering their interests and ours rarely coincide.

       I can't agree with that if you mean that "ALL wealthy people are "the enemy"".  If that is indeed your meaning, you're just picking a different reason to be prejudice.  It's different but very similar to saying "ALL black people are the enemy" or "ALL Christian people are the enemy".
