Eventually, they will realize MSNBC and CNN are propaganda, and that the polls were rigged in a weak attempt to influence the election and keep donations coming into the Clinton campaign. Eventually they will, for the first time, read through the Wikileaks and realize they aren&#39;t just a &quot;bunch of stupid emails,&quot; but that they reveal how god-awful and corrupt Hillary and her people really are. They will eventually realize she should be in jail. And THAT is the reason she lost. It has nothing to do with &quot;white supremacy.&quot; Hillary is white, isn&#39;t she? </p>

Do you know why the left didn&#39;t, or held their nose if they voted for her? HRC was not a liberal and the folk that are freaking out are the ones who drank the &quot;Trump will end the world&quot; propaganda that was drummed for months.

    <div class="md"><p>Yup... We will transform into Trumps best allies to his worst enemies overnight.</p>

<p>It looked like the Republican Party was behind the times with the Bernie train. But once he lost, it turned out to be the opposite, as Trump swept up the populist energy. While many liberals are in shock, we&#39;ll end up being the ones in denial to service in transparent media (through leaks) will ally with anyone in a political position - without stronk checks and balances (not in place).</p>

<p>The whole thing was a temporary alliance to stop Hillary/reveal the Clinton crime family. Now is more important than ever to be inclusive in this community. There&#39;s a lot of pissed off, confused Hillary voters right now that deserve to know the reality. Share the WikiLeaks to even the worst CTR questioning. Explain how WikiLeaks was involved in leaks with the Iraq War/Afghanistan. Explain Google&#39;s DKIM system. To question the integrity of both sides, and avoid the divisive split of emulating the &#39;other&#39; side as cavemen.</p>

<p>We need more support than ever to prevent tyranny, like what is happening in the pipelines right now. If it&#39;s not being stopped, there is not enough support. Remember how Google, and all these other techie companies were defending our privacy rights just a year ago? Where are they now?</p>

It is about removing <em>moral</em> authority from society, community, families and religion and into government so that they can control the population.

    <div class="md"><p>Like NOBODY knows this anymore, and the MSM won&#39;t cover it, but an hour of googling will confirm: the state interest in marriage is not about love between two people, it&#39;s about societal family structure based on the nuclear family--two parents plus kids. Obviously male-female parents because these laws are centuries old. The state believes that we form better societies when the vast majority are involved in these families, so the government sanctions, incentivizes, and regulates this particular societal unit.</p>

<p>But we can&#39;t even have a public or scientific discussion of whether that&#39;s true anymore, because we&#39;ve become by default individualistic. But there&#39;s no science that says that that leads to good outcomes, and nobody&#39;s even trying to do that science, because the whole topic has been entirely co-opted by political correctness.</p>

<p>So we are blind as we make new policy.</p>

<p>Now, I have to credit the SJW because there was a time a gay person could get beat up by local thugs and everyone--police, school administrators, prosecutors, judges--would just the look the other way. That was horrible. I thank them for fixing this!</p>

<p>I can&#39;t be pro- or against gay marriage until I understand what is the state&#39;s interest in regulating marriage in the first place. Why isn&#39;t is a purely private, religious practice? Because there was wide-spread belief that the nuclear family was the relational building block of a stable society. Is that true? We dont know. Can gay parents provide that? We dont know. Science could not possibly answer either of those questions without at least 1 generation to study, so we&#39;re talking 30 years minimum. Evidence is strong that intact 2-parent families produce measurably better outcomes for kids. Gay parents? Impossible to study before hand. You have to allow it. Spend a generation. Then study it. Maybe you need 2 generations.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with gay marriage, simply based on your statements I would say it doesn&#39;t matter how you feel. How about what you can demonstrate logically with well supported documents, emotions mean jack shit in the world of reality and decision making. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She had support of the liberals because the alternative was Trump or Jill Stein.  Bernie Sanders had the real hardcore liberal support.  It just wasn&#39;t enough to win the primary.  Not all Democrats are liberal.  Many are much more moderate, centrist or even conservative.  That was her real base of support.  </p>

<p>It sounds to me like you don&#39;t really talk to many liberals if you thought she had their support.  Most of us knew she was just pretending to be liberal to win the primary.  She even admitted in her private speeches that she was faking her &quot;public image&quot;.</p>

<p>And there is no one &quot;liberal&quot; in the US anyways.  That&#39;s the problem with stereotypes, they distort your view of realities.  </p>

<p>I consider myself a liberal or leftist or progressive or whatever you want to call it.  I support single-payer healthcare, gay rights and am pro-choice.  I understand those are wedge issues that will be hard to come together on as a country, but there&#39;s a lot of things we could agree on as well.

<p>I do not support the new wave liberalism which is focused on microaggressions, safe spaces and shutting out dissenting opinions/attacking the first amendment.

I&#39;m against all the same crony-capitalist corruption and deep state revolving door politics as most conservatives on this board.  </p>

Yet most people WANTED an &quot;outsider&quot; someone that isn&#39;t perceived as being &quot;in the system&quot; (even though I think once Donald is IN, there will be different things we will have NOT expected), or some flip flopping on some of the points or promises to supporters, that are honestly, legitimately, and in all quantum-realities simply just not going to happen, and the pendulum will continue to swing as it does, so it&#39;ll be intriguing to watch unfold. I think a lot of Trump supporters may feel lied to at some point, for one thing or the other; like not actually being able to actually go through with building a wall on the entire southern border and making Mexico pay for it all etc. And I think some of the independents and undecideds that we saw vote for neither candidate (though perhaps Hillary voters too even at some point, but again, these are projections) will find new ways to become more active and better involved in the democratic process and embracing new civic responsibilities that many would have never gotten involved in with such a divisive election as this.</p>

<p>So it&#39;ll definitely be interesting to see how this plays out... I voted for neither and am mostly a centrist with progress-oriented stances on social and cultural issues. And yet, <em>the only constant is change itself</em>, so even that is an ever morphing creature, I think ignorance often manifests itself in stubbornness and people who only vote for such-and-such party because of some sadly contrived reaching reason that has less to do with logic or science or even emotion and more to do with not being open to individual evolution as a human being, being closed or narrow minded rather than remaining Teachable and ever seeking new knowledge and the Wisdom therein, for Socrates states that &quot;I Know that I DO NOT Know&quot; thus creating the fertile soil for reaching higher planes of consciousness and attaining a sort of Self-Actualization that otherwise becomes excluded to those who consciously (or not) close themselves up to such potentially great possibilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, and you can all downvote me to hell but I would hardly call killing babies or promoting disorders like homosexual/transgender progress.  If Hillary would have gotten elected she would have your liberal friends promoting pedophilia, beastiality, incest as &quot;progress&quot; in a few years. I personally don&#39;t judge or have a problem with gay behavior but it&#39;s one thing to be respectful and tolerant and another to go out of your way to promote and celebrate gay behavior.  I would not be surprised if someone in this sub had evidence of elites chemically promoting homosexuality via chemicals in food and/or water.  I don&#39;t have these opinions only because I believe in God, I have these opinions because of common sense.  Murdering babies is wrong.  A man sticking his penis in another mans ass is not normal or healthy.  Science backs this up as well.  We definitely should not be promoting homosexuality in schools to young children.  </p>

Il break it down for you on 7 year old level.  When you eat food your asshole, or sphincter, fills up with waste called fecal matter, or shit.  The asshole is the exit point of the body for your waste and not meant to be used as an entry for a penis.  Now, you can pack fudge all you want and you won&#39;t hear any judgement from me cause I don&#39;t care what you do.

    <div class="md"><p>You can lump yourself in with less intelligent animal species all you want.  I myself recognize God given human superiority over the animal kingdom by the gift of the most powerful instrument on earth,The human brain.  Humans possess the ability to reason, read, write, compose music, understand mathematics, laugh, etc.. Animals are not capable of any of these things.  Scientist classification of man as an animal is in error which is why you are morally confused.  You let some guy who calls himself a scientist think for you rather than thinking for yourself.  See this goes back to you liberals so-called &quot;progress&quot;..Why would you study what you know to be a less intelligent animal species behavior to determine what is morally acceptable human behavior?  That&#39;s absurd.  I had a dog that ate her own offspring the day after giving birth.  Many animals practice cannibalism but does that make it okay for me to grill up my son tomorrow night for dinner. Common human sense tells you no it&#39;s not okay.  Animals often fight and kill each other.  Does this make murder okay?  Human intelligence puts us way ahead of the rest of the creatures in the animal kingdom so why look down to these creatures who are driven by a survival instinct and are incapable of reasoning as a model for what&#39;s moral or not?  You will be a lot better off looking up to God for instructions on how to conduct yourself.</p>

<p>Kidding aside, it was definitely an emotional disaster for a lot of folks on facebook today.

Nobody really talked about the election to me (not like I was looking to chat other than tell them to take a deep breathe and focus on what they can control at the local level), but everyone seemed to really put an extra effort to ask me and others how they were, smile, make eye contact, etc.</p>

<p>Granted, I live in the deep south, but this was beautiful to see. So whatever happens and people wake up or not, I think humanity kinda crossed an important threshold...</p>

<p>Most us in this sub know the President isn&#39;t the end-all, be-all of decision-making and authority, so whatever Trump does or not does isn&#39;t as important as what the Central Banks and cabal try to do...but something important happened last night, and I think it&#39;s the first MAJOR step to our collective freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO That ended for most of the &quot;<em>woke-folk</em>&quot; when they clearly and disgustingly weeded out Bernie and his momentum with extreme prejudice, and the fact that Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC actively and continuously shot itself in the head by thusly denying it&#39;s party it&#39;s most popular candidate. Hopefully Trump can do the job. Part of me thinks he was actually the one all along, the Powers That Be can utilize and use anyone with power, especially someone as thirsty as Trump. But man, I really hope he does some good and can prove his value outside of what has been sold to us. And yet as mentioned above, we are more powerful and difficult to control absolutely when are united as a people together, rather than the Divide and Conquer approach the mega conglomerate news media outlets shove down our throats through divisive and culturally polarizing issues that has created the political landscape we see today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Other than every President and many top administration officials since the creation of The Fed and intra-national power elite groups and such as The Pilgrims, the Bilderbergs, Trilateral Commission, Carlyle Group.  Read the Church Senate Committee findings, could apply today. The media were corrupted even before the 1947 National Security Act. Administrations share political plants , family connections, and links to these groups. It&#39;s one party and confirmation bias born of intentional propaganda is difficult to override. This election was just the start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comments like this getting downvoted in this sub shows just how &quot;in denial&quot; Trump supporters are as well. Trump&#39;s the alt-right version of Obama, promising hope and change to his supporters who are eating it up. Those who think Trump will magically dissolve the political establishment in Washington and is going to singlehandedly end the corruption are a bit naive IMO. Just watch over the next few months as he fills his cabinet and close advisors with establishment regulars and special interest shills.</p>
