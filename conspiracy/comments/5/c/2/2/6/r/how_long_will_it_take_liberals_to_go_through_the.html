       The liberal freak out we are witnessing is awesome. They are blaming racism, slavery, Jim Crow, the civil war, etc. But eventually, I'm hoping, and imagining, they will realize how corrupt she is, they will realize how fucked up it was that she rigged the primary and stole the nomination from Bernie, they'll realize they should have spoke up when she did that and demanded the nomination go to Sanders. Eventually, they will realize MSNBC and CNN are propaganda, and that the polls were rigged in a weak attempt to influence the election and keep donations coming into the Clinton campaign. Eventually they will, for the first time, read through the Wikileaks and realize they aren't just a "bunch of stupid emails," but that they reveal how god-awful and corrupt Hillary and her people really are. They will eventually realize she should be in jail. And THAT is the reason she lost. It has nothing to do with "white supremacy." Hillary is white, isn't she?

       You need to stop analyzing shit in last century's paradigm.  Do you know why the Republican elites supported HRC? Do you know why the left didn't, or held their nose if they voted for her? HRC was not a liberal and the folk that are freaking out are the ones who drank the "Trump will end the world" propaganda that was drummed for months.  It's not a left/right thing, it's a top/down thing.

       Yup... We will transform into Trumps best allies to his worst enemies overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looked like the Republican Party was behind the times with the Bernie train. But once he lost, it turned out to be the opposite, as Trump swept up the populist energy. While many liberals are in shock, we'll end up being the ones in denial to service in transparent media (through leaks) will ally with anyone in a political position - without stronk checks and balances (not in place).
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing was a temporary alliance to stop Hillary/reveal the Clinton crime family. Now is more important than ever to be inclusive in this community. There's a lot of pissed off, confused Hillary voters right now that deserve to know the reality. Share the WikiLeaks to even the worst CTR questioning. Explain how WikiLeaks was involved in leaks with the Iraq War/Afghanistan. Explain Google's DKIM system. To question the integrity of both sides, and avoid the divisive split of emulating the 'other' side as cavemen.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need more support than ever to prevent tyranny, like what is happening in the pipelines right now. If it's not being stopped, there is not enough support. Remember how Google, and all these other techie companies were defending our privacy rights just a year ago? Where are they now?

       As I have said elsewhere today, I usually "vote" with my feets in da streets and I support a "variety of tactics" in achieving social change and awareness in others.  I turned off my OTA TV some years ago and haven't looked back.  Read voraciously and talk to your friends and family about what you've read.  Progress starts from the ground.

       I really don't think Trump cares about gay marriage or abortion. The problem is that the Congress that just got elected does. Trump is actually pretty moderate, and on social issues seems very much of the "leave me out of it and I won't care" mindset. '

       I am curious to see who he picks for his cabinet. That will be telling, because he is a massive delegator.

       Hopefully we don't have a Dick Cheeney 2.0 situation.  A lot of the young new voters who got caught up in the wave of Trump memes don't remember/realize how fucked up the Bush years were.  We are still paying the price for his fascist Orwellian laws.

       I really dislike Pence. I understand that he was needed to validate him with certain groups, and that is alright. We
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be uncomfortable with some of Trump's decisions because we are not the only dish at this potluck.

       Only 3% of American citizens are gay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of those, less than 20% want to get married.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that issue literally affects 0.6% of the population.

       The "gay marriage" issue is not about gays nor marriage. It is about removing
       <em>
        moral
       </em>
       authority from society, community, families and religion and into government so that they can control the population. ("Only the government can be trusted to decide what's right...in ALL circumstances.")

       So you would rather this country be led by religious morals? Just like those Middle Eastern countries everyone hates so much? I'm not saying the government should have final say on everything but I don't want to live in a society ruled by religion either. That's been tried before and it usually works out pretty badly for the people that don't believe in the prevailing religion.

       Should there be morals at all then? Should we all be baby eating cannibals who stab each other in the back to climb to the top? Where do you draw the line as far as morality is concerned? In reality it's a simple topic, why do you feel the state needs to recognize a union between two people? Why a religion? That a community recognizes and accepts it is one thing, but why does some abstract entity that uses force to coerce people need to be involved with something that's supposed to be about love?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not even about your right to be gay, you can be whatever you want, and love or hate yourself or any gray in between, but why do you need an abstract entity to give you a pass?

       That's not what I said at all. I was just pointing out that getting married has way more benefits than just being husband and wife with the person you love. I personal don't believe in any religion or God, it's a waste of time in my eyes. So no I don't see government to be anything besides government.

       Like NOBODY knows this anymore, and the MSM won't cover it, but an hour of googling will confirm: the state interest in marriage is not about love between two people, it's about societal family structure based on the nuclear family--two parents plus kids. Obviously male-female parents because these laws are centuries old. The state believes that we form better societies when the vast majority are involved in these families, so the government sanctions, incentivizes, and regulates this particular societal unit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we can't even have a public or scientific discussion of whether that's true anymore, because we've become by default individualistic. But there's no science that says that that leads to good outcomes, and nobody's even trying to do that science, because the whole topic has been entirely co-opted by political correctness.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we are blind as we make new policy.

       Now, I have to credit the SJW because there was a time a gay person could get beat up by local thugs and everyone--police, school administrators, prosecutors, judges--would just the look the other way. That was horrible. I thank them for fixing this!

       I can't be pro- or against gay marriage until I understand what is the state's interest in regulating marriage in the first place. Why isn't is a purely private, religious practice? Because there was wide-spread belief that the nuclear family was the relational building block of a stable society. Is that true? We dont know. Can gay parents provide that? We dont know. Science could not possibly answer either of those questions without at least 1 generation to study, so we're talking 30 years minimum. Evidence is strong that intact 2-parent families produce measurably better outcomes for kids. Gay parents? Impossible to study before hand. You have to allow it. Spend a generation. Then study it. Maybe you need 2 generations.

       Disagree, emotional based thinking is the least effective. You have the right to feel whatever you want but feelings are in no way legitimately correlated with reality in fact it's the exact opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has nothing to do with gay marriage, simply based on your statements I would say it doesn't matter how you feel. How about what you can demonstrate logically with well supported documents, emotions mean jack shit in the world of reality and decision making.

       Are you asking how does quoting a study reporting the rate of marriage among gay couples in the Netherlands which has had nationally legalized gay marriage for 10 years justify my using the same number for America?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you thinking the rates are different in different countries? could be, but you can't study it here, cuz it hasnt been around long enough.

       It's also about giving rights to spouses such as tax benefits and rights to belongings (which in many cases end up going to families which hate that they're gay and don't want their gay spouse to have the inheritance).  Those are just two of a variety of legal reasons that the government should be involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the government does not force any religious organizations to hold gay weddings.  They only require government offices to give out marriage certificates.

       But what is the STATE INTEREST in that. Those could all be private relationships. Why is the government involved in the first place in old fashioned heterosexual marriage. The reason is NOT tax benefits. The state interest (presumably) is a state society (we should study this and determine if it's actually the case) and the tax benefits etc come as a consequence.

       The state interest is in building a stable society.  Stable societies are built on stable families, stable relationships and stable homes for children.  Encouraging those stable relationships through tax benefits is a way to help foster a stable society.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is more than tax benefits as I said.  Spousal rights, like right to inheritance and end of life care are very important rights that many gay couples do not have.  The state has an interest in ensuring that people have equal rights under the law.

       Hate to be un-PC but there's no scientific evidence that gay families foster stability. There can't be. There hasn't been enough time to even do the scientific study.
      </p>
      <p>
       OTOH gay relationships have higher rates of abuse. Not a good sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       This issue was pushed for an agenda, not to advance the (legitimate) state interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is evidence that intact 2-parent (heterosexual, since that's all we can study) households produce children that have lower rates of crime, drug abuse, etc.

        The data we have right now
       </a>
       suggests that children do as good in a homosexual couple's home as a heterosexual home.  Yes we do need more data and time, but right now the data suggests it's worth continuing our real world testing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's certainly possible that there is a eugenics component or governmental control component, if that's what you're implying by "agenda".  I haven't seen substantial evidence that points to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm of the mind that it is a legitimate attempt at furthering equality in society and providing more stable environments for child rearing in a society with large numbers of unadopted children.  Of which there would be more if the same people who oppose gay marriage get their way with banning abortion.

       I went to Philadelphia along with 40,000 of my closest friends to try to talk the DNC out of committing to the weaker candidate.  They don't have to represent us any more because negative ad$ still work to a large extent with enough voters to win 86% of the time. Citizens United gives us the best pols money can buy.  Folk were prevented from even the appearance of non-unity.

       Remember when they turned the lights out on the Sanders delegates at the convention so they couldn't be seen by the cameras?  There was plenty of folk clamoring for a real choice, but the elites don't voluntarily give up power or money.  It was only after the DNC leaks that it became clear that Debbie and her crew had corrupted the primary to prevent the strongest candidate from winning.  Comey is institutionally incapable of saving our democracy and the coup was complete before it was widely disclosed.

       Many liberals did protest.  They shouted all during the convention and were regularly chastised by those on stage.  There were also large protests outside the convention by liberals.  Liberals do not like Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       She only gained support because liberals were afraid of what Trump would bring.  And as you can see from the results, she didn't get enough support.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who is liberal, I wish you wouldn't use it as a label to attack your fellow Americans.  We have different ideas about how things should be done, but in the end we all just want a prosperous country.  And all of us on this board are against corruption and conspiracies by the elites of the world.  You're only helping their divide and conquer strategy with posts like this.

       These terms are fluid and ever changing.  The status quo liberalism you're referring to is neo-liberalism of the Clinton school of liberalism.  I don't subscribe to that form of liberalism.

       Very true, but I'm more talking about the fact that the DNC colluded and cheated and completely ignored the will of the democratic electorate voices and nominated Clinton instead of Bernie. If they hadn't bowed to the wishes (and money) of HRC, Bernie would have been the nominee and there's no question that he would have crushed Trump. The only thing people on both sides of the aisle can agree on is that the status quo is fucked and the establishment candidates needed to go. And since the DNC made a Bernie revolution impossible (thereby royally pissing off many Bernie or bust types), they ensured a Trump revolution.
      </p>

       So democrats who are whining now can thank the DNC.

       Liberals are blaming the DNC.  And Hillary.  I don't know why anyone on here thinks that Hillary ever had the support of liberals.  It was begrudging support at best, and it lost her the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for loss of progress on gay marriage and abortion, we very much have right to fear loss of progress.  Those are issues that can be overturned by a more conservative Supreme Court, which Trump has vowed to make it.  And he now has a Republican congress to approve his choice, they would not approve a liberal judge.

       I think that's probably mostly the more moderate liberals who support the establishment democrats.  The more awake and politically literate liberals were the Bernie supporters.  The people who were protesting at the convention.  The people who stayed home.

       She had support of the liberals because the alternative was Trump or Jill Stein.  Bernie Sanders had the real hardcore liberal support.  It just wasn't enough to win the primary.  Not all Democrats are liberal.  Many are much more moderate, centrist or even conservative.  That was her real base of support.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds to me like you don't really talk to many liberals if you thought she had their support.  Most of us knew she was just pretending to be liberal to win the primary.  She even admitted in her private speeches that she was faking her "public image".
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is no one "liberal" in the US anyways.  That's the problem with stereotypes, they distort your view of realities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider myself a liberal or leftist or progressive or whatever you want to call it.  I support single-payer healthcare, gay rights and am pro-choice.  I understand those are wedge issues that will be hard to come together on as a country, but there's a lot of things we could agree on as well.  I hate that those three issues divide us so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not support the new wave liberalism which is focused on microaggressions, safe spaces and shutting out dissenting opinions/attacking the first amendment.  I'm also pro second amendment, very wary of the surveillance state and have been a vocal opponent of wars and foreign interference from Bush to Obama.  I'm against all the same crony-capitalist corruption and deep state revolving door politics as most conservatives on this board.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to be open to my conservative countrymen and respect their beliefs, and I'm always bothered when liberalism is used as an insult and broadbrush oversimplification of half the country's beliefs.

       Right! I think there's so much UNKNOWNS at this point, because there was a predictability with Clinton that I think they were counting on being the winning-reasoning. Yet most people WANTED an "outsider" someone that isn't perceived as being "in the system" (even though I think once Donald is IN, there will be different things we will have NOT expected), or some flip flopping on some of the points or promises to supporters, that are honestly, legitimately, and in all quantum-realities simply just not going to happen, and the pendulum will continue to swing as it does, so it'll be intriguing to watch unfold. I think a lot of Trump supporters may feel lied to at some point, for one thing or the other; like not actually being able to actually go through with building a wall on the entire southern border and making Mexico pay for it all etc. And I think some of the independents and undecideds that we saw vote for neither candidate (though perhaps Hillary voters too even at some point, but again, these are projections) will find new ways to become more active and better involved in the democratic process and embracing new civic responsibilities that many would have never gotten involved in with such a divisive election as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it'll definitely be interesting to see how this plays out... I voted for neither and am mostly a centrist with progress-oriented stances on social and cultural issues. And yet,
       <em>
        the only constant is change itself
       </em>
       , so even that is an ever morphing creature, I think ignorance often manifests itself in stubbornness and people who only vote for such-and-such party because of some sadly contrived reaching reason that has less to do with logic or science or even emotion and more to do with not being open to individual evolution as a human being, being closed or narrow minded rather than remaining Teachable and ever seeking new knowledge and the Wisdom therein, for Socrates states that "I Know that I DO NOT Know" thus creating the fertile soil for reaching higher planes of consciousness and attaining a sort of Self-Actualization that otherwise becomes excluded to those who consciously (or not) close themselves up to such potentially great possibilities.

       I'm sorry, and you can all downvote me to hell but I would hardly call killing babies or promoting disorders like homosexual/transgender progress.  If Hillary would have gotten elected she would have your liberal friends promoting pedophilia, beastiality, incest as "progress" in a few years. I personally don't judge or have a problem with gay behavior but it's one thing to be respectful and tolerant and another to go out of your way to promote and celebrate gay behavior.  I would not be surprised if someone in this sub had evidence of elites chemically promoting homosexuality via chemicals in food and/or water.  I don't have these opinions only because I believe in God, I have these opinions because of common sense.  Murdering babies is wrong.  A man sticking his penis in another mans ass is not normal or healthy.  Science backs this up as well.  We definitely should not be promoting homosexuality in schools to young children.

       Nice immature comment.  Here have another upvote, I was 7 years old one time myself.  And to answer your question, no that would not be ok. Il break it down for you on 7 year old level.  When you eat food your asshole, or sphincter, fills up with waste called fecal matter, or shit.  The asshole is the exit point of the body for your waste and not meant to be used as an entry for a penis.  Now, you can pack fudge all you want and you won't hear any judgement from me cause I don't care what you do.  But don't go preaching to me that it's normal and okay because it's not.

       'science backs this up' looool - 'No species has been found in which homosexual behaviour has not been shown to exist, with the exception of species that never have sex at all, such as sea urchins and aphis. Moreover, a part of the animal kingdom is hermaphroditic, truly bisexual. For them, homosexuality is not an issue.'

       You can lump yourself in with less intelligent animal species all you want.  I myself recognize God given human superiority over the animal kingdom by the gift of the most powerful instrument on earth,The human brain.  Humans possess the ability to reason, read, write, compose music, understand mathematics, laugh, etc.. Animals are not capable of any of these things.  Scientist classification of man as an animal is in error which is why you are morally confused.  You let some guy who calls himself a scientist think for you rather than thinking for yourself.  See this goes back to you liberals so-called "progress"..Why would you study what you know to be a less intelligent animal species behavior to determine what is morally acceptable human behavior?  That's absurd.  I had a dog that ate her own offspring the day after giving birth.  Many animals practice cannibalism but does that make it okay for me to grill up my son tomorrow night for dinner. Common human sense tells you no it's not okay.  Animals often fight and kill each other.  Does this make murder okay?  Human intelligence puts us way ahead of the rest of the creatures in the animal kingdom so why look down to these creatures who are driven by a survival instinct and are incapable of reasoning as a model for what's moral or not?  You will be a lot better off looking up to God for instructions on how to conduct yourself.

       We enter an interesting time, when the political and social power of the Clintons passes from massive to nothing. All their "friends" will desert them, some quickly and others after a year or two. All the dirty dealings of the Clintons that we haven't yet heard of will come out, and it will be an earth-shaking revelation, to realize that someone so crooked almost became president.

       As a Bernie supporter I already went through my election Grief cycle back in July.  That gave me an interesting perspective on this election.  I didn't want either candidate (wrote in Bernie in VT), so I was already done being freaked out about one of them winning.  I fully expected HRC to win by hook or crook, but shockingly she lost!  I don't think it will be as bad people think, and we may be a step further away from WWIII than we were before the election.  It's not all bad, remember Trump pisses off establishment Republicans something fierce.

       Trump isn't a Republican. Did you not notice the virtually the entire Republican party was against him? Or at the very least didn't support him? He's like Ron Paul in the sense that although he ran on the Republican ticket, he's more of an outsider/independent.

       I find it interesting how social media and MSM differ in their interpretation of the results. All the mainstream media analysis of what happens be like

      <p>
       <em>
        "this just shows that we've all lost touch with how the average american feels..."
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        "the voters like the appeal of someone different than the politicians they're used to"

       Doesn't it usually take people 4 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Kidding aside, it was definitely an emotional disaster for a lot of folks on facebook today. HOWEVER, I recognized something significant while at work, doing chores around town, etc... everyone was so freaking nice to one another. Nobody really talked about the election to me (not like I was looking to chat other than tell them to take a deep breathe and focus on what they can control at the local level), but everyone seemed to really put an extra effort to ask me and others how they were, smile, make eye contact, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, I live in the deep south, but this was beautiful to see. So whatever happens and people wake up or not, I think humanity kinda crossed an important threshold...
      </p>
      <p>
       Most us in this sub know the President isn't the end-all, be-all of decision-making and authority, so whatever Trump does or not does isn't as important as what the Central Banks and cabal try to do...but something important happened last night, and I think it's the first MAJOR step to our collective freedom.

       It was never about Hillary winning don't you see? It was always about anyone but Trump. seriously a year ago I thought it was a joke. Then the joke got a little out of hand. 8 months later we got fucking trump as president ? Who's next ummm a Kardashian? Or maybe Jay z? That dead gorilla got 25000 votes he could pull it off in 4 years

       IMO That ended for most of the "
       <em>
        woke-folk
       </em>
       " when they clearly and disgustingly weeded out Bernie and his momentum with extreme prejudice, and the fact that Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC actively and continuously shot itself in the head by thusly denying it's party it's most popular candidate. Hopefully Trump can do the job. Part of me thinks he was actually the one all along, the Powers That Be can utilize and use anyone with power, especially someone as thirsty as Trump. But man, I really hope he does some good and can prove his value outside of what has been sold to us. And yet as mentioned above, we are more powerful and difficult to control absolutely when are united as a people together, rather than the Divide and Conquer approach the mega conglomerate news media outlets shove down our throats through divisive and culturally polarizing issues that has created the political landscape we see today.

       Other than every President and many top administration officials since the creation of The Fed and intra-national power elite groups and such as The Pilgrims, the Bilderbergs, Trilateral Commission, Carlyle Group.  Read the Church Senate Committee findings, could apply today. The media were corrupted even before the 1947 National Security Act. Administrations share political plants , family connections, and links to these groups. It's one party and confirmation bias born of intentional propaganda is difficult to override. This election was just the start.

       Even if he's a fake, a fraud, a total disaster, whatever... sending the corrupt Clinton crime family home to die, once and for all, is good enough for me.

       Comments like this getting downvoted in this sub shows just how "in denial" Trump supporters are as well. Trump's the alt-right version of Obama, promising hope and change to his supporters who are eating it up. Those who think Trump will magically dissolve the political establishment in Washington and is going to singlehandedly end the corruption are a bit naive IMO. Just watch over the next few months as he fills his cabinet and close advisors with establishment regulars and special interest shills.

       Unfortunately the general consensus I've been hearing from people around me is that they're blaming the voters for being idiots. Those people are still asleep though...

       You're not a liberal, you are a leftist. The real problem is that the Democrats have conflated "liberal" with terms like left, progressive, etc. to provide cover for their retrograde and corporate sponsored pols.

       People thought Hillary had the support of liberals for good reason; she did. And if you look at the blue areas on the voting map, it's all liberal/trendy-populated regions that kept Hillary in the game.

       So, not only was it a thought, it was proven.

       In earlier times, everyone depended on everyone inside a community in order to survive, everyone had a function to play. We don't have that any more, we need money to survive, this is the root of our society being so internally isolated.
