       Eyes Wide Shut was Stanley Kubrick's last film, and the plot revolves heavily around a guy digging deeper into a secret cult of society's elites. He's eventually intimidated into ceasing his investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The secret society of the upper class is shown to have creepy sex-based rituals, with elements that seem to be modified from Christianity, like a bastardization of it. Here it is.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgvYfMsKJhE">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgvYfMsKJhE
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The creepy part, though, is the old conspiracy theory that Kubrick was killed because of this movie. People believe he was a central figure in the Illuminati (he seems to be the most respected one in all Hollywood, despite not being a hitmaker like Spielberg). The theory asserts that the above ritual and other behaviors shown by the upper class in the film are based upon true behaviors of those people, and a real secret society of theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never believed it, because I didn't believe in a secret ruling class secret society, I thought it was dumb tbh. Plus, he was over 70, and the official cause of death is a heart attack while he slept. Seems likely. I figured it was just art for art's sake, while being an interesting look at society's financial heirarchy. That changed with the Podesta emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the Podesta emails possibly show is that the theory IS true. The upper class DOES hold secret, ritualistic meetings, (we know for sure that they attend Spirit Cooking rituals now) and the links people are bringing up are revealing all this crazy stuff about ritualistic, masonic, satanist sex rituals, largely involving children and sacrifice, as well as cannibalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       We still don't know for SURE what's true and what's not, but Eyes Wide Shut fits WAY too well into this theory with all of this other stuff coming out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, who was the President when the movie came out? I'll let you draw your own conclusions from that answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know is that I'm scared and want to be closer to God than I've been in years.

       Except for that's not what they say that ritual is for... they say it is symbolic of killing their cares for the weekend so they can have fun without worrying about work/life outside of the grove, etc.

       I take Alex Jones with a grain of salt most of the time anyway because he tends to go off the deep end, but may I ask for more info on this? It's the first time I'm hearing that Jones is controlled in anyway.

       Alex Jones is a joke. There has been some use for him, since he has raised some truths, but they're always clouded with his personal ambitions and quackery.
       <br/>
       He's been more focused on telling you how the end is near and selling you the supplement or kit to survive his version of the apocalypse.

       Haha so true. Also his view on 911 supports the weakest theory rather than the absolute truth. He wants to steer people into the "ONLY Control DEMOLITIONS took down the building, AND YES Carbon fiber planes can cut through STEEL beams#

       if we assume that Alex Jones spread dis info, we could think that he also tells some true conspiracies (through him or by his guests).
Because that's the point of a dis-info agent, to mix truth with bullshit so it all become a 'conspiracy THEORY' label..am I right?

       In retrospect I see what you're saying. At the time I was super skeptical about all conspiracies (which I was until last school year). I guess I just figured weird rituals were silly and the upper class wouldn't do that if they could control everything unofficially already through Super PACS etc.

       It's especially prevalent in the entertainment industry. One teeny tiny example: this is what Brad Pitt said when asked how he achieved fame and success:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I related it more to my upbringing,” Pitt said. “I grew up in a very Christian environment, a healthy environment, a loving family. But there were just parameters and things I didn’t understand. I always questioned it and it took me to my adult years or leaving home where I could really try on something different for myself. That was Satanism. It’s working out really well. I made a pact. That’s why the movie came out so well.”
       </p>

       Taken by itself the Brad Pitt quote would present no interest. But in context it is a supplementary indication that you tend not to have success in Hollywood if you don't sell-out to dark forces. Nor in politics for that matter.

       EDIT: you don't need to believe in "the devil" to see this; suffice to realize (most) people in entertainment/power do, and swear "allegiance to it"; rituals and sacrifices, lying for a "higher purpose", pushing a covert agenda, and generally doing evil things. Whether the devil exists or these people are delusional doesn't matter as much as the harm they really do.

       Yeah, I don't think they're talking about literally selling their souls to satan. But I have always thought that was a figure of speech to represent doing immoral things in the name of ascending in life.

       Regardless, this is still the source of evils committed by the higher ups. This philosophy of doing whatever it takes. That's what leads to complacency among themselves with this Pedo Ring we're discovering.

       Yeah! I didn't mention that because I'm not sure if the final product was his vision or not. I had only heard that there were some sex scenes that were cut.

       But there is that creepiness about him calling R. Lee Ermey and breaking down about Cruise and Kidman ruining the film. Maybe there was a LOT more to that film that we didn't see, and more than they let us in on.

       I don't think he was finished cutting the film when he died. But the studio did mess with it after he died. When Tom Cruise is walking through the rooms where people are having sex there are other people conveniently blocking the view. Those people were added by the studio. I don't think they move at all, they are just pictures basically, and it looks very awkward.

       David Icke, Alex Jones, Cathy OBrien, David Wilcock and more have been talking about this for years and decades, finally evidence is being made public but this was always an open secret in an unwilling to believe world. I don't fault anyone, Cathy herself says she doesn't blame good people for not accepting it, she found their unwillingness to process the information was due more to their kind and loving nature that such concepts were "impossible" to fathom.

       imo Kubrick uses known literature to give pleasant heft and familiarity for his "average" audience. But it also functions as a handy cloak to the real message. Even if his sponsors "found out" that message, they probably accepted the risk for the profits they knew they'd make, and are still making. It can be argued that his ouevre is the most consistently popular of any late 20th c director.

       Kubrick would have never been allowed to put out Eyes Wide Shut if the rulers didn't want it. Movie production and distribution is extremely controlled. In fact I'd suggest Kubrick was specifically sought out to make the movie and that the best actors of the time were given the roles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rulers do this all the time. They put all the truth out there for people to see. They subtly cloak it as movies but they really want everyone to know what goes on. I read they are required to inform the population how they rule due to rules that even our rulers must follow. That's going much deeper than most are comfortable to go however.

       Here's a list to consider,
       <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati-movies/">

       Most movies are about keeping people distracted through entertainment. A list of those is simply way too long. Some movies are used to open peoples mind slightly to the reality that is being hidden from them. That is what you'll see on the above list, of course there are more. A rare few movies show elite lifestyles and explain the way our society is ordered, like Eyes Wide Shut.
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand rules that our rulers must follow you dive into extraterrestrial contact and basic rules that are in place for many civilizations. Our rulers are forced to follow some rules and do so to the very bare minimum that they must. I'd link to some that talk about this but much better people explore the subject and organically find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's great to be skeptical! You can't suddenly 'wake up' as you need to fully believe things one step at a time. Skip steps and you just reject things as totally crazy. Apologies...I don't mean to be cryptic.

       There are lots of good sites out there and good people. Sadly there is a ton of crap too. Much of it disinfo put out on purpose. If you haven't seen the movie 'Mirage Men' that's a solid disinfo case they really dig into. The movie ends with a talk about the Holloman AFB UFO landing which is a solid story with credible info supporting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like listening to people directly without all the filters websites apply so the interviews here are good.
       <a href="http://projectcamelotportal.com/category/interviews/video/">
        http://projectcamelotportal.com/category/interviews/video/
       </a>
       Of course these interviews are done in a guided way with filters, but this is about the closest as you can get to hearing it from the source. Lots of the stuff on this website is crap, be warned. Too many trying to be something special and build up a career travelling around and dispensing the 'truth'. Some is quality info however.  When you surf the web and come across a researchers name that sounds interesting to you then dig around for direct interviews of them. Often at this site or several others now. I hope this helps much more.

       I disagree, honestly. Another guy said he believed that the rulers allow people to produce whatever they want, so that they don't look suspicious, and he was swiftly punished after its release.

       As a long time conspiracy theorist, I never believed the stories of widespread pedophilia and satanism in the highest levels of government. Seemed too ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as you say, the Podesta emails and other information coming out has pretty well confirmed its happening in the US Government. And its not so crazy to see how it happens - the ones at the top only recruit others to high level positions who are also into this shit. If you're not into it, you dont make it.

       Once you've understood the "secret" state religion (kabbalism, hermetism, luciferianism), you'll start seeing the symbolism they put everywhere on TV, in particular televised rituals (SuperBowl, Olympics, Gothard tunnel inauguration, Grammies, etc.), in music videos, movies, and elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand the meaning of these themes and symbols check out for example Mark Passio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you'll notice the luciferian hand gestures flashed by many politicians, you'll understand 911 if you haven't already (i.e. not only a false-flag/psyop, but a mega-ritual).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet later you'll re-discover the UFO/ETI phenomenon, realize the Vatican has a telescope called "Lucifer", dig more, and understand the link between so-called "UFOs" and the kabbalistic/hermetic practices of the elite.

       In particular have a look at Podesta's email ID 44097. Note that Podesta accepted the meeting with Mitchell, and he is a well-known proponent of UFO "disclosure". Who do you think are the "celestials" Mitchell is talking about? The answer is "ascended masters" (this modern hermeticism borrows a lot from theosophy). Theirs is a cult of knowledge.

       What is zero point energy then?

       The repeated suggestion of a
       <em>
        contiguous universe
       </em>
       (right next) to ours is bizarre... is there any other information that would support or expand upon what the hell they are talking about here?

       Yes, but not necessarily in the emails (although check out the exchanges with Tom DeLonge, they mention "classified technology").
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know exactly what they mean by "contiguous universe". But to understand better this whole "ufo disclosure" initiative being considered in high circles check out Steven Greer, his documentary Sirius, and another documentary called "the day after disclosure".

       Zero-Point-Energy is a form of "free energy", i.e. energy that can be extracted directly from the fabric of the universe.

       I don't want to get off-topic though, this deserves (and probably has) its own threads.  The point here is that the global elite are superstitious and their kabbalistic/satanic practices are ubiquitous; the child trafficking / pedoring stuff is but one facet of their occult ritual practices and depraved way of life. They need to be exposed, judged and hanged.

       I just rewatched it a couple of nights ago.  If the unthinkable is true, this may become the best movie of all time.  Its stunning and has a great environment on its own, but with his death, the deleted scenes, and verified top tier emails confirming it??? It would become way more than just a film.

       That's pretty true. At least the most important film of the modern age. I always thought of 2001 as the most important since it was the penultimate example of Film as art relying on film conventions. But if Podesta stuff is true... This really could be huge. The most daring film of all time.

       The one thing that was stained my mind with EWS was the Milich's daughter scene. She was a young underage foreign girl who worked for her father ( who does not appear to be biological ).

       Kubrick has allusions to Wizard of Oz in that segment specifically.
Many people believe that Judy Garland began popping pills because of pedophilia.

       Also, look up Monarch Mind Control. The page I read was hugely informative on the program and how it works, which is actually fairly complex. But, one of the "triggers" they use to activate the mind control slave is the Wizard of Oz. reply to this comment and I will see if I can find the specific page I am talking about otherwise I still suggest looking it up if you want to know the truth

       To me the sickest part of the movie (even though it was altered from Kubrick's final cut)
      </p>
      <p>
       is when Tom and Nichole lock eyes uninterrupted for a few minutes in a crowded department store at the very end......and their daughter slips into the crowd and isn't seen again.

       Pretty sure it signifies that they had to give her up to the cult in order to save their own hides.

       I heard that before! I saw an analysis video where someone pointed out that two extras used during the opening party scene can be spotted nearby her at the end there. Could be a coincidence, just using them for convenience. But Kubrick was ANALLY attentive to all details. He could've used other, new actors for continuitiy's sake, and chose not to.

       People do figure it out though. There is a substantial amount of people that are onto this but we must keep quiet always. Most people live in fear, that is where the problem is. If you attempted to tell somebody about this, the most likely result is they would write you off because none of us want to accept that reality is this fucked up, yet it is. Like that movie quote "You can't handle the truth"

       I strongly recommend everyone find and watch the original 1969 German movie of the book Eyes Wide Shut was based upon,  Traumnovelle.  It used to be on youtube with english subtitles, so it must be somewhere online.

       It's almost as good as Kubrick's version, well worth buying.

       I literally just watched this, and as mentioned above I feel lime the studio edited in a way to make the viewer not want to follow the path of cruise's character. Even the ending when Nicole Kidman say that there's one thing to do, fuck. Then cut. Before that she was saying she guesses they should be lucky after she takes everything in from toms crazy ads story. IDK I feel you guys on all the hidden messages Kubrick can create, 
Especially in the Shining.

       Yeah I see that. I took it as representative of the modern person's reluctance to keep their eyes open to the truth, since the truth is so ugly. I think Kubrick was critical of the influence sex has on society, and that culminates in the ending where they choose to live comfortable hedonism over the truth and its implications. Common people keep their Eyes Wide Shut.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's critical of the common person's willful ignorance, and with the Podesta stuff, maybe it was also to cover his own ass.

      <p>
       Or you could be right, it could've been the powers that be lessening an intended revolutionary impact.

       Ah I see, that makes sense because the whole reason he was looking for an adventure was due to his wife cheating on him. The evil that sex causes, and how it's diverse in how it effects certain classes of people. Whoa I like your take on it.

       There were pretty strong overtones that suggested that Kidman's character was secretly a part of what was secretly going on, and probably was at the ritual.  The suggestion, I think, is even those closest to the insides (eg spouse) are not privy to the conspiracy.

       Yeah I need to rewatch this. I've been looking into Kubrick for a while and i subscribe to the theory that the Shining is the story of his dealings with this group. Eyes wide shut also explores the theme of being attracted to power/mystery/a woman and having it go wrong. I think that is the reason he became such a recluse. I don't think a chess player would try to 'reveal' things in this film when he knew they would be taken out but his death is quite odd and the choice of book adaptation is also rather odd. Who knows.

       Honestly The Shining's deeper meaning has eluded me to this day. I can't convince myself of one totally. I have no doubt that his reclusiveness was related his weariness of sex (more a lack of his ability to relate to common folk, I suppose), but also imo, his desire to be away from the people he criticized in EWS and the ugliness they dealt in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, given the nature of this Podesta stuff, I can't believe anything but the idea that he was alluding to this real cultish stuff. At the very least, the film criticizes class heirarchy, and the higher-ups' control of power over lower class people. As Dr. Harford buys middle class people off the whole night, throwing money around to fulfill his sexual desire, so too does elite upper class of society use their influence to get their way, and intimidate him into stopping.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like you said, it's pretty subjective as to an even deeper allegory than that. Personally, I believe that he waited so long to tell this story (he had been wanting to make this film for years, so I understand) because he wanted to live a full life before plunging into the deep shit like he did, maybe he knew it could likely kill him.

       His reclusiveness is the key to everything, and i do think his work being misunderstood, Clockwork orange especially, contributed to it. Also like you said i think he wanted to get away from some elite group that he was initiated into possibly around the time of Dr Strangelove. In the Shining Jack is 'accepted' into the elite of the Gold Room only after he wrecks his family after becoming obsessed with his work. Barry Lyndon also tried to get into the elite (the aristocracy) but he was never truly accepted. Eyes wide shut is the most blatant about this so i can see why people link his death to it. It's just a theme i've noticed that doesn't get acknowledged very much. There's layers upon layers so it's not the only deeper meaning. Could be part of some misdirection, we know Kubrick had a tactical mind.

       Clinton lost because of a few reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Primarily, Hubris.  They thought they had it in the bag.  At the start they were touting 98% chance of her becoming president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, Meme Magic is real.  Desire manifesting as reality, even though many of the people who were caught up in it didn't realise it.  Since this has come to pass, more and more people are waking up, and starting to take conspiracies more seriously.

       Yeah that's true, but I was alluding more to the fact that Bill Clinton was still in office and the fact that considering the infamous stuff about him being part of Bohemian Grove, not to mention all of the shadiness the Clintons in general are surrounded by, I think it gives weight to the idea that Kubrick was killed rather than died in his sleep.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In the original book Lolita is something like 8 years old.  Too scandalous for the movies.  It turns out that Nabokov's books were an exposé on a global network of child sexual predators.  He himself was inducted into this world by his uncle, a flamboyant homosexual who worked in the foreign service who molested Vladimir repeatedly as a child.

       I think he was referring to the part where sex is powerful enough to drive dark shit, which I think Kubrick believed strongly his whole life. However, I don't know if Lolita was as much of an expose, seeing how Kubrick was still relatively new and not super famous yet, I don't think he'd have the inside connections that he had later.

       That's true. I believe Kubrick was always critical on how compelling sex is to people. Idk if Lolita is supposed to be an expose on the secret societies so much, though. He was still a pretty new director, not super famous. I don't think he would've been very connected to the secrets back then.

       You should watch Room 236. It's a documentary about Stanley Kubrick and the symbolism he uses in The Shining. The doc also talks about how the symbolism in his movies is all tied together. It touches briefly on Eyes Wide Shut. The main commenter mentions how evertyime he watches The Shining he catches something that he missed before. I also want to thank y'all for all that wonderful digging and research y'all do. Keep up the good work!

       Edit: it's Room 237. Sorry :)

       He always tried to bring you the reality of life and the true sense of what happens in certain situations. Not cheap thrills, things we know are the truth no matter how hard it is to admit or scary it is.

       Look at our entire society. Everything is flipped. Look at Youtube, went from a great idea to shilling for these psychopaths. Look at Twitter, FB, all of these things. Look at schools, they dumb people down. The most "educated" in our society are the idiots crying that Hillary is not president, not investigating pedophile rings. I would encourage you to expand your investigation into Christianity itself. Not to question a divine spirit that flows through everyone but in my research (formerly raised a Lutheran) this is much more complex than simply God and Satan. Regarless, thank you for fighting the good fight and be as courageous and vigilant as ever we need to take these psychopaths down

       Honestly, I was very much a believer of God vs. Satan as well until very recently. It only takes one read of Genesis to begin to go, "This is God? This selfish, hypocritical guy is God?" The true evil in my understanding are forces in another dimension called the Archons. I would explain but I would not do it justice. If you are interested, go on yt and watch David Icke's speech called the History of the Archons. It is two parts but if you watch, you will be blown away. Also, it is amazing the things Icke has figured out that they do not want anyone to know about. The sickos don't have to do any research, they just get spoon fed piece by piece as they rise up through the ranks. God is hard to explain, it seems clear to me God exists but not in the way Christianity would describe him as a "jealous God" and a God that is physically walking through a garden.

       Even most Christians don't seem to fully understand the nature of God, but such is to be expected when walking the path of faith and not gnosis. Not to judge one as better or worse than the other, but each has its pitfalls.

       Did some reading this morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if I'm understanding correctly, the God that we WANT to worship is on another plane ABOVE Archons, who cruelly manipulate OUR plane from theirs, because the true transcendent God ousted them as the ultimate beings?
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Archons are like, Greek mythological beings? And have, at times, sabatoged our direction as humans by pretending to be the "true" God? And this explains the shift in how God behaves towards us from Old Testament to New, because THEY would butt in to act as vengeful, angry God before Jesus tempered their power more and showed us the true way? Would also explain more confusing things in the Bible that come off as inconsistencies in moral lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since, the Archons have, out of continued spite and jealousy towards us and the true transcendent God, influenced certain humans and directed them on how to make their influence stronger in this world and turn us against the true way to live, with the return being pleasures of the flesh, a fat wallet, great cultural influence, and earthly immortality?
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, the elites have been performing horrid rituals for these Archons, to appease them, and basically acting as their puppets? And the Archons are what we're taught as the influence of Satan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did I get the gist?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really interesting stuff, for sure. I'm open to alternative interpretations of Christianity. Thing is, it's hard for me to accept interpretations that don't draw from the Bible. That's probably a sign that I might be too indoctrinated and not open enough to the truth, but I really, from my soul can't turn from The Bible itself. Which would be playing into the Archon's plan if this theory is true. 
I'd need to see something more for me to start believing this, although I admit I'm not sure what that might be. Maybe if the Pope or an Arch-Bishop said something about it (I'm Catholic btw. I know, I know, that hinders the openness of my mind to ideas like this, but I genuinely can't help it for now). Regardless, this is incredible stuff, thank you for sharing it!

       its not like if you win the lottery you will get an invitation to these parties, its more like watching porn, or lifting weights, the first day at the gym you can hardly life the empty bar, after a year there you are lifting twice your body weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say its the same with money, the first day you are excited to fly on a private jet, but if you really have the money, you will be doing much more wilder stuff in a year, now if you are decent you wont do anything illegal, but a lot of those billionaires are so disconnected from society that is not hard to imagine the things they would need to get really excited.

       That little girl was manipulated by her mother and mother's boyfriend into making false testimony in a divorce custody battle. In addition, the boyfriend's mother physically abused her, violently. And the mother knew. Further, they fed both children only hemp seed product as part of a vegan cleansing, ultimately starving the children. Social services were called as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dig into this story and what you discover is that all those who follow anon and aanigrlfan on this issue got it badly wrong. And continue to disseminate identifiable imagery of these children - violating their privacy rights in the process - all to promote a political and religious agenda of their own.

       There are several videos of official police interviews taken across a few weeks that were leaked. This video, i believe, is one recorded by the mother and mother's boyfriend - those who coached the children. In the final official video, after the children had been separated from the mother and mother's boyfriend, the children recanted on the record. (well, as on the record as a child of that age can get)

       I'm new to the Bohemian Grove stuff, but that event, coupled with other large events worldwide where the rich and SUPER-POWERFUL come together, just says that they wish to cavort with their own types, and God only knows what plans they have for us un-washed masses.  What other reason would these events take place?  Another is the one in Bilderberg summit.

       edited to add that you know some highly illegal stuff goes on, is known to go on, and yet local law enforcement and major crime bureaus throughout the world NEVER press a charge for file a report.  Things that I presume are covered up include prostitution, rape, illicit drug use, money laundering, weapons trafficking, etc etc and possibly worse.

       I'm with you to a certain extent bud - I've been on this sub for ages and this whole thing just feels like a goose chase.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are wildly overreaching for dark, satanic shit when we have evidence of actual criminal, corrupt, and prosecutable political activity here. I'm sincerely hoping that the FBI takes Trump's election as a green light to proceed with the Foundation investigation (as I also hope that there is an ideological core of agents in the FBI that are committed to justice)... and while it'd tickle me to find that these people are involved in some sick ritual magic shit while they rot in jail, I feel like it's a community-created distraction from the bigger, more mundane stories here.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I have no doubts that the upper echelons of the elite circles are into some fucked up shit - but we have hard evidence for the lines of inquiry into the CF and not much hard evidence beyond obscure "code language" and the already-known fact that top level people in DC are incredibly interconnected with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Piercing the wall of these elites' bubble of protection will likely unleash all sorts of information and confirm conspiracy theories long-hypothesized for decades... but first we must pierce that bubble... which means we need a single line of attack. Until physical evidence or a more tangible smoking gun comes to light for this satanic shit, it's just a highly entertaining side trail.

       well any studier of the Masons knows that they likely keep 95% of their members in the dark while the select few are introduced to ancient teachings / power.

       Depends on what's your rank in the Masons?, which was his point i believe. Only the highest ranking members have some weird stuff going on, and some people from the rest of the members get promoted to the "higher-ring".

       Not really familiar with the whole thing, but i believe that was his point.

       Haha I don't really know what to say about this conversation. I mean, MAYBE the masons aren't involved, but from what I understand these guys have a lot of Masonic imagery surrounding them. Like that creepy ass house overlooking the lake that they had a "pizza party" at once... With the POPE. Idk, maybe it could be appropriation or something.

       'Eyes Wide Shut' is Arthur Schnitzler's novel 'Traumnovelle' (Dream Story), moved from 1926 Vienna to 1999 New York.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems unlikely that its based in any kind of 1999 reality.

       "With their widely noted disputes about the adaptation, some think Kubrick left an “eff you” message in The Shining for Stephen King. At the beginning of the movie we see that Kubrick has changed the book’s red Volkswagon with a yellow one — a seemingly harmless change. However, at the end we finally see what happened to King’s red car, it’s crushed in an accident on the side of the road. This, and other theories were explored in Room 237." -

       First time I saw the Shining I was on mushrooms and mind blown. 0% because of a book Stephen King wrote.

       imo Kubrick uses known literature to give pleasant heft and familiarity for his "average" audience. But it also functions as a handy cloak to the real message. Even if his sponsors "found out" that message, they probably accepted the risk for the profits they knew they'd make, and are still making. It can be argued that his ouevre is the most consistently popular of any late 20th c director.

       Even most Christians don't seem to fully understand the nature of God, but such is to be expected when walking the path of faith and not gnosis. Not to judge one as better or worse than the other, but each has its pitfalls.

       Did some reading this morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if I'm understanding correctly, the God that we WANT to worship is on another plane ABOVE Archons, who cruelly manipulate OUR plane from theirs, because the true transcendent God ousted them as the ultimate beings?
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Archons are like, Greek mythological beings? And have, at times, sabatoged our direction as humans by pretending to be the "true" God? And this explains the shift in how God behaves towards us from Old Testament to New, because THEY would butt in to act as vengeful, angry God before Jesus tempered their power more and showed us the true way? Would also explain more confusing things in the Bible that come off as inconsistencies in moral lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since, the Archons have, out of continued spite and jealousy towards us and the true transcendent God, influenced certain humans and directed them on how to make their influence stronger in this world and turn us against the true way to live, with the return being pleasures of the flesh, a fat wallet, great cultural influence, and earthly immortality?
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, the elites have been performing horrid rituals for these Archons, to appease them, and basically acting as their puppets? And the Archons are what we're taught as the influence of Satan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did I get the gist?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really interesting stuff, for sure. I'm open to alternative interpretations of Christianity. Thing is, it's hard for me to accept interpretations that don't draw from the Bible. That's probably a sign that I might be too indoctrinated and not open enough to the truth, but I really, from my soul can't turn from The Bible itself. Which would be playing into the Archon's plan if this theory is true. 
I'd need to see something more for me to start believing this, although I admit I'm not sure what that might be. Maybe if the Pope or an Arch-Bishop said something about it (I'm Catholic btw. I know, I know, that hinders the openness of my mind to ideas like this, but I genuinely can't help it for now). Regardless, this is incredible stuff, thank you for sharing it!
