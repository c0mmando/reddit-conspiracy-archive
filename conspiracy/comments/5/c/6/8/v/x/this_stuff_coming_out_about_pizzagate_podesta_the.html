        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Eyes Wide Shut was Stanley Kubrick&#39;s last film, and the plot revolves heavily around a guy digging deeper into a secret cult of society&#39;s elites. He&#39;s eventually intimidated into ceasing his investigation. </p>

<p>The secret society of the upper class is shown to have creepy sex-based rituals, with elements that seem to be modified from Christianity, like a bastardization of it. Here it is. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgvYfMsKJhE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgvYfMsKJhE</a></p>

<p>The creepy part, though, is the old conspiracy theory that Kubrick was killed because of this movie. People believe he was a central figure in the Illuminati (he seems to be the most respected one in all Hollywood, despite not being a hitmaker like Spielberg). The theory asserts that the above ritual and other behaviors shown by the upper class in the film are based upon true behaviors of those people, and a real secret society of theirs. </p>

<p>I never believed it, because I didn&#39;t believe in a secret ruling class secret society, I thought it was dumb tbh. Plus, he was over 70, and the official cause of death is a heart attack while he slept. Seems likely. I figured it was just art for art&#39;s sake, while being an interesting look at society&#39;s financial heirarchy. That changed with the Podesta emails.</p>

<p>What the Podesta emails possibly show is that the theory IS true. The upper class DOES hold secret, ritualistic meetings, (we know for sure that they attend Spirit Cooking rituals now) and the links people are bringing up are revealing all this crazy stuff about ritualistic, masonic, satanist sex rituals, largely involving children and sacrifice, as well as cannibalism. </p>

<p>We still don&#39;t know for SURE what&#39;s true and what&#39;s not, but Eyes Wide Shut fits WAY too well into this theory with all of this other stuff coming out.</p>

<p>Not to mention, who was the President when the movie came out? I&#39;ll let you draw your own conclusions from that answer.</p>

<p>All I know is that I&#39;m scared and want to be closer to God than I&#39;ve been in years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s especially prevalent in the entertainment industry. One teeny tiny example: this is what Brad Pitt said when asked how he achieved fame and success: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I related it more to my upbringing,” Pitt said. “I grew up in a very Christian environment, a healthy environment, a loving family. But there were just parameters and things I didn’t understand. I always questioned it and it took me to my adult years or leaving home where I could really try on something different for myself. That was Satanism. It’s working out really well. I made a pact. That’s why the movie came out so well.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taken by itself the Brad Pitt quote would present no interest. But in context it is a supplementary indication that you tend not to have success in Hollywood if you don&#39;t sell-out to dark forces. Nor in politics for that matter. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvC7QAUhqF8">Here is Lady Gaga saying &quot;I swear to Lucifer ...&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="http://conspiracyresearch.blogspot.ch/2016/01/stars-who-say-who-sold-their-soul-to.html">In music lyrics it&#39;s absolutely everywhere</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.co/watch?v=HJLxVCmedXY">Or stuff like this</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YiqZvM1Pyo">Or this</a></p>

<p>There are literally thousands of examples (not including the symbolism in music videos, choreography, mega-rituals such as Grammies, Olympics, Superbowl, etc.).</p>

<p>EDIT: you don&#39;t need to believe in &quot;the devil&quot; to see this; suffice to realize (most) people in entertainment/power do, and swear &quot;allegiance to it&quot;; rituals and sacrifices, lying for a &quot;higher purpose&quot;, pushing a covert agenda, and generally doing evil things. Whether the devil exists or these people are delusional doesn&#39;t matter as much as the harm they really do.</p>

<p>imo Kubrick uses known literature to give pleasant heft and familiarity for his &quot;average&quot; audience. But it also functions as a handy cloak to the real message. Even if his sponsors &quot;found out&quot; that message, they probably accepted the risk for the profits they knew they&#39;d make, and are still making. It can be argued that his ouevre is the most consistently popular of any late 20th c director.</p>

In fact I&#39;d suggest Kubrick was specifically sought out to make the movie and that the best actors of the time were given the roles.</p>

<p>The rulers do this all the time. They put all the truth out there for people to see. They subtly cloak it as movies but they really want everyone to know what goes on. I read they are required to inform the population how they rule due to rules that even our rulers must follow. That&#39;s going much deeper than most are comfortable to go however. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a list to consider, <a href="http://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati-movies/">http://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati-movies/</a></p>

<p>Most movies are about keeping people distracted through entertainment. A list of those is simply way too long. Some movies are used to open peoples mind slightly to the reality that is being hidden from them. That is what you&#39;ll see on the above list, of course there are more. A rare few movies show elite lifestyles and explain the way our society is ordered, like Eyes Wide Shut.</p>

<p>To understand rules that our rulers must follow you dive into extraterrestrial contact and basic rules that are in place for many civilizations. Our rulers are forced to follow some rules and do so to the very bare minimum that they must. I&#39;d link to some that talk about this but much better people explore the subject and organically find it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s great to be skeptical! You can&#39;t suddenly &#39;wake up&#39; as you need to fully believe things one step at a time. Skip steps and you just reject things as totally crazy. Apologies...I don&#39;t mean to be cryptic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are lots of good sites out there and good people. Sadly there is a ton of crap too. Much of it disinfo put out on purpose. If you haven&#39;t seen the movie &#39;Mirage Men&#39; that&#39;s a solid disinfo case they really dig into. The movie ends with a talk about the Holloman AFB UFO landing which is a solid story with credible info supporting it.</p>

<p>I like listening to people directly without all the filters websites apply so the interviews here are good. <a href="http://projectcamelotportal.com/category/interviews/video/">http://projectcamelotportal.com/category/interviews/video/</a>
Of course these interviews are done in a guided way with filters, but this is about the closest as you can get to hearing it from the source. Lots of the stuff on this website is crap, be warned. Too many trying to be something special and build up a career travelling around and dispensing the &#39;truth&#39;. Some is quality info however.  When you surf the web and come across a researchers name that sounds interesting to you then dig around for direct interviews of them. Often at this site or several others now. I hope this helps much more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, I know how it feels. You should also check out Angelina Jolie&#39;s recently leaked video telling about the ritual(s) she participated in. Google it or see simply see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QziyTX72WjQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QziyTX72WjQ</a></p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve understood the &quot;secret&quot; state religion (kabbalism, hermetism, luciferianism), you&#39;ll start seeing the symbolism they put everywhere on TV, in particular televised rituals (SuperBowl, Olympics, Gothard tunnel inauguration, Grammies, etc.), in music videos, movies, and elsewhere. </p>

<p>To understand the meaning of these themes and symbols check out for example Mark Passio.</p>

<p>Then you&#39;ll notice the luciferian hand gestures flashed by many politicians, you&#39;ll understand 911 if you haven&#39;t already (i.e. not only a false-flag/psyop, but a mega-ritual).</p>

<p>Yet later you&#39;ll re-discover the UFO/ETI phenomenon, realize the Vatican has a telescope called &quot;Lucifer&quot;, dig more, and understand the link between so-called &quot;UFOs&quot; and the kabbalistic/hermetic practices of the elite.</p>

<p>In particular have a look at Podesta&#39;s email ID 44097. Note that Podesta accepted the meeting with Mitchell, and he is a well-known proponent of UFO &quot;disclosure&quot;. Who do you think are the &quot;celestials&quot; Mitchell is talking about? The answer is &quot;ascended masters&quot; (this modern hermeticism borrows a lot from theosophy).

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but not necessarily in the emails (although check out the exchanges with Tom DeLonge, they mention &quot;classified technology&quot;).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know exactly what they mean by &quot;contiguous universe&quot;. But to understand better this whole &quot;ufo disclosure&quot; initiative being considered in high circles check out Steven Greer, his documentary Sirius, and another documentary called &quot;the day after disclosure&quot;.</p>

<p>Zero-Point-Energy is a form of &quot;free energy&quot;, i.e. energy that can be extracted directly from the fabric of the universe. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to get off-topic though, this deserves (and probably has) its own threads.  The point here is that the global elite are superstitious and their kabbalistic/satanic practices are ubiquitous; the child trafficking / pedoring stuff is but one facet of their occult ritual practices and depraved way of life. They need to be exposed, judged and hanged.</p>

<p>is when Tom and Nichole lock eyes uninterrupted for a few minutes in a crowded department store at the very end......and their daughter slips into the crowd and isn&#39;t seen again. </p>

<p>Pretty sure it signifies that they had to give her up to the cult in order to save their own hides. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I see that. I took it as representative of the modern person&#39;s reluctance to keep their eyes open to the truth, since the truth is so ugly. I think Kubrick was critical of the influence sex has on society, and that culminates in the ending where they choose to live comfortable hedonism over the truth and its implications. Common people keep their Eyes Wide Shut.</p>

<p>It&#39;s critical of the common person&#39;s willful ignorance, and with the Podesta stuff, maybe it was also to cover his own ass.</p>

<p>Or you could be right, it could&#39;ve been the powers that be lessening an intended revolutionary impact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I need to rewatch this. I&#39;ve been looking into Kubrick for a while and i subscribe to the theory that the Shining is the story of his dealings with this group. Eyes wide shut also explores the theme of being attracted to power/mystery/a woman and having it go wrong. I think that is the reason he became such a recluse. I don&#39;t think a chess player would try to &#39;reveal&#39; things in this film when he knew they would be taken out but his death is quite odd and the choice of book adaptation is also rather odd. Who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly The Shining&#39;s deeper meaning has eluded me to this day. I can&#39;t convince myself of one totally. I have no doubt that his reclusiveness was related his weariness of sex (more a lack of his ability to relate to common folk, I suppose), but also imo, his desire to be away from the people he criticized in EWS and the ugliness they dealt in. </p>

<p>Like I said, given the nature of this Podesta stuff, I can&#39;t believe anything but the idea that he was alluding to this real cultish stuff. At the very least, the film criticizes class heirarchy, and the higher-ups&#39; control of power over lower class people. As Dr. Harford buys middle class people off the whole night, throwing money around to fulfill his sexual desire, so too does elite upper class of society use their influence to get their way, and intimidate him into stopping.</p>

<p>But like you said, it&#39;s pretty subjective as to an even deeper allegory than that. Personally, I believe that he waited so long to tell this story (he had been wanting to make this film for years, so I understand) because he wanted to live a full life before plunging into the deep shit like he did, maybe he knew it could likely kill him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His reclusiveness is the key to everything, and i do think his work being misunderstood, Clockwork orange especially, contributed to it. Also like you said i think he wanted to get away from some elite group that he was initiated into possibly around the time of Dr Strangelove. In the Shining Jack is &#39;accepted&#39; into the elite of the Gold Room only after he wrecks his family after becoming obsessed with his work. Barry Lyndon also tried to get into the elite (the aristocracy) but he was never truly accepted. Eyes wide shut is the most blatant about this so i can see why people link his death to it. It&#39;s just a theme i&#39;ve noticed that doesn&#39;t get acknowledged very much. There&#39;s layers upon layers so it&#39;s not the only deeper meaning. Could be part of some misdirection, we know Kubrick had a tactical mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s true, but I was alluding more to the fact that Bill Clinton was still in office and the fact that considering the infamous stuff about him being part of Bohemian Grove, not to mention all of the shadiness the Clintons in general are surrounded by, I think it gives weight to the idea that Kubrick was killed rather than died in his sleep.</p>

<p>Lolita</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the original book Lolita is something like 8 years old.  Too scandalous for the movies.  It turns out that Nabokov&#39;s books were an exposé on a global network of child sexual predators.  He himself was inducted into this world by his uncle, a flamboyant homosexual who worked in the foreign service who molested Vladimir repeatedly as a child.</p>

<p>Check out this astonishing documentary series, it&#39;s well worth watching in its entirety:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he was referring to the part where sex is powerful enough to drive dark shit, which I think Kubrick believed strongly his whole life. However, I don&#39;t know if Lolita was as much of an expose, seeing how Kubrick was still relatively new and not super famous yet, I don&#39;t think he&#39;d have the inside connections that he had later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true. I believe Kubrick was always critical on how compelling sex is to people. Idk if Lolita is supposed to be an expose on the secret societies so much, though. He was still a pretty new director, not super famous. I don&#39;t think he would&#39;ve been very connected to the secrets back then.</p>

The doc also talks about how the symbolism in his movies is all tied together. It touches briefly on Eyes Wide Shut.

This selfish, hypocritical guy is God?&quot; The true evil in my understanding are forces in another dimension called the Archons. I would explain but I would not do it justice. If you are interested, go on yt and watch David Icke&#39;s speech called the History of the Archons. It is two parts but if you watch, you will be blown away. Also, it is amazing the things Icke has figured out that they do not want anyone to know about. The sickos don&#39;t have to do any research, they just get spoon fed piece by piece as they rise up through the ranks.

<p>Even most Christians don&#39;t seem to fully understand the nature of God, but such is to be expected when walking the path of faith and not gnosis. Not to judge one as better or worse than the other, but each has its pitfalls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did some reading this morning.</p>

<p>So if I&#39;m understanding correctly, the God that we WANT to worship is on another plane ABOVE Archons, who cruelly manipulate OUR plane from theirs, because the true transcendent God ousted them as the ultimate beings?</p>

<p>So the Archons are like, Greek mythological beings? And have, at times, sabatoged our direction as humans by pretending to be the &quot;true&quot; God? And this explains the shift in how God behaves towards us from Old Testament to New, because THEY would butt in to act as vengeful, angry God before Jesus tempered their power more and showed us the true way? Would also explain more confusing things in the Bible that come off as inconsistencies in moral lessons. </p>

<p>And since, the Archons have, out of continued spite and jealousy towards us and the true transcendent God, influenced certain humans and directed them on how to make their influence stronger in this world and turn us against the true way to live, with the return being pleasures of the flesh, a fat wallet, great cultural influence, and earthly immortality?</p>

<p>Therefore, the elites have been performing horrid rituals for these Archons, to appease them, and basically acting as their puppets? And the Archons are what we&#39;re taught as the influence of Satan?</p>

<p>Did I get the gist?</p>

<p>It&#39;s really interesting stuff, for sure. I&#39;m open to alternative interpretations of Christianity. Thing is, it&#39;s hard for me to accept interpretations that don&#39;t draw from the Bible. That&#39;s probably a sign that I might be too indoctrinated and not open enough to the truth, but I really, from my soul can&#39;t turn from The Bible itself. Which would be playing into the Archon&#39;s plan if this theory is true. 
I&#39;d need to see something more for me to start believing this, although I admit I&#39;m not sure what that might be. Maybe if the Pope or an Arch-Bishop said something about it (I&#39;m Catholic btw. I know, I know, that hinders the openness of my mind to ideas like this, but I genuinely can&#39;t help it for now). Regardless, this is incredible stuff, thank you for sharing it! </p>

<p>Oh, man, I have. I spent 20+ year of my life as an atheist, and 16+ as a Buddhist, until I realized The Source while in meditation. </p>

<p>I would say its the same with money, the first day you are excited to fly on a private jet, but if you really have the money, you will be doing much more wilder stuff in a year, now if you are decent you wont do anything illegal, but a lot of those billionaires are so disconnected from society that is not hard to imagine the things they would need to get really excited.</p>

In addition, the boyfriend&#39;s mother physically abused her, violently. And the mother knew. Further, they fed both children only hemp seed product as part of a vegan cleansing, ultimately starving the children. Social services were called as a result. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you to a certain extent bud - I&#39;ve been on this sub for ages and this whole thing just feels like a goose chase. </p>

<p>People are wildly overreaching for dark, satanic shit when we have evidence of actual criminal, corrupt, and prosecutable political activity here. I&#39;m sincerely hoping that the FBI takes Trump&#39;s election as a green light to proceed with the Foundation investigation (as I also hope that there is an ideological core of agents in the FBI that are committed to justice)... and while it&#39;d tickle me to find that these people are involved in some sick ritual magic shit while they rot in jail, I feel like it&#39;s a community-created distraction from the bigger, more mundane stories here. </p>

<p>To be clear, I have no doubts that the upper echelons of the elite circles are into some fucked up shit - but we have hard evidence for the lines of inquiry into the CF and not much hard evidence beyond obscure &quot;code language&quot; and the already-known fact that top level people in DC are incredibly interconnected with each other. </p>

<p>Piercing the wall of these elites&#39; bubble of protection will likely unleash all sorts of information and confirm conspiracy theories long-hypothesized for decades... but first we must pierce that bubble... which means we need a single line of attack. Until physical evidence or a more tangible smoking gun comes to light for this satanic shit, it&#39;s just a highly entertaining side trail. </p>

<p>imo Kubrick uses known literature to give pleasant heft and familiarity for his &quot;average&quot; audience. But it also functions as a handy cloak to the real message. Even if his sponsors &quot;found out&quot; that message, they probably accepted the risk for the profits they knew they&#39;d make, and are still making. It can be argued that his ouevre is the most consistently popular of any late 20th c director.</p>

<p>God is hard to explain, it seems clear to me God exists but not in the way Christianity would describe him as a &quot;jealous God&quot; and a God that is physically walking through a garden.</p>

<p>Even most Christians don&#39;t seem to fully understand the nature of God, but such is to be expected when walking the path of faith and not gnosis. Not to judge one as better or worse than the other, but each has its pitfalls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did some reading this morning.</p>

<p>So if I&#39;m understanding correctly, the God that we WANT to worship is on another plane ABOVE Archons, who cruelly manipulate OUR plane from theirs, because the true transcendent God ousted them as the ultimate beings?</p>

<p>So the Archons are like, Greek mythological beings? And have, at times, sabatoged our direction as humans by pretending to be the &quot;true&quot; God? And this explains the shift in how God behaves towards us from Old Testament to New, because THEY would butt in to act as vengeful, angry God before Jesus tempered their power more and showed us the true way? Would also explain more confusing things in the Bible that come off as inconsistencies in moral lessons. </p>

<p>And since, the Archons have, out of continued spite and jealousy towards us and the true transcendent God, influenced certain humans and directed them on how to make their influence stronger in this world and turn us against the true way to live, with the return being pleasures of the flesh, a fat wallet, great cultural influence, and earthly immortality?</p>

<p>Therefore, the elites have been performing horrid rituals for these Archons, to appease them, and basically acting as their puppets? And the Archons are what we&#39;re taught as the influence of Satan?</p>

<p>Did I get the gist?</p>

<p>It&#39;s really interesting stuff, for sure. I&#39;m open to alternative interpretations of Christianity. Thing is, it&#39;s hard for me to accept interpretations that don&#39;t draw from the Bible. That&#39;s probably a sign that I might be too indoctrinated and not open enough to the truth, but I really, from my soul can&#39;t turn from The Bible itself. Which would be playing into the Archon&#39;s plan if this theory is true. 
I&#39;d need to see something more for me to start believing this, although I admit I&#39;m not sure what that might be. Maybe if the Pope or an Arch-Bishop said something about it (I&#39;m Catholic btw. I know, I know, that hinders the openness of my mind to ideas like this, but I genuinely can&#39;t help it for now). Regardless, this is incredible stuff, thank you for sharing it! </p>
