       I’ve been following the Men’s Human Rights Movement since 2011 and it saddens me to say that in spite of all of our campaigning against MGM, it will never be made illegal (at least not in America).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because doing so would open Pandora’s Box.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not about the money made from using the foreskin in cosmetic creams, it’s not even about the Jewish lobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s about the fact that if circumcision is made illegal the medical industry in America will have to admit to these three basic things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Babies were tortured and mutilated, on the basis of false claims about protection from STDs.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Doctors knowingly mutilated unconsenting infants.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         And finally, that they did all of this for profit.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       What impact would this have on the public credibility of doctors?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we started questioning the medical industries lies surrounding male genital mutilation (circumcision), whose to say we won’t question the lies about vaccines, germ theory, or the chemicals they put in our water?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the medical industry acknowledged that they knowingly perpetrated harm against infants for decades, why would anyone take them seriously at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Our best hope for ending this barbaric practice is to convince individual parents of the importance of genital integrity, the medical elite don’t care.

       Oh wow it's very refreshing to see someone else talking about this. I have brought this up to people, and even as a woman bringing it up and pointing out that if the same thing were done to female infants everyone would be horrified, I have never had anyone be receptive to actually thinking about it. I brought it up in a medical program I was in, and the instructor gave me the look of death as she dismissed me in front of everyone and changed the subject. I think it is the most profound example in modern times of how people will be blind to any level of barbarism so long as it is normalized to them in their culture. Like most everyone talks of horrors from other nations in other time periods as though had they been there/then, they would have never accepted what was going on. Then I bring up circumcision and they go full retard.

       thanks. Most medical practitioners simply go through the motions of what they learnt in medical school.

       Your supervisor has probably conducted a few circumcisions, which is why she got upset at you for criticising the practice.

       It is certainly something to behold the polar extreme opposites of human morality and depravity. Sadistic pedophile rings on one hand, and on the other hand parents who are so terrified of the idea that they may have harmed their child that they will not even consider the possibility that circumcision is what it is: genital mutilation. Sometimes it feels like the world is mostly full of highly strategic psychopaths, and good-hearted people who couldn't logic their way out of a paper bag.

       Yes it's sad, I think the main thing perpetuating circumcision is the fact that circumcised men don't want to admit the gravity of what happened to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they get their son circumcised to 'prove' that there's nothing wrong with the practice.

       Yeah I agree that that is another major factor. It is definitely heartbreaking to see men struggling with so much shame they don't deserve. I have seen some online claim that it is necessary because it is hygienic, as though they have bought into the notion that men are too stupid to learn how to take 20 seconds to clean a body part in the shower.

       the worst part (almost as bad as the genital mutilation) is the fact that American doctors often forcible retract the foreskin of babies in their care, which exposes tissue leading to UTIs and other problems.

       That look of death is because they know that they themselves are cowards and they know you are on to something.

       The fact is, male and female genital mutilation come from the same predatory, sadistic, perverted source. It's just that our society is more willing to tolerate the former than the latter.

       I disagree. I think what it will take is a generational change where the majority of men are intact and form a more vocal opposition. That is starting to happen but its going to be a slow process. Certainly there are way more parents who refuse to circumcise after researching it online. Way more young people are now against it. In 20 yrs. Its likely the rate will have dropped to 20% and that's when a push to change the laws can happen. Dont forget that most doctors that push circumcision are circumcised themselves and their demographic will also shift.

       <a href="http://www.mycuriousbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/files/LBoE.pdf">
        From page 105 of this pdf:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They looked at his malehood: Odd was its shape, by a skin was its forepart surrounded.  Unlike that of the Anunnaki malehood it was, a skin from its forepart was hanging!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This implies/shows that Nefilim phalluses did/do NOT have a foreskin, which would account for the practice of circumcision in human males.  It indicates that circumcision may very well have come from the desire (by humans or Annunaki...more likely humans, however) to fashion the human phallus in a manner more closely resembling that of humanity's creator - the Anunnaki.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also from the same page:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Let the Earthling from us Anunnaki by this foreskin be distinguished.  So was Enki saying.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The practice of circumcision is an ancient one designed to align itself with and emulate that of humanity's "godly" ET creators.

       Fuck whoever started doing what? the genetic creation of a species for the purpose of enslaving it? or the uncovering of the information that this has occurred?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean the latter...then...uh...why kill the messenger?  They're only disseminating information they uncovered?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean the former...then yeah...I wouldn't disagree with that.  Fuck whoever started doing that shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, however...um...where it regards the genetic creation or manipulation of a species for the purpose of enslaving it (and worse)...um...this is actually
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what the human species does
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the time.  So the "fuck whoever started going that" statement
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       applies to human beings themselves/ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah.  Fuck whoever started doing
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       ...and that means fuck these other beings for doing it to
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       ...but that also means fuck us for doing it to so many other beings and species as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of a fucked up situation all around.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       involve themselves in genetic manipulation (as, I'll admit, it would seem there really can be many useful applications to doing it), it would seem that being ethical and responsible is a far better way of doing it at least.

       that did that - we ourselves.  I don't know, of course, but my point is that if the information I referenced above is correct, then I wouldn't be surprised if the practice is an extremely ancient one bourn out of an initial desire to emulate the appearance of the beings that created humans in the first place.

       And?  I'd say circumcision can be looked upon within the context of cultural relativism.  It being that doesn't in any way validate things like human sacrifice, child rape, and owning other people/slavery though.

       There's a range, and cultural relativism in NO way should ever be equated with being okay with any of the things you mentioned.  I wasn't even

       Genital cutting
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       acceptable due to cultural relativism.  Absolutely.  The shit's been going on since at
       <em>

       </em>
       the 1800s and likely far earlier.
      </p>

       I'm not saying it's okay one way or the other.  I'm just saying that it's obviously accepted in society.

       No.  Incorrect.  There are certain practices that are pretty ubiquitously frowned upon culturally.  In today's day and age, sacrificing humans can certainly be said to be globally repudiated.  Slavery
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be looked upon as such, but there's still a lot of it going on, unfortunately...but most cultures generally
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       seem to reject it in today's day and age.  And fucking child rape?  Jesus I don't know ANY culture that's okay with regularly doing that shit - although you hear about Satanic cults, etc practicing it quite a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that there are some practices that are bad across the board and across all cultures...and AREN'T "relative" - but there are still many practices that
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       relative, and circumcision is definitely one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumcision in males at birth is obviously far different than circumcision on females at an older age.  The latter seems pretty horrible regardless of what culture you're in.  The former, however, is pretty darn widely practiced still, and I think still constitutes the majority of males in the U.S.

       male circumcision at birth

       No.  You have to understand differences.  Not everything is the same as everything else in life.  That’s simple logic.  Just because using a toenail clipper to cut your nails works and is a good thing, it doesn’t mean that using that same toenail clipper on your skin is good too.

       Different things, different circumstances.

       I’m not saying circumcision is “great!”  I’m just not equating it as being exactly the same thing with literal murder, rape, and slavery, as you are.  Very different things.

       Yeah.  I know.  Not saying there isn’t.  I’m also not saying, as I already mentioned above, that genital cutting is “the best thing evaaaar!”  I’m just saying that you’re wrong in thinking it’s the same thing as the atrocities you mentioned prior.

       Hardly.  That’s like saying a pussy is the same thing as a dick.  Jesus.  They’re analogous to each other, sure, and they START OFF as the same thing in utero, but they are most

      <p>
       Same with circumcision on males and females.  Very different.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the biggest issue with circumcision is more the AGE at which it’s done more than the gender it’s done on.  If done to infants, the trauma is not
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       horrible as it is in older people.

       I 100% agree with the broader questions this raises but as an isolated issue I don't see it as being a huge deal. As you pointed out, it's a cultural norm and I think it'd be probably be more traumatizing to consciously make the decision to be circumcised later on in adult hood.

       If you're conscious about the procedure, you're aware of what's going on. Children being strapped down and having their genitals mutilated have no idea what's going on.

       And?  I'd say circumcision can be looked upon within the context of cultural relativism.  It being that doesn't in any way validate things like human sacrifice, child rape, and owning other people/slavery though.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a range, and cultural relativism in NO way should ever be equated with being okay with any of the things you mentioned.  I wasn't even
       <em>
        thinking
       </em>
       about any of that, much less implying it, in my initial response.
