I never really believed that Trump really wanted to presidency. I thought he was basically playing the republicans while upholding the illusion of democracy. </p>

<p>I now believe that TPTB have recognized the uprising against globalism and the corrupt political establishment and plan to use a Trump victory to dilute the anger. This is sort of a controlled way of neutralizing the growing anger by letting the populous believe they have acheived some form of rebellion against the establishment. </p>

<p>Maybe this view is too conspiratorial. Maybe he health is much worse than we all know. Maybe rigging the election was not possible. What are your thoughts?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The TPTB have their flanked secured and want people to believe every 4-8 years things will change... but they won&#39;t.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s foreign policy will continue the same path as past presidents. Perpetual war will continue, schools will  continue their deterioration of critical thinking, big money/lobbyists/corporations will continue their rape of america with the help of our government, false flags will continue, the MSM will continue to lie and deceive the population and the &quot;Make America great again&quot; slogan will be the same shit as Obama&#39;s &quot;Change we believe in&quot;.</p>

<p>If Trump truly tries to take back the country from the real owners his brains will paint the environment he is situated around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True but there are so many risks to letting someone like him in the white house. It seems like the risk reward perspective of HC vs DT is much more in favor of HC from a globalist perspective. Just letting someone with his views on trade alone is taking major steps back to the globalist agenda. </p>

<p>I think he knows that if he gets out of line he will be killed, will be interesting to see if he has balls like Kennedy did or if he stays in line. He will probably stay in line but there is something they are achieving by having him win that is not readily apparent. It is looking like more divide and conquer through racism is the desired outcome of a Trump presidency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you on the racism angle. This election was absolutely divisive and immediately after he won all the MSM had talking heads saying he won because of racism. They were saying white people voted for him to build a wall and deport Muslims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean it really wasn&#39;t a risk letting Trump into the white house when you figure out the true nature of it all.</p>

<p>Remember when Trump said the Iraq war was a &quot;huge disaster&quot; ?  If Trump truly believed in what he said why would he pick James Woolsey as his senior adviser on national security issues? The same guy who was a huge Iraq war supporter and war hawk?</p>

<p>Deception and confusion is the lifeblood of those in power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre right from a policy perspective but you are underestimating the growing awakening that letting someone with his views into the white house would cause. He got elected by straight bashing 20 + years of globalist policy and work. There are definitely real risks to letting a voice like that have the white house, even if he is going to stay in line and follow the agenda.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hopefully Trump will backfire on the NWO but I seriously doubt it. His VP choice sends a clear message that he is going to stay in line. Now if he picked someone like Rand Paul he might have been a real risk to TPTB.</p>

<p>EDIT: I see what you mean by him always question the authoritative narrative but that just sets him up to the people that he is somehow different. It&#39;s a con game and it&#39;s a long one in the making.</p>

<p>EDIT2: You will never see him question the story of 9/11 again. (I hope I&#39;m fucking dead wrong on this)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This point was already discussed. Of course he is going to stick to the agenda and not get out of line, he knows he would be killed if he got too crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can think of a few scenarios which may have led to Trump winning.</p>

<p>The one that it seems many trump supporters want to believe is that Clinton did everything possible to win the election, but it just wasn&#39;t enough. Their grassroots campaigning and tirelessly promoting the truth about Hillary overwhelmed whatever fix was in place. This may be true.</p>

<p>However, my opinion is that, if the elections are rigged or not, it does not matter who holds the presidency. The elite, the corporations and the money that controls this country stays the same. They may have preferred Clinton, they may have preferred Trump, either way they will continue to chart the course of this country to fit their desires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right that they pivoted form HRC to Trump after seeing how much support he garnered. I&#39;ve been wondering though, why did the MSM not do more to suppress wiki leaks and the other damning information about HRC. They usually just flat out ignore anything that doesn&#39;t fit the narrative they are weaving. Any thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wiki leaks has become too mainstream to ignore. Not mentioning it at all would be worse, it would give it even more legitimacy. Wiki leaks has transcended conspiracy culture because of the hatred of Clinton being so mainstream, and her outrageous actions in the primary. This let the cat out of the bag and may have been the breaking point for the first point you made above. </p>

<p>Having said that though they definitely did not report the killings of the DNC staffers or the leaks like they should have, but the MSM would not do this for obvious reasons...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know though, they ignore the 9/11 truth movement and they say that more than half of the country believes we&#39;ve been lied to.</p>

<p>What I am wondering, just wondering, is if maybe it was all intentional. Maybe it was all planned from the moment he entered the primary. The whole trump is a plant theory, but instead of him being someone Hillary could believably beat, it was the other way around. Trump was the choice and Hillary was there to take a dive. In that scenario, wiki leaks, the Clinton cash stuff, the dnc controversy, all of it was allowed in order to make the country accept or even support a terrible candidate for president. All on the back of the idea that he is anti establishment just because he is not a career politician. </p>
