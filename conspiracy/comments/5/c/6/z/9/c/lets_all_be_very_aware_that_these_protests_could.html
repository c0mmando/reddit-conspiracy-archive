It should be about some of the things that Trump at least claimed to represent, like challenging the establishment, globalist bankers and so on.

<p>It&#39;s a very bad thing. Just the petrodollar alone makes it bad.  They force countries to use the dollar to buy oil, they do that by force and war (see Iraq and the axis of evil).  If they can&#39;t force people to use the dollar to buy energy, nobody wants it and then they can&#39;t run a deficit.  So if you like defects you better love war.</p>

The media has been their lapdog for years and they&#39;ve whipped up people in such a frenzy against Trump that this is the inevitable result, and if that results in violence we will be forced to reply in kind.

<p>It&#39;s like how bankers fund both sides of the war knowing the profit comes in the aftermath. </p>

<p>The American people generally want the same thing. They&#39;re not the enemy.</p>

<p>I was really hoping right-leaning Americans would realize this, but now those at <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> are becoming filled with sanctimonious victimization that they claim they despise from the left. </p>

<p>The sanctimonious victimization</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but you&#39;re completely out of touch. There&#39;s victimization alright, but if you think for one moment it&#39;s the liberal kind of donate to my patreon i was totally assaulted by gamergators and all whites kill blacks all the time victimization you can&#39;t be more wrong.</p>

<p>Donald Trump faces a very real threat of assassination right now purely due to the extreme media slander he has been put through. This does not compare to anything the right is now doing.</p>

<p>Of course the puppetmasters play both sides. I&#39;m convinced the Bush administration and the Clinton administration was more or less the same administration, but I have very little belief that Trump is the same.</p>

<p>Now that I again take a look at the_donald, this &quot;victimization&quot; is less oh look at us poor us boo hoo we&#39;re being oppressed by whitey, and more of a look at who are the real violent assholes, and gloating.</p>

<p>This is followed by a war against China and Russia which will end America and cost the life of 30 million Americans to bring forth the new world order.</p>

<p>The Left have lost, and now they are throwing a tantrum.  They also haven&#39;t lost this badly or fundamentally for a long time.  They&#39;ve ruled the roost since 2008; nearly ten years.

<p>It&#39;s a very bad thing. Just the petrodollar alone makes it bad.  They force countries to use the dollar to buy oil, they do that by force and war (see Iraq and the axis of evil).  If they can&#39;t force people to use the dollar to buy energy, nobody wants it and then they can&#39;t run a deficit.  So if you like defects you better love war.</p>
