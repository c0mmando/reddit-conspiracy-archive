<p>But <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> has been paying attention for a long time.</p>

<p>As circumstances would have it, we&#39;re currently being fed info on the Democratic party. But do not be confused! The crimes being uncovered are not exclusive to those crooks. Do not mistake criticism of Clinton and the Dems for support for Trump and the Republicans. </p>

<p>In fact, those who have done their research know that horrible deeds are an unfortunate reality across the ruling/elite class. Trump is not exempt from that label. </p>

<p>Keep digging. Keep informing. This is an opportunity and we can&#39;t let people derail this into a political argument.</p>

I totally understand why people think he is a threat but under that outer layer his core intention I am convinced is true and he is running against the globalists who are on both sides of the parties. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s global perception isn&#39;t very favorable, but it&#39;s because of superficial reasons (also for reasons of exposure to our media). I may very well have to tell others why his foreign policy stances are significantly better than Clinton&#39;s, but we&#39;ll see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, this is a trump sub now. it&#39;s all just spillover from the donald and politics. if this were a TRUE conspiracy sub (which it used to be), you&#39;d be finding the holes in his story, in his shady business practices, his rapey sex scandals, and the fact that he&#39;s ripped off small businesses he&#39;s hired to build his lavish empire made of lies.</p>

<p>don&#39;t get me wrong, y&#39;all are spot on with hillary here. she&#39;s a career corrupt politician with a closet full of skeletons, but you guys are not being fair and balanced. you&#39;re the fox news of conspiracy subs.</p>

<p>downvote me if you will, but i&#39;m not wrong. this is the essence of donald trump. he divides everything he touches. and i know you&#39;ll come back with &#39;BUT LOOK WHAT HE DID, HE UNITED THE CONSPIRACY SUB&#39;, but everyone who&#39;ll say that is a trumpet.</p>

<p>see the evil in both sides. trump is not your savior. he&#39;s a fraud and you&#39;ll all soon see. they were both the wrong candidates, and the moment you all uncover his bullshit, he&#39;d try and shut you down in a second. he&#39;s already hinted at &#39;shutting down the internet&#39;, as laughable as that is.</p>

<p>the elite class IS terrible, but he&#39;s just another cog in that machine. he&#39;s a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing. you&#39;ll see in time. but enjoy your victory for now. i know you&#39;re all excited, and i&#39;m happy for you. but this guy is toxic and you&#39;ll see soon.</p>

<p>The way the government is run is the anti-Christ, which is very different from disliking government itself.</p>

<p>The Constitution is one of the most beautiful documents to be produced in the history of mankind. I say that without an ounce of hyperbole. A government that adheres to its tenants is a noble one.</p>

<p>As to being anti-regulation, I&#39;d say that&#39;s not true. I personally would love greater regulation when it comes to the environment. More emissions standards, holding automobile companies to a higher standard, making fracking so expensive that it&#39;s not worth it, subsidizing clean energy... but right now, such regulations exist to enrich the energy companies. The carbon credit regulation is as dangerous and absurd a scheme as banning rain water harvesting or letting giant companies take all of the fresh water rights from cities. Let&#39;s make GMO labeling laws. </p>

<p>I could go on. Regulations are useful.</p>

<p>I think this is correct and incorrect at the same time. Wikileaks emails show the camp <em>did</em> want to elevate Trump under the assumption he&#39;d be easier to take down. It&#39;s why we saw about two weeks where the media was promoting him as a force to be reckoned with--totally manufactured. </p>

<p>But it didn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>Also don&#39;t forget that the RNC tried to disown him, too. When the bogus &quot;grab her by the pussy&quot; thing happened and R&#39;s started dropping their support, the Bush family endorsed Clinton... all of those things made me see that he really is an anti-establishment candidate.</p>

<p>Now we just have to see if he&#39;s not a sell-out president. </p>

<p>Subscribers here know that Jewish people are not the same as Zionists. One is a religion and the other is an ideology. Sort of like how not all Democrats are globalists, and not all Republicans are neocons. </p>

<p>We are very, very careful with that language for the sole reason that other subs try to discredit us under the guise that we&#39;re anti-Semitic yokels. Unlike 4chan, where they don&#39;t really give a fuck what others think and prefer people to leave them alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, that&#39;s admirable. I came here expecting the worst. Nice sub but it&#39;s far too politically one-sided against Democrats. I can bet you there&#39;s a lot of bad shit that goes on with the RNC but they were just lucky they weren&#39;t hacked and since the Democrats have been the establishment of the last 8 years, I&#39;m curious how this sub will play out because it seems to love being critical of the establishment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre right about the Dems being in the establishment as a factor in the sub&#39;s current slant. But I think it&#39;s, by and large, apolitical because frankly most people here dont see them as any different. </p>

<p>Another reason is the media heavily echos the dems&#39; narrative, which is the establishment narrative, to which this place becomes an automatic counter-balance, as is the bature of the sub.</p>

<p>To cap it off, HRC became Dems nominee. With her past, the media collusion, astroturfing online, wikileaks, it was just a perfect culmination of factors that produced a heavy anti-dems slant. Trumps dirty laundry was out there anyway.</p>

<p>When the Bush Administration was in power we were too politically aligned against Republicans. I think what you are seeing here is because the vast majority of the MSM has been pro Clinton for the past year. As you most likely are aware, the MSM is pushing a narrative and an establishment agenda. So, the natural instinct here is to completely tear that down. </p>

<p>This is it entirely. You&#39;ll find criticism of all presidents here, and Bush still gets it especially hard here--deservedly so--with 9/11 and all the shady fuckery he, Rumsfeld and Cheney pulled. If you stick around, you&#39;ll see.</p>

Stock market did not tank.  A billionaire now heads a Republican controlled government.  The GOP is known to be very friendly to wall street.  What do you think has happened?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll believe it when I see term limits pass in a gov&#39;t that should easily be able to pass them.</p>
