    <div class="md"><p>I asked for a ban appeal from r/politics a few hours ago now that the election is over.  You would swear a top mod had an aneurysm.</p>

<p>I was perm banned from r/politics for  expressing meta concerns in different subreddits about paid astroturf in r/politics and shedding light about r/politics mod actions.   The ban justification:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Linking to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> with the intent to start metadrama and/or vote brigade.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear that the top mods there have been compromised. </p>

<p>r/conspiracy has a lot of subscribers, but it does not have mainstream appeal (maybe it can be changed?).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, what you&#39;re going to need is to create a subreddit with moderators that respect free speech above all other things. It can be any name, of any subject(s), really.</p>

<p>Just like culture, our forums are backwards. Most people believe good rules and moderators make good forums. Well, freedom to talk makes good forums.</p>

<p>Look at even r/conspiracy, one of the &quot;better&quot; subreddits. They have 12 rules, 5 of which consist of paragraphs, most of which are open to interpretation. They&#39;ve effectively weeded out a lot of good users in the interest in these rules, but some bad moderation remains. I&#39;d rather have bad users than bad mods.</p>

<p>I think the only function of a mod should be dealing with threats to users, doxxing, spam, and state-sponsored propaganda.</p>

<p>If /wayofthebern got on r/all multiple times, then it probably wasn&#39;t covering anything very controversial or informative. That was the criteria of censorship. And whether or not small subs can gain traction, eventually irresponsible moderation will render it into a state of r/politics.</p>

<p>It&#39;s information and expression that is censored. The mods here have done some good things, but they&#39;ve also done &#39;bad&#39; things for every good thing. It could be so much better. Instead of punishing in interest of arbitrary rules, they should have fewer rules. Half of them don&#39;t even need to exist.</p>

<p>Yes, I understand. However, the reason I was banned, I believe, was motivated by a political comment I made. Downvote, certainly. Temporary ban, perhaps. Warning, sure. I was instantly and totally perma-banned. I believe it was disproportionate. That is why I am asking to have this reconsidered.</p>

<p>Can I ask for a reason? I have never been given a good reason why I was perma-banned. Every time someone states it for the record, it is different than last person.</p>

<p>So... I made one comment, and I was instantly perma-banned with no warning? Do you do that to Hillary supporters equally, or just Donald supporters? (For the record, I am a Bernie supporter.)</p>

<p>Political affiliation has nothing to do with the decision to ban a brigade participant.</p>

<p>Okay, I can accept that. Thank you for your honest answer. As long as everyone is treated equally, I have no complaint.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m Australian and care not for US politics, however at <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> we do take brigading and shitposting seriously. This is not school or a workplace, we are under no obligation to give warnings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope CTR reflects on itself and what it helped create. Their social media manipulation tactics backfired. They created this. </p>

<p>CTR were one of the larger reasons why Democrats left their own party in the Rust Belt. These were people who voted for Obama and not racist. What they wanted, what they rejected, was politics as usual. They wanted an outsider. They wanted Bernie Sanders. They wanted someone who was not going to make backroom deals with Goldman Sachs, Health Insurance companies and energy companies that make those companies richer to the detriment of the american people. </p>

<p>The only person who could have beaten and outsider Republican in the election was an outsider Democrat. </p>

<p>CTR, this election was a massive rejection of the manipulation you employed on behalf of the party who cared more about their own enrichment and oligharcal corporate deals via Clinton Foundation and corruption. The only thing you accomplished was solidifiying our rejection of manipulation of a corrupt patry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, does anyone think it&#39;s possible that the RNC had their own version of CTR and infiltrated places like <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>?</p>

<p>Trump might have started out as an outsider, but what if once the RNC realised that he was going to the be the nominee they secretly rallied around him and started their own guerilla social media campaign first, publicly pretending to reject him, and at the same time stoking the circlejerk in <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>?    </p>

<p>Everyone could see that the more the establishment repuclicans spoke out against him, the more people rallied around Trump.  What if the whole thing was a ruse and all of the millenials that proudly shouted MAGA from the mountaintops and posted dank memes for the past 10 months fell for it hook, line and sinker?  </p>

<p>Already, he&#39;s only been president elect for 2 days and he&#39;s getting the old gang back together (Gingrich, Palin, Christie).  For someone who is supposed to #draintheswamp he&#39;s just draining it from the left and filling it back up from the right with the same kind of establishment insiders and toxic psychopaths that have been in politics for decades.  Most of the 18-30 year olds we saw around here supporting trump weren&#39;t alive when Gingrich was House leader and most were too young to care about politics in 2008.  I feel like this group is going to be in for a rude awakening in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that Clinton would have been better in any way, or that her tactics this election should have been rewarded but anyone who is poor or underemployed that voted for Trump and is expecting their lives to significantly improve over the next 4 years is going to be severely disappointed when people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are still the ones drafting legislation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe but the difference is when you go to /the_donald you expect it to be pro Trump.  At least I did.
When you go to r/politics, you expect it to have both sides of the story. There is a different expectation for what is going to be posted and how it is going to be regulated. For the mods of r/politics to be choosing one side is improper.</p>

<p>That being said, bots are not acceptable anywhere though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed on your points about <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  </p>

<p>Whatever bots were being used kept most of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> littered with <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> posts, effectively making it a default sub for the past year.</p>

<p>I would think that the reddit admins had to have some idea that it was happening and they just sat back and let the &quot;the front page of the internet&quot; basically get hacked by a bunch of 4chan anons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think all realities are correct on this one. </p>

<p>4chan&#39;s creation of <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> (and they largely should be credited with its inception) arose from a desire to call out the spectacle of politics in all its absurdity. </p>

<p>Because they saw the Dems putting forth a shit candidate trying to be passed off as gold, they in turn thought it would be hilarious to put forth their own shit candidate and pass it off with the same legitimacy and seriousness (knowing full well he too was a sham candidate). Because chaos and 4chan are synonyms, <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> took on a life of its own. People started believing in the hype, and the Republicans probably cashed in on it from behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Have you watched the mockumentary, Exit Through the Gift Shop? If not you should, because Banksy is 4Chan and Mr. Brainwash is Trump. The young Trump supporters lapped up his message in much the same way as the art scene responded to the grandiosity of Trump. All the while, Banksy&#39;s wondering what monster he created and wondering how this is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn&#39;t thought about bots other than the AutoMod Train and Coat bots.</p>

<p>That makes sense since it seems like 4chan was behind a lot of what showed up on there.   I feel like this was another one of their ops and there are a bunch of long time anons (lots of them probably not even American citizens) laughing their asses off.  They have already successfully rigged and brigaded lots of online votes in the past and they wanted to see if they could successfully brigade and election and it appears they succeeded, at least with a large percentage of redditors.  They essentially made Trump &quot;go viral&quot;.</p>

Indeed, the end of this round of elections may have ended the most overt corruption, but it doesn&#39;t reset all the shady things that went on, that may resurface in the future.

    <div class="md"><p>TLDR:  People allow dictatorships because of ignorance, laziness, and apathy...criminals grow a dictatorship because it empowers their pathology.</p>

<p>IMHO, it is because <em>most</em> americans are unwilling to take the responsibility of being any more empowered and responsible for their own governance than is absolutely, rock-bottom necessary.  Most people would rather hand over the keys to the kingdom in order to dodge the responsibility and effort that real freedom requires, to gain a bit of perceived convenience.  They&#39;d rather close their eyes and ears, naively and without question believe what is fed to them, and let someone do it for them.  Worse case is their trust is abused, and they can suddenly self-righteously they were a victim, and be able to blame those they handed the keys to...again dodging their own responsibility.  It takes a lot of education and that&#39;s a lot of work, as well.  Granted there are some who are too disadvantaged to create the time (working multiple jobs just to keep the family from sleeping under a bridge) to ensure they do their part, or not gifted sufficiently with what is deemed as normal intellect.  These people need the extra assistance and care.</p>

<p>A dictatorship style of government also makes it easier for some to abuse others, as it can afford them greater proportion of power and wealth.  If being dominant over others is of primary importance to you rather that equality and harmony, then a true democracy won&#39;t empower the former goal.  If you happen to be a psycho/sociopath that aims to exercise your abusive tendencies and inclinations to claw your way to the top of what ever pile you have your sights set on, which would you chose?...a fully free democracy...or something more empowering and predatory, such as dictatorship...or oligarchy, corporatacracy, corporatism, fascism, etc...  Predatory governments happen because the people end up or are put in a situation where they won&#39;t/can&#39;t bother with the responsibility being more personally responsible themselves...and because predators (people, governments as a whole) need it that way for their own diseased needs and pathologies.  Corrupt politicians need a corruptible government that will cater to their goal.  IMHO, we have both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be the Trump voters. Please consider the biggest untold story of this election, true of all the national elections beginning with 2010.  The removal of voters from the registration lists, voter ID requirements, fewer polling places and shorter voting times in the red states.  And all the media supports those actions by each election prattling on about, voters from this group or that just not turning out.  </p>
