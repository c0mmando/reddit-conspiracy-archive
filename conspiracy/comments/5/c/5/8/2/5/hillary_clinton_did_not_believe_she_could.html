       It's possible, bit I think there was probably more going on behind the scenes. I'm just glad I didn't have to be around her last night.
      </p>
      <p>
       But whatever the reason was for not making a speech, it was a total slap in the face to her supporters. They stayed around all night for her, and then she just sends out Podesta to tell them to go home. It says a lot about her character

       It was obvious they were 'looking' for votes in the dense blue counties.
      </p>
      <p>
       They knew perfectly well it was going to be concluded that night, no matter how hard the media tried not to call states. Just tell everyone they would finish up and party in the morning then you don't have to face them when the obvious happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took Fox 15 minutes to find a clip of Hillary saying what she would do if she lost. The didn't even have it ready to go. Thankfully Politico and I think Reuters forced the media's hand by calling Wisconsin and declaring Trump the winner. Drudge had called Trump an hour earlier. Drudge had also called the trifecta of OH, NC &amp; FL and hour before the media.
Thanks talking heads...for the last 1 1/2 years you lied and manipulated the news, dragging the election out to 1:48am didn't help what I think of you.

       Does anyone else find it weird that they tell everyone to go to bed when its a certain trump victory, talking about how "Every vote deserves to be counted". Then when everybody wakes up the popular vote swung into Clinton's favor?

       The electoral college is based on the number of congressional seats. So if there's a discrepancy it means that Congress is out of balance in distribution.

       not necessarily true, I think it's just because she got over 60% of California but in other states with significant electoral votes Trump won by slim margins

       Yeah.  There is a "cut off" when using the electoral college.  Once you hit 50% and get the electoral votes it's no different than 100%. But that's on purpose.  It's like saying to California " I get it, you like Hillary, now let the other states say what they want" it's a compromise between voting the total mass of the people and the will of each state individually. One way to do this was to give each of the 50 states and individual vote, but the problem is the states are so different in size they had to do something to account for the population. But voting strictly by population isn't fair to the smaller States either.  it's not just about the will of the people it's also the will of the states.

       Proportional representation is the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have each state be assigned electoral college votes based on most resent census results. Then, electoral college votes are divided by proportional representation of the votes in each state.

       When they were setting up the United States they were concerned about whether it should be 1 state 1 vote or popular vote. And it went back and forth. The compromise was to have the electoral college with Representatives proportional to the population.

       uh NOOOOO.  What they were concerned about was retaining some power in landed gentry's hands.  They were willing to be democratic, but with limits.  In other words, like today's elites, they did want to concentrate power in the hands of the wealthy. Census recording black men as 2/3 the value of a white man, for example.  The electoral college was set up to include one representative from each congressional district and 1 for each senator.  In that way, the owner of a plantation that occupied a large swathe of a congressional district was more heavily influential than the many poor people in an equally sized district.
      </p>
      <p>
       But having one vote per person in NO way discriminates against small states.

       Thanks, that was a great read!  But i think it makes my point for me.  In those days, regional partisanship was a big deal.  Which state you were from might determine who you would vote for.  So Texans would always favor Texans for example, (which might be true today, but doubtful ---- imagine a Hightower candidacy!) and that could cause a steady stream of Texan presidents.  Holy crap, i get the fear!  But now?  We are able to read beyond purely local concerns.  Most voters had an opinion on the TPP for example.  But the ecology of the Rio Grande river, a strong Texas issue, didn't figure into the presidential issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really do not see any disadvantage any more in having one vote one person.  Even though, god forbid, it might have resulted in a Hillary presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       What i am hoping is that the Democratic party as we knew it is dead.   Dead, dead, dead.  They had, for all intents and purposes become Right-wing, corporatist republicans.  No offense to Republicans.  Hillary started running for president 30 years ago, and never acknowledged a changing world.  She thought, "ok, to be president i just have to present an image of perfection and raise more money than anybody else".  But woops.  Along came social media and she never caught up to the fact that the guy with the most money does NOT necessarily win any more.  Trump spent less than 1/3 what she spent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and lastly --- Trump was the only candidate besides Bernie, who had a record of independent voting.  THAT should be a lesson for the 2-party system.  The establishment protocols don't work anymore.....

       What really needs to change is the 2 party system, which isn't even a formal part of our government.  We still have to pay attention to the states though.  When the day comes where the entire map is red or blue maybe there will be an argument. I mean by this that it could still be 49/51 but all the states come to the same conclusion.  But the political preferences still follow state boundaries. It is amazing how there exists a blue state surrounded by red states. Or vice versa. It seems that if we are all exposed to the same information sources it wouldn't matter which corner of the country you happen to live in. We do seem to be getting close, but with the coasts solidly voting one way and the heartland another we still should  recognize those boundaries.

       That was not hometown pride in Hillary's hailing from Park Ridge (an old money suburb of Chicago).  That was machine politics, totally intact and functioning the way it always has.  Rahm Emanuel saw to it they she got IL, by delivering Chicago, just like the first Daley and JFK.

       He appears to be talking about the 20% of all Florida ballots being "counted" completely unmonitored, and the stacks upon stacks of fake completed ballots being found across the country.

       Electoral colleges should not be dismantled.  They should be proportional in the states.

       well, no, I don't really find that odd. I was one who didn't go to sleep and watched the votes until they stopped being updated. Clinton (blue) won a lot of state capitals, California and New york by a 2:1 margin or better, and that constituted a LOT of the popular vote, which is why we have the electoral college. Otherwise California, NY and Florida would decide every election and the rest of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton won most of the east coast, west coast and a lot of the close-by state capitals, along with Colorado. It was mostly the overwhelming interior, working-class americans who are the backbone of the country who voted Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election was decided before California and Washington even got to counting. Those were also the low information voters who thought Trump's son was hunting dinosaurs and thought they should be punished for hunting the endangered reptiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I did notice in real time (and found odd) is that in Michigan, Ohio and especially Florida, the vote counts froze at around 91%. I imagine this was done to see if they could give Clinton the numbers she needed to win before giving up the state. I still think election rigging was taking place, even that late.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think these results are exactly honest, but I think the real winner won due to overwhelming voting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think most of Trump's votes were less pro-Trump and more anti-Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Florida and Ohio saved the country, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most populated areas of the country are staunchly blue, beyond reason or sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The efforts of CTR, MSM, and social media was closer than you think to handing this corrupt democrat the presidency, and that should make your blood go cold for a moment. Hillary was probably the worst candidate to ever run for office, and ~47% of the country voted for her, anyway, despite the overwhelming corruption (unlike anything we've ever seen in our combined history) and death that surrounded her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bev Harris is an election fraud researcher who claimed to find the algorithms used to push votes for Hillary and who is currently appealing to regions to allow us to count the votes honestly to see if and where election fraud was happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, several areas are refusing to share the ballots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think election rigging was presumed. I also think the fix was in and Clinton knew it and supposed the iron grip she had on mainstream media and newspapers/tabloids in these liberal trendy areas would be enough to secure her the vote. When you look at the county map of the U.S., you can see the democratic game plan and it's pretty obvious: they targeted all the populated regions. This is where Clinton's hubris came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was never going to win an honest election against anyone. She couldn't even win a dishonest election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope the Clinton supporters she DID have spend the next 4 years educating themselves and waking up.

       Its all speculation about the fix, but I absolutely agree with you. The only way she was defeated was through sheer numbers that overwhelmed the fix. I can't comprehend anyone still defending her as the better choice. The whole Saudi Arabian arms deal knowing that government funds ISIS! And so much more.

       Which is why, i think, Obama said his meeting with Trump was excellent.  He hates the Clintons and this has worked out brilliantly for him.  Except of course that Hillary blames him for the loss and try to have him suicided.

       I think she did not dream she would lose and that she collapsed and had an emotional breakdown, too distraught and ill to give her concession speech. I saw a video that was filmed the night before the election. She was being held up and assisted in walking and was unsteady on her feet, going from her plane to limo. She was wearing the red outfit that day while speaking in MI. 
It would explain too why she was scheduled to give it mid-morning but didn't do it until afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was traveling so only heard her speech on the radio. I'm curious if the media speculated why she took so long or gave her a pass.

       okay but like who cares? I'm probably going to get shit for this but like of course she thought she would win! She was the democratic nominee! For gods sakes she had Beyonce playing at her rallies and shit. I thought she would win and so did almost half of American's. So why bash her for not preparing for her loss? It's over and done with, let the poor old women live her life. She lost the god damn race twice. As if that's not embarrassing enough..

       Considering how blatantly her campaign came out against the possibility of Trump doing the same thing, it's a tad hypocritical. It's also part of the American presidential process for her to have given one once the race was decided, not at her convenience. For as much as she ridiculed Trump supporters, it's every bit their right for them to ridicule her to some extent for pulling a move like that.
