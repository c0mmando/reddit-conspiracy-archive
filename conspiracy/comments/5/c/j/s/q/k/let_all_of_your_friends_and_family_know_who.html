       Yep, even tho Russia and China wants a stable relationship with the US i dont think they are happy with the propaganda against them. I think they wish US would burn and could potentially attack US if they see its people and government as weak and in poor shape.

       Realistically, we have to come to grips that there is propaganda flowing both directions. At least in their case they have a tighter grip of control over the flow of information. The USA can track it, but there is a lot of red tape in the way of taking action to keep propaganda out of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if Russia is fueling a lot of the "GET OUT INTO THE STREETS!" type of propaganda. A US revolution is exactly what our enemies want. The US and other countries have deployed the tactic in other countries. And now the barrel of the gun is aimed at us.

       Very true, but looking and reading alot of Putin statements is that hes very very tired of how Nato/US are putting up their anti-missiles in europe pointed towards them.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bbc journalist asked him why he was so aggressive in the air-space towards other nations like Sweden and Norway and he was laughing his balls off and replied "How would the US feel if i made a deal with Mexico, Cuba, Canada to put anti missiles towards the US ? How can you say we are the aggressors because we train our pilots ? Russia just want a stable relationship because it will benefit both countries but we want to have our national interests included too." 
I doesnt feel he want to be unfriendly with you. If i were him i would be really pissed how you (US/Nato) treat Russia and i would definetly exploit the US if you get chaos in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ofc thats just how i see it. And the more China-Russia-India's relationship gets stronger i would say Americans really need to worry about the fact you are in decline as world power.

       And im Swede btw, talking too Russians from time to time and they dont really have that much propaganda against you, they just feel very mistreated for being displayed as the aggressor.

       The propaganda in that case would be that their media says they get mistreated and are never included in deals.

       As a more moderate liberal I'm uninformed about Soros. It is shocking to hear some on this thread calling for execution. You all reaffirm a narrative that, like Hitler, Trump is a specially dangerous charismatic leader. I will not at this time hold Trump accountable for your actions. I'm fulfilling my duty to remain bipartisan, you do the same and clean it up tea-tards.

       bonerknocker, please try to look into the history Soros has when you have time. Everyone climbing the the ladder of power has left some amount of residue on its rungs, and Soros has been on this thing for a long, long time.

       If he is tried and convicted for treason, as in advocating/funding violent overthrow of US government, he would be eligible for the gallows. Sorry to shock, maybe you need a safe space to recover, bonerknocker.

       Recover from what? Are you retarded? A bunch of liberals protesting in Portland constitutes as a violent over throw of US government? Post something helpful or nothing at all please. I am admitting a fair bit of ignorance of what you all claim soros is guilty of, rather than taking an opportunity to educate you just slander.

       " It is shocking to hear some on this thread calling for execution." Recover from being shocked, your term. In the right circumstance Soros funding riots has overthrown Governments ie Egypt 2011, Ukraine. First liberals peacefully demonstrate, paid agitators riot, then police shoot them then much more people riot and soldiers shoot them. A circle of action reaction resulting in revoultion.  Sometimes.

       To be clear, the US has not executed anyone for simply advocating violent overthrow of Government unless people died as a result of the advocacy. Prison yes but death penalty unlikely.

       It's funny that you bring up Hitler, because Soros worked with the fascists in Hungary to take the possessions of wealthy Hungarian Jews who were being sent off to concentration camps.
