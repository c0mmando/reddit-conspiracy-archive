       Nah, the point is to discredit the public establishment.  When people are convinced the media and the democratic process are corrupt, and even more when they actually are corrupt, it weakens the ability of public forces to challenge the private establishment.  Without institution powerful enough to inform and act upon the public will, the public will doesn't need to be respected.

       You could trace common heritage to most English people in the US. I'm not saying there is no link, but a link such as this is no smoking gun for what you are saying. Just saying. I have a very interesting family tree (Slavic nobility - royalty), doesn't mean I have anything to do with them, today..

       They weren't, that I know of.. That being said, go down your family tree deep enough, I'm sure you'll find the practice there. Whether cannibalism, or human sacrifice. It's prevalent in all cultures, in ages long gone (good thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       Side note, you're a vegetarian? Yuck... I couldn't live without Deer meat or steak, also turkey and chickens.  Yum.. Rabbits are pretty good too.. And don't even get me started on bacon...

       This is what I've been struggling with. It's easy to think that this is all some big conspiracy, but then you see how badly each successive leader meshes with the one before him. It leads me to believe Brock Obama had uniquely different handlers then George Bush did.
