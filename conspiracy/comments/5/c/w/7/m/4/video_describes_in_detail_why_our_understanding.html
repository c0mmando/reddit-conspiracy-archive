       This isn't the easiest to grasp at first, but there are countless documents all over the web which cover this topic. So don't give up! This is serious matrix-level awakening shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=ZDLozqBiadQ">
        This video

       is your first step to understanding. It isn't polished, but it is comprehensive. Watch it and take some notes. Perhaps look up and confirm points raised, or even better, research questions that you might have on your own while watching.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had read about a related topic a few years ago...that of the mysterious "Three City States" in the world (a topic some of you I'm sure are already familiar). While that topic is significant, unless you understand why and under what circumstances Washington DC is
       <strong>
        one of these "city-States"
       </strong>
       , then the rest of it sounds esoteric and confusion can lead to disinterest (as it did to me).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this information is not taught by any school, it must be sought. As for me, I became interested again in this topic very recently when someone in this sub posted an article about the "Missing Thirteenth Amendment." I read that article with interest, but not much  else. By complete chance, while reading the article, I decided to research some questions I had about it.  It soon became apparent that instead of this "Missing Thirteenth Amendment" being merely a curious footnote to U.S. history, it turns out it's a small component of something infinitely bigger and much more significant to all of us today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have already cut this post in half as I did not want my wordy ramble to discourage anyone from continuing...so I will not go into any more details. However, I am an attorney, and this is foundational to the definition of you, me, this country, and how it functions. When it comes to corruption and "following the money", it is more relevant today; nothing is comparable in scope.
       <strong>
        [
       </strong>
       In fact, in connection with another recent post where someone wondered about "the talk", or what big secret every new President is told upon inauguration,
       <strong>
        I have easily concluded that this is the secret...
       </strong>
       It's the only thing bigger than Kennedy, Watergate, and 9/11 in its significance, it's suppression, and duration of accumulated repercussions combined.

       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>
       Decided to add some helpful related supporting documents which provided a bit of a foundation for me. These aren't rudimentary topics like Jekyll Island, etc., but more along the lines of suppressed history.

          14th Amendment

          essay
         </a>
         on the Fourteenth Amendment. You might need to read it slowly.  I certainly had to since this was not how 14th Amendment due process was taught to me when I was in law school...further this

          essay
         </a>
         discusses a big complaint highlighted in the first essay: that you cannot have an amendment without the necessary bit of the Senate; you see, at one time, House reps were elected by popular vote, and Senators (at 2 per state) were appointed by state legislatures...this put the importance on "Statehood" and state into the U.S., and a key part of what gave it it's "republic flavor". The seventeenth amendment changed all this. It's provisions superseding Article I, §3, Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution. It took several attempts to ratify this amendment and reasons given by its proponents, such as "gridlock at the State level" and "corruption", were later unfounded. It's another fascinating later chapter of the metamorphosis of our government from a republic to a majority -owned by the corporations.¿

         document isn't bad, but it contains some errors, and it tries to add an unneeded a "conspiracy sounding" sensationalism in bringing up the mysterious three City-States. Again while these City-States are not insignificant,

          don't worry about them until you understand why the events took place in the U.S. That led to the Act of 1871.

       As much as I can relate to the sentiment of being forced to work = slavery, it's not that simple. For all of human history, people have had to work to sustain themselves. Now we work more than our ancestors did, but we also have many more material goods to show for it. I'm not saying it's fair and it's certainly not an ideal system but slavery is not the best description for where we are as a species.

       What blew me away is that this video, (plus other docs), basically say that the North and The South had their differences aggravated by Britain and France (both of whom were already usurped completely by banks. The banks had plans to loan to the North through Britain, and The South through Germany. Instead Russia (who herself was fighting to keep the bank's out of their country) told Germany that if she lent money to the South, it would be seen as an Act of War...do therefore the South remained poor and underfunded. Lincoln had almost gotten through the war using only greenbacks, but by 1864, he was forced to borrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't understand how all of  Congress could knowingly let this happen after Lincoln was killed (leading to the DC organic Act of 1871). And what really is extraordinary is that I was taught through high school in the late 1980s that Andrew Johnson was the
       <em>
        worst
       </em>
       President, when he, similar to Andrew Jackson before him, was actually
       <em>
        fighting
       </em>
       the bank's by vetoing the reconstruction acts...and to silence him quickly, they impeached him!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just astounded at this history!

       I haven't been able to get through your video yet (trying to play it in background when I can), but the "financial history" of the U.S. is surprisingly compelling, even for an uninterested layman like myself.

       The Andrew Jack/Johnson revelation was similar for me.  I also find myself despising Alexander Hamilton, and more of an Aaron Burr fan, even though the murdering part isn't exactly in my nature :)

       It's not just a history of banking...It's a history of secret predatory banking that begins with your standard Rothschild fair, but then discusses the American 19th century at length. I learned an inordinate amount of new information from this despite the fact that I'm an armchair US history fan, and a fan of suppressed information &amp; conspiracies. [

       I really appreciate the material you're presenting here.  I wasn't aware of
       <em>
        just how bad

       it was in the years after the civil war.  I knew that Woodrow Wilson and FDR screwed us over bigtime, but this background/buildup to it is interesting.

       "Money Masters" and "Ring of Power" are my two favorite documentaries, and I've watched the 3.5 hour Money Masters a few times, so I'm not completely lost, in this topic :)

       There is a great book and he said all this stuff and that Seward's folly wasn't at all but a conviluted way to get help from the Czar without violating our laws. The land was seen as worthless and we overpaid but in reality ir was payment for their help.

       Not really, left vs right is merely the pathology that allows it to be this way. There's pretty much always two ways to look at something, and that's what causes the division.

       But I think we all are aware that while they parties argue in public, they conspire in secret.

       And I don't doubt they genuinely have some ideological differences... But it's like the Gennovese's and Gambino's working together... Are there endless disputes? Yes. But do they hold the other family group in higher regard and deserving of loyalty more than us? Definitely.

       No doubt about any of that. But my point wasn't really about the parties themselves, and more specifically the higher ups that control them, but the people like you and me who could very simply do something about it if we ourselves could ever reach a state of cohesive agreement.

       Most of us know that politics are corrupt and generally these people, especially the "movers" really don't care about us. We view them as entities that view themselves as a ruling class above us. And, while they're technically incorrect, they are practically correct to believe so.

       And until we can find some way to bridge the divide among the populace, this 2-way street will thrive. So, how do we bridge the divide?

       I've also seen the videos and not one of them shows any actual proof of this.  It's very frustrating, because I see a germ of truth but no substance of it.

       I don't think it's really a straw man, it isn't a "legal fiction". It's real...It's manifold, but real. You legally can hold nothing, and have no freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that's not how we are made to feel.. We think we own things, we think we have inalienable rights, but  The reality is we don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But still legal reality is still only as strong as the legal system in place giving it integrity. Someday it could be possible to stand up to the banks and take all of this back as if their machinations never took place, as if their legal acrobatics throughout the past 200 years never were performed. We still can say "fuck you" to them. Unfortunately, this only works if enough of us understand why we need to.

       And sadly, by now it's the little snickering joke of the Rockefellers and the other .01% of the world who know the world assets and people are chattel to them...at least on paper. They know the entire world knows nothing of this and couldn't grasp it if a schematic was drawn out before them.

       Just as one little example, if you have the
       <em>
        audacity
       </em>
       to suggest that government financing shouldn't be funneled through private banking, at interest, especially, you will get mocked to moon and back, for suggesting such an absurd notion.  I mean...  we

       It's too late for them too. The banks loan money to governments, whereby the loan is secured by tax cash flow paid by citizens...why do you think the 16th amendment (income tax) was adopted (and not ratified) at the same time the Federal Reserve act was passed, both in 1913?? The banks are not willing to loan the US money without the collateral of income tax revenue...
      </p>
      <p>
       And since the US has already been bankrupt (causing FDR to force everyone to turn in their gold in 1931), the "boss" and lender to "Corp US" is The Crown (an entity located in the City of London, not Britain's royal family) has been in receivership of social security and tax revenue for at least 90 years!
       <em>
        Therefore, the money collected from the people in the form of income tax and social security
       </em>
       <strong>
        never gets to the coiffers of "Corp U.S.",
       </strong>
       instead Congress must raisie money from lobbyists (all new members of Congress must immediately begun raising money or their Congressional term will be short lived) to support their government. But of course, lobbyists can't cover all of the bills of Corp U.S....
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, the vast bulk of cash supporting Corp U.S. is (drumroll please....) from the sale of illegal drugs (and other black ops, like those undertaken by economic hit-men)!
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about the first major act taxing and prohibiting narcotics,
       <a href="https://www.naabt.org/documents/Harrison_Narcotics_Tax_Act_1914.pdf">
        The Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act (warning: small pdf)
       </a>
       .
       <strong>
        Any coincidence this was passed in 1914, one year after the Federal Reserve Act and the income Tax amendment were passed?!!

       The problem with this is that it leads to sovereign citizen stuff, which may well be correct, but it then leads to people not paying their taxes and losing their homes. Which some of them would have anyway, but we do not need it.

       So from what I've read just now about the Title of nobility Amendment, Wikipedia doesn't acknowledge Virginia as having ratified the amendment. But it also notes that there arent any time limit, as such as long as you get 26 more stated to ratify it, it'll become a part of the constitution

       It was discovered that it was ratified just this last year.
       <a href="http://www.distract101.com/2016/11/missing-13th-amendment-conspiracy/">
        Here
       </a>
       is the article I read ~10 days ago that was posted in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article doesn't get into the
       <strong>
        Act of 1871
       </strong>
       nor many related topics (and it wrongfully speculates on some suppressed meaning of the War of 1812 (there may be suppressed info still, but I doubt it had to do with the Thirteenth Amendment),
       <strong>
        but it does show that the original thirteenth amendment was ratified.
       </strong>
       It was the only thirteenth amendment until the
       <em>
        DC Organic Act of 1871
       </em>
       converted the City to a Corp and  took a new Constitution (identical except it dropped the old Thirteenth amendment) as a charter document.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this is a charter document...It is not the Constitution for Washington DC, that Constitution is based on
       <em>
        Lex Vori
       </em>
       a Vatican/Roman tyrannical law. I know it's confusing....

       What? I'm not invoking any rights. I'm trying to explain what's happened in the past ~200 and legally how the world doesn't operate how we've been taught it does. It's a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since everyone pretends that there is a U.S. Constitution (which no one or very few in government pay heed to), it's hard to grasp how this affects all of us. It does because the more powerful people believe it does and therefore this belief allows them to act with impunity in serving the attainment of their goals. We can cry, "The Patriot Act is Illegal!!", and wonder why no one every read the damn document it before signing it into law...we can believe it's just the gall of our elected officials, but in truth, they just know who calls the shots and they must do what they're told or be censured.

       This just blew my mind so fucking hard. If you are aware of the zionist conspiracy and the Talmud promising gods chosen 2500 gentile slaves each when the world is conquered,,, this will have you shitting bricks for a week straight.

       "England is in fact a financial oligarchy run by the "Crown" which refers to the "City of London" not the Queen.  The City of London is run by the Bank of England, a private corporation.  The square-mile City is a sovereign state located in the heart of greater London.  As the "Vatican of the financial world," the City is not subject to British Law."  Pg. 34.

       "You cannot take us to court because you can't see us and the courts are our servants as well. We run everything, yet, you do not know who to attack. I must say this hidden hand is wonderfully devised and without any known historical precedent on this scale. We rule the world and the world cannot even find out who is ruling them. This is truly a wonderful thing. In our media we present before you exactly what it is we want you to do. Then, as if in a flash, our little servants obey."
