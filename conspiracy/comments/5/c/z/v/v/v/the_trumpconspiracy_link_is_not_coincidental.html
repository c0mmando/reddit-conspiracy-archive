<p>Also, I wonder what the IQ levels are of these families who were able to financially rule the masses for centuries and keep their bloodlines relatively &quot;pure&quot;. I was wondering why they would want to coexist which each other (I would be taking out the next threat to my power if I were in their shoes). Then I realized that they need each-other&#39;s families in order to keep reproducing.</p>

<p>When you start connecting these dots and the fact that they all kind of look the same and have a history of genocide, I really do feel an impending &quot;cleansing of the races&quot; coming in the US. It sure explains why Trump/the media are already singling out minorities. </p>

<p>We&#39;re also running out of Illuminati cards... Enough is Enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Despite whatever you think Trump believes, there is definitely the Trump = Hitler who is planning to stand up concentration camps link in the left&#39;s minds. Hell just listen to Chapel&#39;s monologue from the other night if you don&#39;t think most minorities feels he is going to go in and crush their rights, you&#39;re crazy. I&#39;m a white male and even I feel that way. All of the innuendos and &quot;Good ole&#39; boy&quot; talk connected with a racist segment of the US that a lot of people are still in denial of. I, however, was born and raised in it so you can&#39;t fool me.</p>

<p>Actually, all of the racist denial just makes think that all of this Trump support really is just a bunch of 4chan kids who lived throughout the Obama presidency and therefore feel that&#39;s the way the US has always been. It would explain why all of these old conspiracy theories are popping up again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he was good about holding his tongue and not saying anything blatantly racist, however, insinuating all undocumented immigrants (he meant mexicans) are criminals with maybe some good people is a racist comment coming from someone who believes mexicans are all criminals. Then you call him out on it and he states he&#39;s not a racist because he employed a lot of them/has some hispanic friends (obviously a racist trying come up with proof that he isn&#39;t while coming off hypocritical).

<p>He did no such thing.</p>
