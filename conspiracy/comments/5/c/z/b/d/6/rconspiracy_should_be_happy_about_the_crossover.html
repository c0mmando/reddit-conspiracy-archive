<p>If you come here to praise trump, that&#39;s just political talk. It&#39;s not conspiracy. </p>

<p>A good conspiracy post would be reading the released documents from the national archives via foia three months ago showing the Clinton and gore administration were first interested in using trump as a third party candidate back in 1999. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/12/fresh-document-trove-sheds-light-on-clinton-trump-ties.html">- Fox News</a> </p>

<p>Or the fact trump donated 101k-250k to the Clinton foundation less then 8 years ago. Or to her campaigns when he was backing her in 2007.</p>

<p>Or the fact bill Clinton called Donald trump days before he announced to run and days after hillary had announced. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bill-clinton-called-donald-trump-ahead-of-republicans-2016-launch/2015/08/05/e2b30bb8-3ae3-11e5-b3ac-8a79bc44e5e2_story.html">it was said bill was upbeat and told Donald he would strike a chord with the rising right </a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay? But what are you doing outside of just saying trump is great? Your not bringing any information to the table. This goes back to the political bull shit.  This sub used to have great articles and people helping eachother find information. Non affiliated with any party because we see the truth and theorize on conspiracy 
But nowadays it&#39;s just loud mouthed assholes arguing about politics instead of sharing conspiracy related information......
Sure you have a &#39;right to exist&#39; but at the end of the day. You are not contributing to this group and which is why it belongs at a place where people WANT to circle jerk to trump. Like at the Donald. Obviously politics has been completely comprised by CTR and shills of all nature, so they don&#39;t take Donald stuff there. But here we want good news. Not stupid shit. It&#39;s not censoring stuff if we they block stories or posts about nothing related to conspiracy </p>
