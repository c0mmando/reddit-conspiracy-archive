       I think the sub you want is politics. Conspiracy is about uncovering truth and putting pieces of articles together reading between the lines and following the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you come here to praise trump, that's just political talk. It's not conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good conspiracy post would be reading the released documents from the national archives via foia three months ago showing the Clinton and gore administration were first interested in using trump as a third party candidate back in 1999.
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/12/fresh-document-trove-sheds-light-on-clinton-trump-ties.html">
        - Fox News
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the fact trump donated 101k-250k to the Clinton foundation less then 8 years ago. Or to her campaigns when he was backing her in 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the fact bill Clinton called Donald trump days before he announced to run and days after hillary had announced.
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bill-clinton-called-donald-trump-ahead-of-republicans-2016-launch/2015/08/05/e2b30bb8-3ae3-11e5-b3ac-8a79bc44e5e2_story.html">

       How about try using your brain and don't always just assume Trump is right about everything. I don't have to prove shit to you. How about you bring facts that Trump isn't a puppet for the elite. You sound like a fascist shill.

       While I don't agree with Trump and would like to see less political spam in this sub, I do welcome them. There are a lot of good people, open minded people, who are following Trump's antiestablishment vibe. Once he starts to turn, it will reach those same open minded people exposing politics for what it truly is: theater.

       The election had two candidates working for the same person. Trumps already laxing his stance. We will see if he prosecutes Hillary or the Clinton foundation. If he doesn't he was just another pawn used to divide and conquer

       Okay? But what are you doing outside of just saying trump is great? Your not bringing any information to the table. This goes back to the political bull shit.  This sub used to have great articles and people helping eachother find information. Non affiliated with any party because we see the truth and theorize on conspiracy 
But nowadays it's just loud mouthed assholes arguing about politics instead of sharing conspiracy related information......
Sure you have a 'right to exist' but at the end of the day. You are not contributing to this group and which is why it belongs at a place where people WANT to circle jerk to trump. Like at the Donald. Obviously politics has been completely comprised by CTR and shills of all nature, so they don't take Donald stuff there. But here we want good news. Not stupid shit. It's not censoring stuff if we they block stories or posts about nothing related to conspiracy

       I see everyone's arguments on both sides, but the focus here needs to be the next step in investigating the revelations of the network of abusers within our government. This isn't partisan. Left right, it doesn't matter. If they  are involved, they will be taken down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being partisan to either side may blind you from the next step in the investigation. Be not distracted.

       I just wish there was a political conspiracy sub and a clearly fringe one. I don't mean specifically, but I want to discuss paranormal/fringe/occult/supernatural/secret things. Not circlejerk over the same thing over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the shit posts and pointless political posts stopped I wouldn't even come close to thinking 2 separate subs would be a good idea. But as tons of people have said before, people have started using this sub as a truth beacon and less of a open discussion forum.
