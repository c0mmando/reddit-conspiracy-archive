        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(The following are rough thoughts at best):</p>

<p>Stephen Bannon was appointed as an advisor. This is bad, real bad. We are heading straight toward the cultural war we&#39;ve been talking about over the past year. The racial rhetoric that began with Obama&#39;s organization has come full circle. Trump is controlled opposition. I see this now. He is in place to continue what Obama started: a race war on American streets.</p>

<p>Hillary clinton was never meant to get in power. I believe the elite employeed hackers to leak emails to wikileaks on clinton, fed her false Intel about the Russians as the culprits. That&#39;s why she was so shocked when she lost the election; she realized she too was just a pawn (again). (See Obama&#39;s 2008 democratic primary victory over her). </p>

<p>Notice the rhetoric about the 99% versus the 1% has been completely removed from mainstream media, and supplemented with &quot;racism this, racism that&quot;... the elite are using it to divide and conquer. We were uniting as a people against the elitist scum that control our country and they pulled a bait and switch on us and turned us against each other. Love is banished. Hate is in full control. The political paradigm from left to right is full of hate for each other. We are so stupid. Simple-minded fools, we Americans. I can&#39;t believe I missed this... never saw it coming. I thought Trump was a wild card. How foolish of me. Continue to see violence spread across this country... it&#39;s happening. Divide and conquer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve figured it out. This is why the whole racism tensions thing only escalated to a ridiculous level after Obama got elected for a second term. Put a black man in office and everything is peaceful because the black people got what they thought they wanted. Second term rolls around and HOLY FUCK COPS ARE SHOOTING US LEFT AND RIGHT WHERE IS OUR BLACK HERO???</p>

<p>Then magically a big spooky &quot;racist&quot; billionaire comes along and wins the presidency and people are just <em>oh so shocked</em>, shocked enough that they might just start a real race war. This is controlled, manufactured division with specific goals in mind. Always has been. This plan has been forming for a very, very long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree that the race war scenario has existed in the NWO playbook for awhile.</p>

<p>While it might be true that the race war is an idea they would like to promote, the only way it can happen is in the most segregated cities. I say this for 2 reasons. 1) while stereotypes exist and define our initial assessments of individuals, most people have more in common than not and 2) Most Americans are conditioned against hardcore violence. As proof, I ask - how many fistfights have you been in over the last 5 years? Most people don&#39;t want violence when it can be visited back upon them. Hell, look at the black on white &quot;hate crimes&quot; that we have seen over the past few weeks; those weren&#39;t murders, lynchings, or rapes, just a few people getting black eyes and insults. I know that these things are ugly, but I submit that the limitation in the violence suggests a much 0reater fundamental respect for &quot;the other&quot; than we lead ourselves to believe.</p>

<p>In my own mind, I feel that the whole &quot;racism&quot; play by the media is a psyop designed to exploit the stereotypical hive mind that seems to dominate certain racial groups, when they are in the process of rioting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually agree with you. I would never and don&#39;t personally know anyone who would ever- harm anyone else unless they had a <em>very</em> good reason to. However that doesn&#39;t mean TPTB aren&#39;t trying to incite a full blown race war. I&#39;m just with you in thinking it probably won&#39;t play out the way they want it to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that they want it, too.</p>

<p>The problem (for them) is that very few of us are still that ignorant. I feel like it is important to say that they want it, rather than it&#39;s coming. We don&#39;t want the weakest links from any race running to extremist groups for &quot;safety&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. People are only really interested in politics when the office is meaningful. But when it comes to the presidential race, almost all the candidates are already thoroughly vetted. They wont commit voter fraud at that level having to do it in the whole country with such exposure. </p>

<p>People need to get involved in politics at the earlier stages, congress and below even local. Its here where voter fraud is likely to happen to advance a puppet over an average joe getting into politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American public is very divided. Plus the country is at the final stages of decline. I posted this lecture a thousand times, but it is still relevant. The guy shows you a process on how to bring down a nation and take control of it. It&#39;s a long boring process that destroys a nation through covert and overt means.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZnkULuWFDg">Here&#39;s the complete lecture.</a></p>

<p>The final process is might be an invasion by the enemy, crisis or civil war. Since the US government wants total control, they will start the civil war intentionally to justify security over freedom. This is why you see Soros funding protests, he&#39;s promoting civil strife and conflict between people. They want a totalitarian government to rule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I dont see true socialism as the agenda at all. We are currently under a mixed economy, and I believe TPTB prefer to keep it that way going foward; essentially, we have a very restrictive form of Capitalism  (top-down Corporatism) wrapped in a guise of socialistic values in which involuntary taxation is used as the justification to fund the socialistic functions of the government.</p>

<p>TPTB need the masses to behave like serfs. Going to work, slaving away for barely enough to keep their families afloat; couple that with the injected belief that hard work mixed with a bit of talent or luck will allow someone to strike it rich, and we have a mass of people working their lives away, begging both the current and the forseeable next POTUS to give them a leg up (a tax break, a handout, etc). The masses are reliant on the system, not vice versa. TPTB prefer this method.</p>

<p>(Theoretically the system is reliant on the masses, but only in the sense that the masses have the power to destroy the system if they collectively agree to no longer participate in the system; stop participating, then the system surely fails.)</p>

<p>The problem is that Americans are conceptually aware of notions of corruption and secrecy in the government. They may not understand the finer details (fine print) of what the scandals and conspiracies really are, but they accept that the  possibility is conceivable. For TPTB, this is the last hurdle. They use PsyOps to penetrate the collective national discussion and turn the direction away from &#39;them&#39; toward &#39;us,&#39; such as they are currently doing with the &#39;racism&#39; dialogue being injected into our collective consciousness; but ultimately, they want a more restrictive Internet and a citizenry that is willing to spy on each other; from there, they will tiptoe closer to mass surveillance that we saw officially formulate under George W Bush&#39;s two terms.</p>

<p>So, short answer: socialism in its truest form will not happen, as it cannot function under a monetary system, which is required by TPTB to properly control the masses.</p>

<p>We had to chose between a cannibal and a billionaire.</p>

<p>There is a a choice, Non-Consent. The most reasonable one if you are into common sense.</p>

<p>If you treat a government like a business and you are the owner, you wouldn&#39;t be electing corrupt employees into office. You would be withdrawing your consent which would force that business to shutdown since that business only operates by consent of the governed.</p>

<p>Stop letting perception of &quot;no choice&quot; make choices for you, and stop letting others pressure you into to making choices you don&#39;t agree with. </p>

<p>When we choose to stop playing the game we dissolve the facade of presumed authority. To destroy a lie, live the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think its so much about a cultural war. Its really simple. People lost faith in the media and in elected politicians because it was just a play really. They were looking for somebody to galvanise them into bringing about change. </p>

<p>Trump is that somone, but rather than questioning the system and structures in place he galvanises all that spirit of protest on his person, with him the people who want to audit the fed are convinced 9/11 was an inside job etc. feel like they got their guy in the white house. The outgroup backs the whitehouse now and the respect of the system and the office with that particular outgroup is restored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t it obvious? All politicians are blackmailed. You don&#39;t get to be in a high position without being compromised in some way, usually sexually. Clinton and Trump are both compromised with at least one of the same child sex rings. The Franklin Scandal also factors in here, as Trump&#39;s mentor, mobster lawyer Roy Cohn was implicated in Franklin. Good bet that Clinton is tied to Franklin as well.</p>
