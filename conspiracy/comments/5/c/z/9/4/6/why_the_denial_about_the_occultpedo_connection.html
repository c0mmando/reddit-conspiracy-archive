       I don't get the argument that this is all just a wacky conspiracy and to ignore the religious aspect of it - It has already been proven that the CATHOLIC CHURCH itself have pedos involved and had hiding it for years!! A belief and religion that millions of people trusted, and still do. why? because it's "GOOD" or "HOLY"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you want us to believe Satanic pedos DON'T exist??? That they are a just a silly conspiracy, a myth, not real etc??
      </p>
      <p>
       If Catholics were doing it and covering it up for decades, you better believe that Satanists are not only abusing kids for sex, but much worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan is 100% real to those that believe in him, just as much as a Christian believes in Christ. No different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedos exists, it is NOT a conspiracy
      </p>
      <p>
       The Occult and people that believe in it are REAL, it is NOT a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most conspiracies start with just one of a few pieces of circumstantial evidence that are expanded in theory without further proof or conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS situation however, has a TON of evidence (email, photos, connections, proof that human trafficking exists) All of it is beyond circumstance and there are many solid conclusions being made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only about 5% of what has been found to theorized here to be debunked or proven false, all these doors to just darker and darker places...it never seems to end

       I'm skeptical of Pizzagate- not because it's improbable (I think there are pedofile networks, and they do use codewords), but because much of the evidence being used to back it up is forced.  There's no real evidence of the main focus of the theory- that pizza shops are being run by pedofiles in an elite political pedo network.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said- Pizza shops are a cash heavy business that are good for laundering money.

       I think many of us, myself included, are NOT skeptical that the Wikileaks emails are
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       What many of us reasonably-minded truth seekers ARE skeptical of is a witch hunt focusing on potentially completely innocent businesses and their owners based solely on combinations of anonymous 4chan posts, questionable "pedo codes," and instagram posts from hipster weirdos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people in this sub are trying to claim this is all proven fact or at least close to it. So far, I have yet to see ONE shred of hard evidence that ties any of this together. All I've seen is posts based off of info found in other posts based off of info found in other posts. We're getting to the point of a
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       game of satanic pedophile telephone in which users are accusing any and every pizza restaurant in the country of being involved in satanic child sex rituals just because they have a triangle or a swirl in their logo.

       Honestly this IS pretty dangerous, in a number of ways.  One of those dangers is that this is all just a trap to make us look like fools.  In all likelihood there is no evidence remaining at CPP (these guys can probably afford new rape dungeons).

       My theory is this :
      </p>
      <p>
       the Catholics pedos were purposely exposed to discredit ALL Christians. After that, they were no longer trusted to run oversea orphanages. It was after that, companies like the Clinton Foundation took over to fill the void....and completely corrupted it
      </p>

       I often point to historical precedent to convince the skeptical.  Throughout all of human history there has been injustice obfuscated from the masses. It has happened in the past, it's happening right now, and it will happen again.  We are not exempt from history's transgressions...after all the present is just future history being written.

       It was fairly recently that even the subject of child abuse or sexual molestation AT ALL was a topic to even be acknowledged, like homosexuality back in the day too. These practices have been used for social / political control, not to mention occultic.

       Hence, why they use symbols and hidden code words to keep it within their own secret group. Just like gays did up until last decade, when it became acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       We now know it was happening and being hidden by the Catholic Church. So why is it so hard to believe Occultists do it as well?  Blows my mind that people are being so closed minded about it.

       It's not denial. Anyone with a brain and a conscience is going to wait for hard evidence before throwing those kind of accusations on someone over an oddly worded email and some stupid fucking 4chan posts. To do otherwise isn't just irresponsible, it's malicious. Victims of molestation by priests have been coming forward for YEARS, but yet here we are.. still waiting for some shred of proof of this satanic "pizzagate ring".

       Thank you. My sentiments exactly. Majority of the "research" that has been presented sounds like a bunch of teenage edgelord armchair detectives who are L.A.R.P.-ing some sort of pedophile National Treasure fantasy.

       So far, NOTHING concrete has been presented.

       I'm sure a fat half of anyone who bothers to come here and say "pedo conspiracy is BS" is operating as damage control. Nobody wants to talk about pedos, if they doubt it they wont come here and let us know.

       Your logic is off. If Catholics and Satanists are molesting children then it has little to do with religion. It's a human problem not a religious one.

       Not sure how the occultic plays into the pedo stuff, but if anyone doubts there is fire in all the pedo smoke, then just the Jimmy Savile case (vulgar clown figure proven to be pedo perv ,closest to the highest levels of power in Britain for no apparent reason), Jeffrey Epstein getting off with a slap on the wrist, recent events in Hollywood, hints at the levels these goes to, then Corey Feldman inexplicably given a spot to perform on tv after he shuts up...then these emails.

       The moment you bring "satanic" into it you look like a retard. Christianity is BS, the whole devil worship shit is just hype and you're going to have to look at religions that existed way before any of the Abrahamic religions. If anything, the Catholic church is the church of "satan".

       Because they don't, look at the symbols they're using. Educate yourself. Satanism isn't a thing, it was a scare tactic in the 80s otherwise it's been invented in the past 70 years.
