    <div class="md"><p>The media are useless without their directors, and their &#39;conspiracy against&#39; Trump was a big figure in getting him elected (billions of dollars worth of press for free)
Politics is rigged, but it isn&#39;t fixed toward either of the two major parties, they are competing for corporate attention, because the party that controls the legislature (right now the republicans) gets all the good corporate money and deals. Also, the competition helps misdirection while our country&#39;s livelihood is stolen from us by corporate overlords.</p>

<p>That&#39;s definitely true traditionally, but is that the case now? I dunno, I feel like if I was some big corporation used to getting government shit that I want done by donating to political parties, I wouldn&#39;t exactly be tripping over myself to donate to the GOP in the hopes that that&#39;ll influence Trump at <em>all</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given a choice, I think Trump is a marginally better President than Hillary. As a conspiracy theorist, I believe that the POTUS is largely a figurehead.</p>

<p>Elected officials have another level of authority that exists above them. Some call them TPTB, but really they are simply people with huge financial resources. </p>

<p>It&#39;s people like this who have the real control. They are the ones who set policy and exert so much influence. Politicians are really just a cutout. Their job is to tell the lies, convince the people and to take the heat when times are bad.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s job will be to do all of these things.</p>

<p>I respect someone if they say they are a Trump supporter. Trump himself is kind of like the ultimate distraction. He&#39;s there to take the heat and get the credit for the decisions made and actions taken by TPTB/Deep State.</p>

<p>He&#39;s there to keep people from realizing how things actually work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/new-york">misinformed</a>. </p>

<p>The state of New York was mostly red in this election.  But the cities, especially NYC, are democrat strongholds corrupted by the DNC, and they rig the elections there.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t fully source that claim, but it is well known here among New Yorkers.</p>

<p>But there is proof that <a href="https://www.tmn.today/2016/11/three-million-illegals-cast-votes/">3 million illegals voted for Trump,</a> and there is a large population of them in New York.</p>

<p>Regardless, there&#39;s plenty of proof of the good deeds Trump has done and the New York newspapers were full of it for decades before they turned on him. Without the corruption, Trump would have won in a landslide here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least he provided SOME evidence of his stance. You&#39;ve provided NONE for yours. As it stands, your stance is the most anti-intellectual stance here.</p>

<p>The reason Trump has bought some trust is because he has been true and damn near uncompromising in his words/rhetoric, despite the fact that he was getting bashed by mainstream media and population. </p>

<p>In an age where politicians measure their words to curry the most favor and the least backlash, Trump shot straight and that resonates with people.</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of evidence to favor Trump as being honest, where there was none at all for Hillary, and Sanders showed his true colors, a folding coward.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not even providing an argument, you&#39;re just shooting insults and providing no reason, forget facts or even evidence. You&#39;re the one openly basing your world view on your petulant feelings, and attacking others whose feelings aren&#39;t as confused at the moment.</p>

<p>It may end up proving true that Trump is the status quo guy. But he has earned the benefit of a doubt. But you don&#39;t even doubt that.</p>

<p>Women for the most part are equal to men in western society, but they also need better care for their issues. Such as a possible longer paid maternity leave and legal abortion. Also I believe the issues such as catcalling and sexual assault against both sexes are pretty terrible.</p>

<p>This is driven by his Christian fan-base and is backwards bullshit. Women should be able to chose to do whatever the fuck they want. I never said he was going to take away their right to vote. How about seperation of church and state? How about him wanting to over-turn Rowe V Wade? Is this the new America? Are we following the bible now over everything else?</p>

<p>This is so short sited. Denying that the earth is getting warmer and that our energy grid can be vastly supplemented by renewable sources is backwards. The only people having this opinion benefits are those that invest in dirty energy and look at quick returns. Renewable energy is a long term investment and if we don&#39;t take it seriously we are going to be so far behind.</p>

<p>Trump Says He&#39;s &#39;Fine&#39; With Gay Marriage in &#39;60 Minutes&#39; Interview</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-says-he-s-fine-gay-marriage-60-minutes-interview-n683606">http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-says-he-s-fine-gay-marriage-60-minutes-interview-n683606</a></p>

<p>even if he&#39;s anti-gay he has said he won&#39;t do anything against the marriage laws for gay people.</p>

<p>The belief that life is sacred doesn&#39;t need to be religious at all, since some think that life starts as a human foster, has human rights and by abortion it&#39;ll kill it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m for abortion until a while into pregnancy (as in not late term abortions out of personal choice or something like that since I see that as a decision made in the earlier months) and when exceptions are present like threat to mothers life, but I still see where they come from.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a good idea or bad idea to terminate Roe v Wade or on what basis you were to overturn it or what not. But from what Ive read it doesnt seem like a bad law/ruling.</p>

<p>Found this quote though, talks about or promotes having a honest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade#Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey">discussion between both parts</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scalia&#39;s dissent acknowledged that abortion rights are of &quot;great importance to many women&quot;, but asserted that it is not a liberty protected by the Constitution, because the Constitution does not mention it, and because longstanding traditions have permitted it to be legally proscribed. Scalia concluded: &quot;[B]y foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish.&quot;[110]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, I see no reason yet to deny climate change as affectable by human &quot;efforts&quot; or usage of fossile fuel, and that releases carbon and possibly dangerous gasses into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Since this man now is the face/representativ of America I hope he does a good job for you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone fill me in on this media conspiracy against Trump. I&#39;ve heard so much from Trump supporters about how the media somehow is biased against him but I honsestly don&#39;t see it. Now yes, all media outlets, mainstream and independent, have bias. That&#39;s just kind of how it is. But for the most part, I haven&#39;t seen any conspiring against Trump on a mainstream scale. </p>

<p>If people see the constant talk around his controversies as &#39;conspiracy&#39; then they&#39;re misled. Trump said a lot of outlandish and divisive things that were sure to make headlines, and the media followed suit by covering the easy eye-catching story. During his entire campaign he spoke to create headlines and get people talking, so that&#39;s what the media did. </p>

<p>And in my opinion, you can&#39;t claim there was unfair bias against Trump when Hillary&#39;s emails and past scandals were also a constant topic in the mouths of everyone. I&#39;m not trying to pass judgement or anything but I honestly just don&#39;t see any foul play by the media, if you pay attention to Donald Trump you&#39;d know it wouldn&#39;t take much work to spread around all the controversial things he&#39;s said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got shit on Trump. He&#39;s anti gay, anti woman&#39;s rights, anti clean energy, and huge fucking cunt. What else do you want?</p>

<p>Most of us here on this sub are fighting for these injustices, the rest of you are not and it&#39;s a shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least he provided SOME evidence of his stance. You&#39;ve provided NONE for yours. As it stands, your stance is the most anti-intellectual stance here.</p>

<p>The reason Trump has bought some trust is because he has been true and damn near uncompromising in his words/rhetoric, despite the fact that he was getting bashed by mainstream media and population. </p>

<p>In an age where politicians measure their words to curry the most favor and the least backlash, Trump shot straight and that resonates with people.</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of evidence to favor Trump as being honest, where there was none at all for Hillary, and Sanders showed his true colors, a folding coward.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not even providing an argument, you&#39;re just shooting insults and providing no reason, forget facts or even evidence. You&#39;re the one openly basing your world view on your petulant feelings, and attacking others whose feelings aren&#39;t as confused at the moment.</p>

<p>It may end up proving true that Trump is the status quo guy. But he has earned the benefit of a doubt. But you don&#39;t even doubt that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>feminists don&#39;t fight for human rights. they just complain about shit. western women are the most protected and empowered women on planet earth. they aren&#39;t oppressed, they have every right  a man has, yet still find every reason to complain or fabricate issues.</p>

<p>fuck feminism and the cultural Marxism it pushes </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my two cents, all of the radical &quot;feminists&quot; that you see on the internet have disillusioned everyone. You never see any of these people in real life. </p>

<p>Women for the most part are equal to men in western society, but they also need better care for their issues. Such as a possible longer paid maternity leave and legal abortion. Also I believe the issues such as catcalling and sexual assault against both sexes are pretty terrible.</p>
