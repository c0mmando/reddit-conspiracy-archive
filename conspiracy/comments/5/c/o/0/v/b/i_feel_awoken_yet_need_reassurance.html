       Friends. I've been lurking on this sub since Wednesday morning, essentially since the election result was confirmed, and everything I have seen is unbelievable. Keep fighting the good fight, your efforts caught my eye as I saw a post on the front page and have quickly found myself down the rabbit hole. This shit is real, there's too much evidence to refute it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a burning question to ask. Since reading into a lot of sub to the point of overload, I am now aware of things I was not - Soros, the Clinton's ties to sex-trafficking, comet pizza, and more. I feel myself awakening, questioning reality. Is everything an illusion? I am I going mad? Someone please reassure me. I'm a student and just reading my course texts now I cannot help but to critique through the lens of this new knowledge which has been heaped upon me. I feel like I've seen behind the veil and now cannot go back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if this post is considered spam, I just needed to say these things. Keep digging, I'm with you.

       Let me assure you that what you are experiencing is normal. And you wouldn't be here if you weren't ready/couldn't handle the awareness. But be assured you are not alone in shedding the illusion and dealing with how disturbing the rabbit hole can get.

       In my student accom I don't own a TV and so I'm not being exposed to main media outlets, although I'm in the UK so I was not seeing US media in the first place beyond snippets on social media.

       By illusion I guess I mean that everything suddenly feels odd, nothing feels real. This is where I'm not sure if I'm going mad or just going to deep in my education considering I study Int. relations and understand the thought that most things we know are construction e.g race, gender.
I suppose I feel more open to questioning what I already knew.

       The shock of truth can shatter one's worldview. I had a similar experience cued by research that landed me (voluntarily) in the hospital. I would advise against psych wards, and medications unless absolutely necessary.

       When you immerse yourself for a long time in such a life as the shadow elite live, it ebbs at your resolve and will eat away at even the most tenacious person's will to continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn meditation, pick up a hobby, distract with pure (allegorical or metaphorical will just get you thinking more) fiction, and practice CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy). Basically where you observe how your thought patterns effect your emotions and behaviour and make changes to your behaviour in order to influence your thought patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Above all, no matter how it feels now, you'll get used to it. Sounds sad to say, but it's true.

       I went through my awakening as a student too. It was quite difficult friend, I hear you. I think it's important to remember, when it starts to get overwhelming, just step back for a moment. Life continues as it is and only time can help you make sense of all this madness.

       Sort of ease into it and try not to get consumed. You may experience periods of paranoia, which is normal.  The pizza stuff is very new so like others said take it with a grain of salt but be open to the idea that there is truth there.  Other topics like 911 and sandyhook have stood the test of time and have some quality research behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont be offended if your friends dont want to talk about this stuff or take it seriously.  These topics make people very uncomfortable (look up cognitive dissonance) and most are not ready to deal with these subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also remember that even if you are completely awake you still have to go to school, pay your bills, do your laundry, etc.  All that shit is still important, even though it may seem like its not at times.   Also try not to watch a lot of TV.  There is a reason they call it programming.

       I cannot say about pizzagate but what is true is that Huma Abedin is a spy, Clinton and Obama broke the law and won't be punished because they are part of the CIA in a group called the 7th floor group.  They are above the law by executive order which somehow congress and supreme court are seeing as legal, even though the basis of which is in contravention of popular sovereignty, the same basis upon which the constitution is based: meaning that the constitution has ben superceded by secret law.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all verifiable facts because they've been explained by a high level constitutional lawyer and 2 constitutional scholars.  This started with GWB on 9/11 and has been continued since, by way of a legal device called 'the continuity of government plan' that was continued by gwb for 8 yrs and then by obama for 8 more.  Osama bin laden has been fish food since 2011, yet obama still continued the 911 state of emergency until 2016--why you ask?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so they could run a private server, sell state secrets, sell illegal weapons to our enemies, create isis, orchestrate mass shootings; control ALL the news; racebait the public using the news (still doing it now!!); gaslight the public with disinfo (it's legal now by exec order); attack and criminalize conspiracy theorists; let people get killed at benhgazi, kill gaddafi illegally, wage illegal wars, perform extraordinary rendition, hold enemy combatants in prisons in iraq and rape them their wives and underage males by forcing the young males to fellage the older males (yes, this was a leaked cable), and so so SO much more; oh and perjury, and subversion, and treason.  Nothing will happen, unless Trump actually does something about this nonsense.

       Wikileaks is a Russian propaganda tool to destabilize western governments and advance its own interests. Look up the history of Wikileaks. Look up its connections to Russia.

       Basically, there are some Russian intelligence operatives making shit up all day and posting it.

       Hi-  I've only been on here for two weeks and yes, it is shocking.  It makes you question your own reality- but sadly, it is true.  In the next few weeks...may possibly have to wait until January....more will become public to the main stream media..Just thank God that Donald Trump won- otherwise this all would have been covered up. Take care!

       I echo the comments of all those who say be skeptical of everything. Just because somebody appears to be revealing some conspiracy, doesn't mean they are revealing everything or that what they're revealing is true. It's called misdirection or disinfo or a limited hangout. They give you part of the truth, but not all of it and try to get you off the scent of truth. Just because somebody appears to be a 'conspiracy theorist' doesn't mean they really are. They could be working for the powers that be. In fact they most likely are.

       One of the things that you should be very careful about is that there are lots of lies and half-truths out there - perhaps especially so on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       we have problems with disinformation and black propaganda. Astroturfing has been a thing long before Correct The Record publicly admitted to it (our first big win for truth in this regard was the HBGary email leak event).
      </p>
      <p>
       View everything and everyone with a degree of skepticism, and  seek evidence for any claims that seem fantastic.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other side of the coin, don't get consumed by paranoia and fear - especially in places where people are trying to piece things together or work for causes you agree with. Be skeptical, hold people accountable, and give people the benefit of the doubt. To borrow a slogan from failed Hillary Clinton's campaign, "we're stronger together" than on our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Educate yourself on the terminology. black propaganda, limited hangout, disinformation, astroturf, false flag, psyops, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigate alternative-media outlets and remain skeptical. James Corbett is generally pretty astute, but always always be cautious. Sargon of Akkad seems pretty legit in regards to SJW/feminist/social marxist stuff. Bill Still from a conservative viewpoint. Dinesh D'souza also from conservative viewpoint - though he's less alternative. Joe Rogan is likely an establishment gatekeeper, but still has some pretty good interviews. Alex Jones, while a fearmonger and possibly cointelpro, still has some gems now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thejoycamp/videos">
        Joy Camp
       </a>
       for some humor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Visit other subreddits and communities relating to these issues - don't depend on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as it is often targeted by disinformation and vote manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       take breaks. don't be discouraged if others are resistant to the information/discussions you try to share with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: above all, listen to your intuition, your gut.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit2: how could i forget, keep an eye on the meta-reddit stuff if you spend much time on this site:
