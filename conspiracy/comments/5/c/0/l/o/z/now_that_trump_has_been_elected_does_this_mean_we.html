       There is no "corporate media elite conspiracy" fixing votes or running the election for us. This isn't a farce. You can maybe,
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       , fix a district. But not every district in a state, and not thousands and thousands of districts across all 50 states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump is president. If there is a cabal of members of a shadow government fixing things to keep the status quo, they did a pretty fucking terrible job at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: The point is that the election was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       rigged, Donald Trump won the presidency. Everyone who talked about how the election was fake and already decided for Clinton because some media-corporate-government conspiracy says so, you were wrong. Those are the facts.

       Paper ballots.  No voting machines.  No super-delegates.  Transparent process.  No bullshit.  We will never "shut up" until the elections are not "trust us, it's not fixed" elections.  There is no "trust us".  We need a transparent system.

       Um, they let the American people choose which puppet dictator they would like to replace the current one - Hillary "Stalin" Clinton or Donald "Hitler" Trump
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying they're doing a superb job. They didn't need to rig the election since only their guys were runner ups. They just needed the people to go vote to legitimize the oppression.

       You think Americans chose Trump all by themselves? They purposely only gave you the choice between the witch and him. Trump was trolling America!! You will see. You have been trolled by a corporate mole. Guess who signs the check that Trump needs to finance his realty business? Banks!! Obama Treasury was full of Goldman Sachs, so will Trumps. He will go kiss Janet Yellen's feet for using her as campaign fodder.

       Not one, hundreds. This isn't a single election; it's 50 state elections, with many districts in each one.

       It is impossible to fix enough of those elections to change the outcome of the election.

       The American people choose their president, and I do not believe there is a vast corporate-government conspiracy to only "allow" elections where the status quo corporate candidate wins. Because she certainly didn't.

       Trump winning is likely part of the conspiracy.  Think about it, after 4 shitty years of trump America will be chomping at the bit to get back to the status quo. Unless he makes good on a number of his promises it is just 4 years till we are right back where we started. This whole election was a farce.

       Well maybe maybe not to the conspiracy part. But I don't think any politician is to worried about Trump's long term effects.

       When she concedes, the point will still stand. She hasn't publicly conceded because she's probably distraught and can't form a thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       That she hasn't conceded
       <em>
        yet
       </em>
       doesn't make a difference. He won. Even if she never concedes, he will be president.

       No election is perfect and above criticism. An un-criticized election is what Saddam held in Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Clinton's little web of friends why should they go?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tammany Hall Boss Tweed went to prison, somehow escaped and then went back to prison and died, yet Tammany Hall continued basically unchecked for the nest 80 years.

       Same here. Many of those who were made by and profited off the Clintons are still in office and will be there when Trump is inaugurated in Feb and he will have to deal with them (unless he decides on a purge and extensive criminal indictments). Beside the corrupt backers who paid for Clinton are still there ready for the milking. So I guess the network of patronage and nepotism will remain as it is how they got their position and wealth, and it is how the system really works in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides Trump still has to prove himself and his administration. Will it be a good Presidency or one like the U.S had under George Bush Jnr. with crooks who answer to the name of Republican instead of Democrat?
