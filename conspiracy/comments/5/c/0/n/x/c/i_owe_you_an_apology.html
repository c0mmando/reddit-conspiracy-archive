I figured America&#39;s democracy was dead.
With all the money behind Clinton, I just assumed she would be ushered into the Whitehouse without problems..
I even said to my wife and mother in law, &quot;I&#39;d bet my house and kids college funds that Hillary will be president. This shit is rigged and presidents are chosen before hand&quot;... Oops! Sorry kids!</p>

<p>What a pleasant surprise it was this morning when my wife checks her phone, rolls over and tells me &quot;Fuck, Trump won&quot;. I couldn&#39;t be more happy!</p>

<p>Maybe there actually is a democracy when it really comes down to it?..</p>

<p>I&#39;m so happy to see that old hag Hillary get the boot. It brings me great pleasure to know how fucking mad she is right now. Her voice hoarse from screaming at her staff.. </p>

<p>RIP Clinton.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reverse psychology is a technique involving the advocacy of a belief or behavior that is opposite to the one desired, with the expectation that this approach will encourage the subject of the persuasion to do what actually is desired: the opposite of what is suggested. This technique relies on the psychological phenomenon of reactance, in which a person has a negative emotional reaction to being persuaded, and thus chooses the option which is being advocated against. The one being manipulated is usually unaware of what is really going on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_psychology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_psychology</a></p>

<p>For decades now it has been known that the majority of the American public do not trust the media. The last thing the elites would do in such a situation is to pay the media to promote their favoured candidate.</p>

<p>Instead, they use the ancient technique of reverse psychology to manipulate people into voting for their candidate, while simultaneously tricking the public into thinking the elites lost.</p>

<p>To find out what the elites actually want, simply look at what the media is saying and assume that the opposite is what they want.</p>
