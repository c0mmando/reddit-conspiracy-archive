What better way to calm people down than to give them the feeling they have a choice and that choice matters. Trump and Hillary are both playing for the same team , nothing will change , this was just one big theater show to make people forget about everything that happened in the last month.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The unreal (so rigged) polls telling HRC was gonna win by a large margin, got to demobilize the people who would vote HRC in order to avoid Trump to win.
But no one seems to see any conspiracy here.</p>

<p>Both HRC and Trump were bad outcomes, but the really bad thing is they made people think they were voting against the establishment. And what is even worse is that they have manipulated people via internet and social networks. So they have conquered the only tool we had left for making people wake up. I bet some billionaires will be laughing hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed.
Especially now that it seems (or at least to me) that this board has been shilling for Trump just as hard as r/politics was for Hillary. </p>

<p>Everyone in the country rejoicing for this &quot;victory&quot; is like a bunch of mice rejoicing because the old cat left and a new cat is prowling the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Trump made it very clear that he is not going to let the corruption go.  They would have been better off having Hillary personally blow his brains out on live television than having him win the election.</p>
