        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am wanting to know what everyone thing about Trump winning.</p>

<p>Are you happy that he won or not? Do you think he will be a great president or just like all of the others and why do you think that?</p>

<p>I strongly feel that he will be a great president. Mainly because of a lot of things that he has said (Saying he will do something doesn&#39;t always mean he will. I know that) and that would help our country and hopefully destroy the establishment and the corrupt system that he currently have. I also have been doing research on Ronald Reagan and learning more about him. NOTE: I was born in the year of 1995 so i couldnt experience how it was when he was in office. After hearing his speeches and learning about what he did and said he would do it sounds (To me) a lot like Trump. Either way! He is way better than Hillary and her whole corrupt background and system. I bet if she would the whole US would go to shit! Also i&#39;ve heard about the simpsons predicting him becoming president and destroying the US. What are your opinion on that as well? </p>

<p>Also i keep a open mind about everything. Hinting why i&#39;m in the sub! I just wanted to know what everyones opinion on Trump winning and all of that jazz! </p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">3</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/WHOtfAmI420.html">WHOtfAmI420</a> 2016-11-13</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I look at it like this:</p>

<p>This election was a lose-lose situation. I do NOT support either candidate. I think it&#39;s obvious that there are higher ups placing people into power. OUR CHOICES CAME DOWN TO HILLARY CLINTON &amp; DONALD TRUMP FOR FUCKS SAKE. </p>

<p>Trump is the lesser of two evils, but that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t be corrupted, or isn&#39;t already complicit with TPTB to lead this country into some sort of unrest. This election has divided this country more than it already was. Who knows if Trump doesn&#39;t have some hidden agenda and is coaxing us all into the New World Order. Divide and conquer, the oldest trick in the book. I mean, the guys a multibillionaire. If that doesn&#39;t scream &quot;global elite&quot; then idk what does.</p>

<p>Hillary would undoubtedly sell this country out 100 time worse than it already is. She&#39;s as corrupt as it gets, the physical embodiment of everything that&#39;s wrong with our system and the way things are. Another chapter in these political dynasties that have been &quot;leading&quot; our country for a long, long time.</p>

<p>Trump seemingly wants to &quot;Make America Great Again!&quot; But what does that even mean?? This country has been at the mercy of the global elite for decades, maybe centuries. </p>

<p>I think if Trump really does have our country&#39;s best interests in mind, and actually does try to shake things up, he won&#39;t make it to see a full term. The higher ups have come too far for someone to step in and interrupt things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with your comment/statement! </p>

<p>Every president that have fought the higher ups were taken out by someone and that someone was later killed so keep them permanently silenced. I could name a recent president but i can already bet you know who that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it helpful to look at presidents in the US as people who are installed - not elected.   All the hoopla around debates, speeches, and polls is just a cover to give the whole thing some seeming form of legitimacy.    </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t see HRC vs Trump as a lesser of two evils situation.  Power got the person in office who&#39;ll best deliver on their goals for the next 4 years.   And if those goals are anything like what&#39;s been happening for the past 20 years, they&#39;ll make the rich and powerful richer and more powerful while putting everyday people further and further into poverty and hopelessness.   And we&#39;ll fight with each other while it happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My life fades. The vision dims. All that remains are memories. I remember a time of chaos... ruined dreams... this wasted land. But most of all, I remember The Road Warrior. The man we called &quot;Max.&quot; To understand who he was, you have to go back to another time... when the world was powered by the black fuel... and the desert sprouted great cities of pipe and steel. Gone now... swept away. For reasons long forgotten, two mighty warrior tribes went to war, and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all. Without fuel they were nothing. They&#39;d built a house of straw. The thundering machines sputtered and stopped. Their leaders talked and talked and talked. But nothing could stem the avalanche. Their world crumbled. The cities exploded. A whirlwind of looting, a firestorm of fear. Men began to feed on men. On the roads it was a white line nightmare. Only those mobile enough to scavenge, brutal enough to pillage would survive. The gangs took over the highways, ready to wage war for a tank of juice. And in this maelstrom of decay, ordinary men were battered and smashed... men like Max... the warrior Max. In the roar of an engine, he lost everything... and became a shell of a man... a burnt-out, desolate man, a man haunted by the demons of his past, a man who wandered out into the wasteland. And it was here, in this blighted place, that he learned to live again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing to have enthusiasm over a government official, but please keep in mind that anyone can be corrupted. Don&#39;t let your current enthusiasm cloud judgment if things get hairy down the line.</p>

<p>I personally am cautiously optimistic. This election set a lot of things in motion that have potential to do good; people are doing homework and becoming their own &quot;media&quot;. As for Trump, he has raised questions about a few things discussed on sites like these, namely vaccines and 9/11. I think he has the potential, but time will tell better than wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Bluffton SC rally in Feb. where he talks more about Sept. 11:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM7B5oiIuyw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM7B5oiIuyw</a></p>

<p>Richard Gage of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth sent DVDs and a book to all the presidential campaigns and Trump&#39;s was the only one to respond back:</p>

<p>“Thank you for your book and DVDs. Our advisors will investigate the claims made by the architects and engineers more thoroughly and draw their own conclusions from there. We appreciate your continued support. Sincerely, The Trump Campaign.”</p>

<p>Here is a youtube video of Donald Trump calling a TV station to talk about what he saw on that day:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have hard facts, but I believe he was not directly involved. What interests me is that he is a prominent figure, now president elect, who has questioned, in the past and during his campaign, the validity of the story the public was given about Sept. 11. If it&#39;s his authentic belief that we were lied to, he is in a powerful position that gives him the opportunity to get us the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Trump Presidency is literally setting stone for an American Revolution, or it indicates that Trump is NOT here to help America but instead lead it to destruction.</p>

<p>In order to understand this, you need to know how election works in America.</p>

<p>American democracy has 2 types of votes, a popular vote and an electoral vote.</p>

<p>Hillary won most of the electoral votes by rigging voting machines, but Trump had got the electoral vote by 500 or so nobodies that nobody seems to be able to name or know where they are from, but they can elect presidents. </p>

<p>(Be noted that Electoral Vote councils were NOT shady organizations when America was first created, they were well known publicly. It&#39;s the illuminati hands that do most of the work.)</p>

<p>And now the electoral council happens to rig Trump in.</p>

<p>The Electoral Vote winning over Popular Vote has happened for a few times, with the latest after over 100 years being George Bush, and most of them happen to be republicans, including George Bush and Trump.</p>

<p>This means that Trump is literally being set up as an unpopular president to END America just like George Bush, and the next president will be a democrat communist if there is still any. </p>

<p>Chances are a Maidan-like series of bloody clashes will occur in America to force trump to step down and if he does Hillary will be exalted as the eternal president of united states, which can be president as soon as she lives, and if she happens to leave presidency, she can send another person to become president, making her a virtual empress.</p>

<p>If it does not, expect Trump to do a bunch of foolish decisions opposed to what he says before presidency, eventually ending America under the hands of China and Russia.</p>

<p>And when it happens....Welcome to the NWO of the Ages.</p>

<p>(Be noted that i strongly believe the conspiracy controls all sides and thus i am neither on the side of Hillary, nor i am on the side of Trump or Russia/China. This is EXACTLY how American elections work.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand your &#39;Trump wasn&#39;t elected by accident&#39; statement. I do know this election was very similar to the Bush V Al Gore where Al Gore had the popular vote but Bush got more states and more electoral votes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that most things we see in politics has been predetermined. I don&#39;t have anything to back up my statement, but It&#39;s pretty common knowledge that our politicians are controlled by the rich. If Trump isn&#39;t wanted by the elites, he&#39;ll likely be replaced by his VP, Mike Pence. He&#39;s much worse than Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not convinced he was much of a choice at this point.  His transition team has walked back most of his statements and it hasn&#39;t been a week.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad thing exactly, I hate most of his campaign proposals, but it doesn&#39;t look good for anyone hoping his election would be significant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rigged up game that only got what it was always gonna. A trump is the best hand. How and why remains to be seen because those policies promoted shouldn&#39;t have made two cents.</p>

<p>There was no lesser of any evils, because Trump is such a stand up guy. I mean the Oligarch/Mogul hasn&#39;t been paying taxes least of all has he had any credibility apart from being a billionaire in a business of manipulation. If there was anti establishment, you have just voted for the establishment. Like the rest of those gungho republicans and the often redneck policies promoted which don&#39;t make any sense, that rhetoric is now deniability and rewording for another agenda or attempted gain, it figured because it was quite the farce. It certainly won&#39;t be a new different surge in Americanization otherwise we are all incredibly naive, provocation trade/climate/allies doesn&#39;t cause diplomacy, and any isolation doesn&#39;t gain. </p>

<p>On paper it probably looks like retreat and rebuild except there just isn&#39;t that time frame today. There would only be a Chinese UN next, where any democracy is left completely out of that veto as those institutions of power and establishment are rewritten on a different part of the map where money and growth gain exponentially as the fall of Rome is left shafted in the ass stagnating to the point of the corruption and decadence we have seen.</p>

<p>So what is that strategy you tell me? Markets will only bounce back at you bending over a barrel taking out currency costing economies reliant on it so much more than those where citizens have often come from the other gap. Increased warming will lead us to that same place with no future much sooner. Reversing allies and partnerships will only see other alliances and bases popping up everywhere else. Attempted isolation of what plays where, will have the result that something will.</p>

<p>Perhaps we are all gonna be friends and it&#39;s business as usual, not according to the campaign notes America first make America Great Again</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think trump has much pull anyways. Everyone just assumes he&#39;s going to run the country like a dictator and pull all sorts of policies out of his ass and ruin the world.. Relax people. You are giving him too much credit!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would meaning sanctioning somewhere, causing oil to hike, because there is less on the market. The markets are flooded with it, and unless those telsa electric robotic cars are going to all be v8 7 litre jobs with chassis made out of plastic. There won&#39;t be the demand. Perhaps the ban on microbeads is revoked and there will be lots of plastic robots mining all the coal.</p>

<p>He has been pulling those policies from somewhere is the point? Nobody gave him that much credit and he was elected, but are we to wonder why?</p>
