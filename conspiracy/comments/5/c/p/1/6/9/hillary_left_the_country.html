       I find it weird that there's only been one photo (staged) of Hillary since the election concession speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely there would be reporters following her around to get a photo of her after being in the spotlight for so long?
      </p>
      <p>
       Has she left the country? Can she really have stayed in the house and not left it?
      </p>
      <p>
       How did a "random" see her out hiking and no media did?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if she has left the country.  She's not well. Something very fishy going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think she'd ever face trial for any accusations eg Clinton Foundation/emails etc. But if Trump follows through on the jail comment (seems he's backed off a bit on this in an interview today, but that could be him playing the media and the American public who are unsettled right now and waiting for the right timing to bring a case. Plus there's plenty of other things which are more pressing for him to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, I find it weird no photos of her. Is the media still helping her and covering for her? Has she left the US?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is there some unwritten code I don't know of to not photograph the loser for a certain amount of time???

       sorry that's not fulford's bio, that's the bio of the kualipelle blogrunner who only reposts fulfords paid material for free on his own woo-ish site. Way to act like you know what's up when you clearly don't even bother to check simple facts. I am not going to vouch for him but the above light spirit stuff is 100% not like anything he has ever written and the fact that you would believe otherwise proves that you don't know anything about him. He might be crazy but this is the wrong crazy.

       IMO fulford's stuff is quite hard to stomach, but you are mistaking the bio of the hawaiian blogrunner as if it were the bio of fulford himself who is american living in japan. This blog is run by someone totally unrelated to fulford, who simply reads and reposts fulford's material among other things. That person is the one who wrote the bio describing himself as a light spirit, something which would be completely out of character for B.F. no matter how bizarre his stuff can get he does not do woo. Fulford's reports are at odds with the mainstream info by any standard but are and have always been entirely free of any wacky fourth density nonsense.

       Benjamin Fulford is very clearly either disinformation or batshit crazy. He's had people literally paying him for YEARS for this drivel, running around chasing their tails and waiting for this idiot to save the world (think about that for a second). And who's the other little, round old guy that he travels the world fighting 'the Cabal' with? Neal something? I seem to recall a video uploaded to YouTube years ago of those two with a man actually dressed as a ninja, claiming they were brokering some deal for humanity. It's just ridiculous, and people waste huge amounts of time, energy, and money waiting for these people to actually change something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone remember 6-7 years ago when all these people said for like two years was that 'the green light' for 'mass arrests' of the Cabal was always tomorrow, or next week, or right around the corner... Guess what? It never came, it's never coming, people like Benjamin Fulford exist solely to pacify anyone waking up to this information. Oh, don't worry, Benjamin Fulford, the grandpa from Jurassic Park, and a fuckin Ninja are on the case!
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are doing the truth movement many huge disservices, and I don't believe they're doing it unknowingly.

       So you think that Benjamin Fulford is the be-all-end-all of truth, and anyone that doesn't believe him is 'under hypsnosis'?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been involved in what you'd probably call the 'conspiracy' world for the better part of a decade, and followed this dude specifically for awhile. It's really bad fiction, poorly done. I can see where it might be appealing to those just opening their eyes, but that's nothing but a bottomless moneypit being fueled by this whole thinly-veiled game of 'oh, humanity will be saved next week, just donate again so I can go meet my secret ninja illuminati contacts and all will be well!'
      </p>
      <p>
       How long have you been following Fulford? Do you realize he's been doing this exact same, tired spiel for years upon years?

       Look, I'm not here to insult anyone else's beliefs, but I do genuinely believe that this guy and his weird cronies are doing the 'truth movement' (for wont of a better term) a huge disservice by basically keeping huge swaths of us in a waiting pattern while this guy flies around the world blogging up fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that much of it is laced with truth, but he makes himself, his 'adventures,' and his 'connections' way, way too fantastical. In fact I basically think everything about who this guy is and what he does is completely contrived, by himself. It's like he's taking the basic reality of things and then blogging himself into it as if he actually has some importance, but the majority of it is very clearly made up. Again, I'll point you to the ninja illuminati meeting YouTube video, I'm sure it's not hard to find, and I'm sure there's many, many more that are very similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Neil Keenan was the name of the old round guy I was talking about. Go look at his website. That's either the ravings of a deranged lunatic, or someone who is paid disinformation. Does anyone actually believe these are the people humanity's future hangs on? Benjamin Fulford, Neil Keenan, and 'Group K?' Come on, man...

       I was skeptical, then I got the the talks of a GCR and I said to myself ‘oh, it's one of those sites...’ and I dropped any bit faith I had in it being the least bit accurate. I'd love to be proven wrong but whenever I've come across people talking about a Global Currency Reset they've all been involved in purchasing near dead currencies on the hopes of this magic GCR changing values and making them million/billionaires..

       Of course not, but I also don't think we're going to revalue stuff like Zimbabwe's currency to reflect the numbers on their dollars. I've seen people betting their lives on the hopes their One Zillion dollar notes will be revalued and they'll end with with millions per note. 
That's just crazy talk. 
If anything we'd probably end up with either an entirely new form of currency for everyone to use or we'd finally just drop it all together and start treating people as equals. 
As long as money is around there will always be corruption.

       Oh, Jebus! The whole timeline idea is cute but unsubstantiated. If time travel were to exist the repercussions would be far greater than the trivial aspects shown as proof of its existence. 
If you've got the smoking gun I'm all ears but I've heard just about every view on the idea and have yet to hear or see anything even remotely conclusive. I find it a much more likely probability that the world we see is just a simulation.

       It's kind of wild actually. We can all agree on the fact that the world IS overpopulated and the only true way to delay the inevitable is population control. But we can all agree its also highly immoral.

       I don't agree that the world is overpopulated, we do have an out of control consumption tho. But if you want a lower population so that we can continue to consume what we do on a daily basis, education for the poor is the way to go combined with healthcare and a secure living condition, it will create smaller families, and thus a smaller population.

       The world is not over populated. It's about sustainability.

       If we were to take EVERYONE that is alive right now and put them in one spot, it would take up some of Texas.

       Does that sound like overpopulation to you?

       It's about inventing new ways of food production and nurturing the planet so it can support us. Instead of exploiting it and cutting down the Amazon jungle for more cattle farms.

       Sustainability is the key word.

       Who are you to say why over population is an issue to me. Putting everyone in close quarters would be my personal nightmare. You'd want to sustain this watered down uneducated version of humanity? I will be honest with you... I'm looking forward to the next big war or virus. Even if it takes me out. Humanity is cancer. We haven't done anything truly positive that hasnt been outrun by our destructive nature.

       I was giving you an example bro. I don't actually advocate cramming every last human into one small state. I was merely creating an example to give you a glimpse of the amount of space we truly take up on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree we are a destructive species but we are learning, evolving, and adapting. 30 years ago asbestos, lead, and cigarettes were widely accepted. Now we understand and have learned from those mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aren't perfect but we aren't a cancer, unless you focus on the negative aspects of humanity. But you need to take the positive into account as well, such as the goal of planting millions of trees in the Amazon, positive global change that is coming about, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       We just need to keep learning and we will be just fine and eventually we will reach a state where pollution, violence, and danger, is a foreign concept.

       The world is not overpopulated but the ethics people would like to make you think it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about being sustainable..
      </p>
      <p>
       And inventing new ways of food production without the downfall of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is possible with aquaponics and skyscraper food farms such as seen in Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
       De-population is the lazy, morally devoid way, of dealing with people and it's sick people still believe and support such an ignorant notion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even God talks about it in the books called "Conversations with God" by Neale Daniel walshe and agrees that de-population is not needed we just need to invent more sustainable ways.

       there are two illuminatis, the first that came back to prominence was the anti-vatican scientists and intellectuals who believe in climate change and the second formed more recently, more practical thinkers, more objective climate change skeptics who broke from the first illuminati but who still believe in science and practice solutions like dont fuck up the great barrier reef.

       Wtf are you talking about? You posted a good thing about that white house petition (think that was you anyway) but everything else I've seen you post has been about "alternate timelines" and 2spooky stuff. Could you at least attempt to explain? Add a source? Anything?

       So here's the thing about
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . We seldom get conclusive proof of said conspiracies handed to us on a silver platter like we did for Clinton's corruption and elite pedophilia. We usually post "out there" blogs, connect a few dots that paint a compelling picture, and then discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes the stuff is really "out there" like aliens and the holographic nature of reality.

       If you want to learn more about what
       <a href="/u/TeslaMuse">
        /u/TeslaMuse
       </a>
       is posting, check out Benjamin Fulford, David Wilcock, Corey Goode, Red Ice Radio (one of my favorites), and Coast to Coast. But you won't find many traditional sources for this stuff.

       In addition to all this, many already know, and even the MSM has shown, that modern day birds are in fact dinosaurs - which were themselves "lizards".

       So if anyone ultimately

       fly, it is in fact lizards - since that's ultimately what birds really are and come from.

       Neither of these are definitive proof of a timeline. The Clinton campaign likes to control narratives. I think you'd be remiss to take the face value implication of timeline as a given.

       It is generally accepted that she has health issues so it is not suprising after such a stressful week that she has not ventured out.

       Just a tin foil tingle, but could ISIS as we know it have any relation to the pagan god Isis?
I'm not too brushed up on my history of the pagan gods, but I feel like if we find a connection it would kind blow my mind.

       I have an interesting link to that. 
John Zeglis the former President and CEO of AT&amp;T is a very close friend of my family. I typically see him 3-4 times a day over the summers. Think he may have something to do with it?

       Keep in mind I've never really liked him. He's pretty arrogant. But I converse with him a lot.

       afextwins explanation could be true, i thought hillary may have named isis because bill clinton said "it depends on what the definition of is is", and it coincided with isis the god so they went with that, typical bs to see what they could get away with, everything to the criminal globalists is their personal joke, their whole lives are lived in glee and bliss.

No. Much more simple. Verizon was going to roll out their mobile wallet to compete with ApplePay and others. The name? Isis...this was about 6 months to a year before the MSM rebranded The Islamic State aka ISIL to ISIS. Money talks, someone didnt want verizon cashing in on an emerging tech and soured their 10 year marketing plan. Billions down the drain.
Edit: as with all my posts, this will be deleted after 1 to2 days. Save it now if you wish to go down that rabbit hole.

       She has to stay out of the public eye in order to distance herself from the movement to use the electoral college to change the outcome of the election. Can't look like it's coming from the Clinton camp at all. Has to look like she's just out there hiking, winding down from a tough campaign, accepting her "loss," when surprise! surprise! she gets a phone call Dec 19th, "Job's still yours if you want it!"

       there's an electoral college, to prevent the unfit from attaining the office..." yet? Wait for it... It will be sold as the "smart" thing to do.

       It is orchestrated. Left boot, right boot - doesn't matter, the treadmarks look the same on your neck. Frankly, seeing the footage of Trump after his meeting with Obama, actually check that, even the footage of the results coming in election night... he doesn't want this job. He's in over his head and he fully came to terms with that thought sitting in the White House yesterday.

       The electoral college is sealed. The only way anything on either side would change is if the Trump campaign came out and demanded a recount to check whether there was large counts of voter fraud. I've heard numbers as high as 13-14 million of fraud votes. But I doubt it happens.

       But the media and Soros are definitly trying to recreate what happened with Ukraine a few years back. Undermine a previously installed president by creating public outcry that was heard only by a minority of people initially.

        The upshot of all this is that yes, it is theoretically possible that — as urged by the Change.org petition cited above — a large group of Republican-selected electors could choose not to cast their ballots for Donald Trump, but to instead defect and vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton (or some other compromise candidate) and thus deny the putative election winner (Trump) from gaining the White House.

       By sealed up I mainly mean that there is no way she could skew the results without a full recount. Which would then find mass voter fraud. The map is essentially done. I don't really have any factual evidence for you as I'm on my phone. But I just can't see it happening without causing an issue counterproductive towards what they may try to move.

       Clinton stayed out of the public eye even during the election cycle. She's probably sick. But I remember that rumor about $1 billion being flown out to Qatar and everyone joking she was setting up her escape hatch to a non-extradite country. But considering she opted out of spending time with her own campaign workers on election night it doesn't surprise me that she's keeping a low profile now.

       John Kerry going to

       Antarctica was fishy. I immediately thought, "there ain't nothing there but underground military bases. Something's happening."

       Now that he is President elect I don't think he's be allowed to comment on any ongoing investigation. I feel like HRC is most likely been in custody since election night, and only allowed out to go to the concession speech. The pic in the woods was mosdef staged (prolly before election day)and released everywhere for some reason. Probably so her followers don't think she's locked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If she isn't in custody she is already dead from a cyanide capsule... but there is no way the she was allowed to leave the country. The New FBI has been running things for a long while now... and only allowed her to carry out her plans for so long in order to get as much evidence about her co-conspirators possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is covering for her... because they don't know anything about her aside from the pics they are sent...but the crooked media is just starting to dry up now... I haven't followed TV news until just recently, but there are already a lot of staff retiring.

       here are all the things I see that look curious to me in hiking photo:
      </p>
      <p>
       very first thing that made me do a double take is that the woman in blue has her hair done but down, just speaking as a female who goes hiking myself -- I've Never seen a woman bother to do her hair but not put her hair up/away from her neck when hiking. - it's hardly evidence of anything I know -- but it's the first thing that made me curious to look further,

      <p>
       second odd thing is how the woman in blue seems to be pressing her face against Hillary's. and it's her doing it -- she's the one leaning in. It's just odd ==== it's very personal and presumptuous for the circumstance, Hillary also seems to be pulling the woman to her -- again -- really?? Hillary Clinton and this woman are besties suddenly? women don't press face to face with strangers for first time meeting -- and for still Hillary to do this -- i've never in all photos of Hillary posing with people seen her eager to press faces with a stranger, or even with somebody she knows well. it's weird. maybe maybe the day after presidential defeat explains it --  but I still find it unlikely. my first joking to myself guess was that perhaps woman in blue was posing like this with her actual bestie, at some point, and that pic was shopped to fit hillary into it, .... that then got me wondering -- maybe thats what this is, or something like that  -- so is this photo real at all? maybe it's partially real and partially shopped? did woman get her pic taken by herself - knowing it was going to have hillary shopped into it? did that woman do her hair that morning knowing she would be in a picture everybody would see?? that's what that hair looks like to me. that's what the over-leaning in looks like to me too on further reflection, like she's posing by herself anticipating somebody being added to the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       and then I started looking at shadow. nothing is a glaring smoking gun red flag - but enough stuff seems off to me, led me to conclude it's fake. the shadow stripe across Hillary's upper thigh area that seems to come from nowhere. if it's from a branch above them it aught to fall across woman in blue too, but really a branch couldn't create it since there are zero other such shadow around. seems everything is getting diffused at any kind of distance, so that shadow across her thighs is an issue I think - needs an explanation and has no explanation. puppy seems to be making a direct definite shadow on Clinton's calf but leash makes zero shadow. dogs rear leg is brightly lit - but seems it should be in shadow. Baby's round face catches zero direct sun while clinton is almost washed out in sun. woman's face casts really weird shadow on clinton's face -- as if her nose is giant but clearly it's not. Clinton's head seems crazy big proportionally to other woman. there is such an incredible lack of shadow in red trees to the side of clinton's head. as if that area is in a totally different time of day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a photo expert -- this is just me feeling i'm looking at a fake pic and my reasons, the unlikely face pressing - to me, is the biggest tell. thanks for asking!

       it's just very unlikely imo that Hillary would press cheeks with that woman for that photo op. pressing cheeks is intimate! maybe young people at a party would press cheeks with somebody they just met for a photo -- but try walking up to somebody and asking for a photo and then pressing your cheek to theirs when you take the pic -- see how they react - how you feel. it's very intimate, just not likely Hillary would do that. imo/

       oh. I can't say see a red spot. but it looks like it's blown out to me -- just totally different lighting than the rest of image.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm convinced Hillary is not with us any more. I don't know when she passed/left country, or whatever. But again her speech today -- looks like CGI. I feel like I'm watching a planet of the apes animation of her, it has that hollow ghostly undertone even top CGI still always has. I just don't think it's really her. I don't think she is alive, or at least I'm sure she's not actually present in any of these images.

       Yeah. On my phone it looked like a bruise on her cheek. Looked on the computer and saw it wasn't there.
      </p>
      <p>
       She did a local appearance during the campaign and the lighting was bad. She looked even worse than this recent "makeup free" event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm convinced that we are well into the realm of not knowing what's real. Looking back through history, it's always been this way, though. Renaissance painters were successful for painting the royalty in a more favorable light; and the public may have never seen their leaders in real life, so they wouldn't know that a nose had been adjusted or a chin strenghthened. Photographs have been faked since day one, and now we have CGI. We can't trust anything we see; so I agree with you that she could be long dead. I wish that it mattered...

       I recently started watching this guy's video on possibly falsified history -- in this part he specifically focusses on 19th century painting. I found it so interesting! if you haven't seen it yet maybe you will too.

       I agree it's so amazing to realize how long we have been deceived. but I'm also wondering maybe it doesn't go back as long as we are told, they tell us history, for all we know -- we are one of just a few generations under this deception and the idea of how far it goes back is also a deception.

       Thanks - fascinating! The bit about the cheek to cheek is very intimate and probably the most weird to me, apart from the woman's hair- it looks so perfect!

       Look, I'm not here to insult anyone else's beliefs, but I do genuinely believe that this guy and his weird cronies are doing the 'truth movement' (for wont of a better term) a huge disservice by basically keeping huge swaths of us in a waiting pattern while this guy flies around the world blogging up fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that much of it is laced with truth, but he makes himself, his 'adventures,' and his 'connections' way, way too fantastical. In fact I basically think everything about who this guy is and what he does is completely contrived, by himself. It's like he's taking the basic reality of things and then blogging himself into it as if he actually has some importance, but the majority of it is very clearly made up. Again, I'll point you to the ninja illuminati meeting YouTube video, I'm sure it's not hard to find, and I'm sure there's many, many more that are very similar.

       Who are you to say why over population is an issue to me. Putting everyone in close quarters would be my personal nightmare. You'd want to sustain this watered down uneducated version of humanity? I will be honest with you... I'm looking forward to the next big war or virus. Even if it takes me out. Humanity is cancer. We haven't done anything truly positive that hasnt been outrun by our destructive nature.
