       All of a sudden, people are citing Podesta emails from this website that kind of popped up out of nowhere, and the major issue is that

       <strong>
        <em>
         no one is fucking answering the question about who this website actually is.

       <em>
        Every

       time I see people asking about where this site came from, they are ignored every single time. On this sub, and even on 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we just talk about how there's no verification for any of the information spread from this website?

       My personal opinion... This website is either peddling red herrings for us to feed on so we aren't focused on legitimate issues which we
       <em>
        may currently be neglecting entirely,
       </em>
       OR the website is simply illegitimate in its entirety and it's all just false information from someone who really, really hates us; maybe likes seeing us running in circles.

       Dude deleted his comment &amp; account speaks volumes for what he was actually doing. Call them out, make them known, anyone openly denying this &amp; downplaying the situation are obviously either CTR employees or paid shills/trolls to make it hard to read between the truth/lies. The digging continues, I love this sub &amp; the real subsribers!!

       If DCLeaks is legit, they should have DKIM verification. Wikileaks lagged in adding them to all mails but I think they covered most of them by now.

       I mean honestly, with all the crazy shit that's going down in this sub, I wouldn't put it past. There's the recently revealed video on Soros, of course the restaurant business that I prefer not to mention by name, AND the massive spike in subscribers since the election...
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't know who or what to trust anymore man, and the last thing I want is for people to begin investigating evidence found in these emails, only for them later to be debunked, effectively making all of our latest research moot fucking point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really want them to be real,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       so our favorite restaurant is investigated.
      </p>

       I still have my doubts about wikileaks itself, though given the influence they've had in this election their credibility has been increasing in my eyes.. but as you say, this dcleaks.com thing has seemingly sprung up out of nowhere. Anyone can make a site like this and fill with seemingly plausible emails. If they have some means of establishing credibility, or communicating about who they are, then let us see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of right now, I would assume all leaks are possible disinformation, and seek always to confirm validity.
