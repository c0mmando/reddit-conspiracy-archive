This website is either peddling red herrings for us to feed on so we aren&#39;t focused on legitimate issues which we <em>may currently be neglecting entirely,</em> OR the website is simply illegitimate in its entirety and it&#39;s all just false information from someone who really, really hates us; maybe likes seeing us running in circles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean honestly, with all the crazy shit that&#39;s going down in this sub, I wouldn&#39;t put it past. There&#39;s the recently revealed video on Soros, of course the restaurant business that I prefer not to mention by name, AND the massive spike in subscribers since the election...</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know who or what to trust anymore man, and the last thing I want is for people to begin investigating evidence found in these emails, only for them later to be debunked, effectively making all of our latest research moot fucking point.</p>

<p>I really want them to be real, <em>especially</em> so our favorite restaurant is investigated.</p>

<p>I feel somewhat proud that first post attracted a shill, kind of a badge of honor ;u;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still have my doubts about wikileaks itself, though given the influence they&#39;ve had in this election their credibility has been increasing in my eyes.. but as you say, this dcleaks.com thing has seemingly sprung up out of nowhere. Anyone can make a site like this and fill with seemingly plausible emails. If they have some means of establishing credibility, or communicating about who they are, then let us see it.</p>

<p>As of right now, I would assume all leaks are possible disinformation, and seek always to confirm validity.</p>
