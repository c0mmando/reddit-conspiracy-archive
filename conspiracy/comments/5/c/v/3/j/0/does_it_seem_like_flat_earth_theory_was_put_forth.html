    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Plausible&quot; is the last word I would use for the flat earth theory. Lunar eclipses, watching ships sail, the fact that you can sail or fly around the earth, actual pictures of the earth from space... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didnt look into it at all I would say. Anything is plausible since you have no idea what information is held away from you.</p>

<p>The ship sale that&#39;s mostly our eyes have you ever watched a ship sale with a super powerful lense? You go east and west to fly if you go north anywhere you hit the north pole and if you go down anywhere you hit Antarctica and the edge of the world. If you did any research you would at least know that fact.</p>

<p>So I dont think you looked into it at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never looked at a ship through a lens, but that&#39;s what I see when I&#39;ve ever watched a ship. You didn&#39;t even tell me what happens when a ship sails when observed through a powerful lense.</p>

<p>Yes, you fly east to west, and you can fly east to west in a complete circle around the world. At the very least, you&#39;re looking at the earth as a cylinder. Maybe not an oblate sphere, but definitely not flat.</p>

<p>I also notice that you can&#39;t explain the phases of the moon. You know what explains the phases of the moon very well? The position of the sun on different sides of the planet. </p>

<p>I looked into it, so don&#39;t insult my intelligence. Looking into it led me to a different conclusion that makes your conclusions seem very short-sighted and paranoid to me. </p>

<p>Go look, or try and find a video. Remeber our eyes can only see a certain distance. There are some weird anomalies.</p>

<p>a flat disc. Did you even look at the theory.</p>

<p>The earth and Sun are smaller and they are the ones that rotate.</p>

<p>You didnt look into it all those parts were explained so its not an insult of your intelligence but a simple observation from my open minded research into the theory of flat earth.
&#39;
You obviously didnt look into it based on the questions you asked they have answers for all of them and I dont have conclusions I just have theorys and they are all plausible unlikely but still. 
I know I know nothing so I think of everything as plausible.</p>

<p>Its a fun little theory I enjoyed my voyage into its reasoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but the weird thing is when I google that, the only thing that shows up is flat earth stuff. That&#39;s obvious bias... </p>

<p>Yeah, I did, and it honestly doesn&#39;t make any more sense than traveling in a circle around a spherical earth.</p>

<p>That still doesn&#39;t explain phases and the waxing/waning moon. You&#39;re going off talking points and not even having a conversation with me, dude. You&#39;re ignoring the questions you don&#39;t like or don&#39;t have the answers to and repeating stuff you&#39;ve watched in youtube videos. You&#39;re letting distrust override your reasoning. </p>

<p>You&#39;re ignoring centuries of mathematical and scientific evidence to get to the conclusion that someone is out to dupe you. You seem like an intelligent person, and I&#39;m not trying to fight with you or call you dumb. I just think flat earth theory can be disproven so easily. I mean, easiest way of disproving it for myself is looking at every other celestial body in the sky and noticing they&#39;re all the same shape. Why would earth be a completely different shape than everything else in space?  </p>

<p>Antarctica is of some sort of <em>real</em> importance that much is clear.</p>

<p>Nasa is up to some shit that much is clear.</p>

<p>There have been cycles of extinction of men or &quot;hard resets&quot; at least twice that much is.....mostly clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think Biblical floods (they did happen) and the fact that pyramids in Egypt show water damage. Also the Star Sirius is very important it&#39;s the dog star and what the pyramid head was originally before it was destroyed...twice. It&#39;s been reshaped to be a human but the body remains, it&#39;s a sitting dog not lion.</p>

<p>As for Nasa well it&#39;s mostly all bullshit or weird. Losing all audio recordings and transcripts of initial moon landing. Moon rocks given to foreign country for use in museum turned out to be petrified wood.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only just discovered it myself a few weeks ago. Theres not a lot of information out there that I can find. If flat earth was an active measures situation then the flat earth societies would have to be looked at to try and find out who was funding them. paper trails like that don&#39;t always exist. Wikipedia says flat earth theories have gained momentum with the Internet in the last few years. i would be interested to find some early flat earth articles, by early I mean before 2004. Will have to look into it more myself :)</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying gravity doesn&#39;t exist?

<p>I can catch a tennis ball on fire, and it won&#39;t burn the same way our sun is burning. Because it&#39;s not a gigantic object on fire in the vacuum of space. There are some really cool videos from the ISS where Chris Hadfield is in 0 gravity and pours water out of a tube. The water &quot;sticks&quot; to the closest object. It forms around the shape of whatever is closest, and, when floating freely, takes the shape of a sphere. </p>

<p>My personal guess would be that when you&#39;re flying a plane, you&#39;re still affected by the earth&#39;s atmosphere and gravitational pull. So the speed of the wind/air is relatively close to the speed of the ground moving. Once you leave Earth&#39;s atmosphere, it becomes much more complicated.</p>

<p>I have seen those. You&#39;ll notice that the guy doing the experiment is not just releasing the ball - he starts the orbital motion by pushing the ball in an orbital direction. If he just let let ball go, it would roll straight down to the heavy ball in the middle without circling around it.  When a piece of steel is attracted to a magnet, it continues moving towards the magnet until it crashes into it. The steel does not start orbiting around the magnet at any point. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you will agree that fire needs oxygen to burn. There is no oxygen in space, so how can the sun be a ball of fire?</p>

<p>Well, things that get pulled into orbit didn&#39;t just &quot;drop&quot; straight down on the larger object. They were traveling in their own direction at a high speed and got pulled into the orbit. When you watch the experiment, you notice how they start out with larger orbits and form into something smaller and more familiar? If he drops it straight down, that would be representing an object whose direct path was Earth. That&#39;s what a giant meteor would do if it were crashing into us and trying to kill us.</p>

<p>What&#39;s going on on the sun isn&#39;t ordinary fire. It&#39;s a much stronger source of energy taking place through nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion doesn&#39;t require oxygen.</p>

<p>Have you watched any of the Flat Earth 101 type videos? </p>

<p>We can sit here chatting all day about whether gravity is real or not, but ultimately gravity does not determine the shape of the earth. Neither does whatever else appears to be in the sky or in space. </p>

<p>The proof is in the pudding they say, and for flat earth the pudding is the complete and utter lack of proof curvature on earth, as well as the motion of earth which has never been seen, felt or scientifically measured by anyone ever.</p>

<p>As an example, it&#39;s commonly taught that the earth spins at around 1000mph at the equator, do you know where they get that number from?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d want to measure the curvature of the earth. You couldn&#39;t do it traditionally like a surveyor. The only way I could think to demonstrate the curvature is with a picture of the earth from a distance. And have you ever heard of the Foucault pendulum? That&#39;s a demonstrated experiment that shows the earth is spinning. For the speed, they may use that experiment and scale up whatever is hanging on the pendulum to an object the size of Earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And have you ever heard of the Foucault pendulum?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Foucault’s Pendulums are often quoted as proof of a rotating Earth but upon closer investigation prove the opposite. To begin with, Foucault’s pendulums do not uniformly swing in any one direction. Sometimes they rotate clockwise and sometimes counter-clockwise, sometimes they fail to rotate and sometimes they rotate far too much. The behavior of the pendulum actually depends on 1) the initial force beginning its swing and, 2) the ball-and-socket joint used which most-readily facilitates circular motion over any other. The supposed rotation of the Earth is completely inconsequential and irrelevant to the pendulum’s swing. If the alleged constant rotation of the Earth affected pendulums in any way, then there should be no need to manually start pendulums in motion. If the Earth’s diurnal rotation caused the 360 degree uniform diurnal rotation of pendulums, then there should not exist a stationary pendulum anywhere on Earth.</p>

I&#39;ve seen videos of people in the international space station, and you can see the earth right out the window.

I never thought to measure the roundness of the earth like I&#39;ve never thought to measure the roundness of a basketball. What&#39;s the end goal to &quot;indoctrinating&quot; me with the idea that the earth is round? To me, you&#39;ve been &quot;indoctrinated&quot; to think it&#39;s flat by people who really aren&#39;t teaching you anything or looking at things on a universal scale. They&#39;re looking at how things &quot;seem&quot; to them when technology has shown us things aren&#39;t exactly as they seem. </p>

<p>So you don&#39;t believe in space? Or that there&#39;s anything out there? Do you just believe it&#39;s a flat planet with a dome over it with a laser light show? I don&#39;t get it, dude. It makes more questions than it answers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to come back to that video later because I still don&#39;t know what answer you&#39;re looking from for &quot;curvature of the earth&quot;. According to google, though, the curvature is close to 8 inches per mile. I really can&#39;t stand to watch this this morning because the dude just seems angry, and all of his stuff screams, &quot;shut up and listen&quot;.

<p>The swing of a Foucault pendulum primarily varies based on where you are on Earth. You&#39;re citing a lot of user error on why it SOMETIMES doesn&#39;t work. The movement of the earth isn&#39;t noticeable enough to get the pendulum swinging, but that&#39;s why you have to watch it for 8 hours to get a 90 degree rotation from it. Because you&#39;re watching a minute effect on a smaller object that sits on a larger object. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in both. They&#39;re not mutually exclusive, man. Don&#39;t play that shit with me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never watched it.</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s fatter around the middle, and if you just measure land it looks different because of the weight of oceans. Nothing exists in a perfect form, but it looks like a perfect sphere to us. People think &quot;oblate spheroid&quot; means it looks like a pear or something. No. The other planets we can see are the same shape we think earth is, and it&#39;s mostly spherical... but oblate. Squished down a little and fatter than a perfect sphere. </p>

<p>Alright, that&#39;s strange. You&#39;re getting further from exploration to find &quot;the truth&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;d be able to see the sun from trillions of miles away because it&#39;s a giant explosion of energy. That doesn&#39;t mean you can zoom right in with a Nikon and see the explosions and solar flares. You might be able to see it&#39;s there without fine details.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re just arguing. You can&#39;t tell me what kind of vibes I should be getting from someone. That guy is confrontational out the gate. Less like an educator and more like... a very angry educator.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t prove that the earth doesn&#39;t move. That proves gravity is holding the pendulum down in a downward &quot;funneling&quot; type force. But once it has been pulled so close, it&#39;s inert. Because the pendulum is part of the Earth now. It is so close to the large object, it appears unaffected by it. And until a more direct source of energy acts on it, it&#39;s not showing any sort of noticeable movement. But if you apply energy and watch how the object behave over MANY hours, you see the object moves in a way that suggests the earth is moving. </p>

<p>I have questions for you as a flat earther. How do you explain seasons? How do you explain wind and tides without the influence of the moon? How do you explain the phases of the moon and eclipses? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a ton of things that points to the earth not being a spinning ball, but the big kahuna would be that no matter how hard you try or how scientific you get - you can not find the amount of curvature that there is supposed to be over any ocean, flat land or natural bodies of standing water. It&#39;s simply not there.</p>

<p>As far as seeing the curvature out of an airplane window, the big problem is not seeing a curved horizon - you should not be seeing a horizon at all. If you draw a circle (no matter how big), and make a dot above the circle to represent the plane. Now imagine yourself sitting in the plane and looking out the windows on the left and right. You should be looking out into clear blue sky or space. To see the curvature of the earth you would have to stick your head close to the windows and look down to see the curvature.</p>

<p>Flat earth has no leaders, but I will recommend watching all of Eric Dubay&#39;s flat earth videos first. There&#39;s A LOT. He sticks to the facts and is mostly responsible for the resurgence of flat earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5i_iDyUTCg">200 Proofs Earth is Not a Spinning Ball Videobook</a></p>

<p>His website is <a href="http://ifers.123.st/">http://ifers.123.st/</a> (Don&#39;t bother creating an account, almost everyone gets banned as flat earth is so heavily shilled)</p>

<p>ODD Reality also makes great videos, this is a good one:

I&#39;ve seen other non heliocentric earth believers also talk about 9/11. I figured it was a way to deem the word conspiracy to be fake and outlandish theories.
But I don&#39;t think NASA does psyops, atleast on that type of scale. The military or intelligence communities would though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t subscribe to flat or hollow earth, but i am willing to research it and have discussions about proposed evidence which supports it.</p>

<p>Having said that, i never gave much thought to the moon landing until watching a documentary about it.
The most compelling piece of evidence IMO is the fact there is no jet blast crater below the lander.</p>

<p>This is very glaring once pointed out. Hollywood set designers often make mistakes because they lack the practical technical knowledge to know better. The scene looks as though the lander was gently lowered down with a crane.</p>

<p>We know the surface (of the set) was sandy, since we see the rover kicking up sand from the tires, and yet no crater from the rocket.</p>

<p>There is a mountain of additional evidence, but this is a difficult one to refute/explain.</p>

<p>Note, that I don&#39;t say that&#39;s evidence in the way of the moon landings being real. I&#39;m not firmly on either side (I lean toward hoax, or at least real with fake elements), but I just don&#39;t find this particular line of reasoning compelling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isee your point. The thing that gives it more credence, in a small sense, is that Van Allen (i believe) discovered the Van Allen belt before the Apollo Missions. Another, better line of reasoning, is the fact that all other human space exploration (minus the Apollo Missions) has been relatively close to the Earth... including all other nations.</p>

As the lander gets closer to the surface, these gasses exert force on the surface and the loose dust/sand.

check out Active Measures, the Russian led disinformation operation. It included the KGB spreading the moon landing hoax. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_measures">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_measures</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if flat earth theory is a part of their disinfo too, I&#39;m only speculating. However, the people behind active measures were also involved in funding &quot;the society for psychical research&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Sidgwick">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Sidgwick</a></p>

<p>Henry Sidgwick was founder and president of the society but also involved in the Cambridge Apostles, a  secret society which was used as a spy ring for the KGB. </p>

<p>If you want to go one step further on this then ill tell you that the cult that Julian Assange grew up in (The Family, new age Australian group) was led by Raynor Johnson who was from the UK, a university parapsychologist who had ties to the society of psychical research.</p>

<p>The Family (government MKultra funded operation) conducted all kinds of experiments on their followers, including children of whom their leader Anne Hamilton-Bryne (who believed she was the reincarnation of Jesus) had fostered. The children were eventually taken off her. Julian Assange was one of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Read your own links</p>

<p>&quot;
&quot;Results indicate that, from an erosion and visibility standpoint, the best landing mode for a lunar module type of vehicle would involve: site inspection and selection above the incipient erosion height, and a fast descent to the highest drop-in altitude that the vehicle structure could withstand. A slow and cautious descent with hovering just above the lunar surface would greatly increase crater size and impair visibility.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/mBlNfFcV6ns">https://youtu.be/mBlNfFcV6ns</a></p>

<p>And heres a video of the rig they ended up using for practice. Take note of how they hit the thrust at low altitude to set down gently as any experienced pilot would do. Especially one flying a $2.2 billion ship (nearly $17 billion adjusted for inflation)</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/yMfNkbEz8ZA">https://youtu.be/yMfNkbEz8ZA</a></p>

<p>At the time they were unsure of the moon&#39;s surface composition. They had educated guesses, absolutely; but there was no way to know until they touched down. They ultimately didn&#39;t know if they would sink into quicksand or hit rock. No way would any pilot take that risk when it came down to the moment, especially one who trained to touchdown gently, as the video shows.</p>

<p>Right, for practice.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They had a pretty good idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They ultimately didn&#39;t know if they would sink into quicksand or hit rock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They knew it was solid since they&#39;d already landed unmanned vehicles on it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well they were test pilots, it was sort of their job.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure anyone willing to take the perilous first trip to the moon wouldn&#39;t be any more or less worried about some space sand enveloping their lander than anything else.</p>

<p>Moon landing conspiracies have been pretty widespread since the 1990s, and I don&#39;t think many people in the mainstream consider the moon landing hoax theory to be less crazy than flat earth.</p>

<p>All conspiracy movements have their limited hangouts, I don&#39;t think these are designed to discredit conspiracy theories, but to prevent us from actually reaching the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth theory was particularly popular back in the late 1800s-early 1900s (with the &quot;zetetic&quot; movement and dozens of books), long before the faked Moon landings. It was only recently popularized again due to the internet and YouTube. </p>

<p>Many people ended up looking into flat earth sometime after they realized the landings were faked and they were already aware of the lies of NASA, so it makes sense they would mention it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did read the link i sent, actually, and it affirms my point either way you look at it.</p>

<p>I cant bring myself to believe they built a delicate piece of equipment, flew all the way to the moon, and allowed the lander and crew (over 36,000 lbs, and still over 6,000 lbs at lunar gravity) to slam down onto the surface without using thrusters to arrest their decent? Without ever having performed this maneuver on this surface? </p>

<p>I welcome criticism, it leads to greater understanding. I look forward to reading your post outlining your views and debunking own, since you haven&#39;t made any. At all.</p>

<p>LMAO They didn&#39;t really fly it all the way to the moon. They mostly just sorta pointed it in one direction and it went there. Yunno, gravity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and still over 6,000 lbs at lunar gravity</p>

<p>So like the weight of a small truck?</p>

<p>Why would you assume no thrusters were used?</p>

<p>LMAO good thing they had those skilled pilots and a team of engineers and mathematicians. </p>

<p>Of course those other apollo missions which attempted things like orbital insertion didn&#39;t hurt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple rocket mechanics. The lander is slowed by the exhaust gasses exiting from the bottom of the nozzle at high velocities. As the lander gets closer to the surface, these gasses exert force on the surface and the loose dust/sand. One would expect the dust below the nozzle to be displaced to some degree, as the rovers&#39; tires clearly displaced the loose dust. </p>
