<p>A really good insight to the basis / thoughts:

<p>It seems like Intent motive and means- Also this came out today (9/11 and thermite mentioned). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/5cr8oh/wikileaks_encryption_keys/">https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/5cr8oh/wikileaks_encryption_keys/</a></p>

<p>TL/DR If you ever were to attempt to call 9/11 an &quot;inside job&quot;.
That looks like the best proof you will ever ever get-</p>

<p>Note: Probably screen shot everything while its all up---</p>

<p>Edit / Update: (wrong link this one haha)...
<a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?query=gerald+bakes&amp;exact_phrase=&amp;any_of=&amp;exclude_words=&amp;document_date_start=&amp;document_date_end=&amp;released_date_start=&amp;released_date_end=&amp;new_search=True&amp;order_by=most_relevant#results">https://search.wikileaks.org/?query=gerald+bakes&amp;exact_phrase=&amp;any_of=&amp;exclude_words=&amp;document_date_start=&amp;document_date_end=&amp;released_date_start=&amp;released_date_end=&amp;new_search=True&amp;order_by=most_relevant#results</a>   (there are 40 emails that appear to have be missing)</p>

<p>Stratfor is an intelligence agency- This dude is likely not a joe blow me. His inside knowledge seems impeccable.
he mentions things that are unreal.. Any guesses at to who this it? gerald bakes?</p>

<p>Update 2 Thinks this is him...
<a href="https://disqus.com/by/google-f0878e42d0133987f53e0532e9d41553/">https://disqus.com/by/google-f0878e42d0133987f53e0532e9d41553/</a></p>

<p>THATS DEF HIM MISSING 3 YEARS- Best I could do I am going to sleep night reddit - 
Have fun playing scubby Dew</p>

<p>UPDATE: Plot thickens:
<a href="http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/hammond-sabu-fbi-stratfor-hack/">http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/hammond-sabu-fbi-stratfor-hack/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Stratfor_email_leak</a></p>

<p>Stratfor was hacked, following 9/11 which is how wikileaks came into access of these cables. </p>

<p>Thoughts. Currently the FIB is Investigating the DOJ - 
The Fib Used SABU to Push Hammond into hacking Stratfor - </p>

<p>The files at stratfor are from quote: agents, companies, Clients. Nowhere would any &quot;citizen&quot; even know these email contact routes. As Sabu apparently Informed Hammond about Stratfor in the first place - 
Just thoughts - Maybe there is a coupe, and the FIB learned that this was all orchestrated and this info is all Correct, so the DOJ is Complicit?</p>

<p>Weird?</p>

<p>Your comment seems to imply that &quot;working on behalf of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth&quot; is grounds for questioning the information here and possibly not believing it.  Can you ELI5 me on that?  I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong here because I honestly don&#39;t know enough about the dynamic to say yay or nay - which is why I&#39;m asking about it here.  What exactly do you think is going on w/the OP?</p>

<p>I was talking about the thread title and header which incorrectly suggest that this is some sort of leak from an institution, indicating knowledge of foul play. Hopefully, by looking at the email, you can recognize that it is a spam newsletter (if your inbox is like mine, you get tons of &#39;em).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the motivation is for getting this so severely wrong... could be lots of things... possibilities include (but should not be limited to) awful reading comprehension, the motivation to muddy the waters for people who really want to know things, or maybe they like seeing their post karma go weeee into the sky... doesn&#39;t matter, cuz they won&#39;t tell me. I&#39;m going to go look for another thread that doesn&#39;t make my head hurt. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a big time skeptic.</p>

<p>I believe that the Disclosure movement is a very old psyop (starting around Roswell). I believe that the original purposes were to make the Military/Industrial complex seem more powerful than it actually was and, later, as a way to mask endemic fraud (the missing trillions of defense $$$). Going by Occam&#39;s Razor, I find that theft by the robber-barons is just a teensy bit more likely than secret space technology.</p>

<p>I am also a straight tinfoiler when it comes to the Apollo Missions. In my lifetime, I have never seen a human being further than 471 nautical miles from earth. Supposedly, the moon is 227,000 miles away, and we did it back in the 60&#39;s with slide-rule technology. I truly believe that the conquest of the moon was a greater feat of media than engineering. As to the astronauts themselves, I have wavered on whether or not I believe them to be lying. It is possible that the astronauts&#39; handlers utilized hypnosis so that they actually believed that they were there. Just the same, I think Buzz Aldrin is an active liar. I believe the same of Edgar Mitchell because of his links with Hoaglund (a famous disinfo guy). Not a super great explanation, but it gives you the gist of my ideas. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your explanation. I see where you&#39;re coming from, although I&#39;ve heard too many witness testimonies to believe it&#39;s all a psyop. Mitchell is just the tip of the iceberg, and he&#39;s far from a good witness compared to some others, like his fellow astronaut Gordon Cooper. (Not a lunar astronaut.) </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also had personal experiences with aliens. (And yes, I acknowledge that these &quot;aliens&quot; might be produced by advanced human tech camouflaging as alien tech.) And I&#39;ve seen several alien craft (flying), and family members (and acquaintances) of mine have seen them too, in one instance up close and with humanoid beings visible through the outer shell of the hovering, silent craft. </p>

Never saw a damn thing other than satellites, meteorites, and an aurora borealis. Later, as a civilian, I saw something - just a metallic sphere in the sky. A few seconds later, it was gone.

<p>If you have posted about what you have seen, link me to it. I am interested to learn the details of your encounters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In other words,  wikileaks and Assange are consistent about not publishing material from establishment insiders that points to 9/11 planning.    We knew that.   Its consistently a WL stand,  we know they carefully decide what to publish and what not to.   The 9/11 truth movement stands on its own without help from WL.   Thats kind of a shame,  and it says more about WL than it does about the facts of 9/11.</p>

<p>For an explanation of why WL and Assange take this position,  there are plenty of other reddit posts that have discussed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this. </p>

<p>I fabricated this email in 2011, shortly after 9/11 because I knew that the global intelligence firm would intercept it. 
I worked under the auspicious operating notion that &quot;once secured&quot;; The FBI would coerce a hacker with an undercover agent to then hack said intelligence company; </p>

<p>This allowed for a small window for our coerced perp to contact a known whistle blowing agency and release the intentionally misleading documents that implicate governments hand in the crisis; Which had nothing to do with the very factual auspiciousness of governmental fraud that coincided in the events- </p>

<p>Fast Forward:
After waiting 5 years in pain and agony, I finally today was able to reap the rewards of my hard work and effort, and now I am raining in all that sweet karma -!</p>

<p>I almost got away with it too! Next time I suppose I will have to try harder, and be weary of the users who out-thought my amazing conspiracy!</p>

<p>&#39;In the midst of all this, Building 6 was destroyed by explosions from within.&#39;</p>

<p>Hmm, <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-35A-7PD5x0/maxresdefault.jpg">building 6</a> is rarely mentioned, even within the 9/11 truth movement.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty interesting how the outer walls of WTC 6 are still standing, yet the inside is hollowed out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not alone shredgnar10. I read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? over 5¬Ω years ago. It&#39;s obvious who the scumbags are that cover up this secret technology from their own actions. </p>

<p>The 9/11 official story is:</p>

<p>Nineteen fanatical Arab hijackers, masterminded by an evil genius named Osama bin Laden, crash airplanes into steel skyscrapers because they ‚Äúhate our freedom to consume‚Äù. (And what did Bush tell us to do right after the event? Go shopping!‚Äù) Inexplicably the jet fuel, which is basically kerosene that burns at about 400c, took on the qualities of an explosive demolition agent, vaporizing 70 tons of aircraft into a puff of smoke and causing 110-story buildings to collapse into a pile of rubble.</p>

<p>The 9/11 Truth Movement has the dual purpose of vectoring genuine truth seekers to dead ends, where anger, hype, and paranoia endlessly stress the seeker and those around him or her, and to facilitate the mainstream media‚Äôs task of branding those who ask questions of authority and the true nature of reality as insane. What if the 9/11 Truth Movement is nothing more than a pseudo-movement promoting a government ‚Äúalternative official‚Äù story?</p>

<p>When the truth about 9/11 is finally exposed, not only will the wars be ended, but the world will finally be liberated from the grip of the oil companies. If you are interested in evidence and not opinion, read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? as I did over 5¬Ω years ago.</p>

<p>Popular theories about what destroyed the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001 are:</p>

<p>1 Fires from jet fuel and office materials weakened steel in the upper floors and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>2 Conventional controlled demolition blew out supports at the base and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>3 Thermite cut steel columns on virtually every floor and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>4 Conventional explosives blew the buildings up</p>

<p>5 Mini-nukes blew the buildings up</p>

<p>Theories 1, 2 and 3 rely on gravity to bring the buildings down while the last two blow them up. Popular theories, yes, and dead wrong.</p>

<p>Five facts scientifically documented in Ph.D. engineer Judy Wood‚Äôs comprehensive textbook (Where Did The Towers Go?) prove the popular theories false beyond any doubt whatsoever. Yes, I know it‚Äôs amazing. Who‚Äôd a thunk it‚Äôd be this easy? I&#39;m a thinker and not a believer. It is in the interest of the government to have a population of believers and not thinkers. The media assists this goal explicitly and in concert as agents-of-influence. </p>

<p>THE FACTS:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>DEBRIS: What debris? There was so little debris from each 110-story building that there was no ‚Äúpile‚Äù or ‚Äústack.‚Äù Rubble totaled less than a story. It was a football field as a survivor who emerged from Stairwell B, North Tower, exclaimed. No computers, toilets, and only one small piece from one Steel-case file cabinet were found. Some steel and mostly dust remained. Lack of debris on the ground from quarter-mile-high twin towers whispers ‚Äúno collapse.‚Äù See Chapter 9.</p></li>
<li><p>BATHTUB: A bathtub or slurry wall surrounded 70 feet of WTC subbasements to prevent the Hudson River from flooding the WTC and downtown. If each 500,000-ton tower had slammed into the bathtub in 10 seconds or less, the protective wall would collapse. Did not happen. Upshot? Collapses did not happen. See Chapter 5.</p></li>
<li><p>SEISMIC IMPACT: ‚ÄúHad the towers collapsed, foundation bedrock would have experienced tremendous force hammering on it throughout the ‚Äòcollapse,‚Äô‚Äù writes Dr. Wood. Seismic instruments registered disturbances far too short in duration and far too small to record tower collapses. This was true of both the twin towers and 47-story WTC7. Again, no evidence of collapses. See Chapter 6.</p></li>
<li><p>SOUND: There were no loud explosions, as established by videos, witnesses, and the official report of NIST. Nor were there loud screeches and screams from massive metal falling, colliding, scraping and collapsing on metal. See Chapter 6.</p></li>
<li><p>DUST: Photos, videos and witness testimony show the towers turned to powder in mid-air. Tim McGinn, NYPD, said, ‚ÄúI was standing there for a couple of seconds thinking where the f**k is the tower? I simply couldn‚Äôt comprehend it.‚Äù The dust roll-out was so enormous and thick it blocked out sunlight and left an inch or more of dust covering downtown. Much of it wafted into the upper atmosphere. The volume was incredible. Particles from dust samples were smaller than red blood cells and about the size of DNA. As for toxicity, researchers said the dust ‚Äúrecorded the highest levels we have ever seen in over 7,000 measurements we have made of very fine air pollution throughout the world, including Kuwait and China.‚Äù See Chapters 8, 9, 14-16.</p></li>

<p>Jackie being in on it is oart of the Michael Collins Piper &quot;Jews did it&quot; theory. As she was a Jewess and a known CIA agent. I think her name, Lee, was really Levi. And her mom once got a nasty nasty letter from the real Virginia Lee family asking her to stop pretending or insinuating to people that she was related to them. Ouch!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a number of Mandela effect videos that claim the JFK assassination has changed and is &quot;evidence&quot; to the Mandela effect (changes in the history of past events, in which mass numbers of the population remember events from a different timeline).  In the Zapruder film, you see JFKs car has 6 seats, but a lot of people only remember 4 seats in the film.  Also, some claim the the Zapruder film now shows that JFK fatal head shot may have been Jackie Kennedy shooting him after the throat shot.  Check out some of the videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;Mandela Effect&quot; is the name given to the phenomenon of mass quantities of people &#39;mis-remembering&#39; facts or events. </p>

<p>The name comes from one example where thousands of people claimed to &quot;remember&quot; Nelson Mandela dying in prison. As we know, in this reality, Mandela was released from prison and only died a few years ago in his eighties. </p>

<p>There are dozens, if not hundreds, of other examples... like <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-berensteain-bears-conspiracy-theory-that-has-convinced-the-internet-there-are-parallel-universes">BerenstEin Bears / BerenstAin Bears</a> is another very popular one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did look into the Mandela effect phenomena and am still not quite convinced. I do remember a couple of things differently as we&#39;re pointed out such as the Forrest Gump line and Star wars line that are supposedly different than I remember but I can&#39;t be 100% certain I didn&#39;t just misrremember. As far as building 6 being mentioned as a ME effect I find that interesting because I do remember hearing and reading about it being crushed by the towers and still not totally collapsing however it&#39;s rarely mentioned which makes me wonder if there is a separate cover up of some kind focused on building 6 and maybe the fact it was rarely talked about anywhere is evidence of cover up and also why people may have never heard of it until now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I&#39;m not 100% convinced of the Mandela Effect myself, but there are some compelling elements to the theory.

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the Mandela effect there are people who swear they watched Nelson Mandelas funeral and there are people swear they saw him get released from prison so it is very strange that so many people could get it so wrong. Before I jump to the conclusion of alternate timelines I would be curious to know if they attempted to fake his death to part of the world via the news and it backfired or if it was some sort of long term way to mess with the masses. It seems like you could simply write it off as people misremembering but some people are very certain of what they saw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I completely agree, very well put. Im just glad there are people who still care to get to the truth about 9/11. Almost everyone around me in my life has long since bought the official story as well as the idea that it&#39;s wrong to question the official narritive. It&#39;s almost like no matter how much proof we provide some people just simply are unable or unwilling to accept that they&#39;ve been lied to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I told y&#39;all!!! Just did a post here a few days ago saying building 6 is the smoking gun.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the deal...The Mandela Effect is going to be our key to unlocking all this shit. Those with the old memories are being given all new information and that information is key. I&#39;m telling you. Same with JFK assassination. I&#39;ll say more if I don&#39;t get downvoted into oblivion. </p>

<p>Edit to add:</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to talk about what&#39;s &quot;new&quot; when I don&#39;t know what y&#39;all already know. It&#39;s complicated but...The veil is being lifted on so many of the mysteries that have fascinated us for eons. Not just 911 and building 6 and the ball video, not just JFK and the French Zapruder film, not just the Lindbergh baby mystery (solved!), not just the new Pyramid of Gaza, or even universal questions like earth&#39;s location in the galaxy (did anyone think we were in the Sagittarius arm?) and what that means for flat earth theory...</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that any of this information is new though. In this reality (or whatever) we&#39;ve always been in the Orion spur, there have always been 6 people in the limo, building 6 always had a crazy explosion in the middle, the Lindbergh baby mystery was solved in months, etc.</p>

<p>So, what if we look at what has been revealed by the Mandela Effect? I keep mentioning the French Zapruder film. That&#39;s going to solve JFK. All the information that is &quot;new&quot; is the key.</p>

<p>Oh, and pizza gate and the ruling families is another example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story is that the version of the Zapruder film we&#39;ve all seen was edited by the CIA prior to release. They blurred the actual head wound. But there was rumored to be an uncensored version. Well, here it is and it&#39;s fucking gory. Also, been out for years, apparently (but that&#39;s back to the Mandela Effect).</p>

Except, we do have some evidence on our side. It&#39;s not useful to people who aren&#39;t experiencing this, but it makes us feel better.</p>

<p>For example, I was always under the impression that we are on the outskirts of the Sagittarius arm but apparently we&#39;ve always been on the Orion spur. There&#39;s a Neil Degrassi segment on Startalk that mentions us being on Sagittarius arm, but that&#39;s just what we call residual evidence and others call an error. It&#39;s crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Caved in shorty after collapse due to damage&quot;...</p>

<p>That is not a free fall acceleration, symmetrical collapse into its own footprint..the point is building 6 damage is about what you would expect for being so close to the collapse which gives researchers a good reference close by during the same incident. Building 7s collapse on the other hand is a textbook controlled demolition. If you are still in denial about that it is probably too late for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is freaking me out... I read the email... what the ruffneck says is true... I repasted my comment to you because I can&#39;t tell if everyone else in here is bots...</p>

<p>If you look at the mailing list, this was not an internal email, but some guy trying to get the press to reopen the 9/11 investigation. Look He was probably working on behalf of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth...</p>

<p>I find it very creepy that, as of now, this thread has 118 upvotes, 20 comments, and not one points out this fact.</p>

<p>Before you downvote me to hell, I&#39;m a truther too... Is this some new CTR shilling, or do we have serious issues with reading comprehension (seriously)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the dude is totally redpilled like the rest of us. Might even be one of those educated engineers or architects.</p>

<p>most likely, they are scrubbed because he tries to break the MSM like the rest of us. Either that, or there&#39;s a limited retention to comments on online articles (I saw that his most recent post was 3 years ago).</p>

<p>If this guy is as paranoid as the rest of us (and/or an architect or engineer) it would make sense that he wouldn&#39;t use his real name in comments; it is reasonable to think that he could face institutional persecution for spreading these ideas.</p>

<p>This was written directly to the intelligence agency, (period)...
 It is from a very sophisticated user, whose complexity leads one to considering that they themselves had a pre existing relationship to the agency.

    <div class="md"><p>I am also talking about r/conspiracy - In general Reddit is heavily censored and controlled through out most popular forums like r/news and r/politics (top 100). Articles about corporate crimes, the US intelligence community, the T.B.T.F. financial institutions, inequality and political scandals and corruptions are being monitored very closely and often vote manipulated/removed/shilled/banned by the moderator team. They purge whole moderator teams, those who are just volunteers, 100&#39;s of users, if they think it is necessary. The Reddit administrator team will deny it, they will censor anything about the censorship, but it doesn&#39;t stop everyone from talking about it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, this is really good stuff!</p>

<p><em>Gelatin = Gelatin referring to a type of explosive. Likely the team that was in charge of the nano-solgel addition (patented paint-on nano-thermate) to the buildings, mainly targeting the 47 core columns at impact point (initiation), the interior core columns (every 6 floors), and the corner sections (every 12-15 floors).</em></p>

<p><em>E-Team = Possibly referring to Explosive-Team? Likely the team that was in charge of the wiring/prep for the outer core concussive charges (every 3 floors) as well as the attack zone &quot;visuals&quot; at impact point (with their name being used to make sure everything was lined up right inside/outside).</em></p>

<p><em>Then the actual explosives for the impact zone visuals and the outer core column charges were likely added over an ~5 day period starting on Sept 6, 2001 (which just so happens to be the day that &quot;bomb-sniffing dogs were abruptly removed&quot;, a large amount of &quot;telecom upgrades&quot; were being done throughout the buildings (which is why the occupancy in the towers was so low, a lot of occupants had Mon/Tues off), and a series of &quot;powerouts&quot; took place over huge sections of each tower (related to the telecom upgrades)).</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>Added Context:</p>

<p>WTC 1/2 Collapse Demolition</p>

<p><em>Phase 1 - Collapse Initiation - The 1st attack was a complete horizontal severance of all 47 core columns at each impact zone to initiate the start of each collapse using nano-thermate sol-gel incendiary charges.</em></p>

<p><em>Phase 2 - Outer Core Columns - The 2nd attack was on the outer core columns (strongest ones), which were taken down every 3 floors using concussive charges placed adjacent too the welds.</em></p>

<p><em>Phase 3 - Exterior Corner Sections - The 3rd attack was on the corner sections of the building (hardest to get to), which were taken down using nano-thermate sol-gel incendiary charges every ~15 floors.</em></p>

<p><em>Phase 4 - Inner Core Columns - The 4th attack then followed with a complete severance of the remaining internal core columns (the delayed skeleton collapse) every 6 floors using nano-thermate sol-gel incendiary charges.</em></p>

<p><em>These 4 &quot;attacks&quot; then happened in overlapping cycles, in a wave down each building over an ~10 second period in this order... 1 to initiate each collapse at the desired time, followed by 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4... repeated ~10x per tower all the way down.</em></p>

<p>There is a very interesting one in there that talks about JFK, Marilyn Monroe, and 9/11.  It is from an ex KBG officer and was a manual written for Hillary.</p>

<p>This one says:</p>

<p>:Strobe and Gore (as VP) were agents of influence of the KGB.:</p>

<p>&quot;I shutter to think how many Obama appointees are reporting to the enemy. (RUSSIA)
Fortunately, Biden is too dumb to be reporting to anyone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Post subject: And yet another perspective on 9/11, interesting though.Posted: Tue Aug 24, 2010 12:59 am

Joined: Thu Jun 18, 2009 7:54 am Posts: 597 Location: Jacksonville, FL Let me tell you, there&#39;s a great deal of obfuscation going on. The answer to almost every question posed of this type is, &quot;follow the money&quot; and that&#39;s precisely what I&#39;ve done.
My position is that almost all 911 truth organizations have been compromised and I maintain that position based on my research into this event and that the truths I&#39;ve discovered are not discussed by ANY of the 911 truth movements. I can describe perfectly in rather short order why 911 took place when it did, what the 3 primary reasons behind the event were and specifically who was responsible. I can also provide the data necessary to see both why and how the actual reality behind the event is and was covered up and more importantly, why it will remain so.
Why did the events of 911 happen on 911? Was this a &quot;date specific&quot; event?
Yes, the event was specific to 9/11/2001.
911 happened on 911 because on 9/12/2001 two hundred and forty billion dollars in fraudulent securities became due and payable by the US treasury and paying those securities would have exposed the necessary links in 100s of massive, global international money laundering schemes and 100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison based on 100s of current and ongoing investigations at that time. Evidence of money laundering, arms sales, drug sales, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and many more crimes were destroyed forever.
100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison?
Yes. The FBI, the CIA, the SEC, Customs, the Secret Service, IRS, the Office Of Naval Intelligence, banking regulators and global intelligence organizations as well as a number of other government agencies were tracking the money laundering activities related to gold market manipulation and global international money laundering. The &quot;Eldorado Task Force&quot; was a group of 55 intergovernmental agencies devoted to investigating international money laundering. These investigations all began after 1989 and were tracking years of fraudulent but very sophisticated money laundering schemes. ALL investigations were immediately halted on 9/12/2001 because not only was ALL of the evidence destroyed but 100s of the government and non-government investigators were also killed.
Did anything unusual happen on 9/12/2001?
Yes. For the first time in US history the Federal Reserve cleared 240 billion dollars in securities ANONYMOUSLY thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission invoked its emergency powers under SEC Act Section 12(k) and eased regulatory restrictions for the clearance of international securities on 9/11/2001. Think about that. The Federal Reserve allowed an anonymous individual or individuals to be paid 240 billion dollars in US denominated funds without revealing their names, location or legal status. As a result of the events of 911 George Bush, the SEC and the Federal Reserve approved the dispensing of &quot;Securities Clearance&quot; laws, for less then 15 days, a presidential approved breach of National Security, for the first time in history.
Why did George Bush and the Federal Reserve do this?
In 1989 a scheme was devised to end the Cold War and destroy the Soviet Union. The plan included crashing the currency and thus the economy, buying up the Soviet infrastructure at pennies on the dollar and leaving the Soviet Union a shell of its former self. The plan worked. In order to promote a sophisticated plan to crash the economy of the Soviet Union a massive amount of money was needed and the Federal Reserve, the SEC and with the blessings of George Bush, approved the counterfeiting of 240 billion dollars in bearer bonds, commonly referred to as Brady Bonds. This scheme was covered fully under &quot;National Security.&quot; There were 4 parts to this &quot;National Security&quot; scheme:
a. Theft of the Soviet Treasury
b. Currency Destabilization of the Ruble
c. Funding the KGB Generals 1991 coup against Gorbachev
d. Takeover of key Soviet energy and defense industries by Western powers
What exactly did they do once the bonds were floated?
Using various global intelligence assets, foreign banks and large international corporations with off-shore accounts, like Enron, but many others, they destroyed the Russian Ruble causing its value to plunge. They then bought oil, gas, steel and commodities exporters, major technological institutions and water, electric and agricultural firms within the Soviet Union. By buying up the infrastrusture (energy and defense) and then selling off the assets the economic viability of the Soviet Union was destroyed.
What were the 3 primary reasons for 911?
The first and foremost reason for the events of 911 was to conceal the identities of the 100s of intelligence assets, international bankers, elected officials and international players involved in the demise of the Soviet Union and to prevent the exposure of a &quot;National Security&quot; event, the destruction of the Soviet Union. The 2nd reason behind the events of 911 was to end for all time the ongoing investigations by numerous government and non-government organizations into these money laundering and gold market manipulations. The 3rd reason behind 911 was to provide the cover to allow for vilification of Islam and for blame to be placed on Islamic Fundamentalists allowing for public opinion to support extended wars to acquire global petroleum and mining resources.
Were the several planes targeting specific locations?
Yes. Each plane on 911 had specific targets all of which were hit with great precision. There were 3 major securities brokers in the Twin Towers, Cantor Fitzgerald (largest in US), Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 11 hit the North Tower right below the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald destroying all records of securities transactions. Cantor Fitzgerald was the primary target. Flight 175 hit the South Tower below the offices of Eurobrokers and while this all took place massive explosions were reported in the North Tower under FBI offices on the 23rd floor and under Garbon Intercapital on the 25th floor again destroying any and all securities records. Flight 77 hit the Pentagon targeting the Office Of Naval Intelligence where investigators were working on illegal international financial schemes based out of the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 77 not only destroyed all records related to these investigations but it also killed 39 of the 40 Naval Intelligence Investigators. The flight that crashed in Pennsylvania missed its target, building 7. All certificates for US bonds and other securities were completly destroyed.
Since this was a murder are there clues if we examine the fatalities?
Yes. Forty-One percent of the fatalities in the Twin Towers came from the two corporations that managed US government securities, Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers. Thirty-One percent of the fatalities at the Pentagon were from the Naval Command Center that housed the office of Naval Intelligence where 39 of 40 investigators were killed.
How is this cover-up maintained?
The event was a &quot;National Security&quot; event. Anyone connected whether media or elected officials are given the excuse that &quot;National Security&quot; is and was at stake and that&#39;s all that needs to be said. 911 hides the purposeful destruction of the Soviet Economy, massive crimes attached to that, and the need for a massive crime to cover up these massive crimes.
Who was involved?
I&#39;m going to list the major players in no specific order. Please remember, the events of 911 were designed to cover up illegal global international financial activity by many people, both elected and non-elected, whose privileged lives were about to go up in smoke, whose pampered lifestyles would have, if not for 911, been reduced to a life in prison. In essence, 911 was a National Security event designed to cover other National Security events, or, depending upon your perspective, a massive crime to cover even more massive crimes.

In a number of cases murder and false imprisonment (see Leo Wanta) seemed to be the mainstay of efforts to prevent any remorseful participants from going public with their stories. While accomplishing the objective - bringing about the demise of the Soviet Union - the scheme also seems to have lined the pockets of the individuals that executed the policies at US taxpayer expense.
