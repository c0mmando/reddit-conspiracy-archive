       I remember someone posting a conspiracy thread where they showed polls from phone apps that showed that Stein was actually beating Clinton massively, and not far behind Trump. The person theorized their plan was to swap Stein votes over to Clinton to steal the election that way.

       I do. I decided to go with Gary because I'm very pro-vacc and Stein has a view in that regard I cannot agree with. I find her views very outlandish, while I saw real probability that the Libs could hit the 5% mark. I like some of her ideas but others are incredibly ridiculous to think they could come to fruition or be beneficial.

       For what it's worth, she's not anti-vacc. She's very strongly pro-independent testing of vaccinations before they are administered to the public. In other words, don't let the pharma companies that make the vaccine fund the studies that test to see if the vaccines are safe and effective.

      <p>
       That's not outlandish at all.

       Are there any other views of hers that you are against? Cause I'd bet you've been misinformed. The media did a subtle but effective smear job on her and her viewpoints this election season.

       Care to elaborate as to why you don't believe it's reasonable? Do you not think we can get there, given our current technologies, or do you not think these are things we should be pushing towards in the first place? Just curious.

       Two big things leap out at me First off, while I agree our agriculture needs some cleaning up if we go back entirely to organic we are not going to have any where near the yields we have now. Food prices will climb. Second is both mentions of recycling everything. While we do need more recycling with specific things in the US the problem is recycling is more energy intensive in many cases.

       I disagree. HRC was the absolute epitome of the Democrats ideological extreme. You just might not agree with what the Democratic Party has become.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrats aren't left anymore. They're centrist. They only seem left compared to the Republicans who have swung further to the right.

      <p>
       I think the main problem with the ideological extremes of every party, which I agree with you on, is that the people voting for their candidates have the expectations and/or the misunderstanding that these ideologies should be accomplished and achieved in 4-8 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either because of such expectations, or perhaps it's partially the cause of such expectations, our political candidates' rhetoric leans heavily towards promising they can accomplish these goals during their time in office. Ultimately, this is why we're all left so disappointed every 4-8 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not what party platforms are for. They are not 4-8 year agendas to be accomplished if their candidate gets into office. They are long-term, multi-generational goals to work towards.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, we will not be able to go back to purely organic farming within the next 4-8 years. That doesn't mean it would be asinine to take strides to see what new technologies and/or methodologies we might be able to create to get us closer to that goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, recycling is more energy intensive in many cases, but how do we get to a point where it's not? We start focusing on it now, and make whatever steps we can, whenever and wherever we can, in order to get us there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in terms of a quick-fix, immediate results, automatic solutions kind of thing... yeah, sure, the Green Party's platform may seem a bit out of reach. But in that whole "planting trees whose shade we know we shall never sit in" sort of way... their platform isn't outlandish at all. It's just laying out the direction they'd like to work towards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, to get back to Jill Stein in particular, it's worth noting that none of these points were part of her campaign pledges.

       the key is to not make them mandatory. dont people understand how expensive vaccines would be if they were mandatory? We are talking billions of dollars. You think your 1000 dollar  a month obama care payments are a lot now?  hold onto your butts....

       I was full-on expecting that Johnson would get at least 9% of the vote. For fuck's sake, he had been polling at 22% in New Mexico and been tied for second in the border states for a month prior to 11/8. I was calling bullshit on it to my Libertarian buddy and he wasn't surprised a bit; he said a lot of people were really upset and didn't vote. Apparently the week before the election Bill Weld decided it would be appropriate to endorse Hillary. Talk about campaign suicide... "We're not gonna win anyway, go vote for Clinton!" I hadn't heard about it, myself, but I had seen several months ago where Weld said he looked up to Merkel... They couldn't have been too serious about their campaign.

       Isn't that the same polling we aren't supposed to trust because it's controlled? Or at the very least very wrong.

       Well, to a degree it's controlled. You can only fudge the numbers so much, right? I had no problem believing that he was polling that high in New Mexico - he is very liked there, where he served two terms as governor. But I don't know, your explanation certainly plays into it too- many people did inevitably think it better to vote for Clinton or Trump when it came voting time. I'm positive that Johnson's numbers dwindled because of Weld, though. I'm not a member of any of the groups he's in but all the Libertarian-minded people he had on Facebook were blowing up these groups because of how pissed off they were that Weld endorsed Clinton. Johnson lost a very significant amount of his supporters from that.

       Since it isn't an actual vote, there's no harm in telling a pollster who you'd like to vote for, but on election day, if that person is polling very much in 3rd place, you'd be wasting your vote if you don't vote for one of the top two instead.  So the difference is probably just people who realized he didn't have enough support to win and so they voted for someone else.

       maybe they decided they couldnt take Trumps votes so they long shotted it and tried to steal a small portion from each other candidate that was unnoticable in and of itself, but combined they thought they would get the victory? I dunno, i exist in a pretty right wing echo chamber.

       I think anyone who said that was an idiot. I thought she had the higher odds, but the assumption that the status-quo candidate with no enthusiastic backing would motivate enough people to vote and make her win the swing states, was stupid. That being said, I do not believe the strong Trump supporters outweigh those who don't like him, and I don't think that's even close.

       Skewing the polls on purpose would make no sense, and would not help anyone. I've talked about this a lot in other threads, and why Trump won despite her being up. I've seen no reason to believe that the majority of our country loves Trump.

       Also, FYI, democrats often have slight overrepresentation in polling for a reason. Which is that there are slightly more people who identify as democrats than republicans. Equal representation of parties in polling would not be representative of the country.

       Hillary's only real reach to "steal" an election was with her establishment backing and support/insiders in the media. She didn't, and feasibly couldn't, actually steal the votes. Which is especially proven by the fact that we currently have President Trump.

       The problem, in my opinion, with polling during this election year is the faith in the term "likely voters", when we have deeply hated candidates, unexciting candidates, and candidates primarily backed by the least likely demographics to show up to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 2014, there are only 3 samples out of about 40 that put republicans ahead, and only 7 in the "leaners" group. Altogether, democrats are ahead by at least a few points. You can't look at a couple outliers and call it even.

       Also, to touch on that D+10 instance you're talking about, that's just going to happen sometimes, particularly when democrats have a larger percentage in the country. But that's why we primarily rely on aggregate polling (I don't like when the media freaks out about single polls toward either side).
      </p>

       Some of these polls, like this one, are not made to have participants screened and create accurately representative samples of party demographics. It's just random polling, with sample size justifying its accuracy. That can swing many different ways. It's hardly evidence of manipulation, and even if they wanted to do that, they could have falsified data to show Hillary polling higher with independents and republicans. You can disagree with their methodology, but they're showing you what it is.

       The nonresponse rate accounts for the inaccuracies of polls as of late.  While they're still selecting a sample of, say, 1000 people, today they have to go through twenty times that to find people who actually are willing to answer.  And what are people who answer likely to be?  People with strong political ideologies.  Most Trump voters were in the middle but ended up swaying towards him.  So it makes sense that Hillary supporters would be overrepresented in the polls- because they actually answered them.

       Because polls being different from results are not enough to get you into a court.  Even

        exit polls showing her winning NC, PA, FL, and WI

       It really isn't.  It has happened before, although never quite on this scale, and never ended in court.  The only election to end in court was FL in 2000 and that was over how to conduct a recount.  Michigan is probably close enough to get a recount but that won't change the final result, so they probably won't ask for it.

       No, I completely agree with that. She had almost 0 enthusiasm for her outside hardcore feminist groups and super establishment guys. Her campaign was basically "maintain status quo, Trump is bad".
      </p>
      <p>
       But Trump is also so deeply disliked throughout the country. I have a big social circle across many cities and states, and the few Trump voters I know still think he's a moron. This was a unique election in which we had some of the worst candidates imaginable. I wouldn't see it as a surprise by any means that the hate against Trump is bigger than Hillary's unpopularity.

       Yes, but many people unenthusiastically voted for her.  I know very few people who voted for Trump, but I'm not ignorant enough to assume that my professional and social circles represent the country as a whole.  In fact, I don't think I've ever met someone from the dakotas.

       That said- if there was any significant malfeasance at the polls (and at my polling station it would have been easy to vote several times- the books were out, the booths were open and nobody was really checking anything), I would suspect it was by the dems in the swing states.  I feel like the republican apparatus didn't have enough of a dog in this fight, this time around.

       It's irrelevant whether she won the popular vote.  Were it the popular vote that matters, they both would have campaigned differently, and the outcome would have been different.  Just because Trump didn't win the popular vote doesn't mean that he couldn't have.

       Doubtless, the Democrats rigged the vote as much as they possibly could. Likely hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions, of votes either nullified, or flipped to their candidate, or ballot boxes stuffed, or non-Hillary voters prevented from voting, etc.

       I get the feeling the Democrats won many large urban centers quite overwhelmingly. It's consistent with many past years. I haven't seen any evidence of widespread ballot rigging yet. Florida would be the place I'd focus any investigation as it would be the epicenter if rigging was going on.

       Doesn't that unfairly give a ruling vote to a increasingly small rural community though? We have the same issue here in Canada where the vast majority of the population is urban, but rural ridings tend to represent much smaller populations. Not saying rural voters shouldn't have a voice but isn't it somewhat unfair that their vote would be worth more than an urban voters?

       At the time it did, today that would really just mean restricting the vote to the rich or to people who inherited their land, which I don't think is a good alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: also those outside cities obviously where land is a lot cheaper. It would just mean city dwellers like me would have to purchase land out in the middle of nowhere to get the right to vote.

       Then move. You're probably a liberal since you live in Toronto, the most degenerate place on earth. But hey, your right, some places are incredibly expensive so let's just disregard the landowner thing and compromise on who should be able to  vote, right? Firstly, judging by the IQ gap between whites and other races, the pedophilia and other crime issues with LGBT's, and the conformity of women, I'd be happy if only straight white men were allowed to vote. That's how we got Andrew Jackson and all the other great presidents. (AND also how we got the next great, Trump. Lolll)

       How do people who don't own land not have a stake in the country?  Do they not still pay taxes?   Are they not still affected by the laws passed by congress?  The first 9 elections had turnouts as a percentage of the total population of about 2%.  It was a democracy of the rich white men.

       No. The Electoral College is divided fairly by population. Less rural voters means more weight should be attached to the vote. Urban voters have more of a collective voice and a huge amount of Electors. I could say the same about places like California in LA/SA and New York. In states with mega-cities, rural voters have to abide by the overwhelmingly liberal state legislatures. That is a vote being unfair. Not the average liberal pseudo intellectual in cities who consistently vote Democrat time &amp; time again for presidential elections. Well, California since 1965.

       Ohio is another one. In fact, the Republicans rigged it twice and got away with it once. The 2nd time, I'll never forget the look on Karl Rove's face when they called Ohio for Obama in 2012.

       You have to remember that only 57% of eligible voters even voted, add to that that the eligible voter pool is only about 230 million out of a total population of 320 million.

       I have no problem believing that 70 million people support Clinton, its still a minority of the country but it creates this illusion that she won the popular vote. She had a slightly higher percentage of the 40% of the population that actually voted. Hell more people in the US don't have the right to vote (non-citizens, underage, ex-cons) than voted for Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise third party supporters were less likely to go out and vote since they knew their vote wouldn't change the overall election results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also of note, a lot of people can vote democrat without being pro-Clinton.

       California voter here, voted Johnson. My state goes democrat no matter what, I always vote for who I actually want and not who has the better chance. The whole, "every vote counts" thing only matters in battle ground states, people living anywhere else should not feel compelled to settle for a shitty main stream candidate as their vote won't change your state's outcome as a whole. What it will do though is show the establishment that more people are dissatisfied and are turning to 3rd parties.

       Especially with all the talk about not voting or voting 3rd party being a vote for Trump.
      </p>

       I bet there were a lot of people that bought into that and reluctantly voted straight ticket Democrat despite not supporting Clinton.

       The argument for Clinton over Trump post election is absolutely ridiculous. If people are going to protest and riot to block Trump, Clinton better not be the solution.

I've seen many Johnson signs, maybe 10-20, and 1 Hillary sign. It said "Hillary for prison." Hillary won in my county nearly 64% to 32%. Bullshit. No one here voted for her, at least not that many.

       took a day off from my tech job and volunteered as an election clerk in california. had 0 illegals at the precinct. in fact the only odd one was someone in town visiting from long beach county wanting to vote. we let him do provisional to not hold the line and our officer wasnt 100% about the situation but unfortunately, likely wont count.

       Team Clinton definitely engaged in election fraud.  But in the wrong states.  Just like generals fight the last war, their strategists would have been using out-dated data.  The level of anger and willingness to try new approaches hasn't been seen since the 60's.  Even then, no anti-establishment candidate gained traction; nor was social communication as pervasive and instantaneous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Team Clinton probably put their resources in the wrong states.  Their strategists fought the 2012 election.  They assumed or convinced themselves R's wouldn't have a candidate much more inspiring than Romney.

       I also wonder if there is a case for whether she "overdid it" or not.  CTR was so omnipresent and grasping.  Her message offered nothing, and in the end of her campaign they realized the negative ads weren't working.  All of this with the attitude that she was the heir apparent, and her win was already a fact.  "The bigger they are, the harder they fall."

       My anecdote of living in Milwaukee which was one of the few Democrat counties in Wisconsin this election:
      </p>
      <p>
       I never once saw a Clinton yard sign and I think maybe saw one or two bumper stickers. Trump? Many yard signs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that's such a small thing to note bit I can't remember ever an election where I didnt see both candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton was by far unpopular. So I'm sure she was voted for by diehard Democrats but I don't think that they were as energetic for her as others were for Trump.

       If they were cheating the election, wouldn't they have been able to get her to win? I can believe with the way third parties are treated that Jill didn't get many votes - even people that would have voted for her were possibly pressured to vote Hillary as an anti-Trump vote.

       Even if she did have popular vote, records show that there were fewer registered Democrats that voted this election.  It's almost like they got cocky and felt they couldn't lose... Problem is, if you don't vote, you have no right to complain.

       there is a 0% chance HRC won the popular vote. If Donald Trump had lost do you know all people would be doing is showing example after example of election fraud on Nov 8th. I live in Philly and there was so many reports it was insane.

       In Florida they got caught filling out the ballots in the back. That is literally just one person we happens to catch. Think about the couple hundred thousand we didn't catch.

       You could make a court case against in a few individual small scale cases that did not influence the outcome at all.  The fraud for Trump looks a lot more like large scale election fraud.

       The Democrats would not let Republicans poll watchers into the building who were legally supposed to be? How do you know how small scale that is? In Florida they were in the backroom filling out ballots. Those are just the people who got caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all due respect, you have given ZERO examples of anything related to election fraud. Are you saying the Republicans put fake votes in to the system? Yeah because it didn't appear that Trump had any momentum at all in his last week. Let's also ignore the Reuters poll that had him up by 6% the morning of the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I provide examples and you say it is small scale. While you provide no examples and call it large scale.

       You honestly believe that crap? North Koreas leadership always wins the popular vote. Saddam Hussein always won the popular vote. All dictators win the popular vote. Next you'll argue the popular vote was good for the Phillipines. Do you see the logic of the popular vote?

       The electoral college has been largely ceremonial for over a century now.  If they decided to do something now it would be hugely controversial.   I prefer to be pissed at the idiots who voted for him, particularly the Berniebros who voted for him out of spite.
