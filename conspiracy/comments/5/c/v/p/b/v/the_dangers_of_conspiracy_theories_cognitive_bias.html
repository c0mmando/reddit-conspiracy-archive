       There are conspiracies, and there are conspiracy theories.  I've had the "pleasure" now of following a few theories to a logical dead end over the past few months, but only after having gone down a rabbit hold of thinking I may have found
       <strong>
        THE FUCKING SMOKING GUN OF ALL TIME THAT WILL PUT CLINTON/PODESTA/HUMA/&lt;INSERT NAME&gt; AWAY FOR LIFE!!!!!!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I've found that if I really want to learn to do proper and meaningful investigations, I must be able to steady myself with healthy and regular introspection, along with detaching myself from any ideological agenda.
       <strong>
        The truth has no ideology.
       </strong>
       And it's just too damn easy to get caught up in making all kinds of connections that aren't there.  It's not much different than repeating religious dogma over and over until you start believing it.  Seriously, don't take your own shit too seriously, because most of it is just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've found there really is no end to my imagination.  If you keep looking for a conspiracy, you will find one, whether it exists or not.  Remember that.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Rule #1:  If you keep looking for a conspiracy, you will find one, whether it exists or not.
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And then there's the excitement.  It doesn't even fucking matter if I actually found a smoking gun.  The excitement of the hunt is great.  The excitement of other people discovering shit is great.  And then, every now and then, some
       <strong>
        ALMOST FUCKING SMOKING GUN
       </strong>
       is discovered by someone which is
       <strong>
        FUCKING AMAZING
       </strong>
       and maybe it even gets mentioned
       <strong>
        IN THE NEWS!
       </strong>
       And then there's relief, like after an orgasm, and you think where the fuck did this month go?  And then maybe you rest for a few days.  But then, you want that excitement again.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Rule #2: Conspiracy hunting exercises your imagination in an exciting way that is pleasurable, even if you don't find anything.
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Both of these rules are greatly enhanced in their allure if one is working on your own, or within a group that will eagerly eat up anything you give them.  And THAT happens ESPECIALLY when you focus your investigation along some ideological ground that unites people about a "cause".  The "truth" is ideologically neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Reddit itself is rewarding us with
       <strong>
        FUN VIRTUAL LIKES (TM)
       </strong>
       which essentially gives you some real social recognition since your posts can get upvoted to maybe fuck high.  That's gamification and it works most of the time for most people, either directly or indirectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       By all means, have fun and dig in, but keep your balance and wits about yourself.

       Part of the problem is that people are shamed into doubting themselves because of the stigma of the name "conspiracy theory".
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point,  its used as a way to settle the dispute between what happened,  and a lie about what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can have a hypothesis or a theory about something that has yet to be proven,  but in actual application of perceptions,  observations,  what we are talking about is already a proven fact and still is being called a "theory",  and more stupidly yet,  a "conspiracy".    Building 7 was demolished.   That is not a conspiracy and not a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now,  the idea that Hillary drinks murdered babies blood,  that has yet to be proven,  its still a theory,  and if she is indeed doing it,  with others help,  its a conspiracy on their part.    No objection to calling that a conspiracy theory for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way,  if you already have the power,  and the corporate media backing you,  you can make outrageous claims,  lies,  conspiracy theories about Russia interfering in elections,  and it will be accepted as a documented fact!
      </p>
      <p>
       So,  its often about power,  about politics.

       You got me thinking.  When they brought down the twin towers, someone probably said, "God help us."
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they didn't expect that many firefighters to be in the building at the time.  Maybe they thought the buildings would go into demolition mode immediately.  But they were in too deep.  Commitments had been made. There was no going back. "MY GOD, WHAT HAVE WE DONE?  (WHAT HAVE I DONE)?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And then they were rich.  And as real people, they felt sick about it.  They had to do something.  Something good.  To make up for what they had done.  No, they would never say that again, not even to themselves.  "For the events of that day."  That's how they would describe it. Over and over.  Like a mantra.  To drown those other words.

       Yeah,  its possible.    If these people are ever convicted,  they should not be executed.    We should try to find out just how callous they may have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like Rumsfeld and Cheney have long records in government and corporate positions.    I don't think they have a conscience about what they have done.    Its not the way it works.    People with a conscience,  like maybe Vince Foster,  are eliminated one way or other before they get to that level,  seriously.    They stand out.   Ruthless people can tell in a second.

       But see what you did there?  You put yourself somewhere in the middle of the spectrum of "this is the real stuff" and "those are the wacko nuts".  My entire point is that, due to cognitive bias, people will ALWAYS think of themselves as being exactly at that middle point.  To other people to the left and right of you, you may seem like the "wacko nut" or the "deluded, closed-minded blue-piller".

       No two people have the exact same point of view.    What other point of view can you take other than the point from which you view?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't worry too much about objective truth,  or being there at every moment where society reaches a tipping point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US just had a cathartic moment,  a tipping point in the election of the Trump.    Lot of people had been self deluding about stuff,   a few people were pointing that out.   The rug got pulled.   People reacted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that its over,  lots of people are let down because the excitement is wearing down,  they are adapting to a new normal.   I mean,  there are people disappointed that there wasn't more bang, more of  a real effect.   Its mostly business as usual until the next big distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       On 9/11,  we don't really know what people really think.    The corporate media gets to say what the landscape is,  and thats mostly a lie,  what they say,  for propaganda and control purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose what I am saying is that there is so much disinfo happening,  that its probably not a bad idea to stick with a little less certainty about spectrum of reality and make believe.    The map is not the territory,  the model is not the thing.    Spend enough time with the world outside,  not too much time with pretend in your head.

       Or just look at what is obviously true ;
      </p>
      <p>
       Globalism with mass immigration to balkanise europe/north america which goes hand in hand with constant war in the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pedo/human trafficking shit and the phoney war on drugs that creates untold misery and provides these scumbags with vast amounts of off the books money.

       What is obviously true isn't a conspiracy theory then, now is it?  Conspiracy theory is a hobby for most people, IMO.  (It's only a profession if you get paid for it.)

       Have compassion for them.  From your perspective, you can see that they are hooked into the matrix. From their perspective, you're delusional. And maybe a little weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weird is a word they use which means, "I'm afraid of your truth."  Because the truth is crazy, and they know it.  Because their world is fake, and deep down, they know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me tell you, it's even crazier than what you think it is.  And you know that has to be true. Because it make
       <em>
        me

       seem kind of weird to you.  But now you know... that feeling isn't really that
       <em>

       "weird".  That feeling is fear.

       Knowing and saying are two entirely different things, that serve two entirely different purposes.  Just because you know, doesn't mean you should speak.  Just because you don't know, doesn't mean you should not speak. Speaking is an action that has consequences, good or bad. The wise use the power of speech effectively.

       To be clear, I'm not "anti conspiracy theory" (which would be as absurd as "anti thinking"), and I don't think "conpiracy theory" is a negative term. Also, I agree with everything you said there. It's all quite factual.

       Agreed, but you missed the primary question:
       <strong>
        Who benefits, and how?

      </p>
      <p>
       Europe has been being flooded with immigrants who cannot and/or will not assimilate. At best, this will irreversibly change the very fabric of European culture, and it may very well result in ethic strife that will explode into continent-wide "civil war".
      </p>
      <p>
       Who benefits?
      </p>

       A similar 'Balkanization' has been slowly taking shape in the US for decades - and has escalated dramatically recently - threatening to tear the country to shreds.

        Also remember that Reddit itself is rewarding you here with FUN VIRTUAL LIKES (TM) which essentially gives you some real social recognition since your posts can get upvoted to maybe fuck high. That's gamification and it works most of the time for most people, either directly or indirectly.

       Some people do worry about things getting lots of upvotes on reddit. For example it's well known corporations and advertising companies worry about it... And one time I got in a LOT of trouble for making posts that certain people didn't like...

       Critical thinking , skepticism, demanding empirical evidence, learning about and avoiding bias  and logical fallacy....allows me to follow conspiracy for 30 years, yet I cant think of a single conspiracy at the moment that I consider legitimate. But I really enjoy and get excited about the first few seconds of a claim of evidence , exspecially if its physical hard evidence or a (testable) future prediction.  But I am always disappointed at the lack of real evidence in the end and after 30 years of consuming every conspiracy I can find, ive become a rock hard anti-conspericist

       I'd rather ask too many questions, and find some "wrong" answers, than ask no questions, and be given my answers.

       Thanks for that, this resonates as I know that to be true.
