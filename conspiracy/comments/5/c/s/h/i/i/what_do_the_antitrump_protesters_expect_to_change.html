       im honestly confused as to why so many people are up in arms AFTER the election and not before. there was a bunch of stuff to protest BEFORE the election, including trump. i hope this isnt a conspiracy but dont know where else to ask.

       Same here, I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised by how cool and easy the conversation/evening was. If you ever come south, I'm always around, always down to walk and talk, sip a coffee and try to sound reasonably intelligent.

       I never leave this town... I've never had any problems talking with people, just most of the time the conversations are pretty disappointing so I've given up... but I can see that changing in the future cause my mind is a bit different than it used to be.

       Yeah Portland is a lot of fun, but I don't have a car... Social interaction is fine... more important now that I realize I'm not the know-it-all I always thought I was, but that transition was fairly painless since I've always been skeptical of everything.

       Some have for months got all their news from a facebook driven echo chamber and the reality of the election is a shock

       Some have been woken up and have concerns on some of the more extreme things said during the campaign (including much that has been exaggerated and stirred up by a paid for media)

       We have
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of people in here from r/the_donald recently that think Sandy Hook was a real thing, Dylan Roof was a real person, CIA had nothing to do with Orlando Nightclub shooting, and that Israel are one of the "good guys." There needs to be a wake up call.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're seeing with these protests is a bunch of gay lesbian bisexual blue hair furry transgender YouTube feminist attack helicopters latching onto a manufactured cause. They want to be
       <em>
        part
       </em>
       of something because in their recent memory (I'm 25 trust me) this is the most polarizing election (puppet show) that's ever happened in their lifetimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entirety of the media forced everyone in America to believe that Donald Trump is anti-every adjective for the past few years and by nonstop coverage of these protests, people are getting it in their heads that they should go be a part of something. The media gave them the choice between a
       <strong>
        woman
       </strong>
       and a supposed
       <strong>
        sexist misogynist rapist racist
       </strong>
       . All the frustrated adjectives are obviously going to oppose the candidate who's not a woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add all of this to the fact that people are being paid to riot and fake some outrage and basically what you have is a diverse group of adjectives believing that if they yell and scream and march enough with that other group over there with the pretty signs, Big Brother will change his mind and let the woman be president instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of them are aware of the consequences because none of them have the mental capacity to seek them.

       I was just up there, checking it out on Central Park South.  It's so obvious that there are paid agitators.  There are literally school busses (I counted 3, there were probably more), and people wearing head sets that are organizing the crowd with megaphones.

       I think some were bought and paid for way back when the script said HRC would win... Then it looks like Trump is an asshat... his followers are burning down the country... excuse to declare martial law or whatever the hell those controlling the DNC wants... which I would have to guess was WWIII for them fat warbucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI intervened, election went legit, Trump wins, rioters still scheduled to hit the streets... want the money... but not feeling the cause anymore... mope around. Soros wants a race riot... schedules more rioters on short notice... also just want the money.  FBI saw protests coming long ago... parade routes pre-lined with cops and barriers. I'm guessing they have been reading HRCs emails for a long time...

       No it isn't a good thing based on their actions. Behaving like spoiled children isn't a good thing, violence and destruction of private property because you didn't get what you want isn't a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole election on all sides isn't a good thing so violent protesting because your corner of shit city isn't in control is not a good thing.

       As time goes on you'll realize how bad these protests really are because if shit goes south by way of the electoral votes and trumps people begin what justification will you cite to excuse them?

       You're advocating against protest on the flawed notion that
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       protest is
       <em>
        violent

       protest. You're being tricked by MSM and internet echo-chambers that this is the end-times. It's literally just young people protesting against the government, something that has happened hundreds of times before and will happen hundreds of times again. People are just losing their minds because this is Donald Trump and everything is 100 times more amplified.

        Besides, if your logic was correct then these dumbass young people should have protested with the same ferocity when Sanders was shit on.

      <p>
       Again, your basing your opinion on flawed logic. Not only was there protests over Sanders there was a huge loss of votes for the dems. So you can't discredit them based on a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have a right to protest, just because you disagree doesn't mean you should shut them down. What will you do when you protest but people want to discredit you based on age/race/opinion?

       It really says something that you think stating the right to protest is 'trolling.' Remind me which sub is all about personal freedoms again?

       Always calm, that dipshits list was gonna be produced regardless of my response. My original response never said I was against all protests. I singled out these protests and this asshole logic fallacied right over the meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their initial response was a logical fallacy to discredit my original response.

       Anytime that tactic is used in a forum I suspect troll whether or not it's intentional.

       It's an excellent question. Are they simply causing a ruckus? Are they paid to distract from CF criminal activity? Is there a major event they're burying? Are they just jerking off the Clinton administration?
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, to not have expressed their demands, seems a bit like they drank the kool aid. IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm suprised the lazy shits would even come out for anything which lends credibility to the theory that they are paid. Stupid people will sell their souls for the almighty dollar. That said. maybe they know something we don't. In which case, they're ineffective because they have America's attention. If they truly wanted change, they would organize and take up arms. (Not advocating this, just speculating on effective revolutions)

       i agree fully with what you said. thank you for responding.
      </p>
      <p>
       that being true, (which i think it is), i would like to follow up with a second question:
      </p>
      <p>
       if they are all being paid, wouldnt we expect SOMEONE (one of the "lazy shits") would tell SOMEONE that they were paid, and it would get out? 
(also applies to supposed orlando shooting crisis actors and other events as well)
      </p>
      <p>
       its hard for me to fathom ALL the paid participants would be so diligent to a agreement not to talk about their "sweet gig".

       $25/hr is hush money. I think they were likely threatened with a contract that they fear retribution on, and they suck anyway, and don't care.

       Also, remember when online shills came forward and outed themselves as paid dissent? Of course they will tell, eventually.
