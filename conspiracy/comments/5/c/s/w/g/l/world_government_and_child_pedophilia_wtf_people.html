       Okay so this thread is pretty much all about pizza gate, Wikileaks, and stuff of that nature. And it is very important, and should for sure be talked about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just was wondering, what's everyone's theory on if and when we will have one world government that the bilderburg group wants so badly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel as though it's a matter of time before he elites get what they've been working for, but do you guys think that this child sex ring, spirit cooking, occult things could affect this? Like make it harder for them. Or do you think eventually our (USA) "media" will talk about it openly and see it as the threat it really is.

       I don't think it'll ever happen. People are waking up faster than the amount of time it takes to set up a world government, which has probably been their one major setback all along.

       I can agree with this.  I feel like you could never truly quell dissent, it's about balancing, and discrediting the dissenting opinions.  There is a tipping point, and we are moving closer to it.

       Indeed. They probably thought we were stupid enough just because we dont come from super wealthy families. I mean thats normal, usually the wealthy ones always believe they are smarter than normal folks, which is true to some degree but not that much.

       When will you guys finally understand?  There are no laws in place because the constitution has been superseded.  Only ppl who consent to the court system and participate in it thereby consenting to its legitimacy receive adjudication.  Otherwise you can tell the judge he/she cannot determine the courts jurisdiction because even congress is barred from knowing about COG.  The only law in play is maritime admiralty law and law not defined by constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see they might come back with "secret law" but secret law makes the intelligence community privatized, which means their mass surveillance, warrantless survelliance and state hacking on US citizens then becomes an act of war by a hostile foreign entity.  Which means if congress continued to fund them (they did), they were doing business with the enemy which is a treason offense, making the US in breach of public contract---and therefore dissolved as a nation.  Now that cannot he the case, thus the intelligence community is still "public sector" therefore the only way their illegal actions are not brought to justice is that there are no laws.  The annual  COG renewal thus means the constitution is null
      </p>
      <p>
       And has been since 911.  We've been taken over and subjugated by a lawless coup, and no one in our public gov has challenged it, and they should have because they would discover what I'm saying is true, and if its not, then its because of some hidden executive order we dfont know...and we  need to challenge Obama directly on his abuse if executive privilege and impeach him
      </p>
      <p>
       But the silver lining is that if its tge case im right (good chances according to a const. Lawyer) the government has lost sovereign immunity because of this, since its defined by the constitution,  which means we can class action lawsuit the government into bankrupcy and sforce the to sell off ALL THEIR SHIT in another court, international court for example.  We should act quickly

       I feel like we already are a one world government. Democracy is a concept that's been sabotaged by globalists to keep the NWO under disguise. All countries with a democratic form of government are already part of the one world government. A child sex ring being exposed wouldn't do anything to stop it.

       As far as I can tell they are on track, I think all the scandals are deliberate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks to me that TPTB are renovating their puppet set; Furthermore, I remember reading during my studies on the Saturnalia Death cult that TPTB always gets their puppets hooked on something like pedophilia, death rituals, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing that, I am of the opinion that they are in the process of delegitimizing the current government puppets around the world so that they can provide us with a solution to that problem.

       As for what I think of the death cult, Apart from their practices it brings an interesting perspective when you read the mythologies of ancient peoples.

       Well it's all spelled out in the agenda 2030 UN documents. It describes a drastically different world with a equalizing of countries and redistribution of resources. It calls for various utopian ideas only attainable by all countries submitting to a central global power. The only way any of that plan is possible would be after something like ww3 and the plan would be used when rebuilding after total destruction of the old order.
