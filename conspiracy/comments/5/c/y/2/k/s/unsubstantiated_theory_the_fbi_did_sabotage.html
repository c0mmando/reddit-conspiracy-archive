    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s definitely been true historically. Obama also campaigned on change and said all of the right things, but we&#39;ve seen how that turned out. That&#39;s why I remain so skeptical, but I&#39;m at least willing to give Trump a chance at first. If he fails to live up to his promises of &#39;draining the swamp&#39; in the first six months of his presidency, then I will turn on him very quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>/lol, &quot;How that turned out?&quot;  Did you forget about the Repuiblican leaders gathering on the steps of the Capital building  the day after the inauguration and announcing they would not allow the newly elected majority Democratic government to govern   and proceeded to do just that.  Al Franken wasn&#39;t allowed his seat until August, after Ted Kennedy went home to die.    Do you honestly believe it takes that long for a vote recount?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the conservative and liberal ideologies are different, but I don&#39;t think the people in power of the GOP and DNC accurately reflect those differences. I supported Jill Stein, who I thought believed in real change. I don&#39;t agree with her 100%, but I do feel her message reflected the higher level of consciousness that I was referring to earlier. I just can&#39;t support Hillary for the same reasons I was strongly opposed to people like Bush and John McCain. They are all evil in my eyes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I supported Bernie Sanders, but did vote for Hillary even though I believe she is too business friendly.  I might harbor FDR/JFK/LBJ liberal ideas, but did feel it was important to not allow a one party government.  And one party government is what we now have.  </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t think third party and write in votes tipped this election, it was stolen, and the theft only more flagrant than in 2000/04 and used the same techniques but in a 50 state, precinct by precinct plan that began for the 2012 election and failed but succeeded this election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if she took a dive because she was threatened with exposure?  We know she could easily rig the election as she did the primary. Fireworks over Hudson were cancelled the day before. Trump saying now, &quot;don&#39;t want to hurt them (Clintons).  They are good people&quot;.  Trump is quickly being sucked into the establishment. Which we know is Oligarchy bought &amp; paid. Why are NYPD silent after very solid evidence was leaked, source was Weiner&#39;s laptop?  Appears you all are painstakingly chasing what is wrapped with a bow on that computer.  That former SoS dept guy seemed to imply they were going to do it that way (YouTube videos). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People forget Trump had serious momentum going into Comey&#39;s late reveal. Wiki Leaks, Obama Care, Clinton Foundation etc were already starting to take their toll. As matter of fact I was mad at Comey for releasing the letter because I thought it would stifle momentum.</p>

<p>That being said I think Comey had regrets about not investigating Clinton harder from the start. At the same time remember the FBI Director is a status quo position. If the leader of the status quo gets impeached that diminishes the status quo and/or his status as well. Throw in a little patriotic self esteem Comey didn&#39;t want to degrade the US by putting a sitting president or potential winner through a criminal investigation.</p>
