       FUUUUCK. Thanks for saying this. I thought I was losing it lately because people have been posting decent stuff but then as soon as anyone implicated Trump, it's like wooooaahhh. Leave him out. Um he's a rich, powerful, manipulating, fear-monger just like the rest. A friend of JE is never a friend of mine, bunch of slimy fucks.

       Honestly I never understood the Trump love around here beyond his support for Alex Jones. He's been a member of the elite his entire life, has friends in shady places, has a primary interest in increasing his fortune and popularity, and is looking to fill his cabinet with Bush-era establishment guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Clinton is corrupt too, but the major difference I've seen between him and Clinton this election is that we've barely seen ANYTHING about Trump's behind-the-scenes dealings. We've been fortunate enough to explore massive investigations against Clinton, look at her and her foundation's financial records, see thousands of leaked and released emails, but we can't even see Trump's tax returns. I really don't like that there's some kind of assumption he's clean when he should be an obviously shady character and we know little beyond what he tells us.

       Yea, from that standpoint Trump did a great job at tearing off Hillary's sheep suit during the debates.

       Unfortunately, I don't see any sheep(suits) in politics or business, just wolves hungry for a meal.

       From that standpoint, Trump definitely looks a lot hungrier than Hillary.

       What America needs is someone to go in and clean up the military industrial complex, the privatized prison systems and legalize marijuana.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we stop crippling our economy by going to war and locking our citizens up for profit using tax dollars and instead start receiving sales tax for the marijuana that's currently being sold illegally - true change will become possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political corruption, our prison population, federal income taxes - all cut down
      </p>
      <p>
       Citizens would be able to live their lives free of being imprisoned for smoking a little reefer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jobs? Plenty. The privatized prison systems are largely fronts for legalized slavery. You see once you are sentenced, you lose all of your rights and become property of the state to use for manufacturing. That's where all of our jobs went. Not Mexico (who's cartels are now financially weakened due to the legalization as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       Our schools and prison systems are fundamentally flawed. We "teach" children by spouting information at them without teaching them how to find it on their own - how to fact-check it for validity. We use our "correctional facilities" simply as a means to punish people without putting any thought into actually helping them become a better citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've yet to hear any candidate mention or acknowledge these problems let alone run a campaign on them.

       I didn't realize the private prison system recently started raking in money off immigration detention. Maybe that's part of Trump's play with the wall?

       People can't "find" jobs because half the country is dumb enough to vote for Trump. We need to educate people on how to start a business or at least tell them to go into a profession with a demand. My college program has had a 100% pre-graduation job placement rating for like 10 years running (meaning every student to graduate with that degree accepted jobs prior to graduating) and myself along with 2 of my highschool buddies all went through it and now have lucrative careers while I see other friends who wasted free rides on parties and unmarketable degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to accept that the future is in education and IT. Not manual labor that can be cheaply outsourced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either that or embrace the fact that we are the world's mob and up the extortion. I'm down with whatever, just vote for me.

       Well, You are an agent. Tell me how come Trump message or propaganda prevailed , opposed to Hilary's ?  What was the tipping point .. Was it FBIAnon post on 4chan , or was it that Hillary was out of touch and more corrupted ? 
Also, were we really on the verge of WWIII as posted around, or was it part of a Trump scheme ? I know USA media was unbearable about Russia last few months.

       Trumps "message" prevailed because it was all-encompassing, had sophisticated brainwashing techniques and was targeted at America's most gullible political party (almost entirely christian hence the fake pope articles, antichrist messages, anti muslim sentiments etc). They told people that if they didn't vote they would be personally accountable to god for every abortion that takes place post-election. They told people that Soros/the DNC control the government and Trump is their only hope at a fair democracy. They told people that Clinton was paying people to beat up Trump supporters. They told people BLM was run by Soros. They told people the MSM is biased and to only come to them for information. Need I go on? He ran an excellent campaign and as a businessman I tip my hat to him but he's still not my president. I'd like to think that conspiracy theorists weren't the target/aren't republican and he was merely exploiting the addictiveness of a good theory, however, I'm beginning to have doubts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not an agent. In truth I'm a pissed off ~25 year old white guy who has been dating an undocumented immigrant for the past 3 years and I'm personally pissed off that he thinks he has the right to wrangle her up and deport her.
      </p>
      <p>
       She comes from an area that's filled with violence/poverty and merely fled here to escape and now lives peacefully with me working over 40 hours a week and paying the same income and sales taxes as every other citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm able to separate myself from that and see that other citizens will suffer just as much from Trump's "message". That's why you see people protesting in mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, the Republican platform runs off Christianity, the Military, Whites and the Rich while the Democratic platform runs off increasing civil rights for all citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Obama was taking office he was subjected to being called a Muslim terrorist and was basically forced to show his birth certificate to the public. People were/still are so racist that they can't help but distrust a black man. Almost every white person I knew - family, friends' families called him a nigger and talked about how he was going to ruin the country (coming out of being economically depressed from the Bush administration). For the past 8 years he has turned this country around. We are (almost) completely recovered and things seem to have been business as usual on the war front. Women saw lots of rights given to them. Black people felt accepted in society since they finally got one of their own in office (there was a huge racial divide). Gays were granted the right to marry. Immigrants were welcomed with open arms. Our suffering were given government assistance to get back on their feet. etc. It seemed the USA was truly the land of the free and a place I could call my home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Trump came along with his civil rights stomping ass. The Democrats will never take a civil right away from anyone. The Republicans seem to want to oppress any non-white male (claim the bible for why women should have less pay, rights, etc). People seemed to have forgotten America's ugly domestic past. While I was off having fun with my new black, hispanic and gay friends a dark faction of citizens were apparently stewing in their bunkers pissed off at how the world has gone to shit.

       OK. Let me tell about myself , since you were being so kind in sharing your place and view of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in Serbia, it's in eastern europe and was until 1991 a part of a country called Yugoslavia. Look into Josip Broz Tito (who was our 'marchall' and a socialist dictator) and look into the making of Non-Aligned Movement. I'm 43yr white male. When I was born , our country experienced major economic boost , coming from a int.loan , but economy was so blooming it was easily payed off. There are some analysis that citizens of Yugoslavia actually felt and made up to 50% more money / consumer power (?) in the small period of 2 years. At that time 1973 - 75,6 . Now comes 1980 and our beloved dictator dies of old age (had a one of the largest funerals in history - by foreign delegation attendance, look it up, too). It took about 10 years for shit to hits the fan and nationalism to start blooming (YU consisted of 6 republics and about 8 major nations: Slovenians, Croats, Muslims, Serbs, Macedonians, Montenegrians, Kosovo-albanians, and some Hungarians) I'm a minor minority nation, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, with incentives from Western Europe (EU Union in forming) and NATO in forming, Slovenia and Croatia decides to secede. All hell breaks loose, 'cause Croatia had about 15% of Serbs living in it, they wanted to keep living in Yugoslavia. Also , they remembered 2nd WW , when Croats had a strong fascist movement of Ustasha. 
Western world allies Croatia to secede , war starts, first Croatia, then Bosnia, then Kosovo. Serbia are bad guys , all the time. 
In retrospective, the reason for this was always the way of independence and non-aligment being rooted very strong in Serbia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically , western europe, USA, and NATO helped very much for a country of 20 million same language speaking , with strong independence movement, strong economy and strong army, to fall apart to 7 small , nationalistic countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       In comes EU and USA to buy all the good industrial resources, and make us work like slaves for a small vage for them. Divide &amp; rule. 
My country - Serbia was made to look like it's full of villains (look up some holiwood movies) , savages and nationalistic retards. 
And it was made to look like that - by American Democrats. 
When in fact, the only countries that were accepted into EU were Slovenia and Croatia, countries that are almost purely ethnically clean. (Look up Croatia - operation Storm / Oluja , which made almost all Serbs to flee to Serbia , 10% of Croatia population) Oh, that made with a help of NATO and USA liberals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros all the way involved in 'making of these civil societies'. Fact. 
Comes a 1999 and a Kosovo problem , long in waiting, since Serbs and Kosovars had their share of disputes. Again, with the incentives from the West, Kosovo demands indipendence (how lucky for USA that it has some major mining grounds and resources to serve in next 50 years). Liberal politics from USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here comes the first european bombing of independant country since the 2ndWW.  That bombing of Serbia could've easily instigated 3rdWW if the Russia was strong as it is now. Luckily for Serbia (which is to 'blame' for all wars ever (look up 'Gavrilo Princip')) , it did not grow into major world conflict. 
Kosovo albanians payed of their debt to western world by being a major drug trafficing country, and with an illegal trade of people and organs (look-up 'Organ theft in Kosovo , Yellow house')
      </p>
      <p>
       Comes 2000, and we were overthrowing our 'dictator' Milosevic (who , by the way , wasn't at all nationalist, but more of a socialist with a strong non-nationalistic view for Serbia) , and happily run into this 'Brave new world' of freedom and democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, 16 years later, we are still waiting to be accepted to European Union, still getting lectured of democracy, still being called savages (by England and USA, most prominently) , and with having now a gullible , easily manipulated (from West) goverment. Still waiting for a better pay , better life, better day. I am a minor minority in Serbia, never had a single nationalistic problem in life, live in a city that has the most variants of religions and churches, probably in the whole eastern europe (see 'Novi Sad' it's a beautiful city - chosen to be Cultural capital of Europe for 2020.) , still waiting to not be called 'savage' by the western societies.
Here is an example of a City sign in my neighbour, written in six languages ... it was always like this here where I live.

       </a>
       Savage , isn't it ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm seeing a major influx of Syrian , Iraq, Afganistan refugess , passing through my country and city , going to EU to seek a better life. Every day. Croatia and Hungary (both part of EU) had built their walls already, they did not need Trump for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, all I can think when looking at american liberals protest against Trump is this: even though your purpose and goal is credible and worth fighting for, you people live in the bubble and not seeing that Democrats and liberals with a MAJOR HELP of Soros and so called 'open societies' are actually blackmailing and destroing countries , inventing wars to sell arms and take resources.
And your protests against Trump are used, organized, or helped by some major villains, as seen throughout the world. Well, if you don't chill and learn about what's going on, you will now see the same shit that I in the Serbia, some dude in Iraq, Libya, Sirya , and Ukraine were seeing all these years.  Maybe it's for the best. Maybe you need a rude awakening.

       I'm just trying to make sense of everything. I went from 100% hillary to finding out about all of these conspiracy theories tied to a billionare capitalist "knight in shining armor" (Trump) so the skepticism is strong. Him wanting to kick my girlfriend out, Alex Jones' craziness and the whole nazi correlations weren't helping. Not to mention, he hasn't come out and stated anything officially and seems to just be hiring a bunch ot crazies for his cabinet... I'm pretty close to jumping on the Trump train but I still smell a fish somewhere.

       Oh, yes. The smell of fish is everywhere. Especially around Clintons. We'll see what Trump is in a couple of months ..  Is he a democratic plant ? Is he a KKK choice ? I'l give him credit (taken form some interviews) of manipulating both sides to his benefit , at the time needed. But, I think he is smarter that that. Also, don't forget that his wife was immigrant at some point, too.

       Russia used to the be USSR, just in case you weren't aware that before 1993 Russia was the USSR.......you are aware of that right?

       Of course they are tame, they are the largest remnant of a failed global superpower from 23 years ago. You don't fail as a superpower and then instantly recoup yourself and go back to fucking with the world with noticably less power and influence like a badass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia isn't the good guy or the bad guy since countries aren't human beings and therefore can't be good guys or bad guys,  they can do good or bad things from certain perspectives but that's really depending on what country you live and it's relationship with Russia.

       Ok, but at the height of the cold war both the USA and USSR were doing equally corrupt shit. At the very least both nations are equally corrupt. Why is it though that americans have such a hateboner for russia/putin when their own government does the same thing, and worse than russia now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike the president of the united states, putin is firmly in charge. At least you know who is pulling the strings and how the power structure is aligned. With the USA there's a shadow government controlled by massive monetary interests from around the world. They abuse the USA's power for their wealth whereas Putin enriches himself. The corruption in Russia is much more open  and authoritarian rather than the subversive manipulation in the USA that makes people think their country isn't a fucking monstrosity.

       Putin is owned by old ex-KGB and has been from day one. He would have a hole in his head the moment he thinks he can pull his own strings. Go read up on KGB and where Putin comes from, you'll realize there is no way he could get to where he is without having people above him helping and putting him into power, those are the ones who control Russia.

       Eh, I feel it should just be assumed that the POTUS is going to subjected to corruption and extortion since it essentially comes with the job. The ridiculous idea that he would even be able to come in and sweep out corruption without immediately being assassinated is preposterous and needs to just be thrown out the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leaves three options: he's already corrupt, he will be corrupted, or he's not going to survive to see anything come to fruition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that he is fully saying that he wants to go in and flush out "the swamp" (corrupt democrats), I'm left with the options that the government's corruption isn't really an issue (not likely), Trump want's to go in and be the Republican's Soros (what I'm guessing), Trump is dumb enough to think he can sweep out a shadow government (I don't think he's that dumb) or he is willing to sacrifice himself for "the truth" (possible but I doubt it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judging by his familiarity with MoveOn, Soros, Wikileaks, etc. I assume he's just been playing the jester in order to further the police state agenda for the NWO or whoever and drawing attention to Soros in order to take over his position or as a scapegoat for simple military industrial complex/privatized prison/etc money.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best guess is the last, he's using Soros (a known conspiracy theory target and someone with relatively low wealth and life expectancy) as a scapegoat for his election and his plans are to exploit his position to further his family's wealth and power.

       You're assuming there's only one controlling monetary interest in congress. It's not centralized corruption or control, it's just the invisible hand of a broken power structure controlled by overall greed not a single entity. A nudge in the right direction (trump's plan) won't fix it but it will reduce the weight that hand has on policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think there's some sort of evil cabal that controls every move and policy you're a fucking moron plain and simple.

       I assume it would just make that invisible hand's job harder as he would have to reach out to more people but that's essentially just another middle-man position for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look at it like this: I'm the president and the nation wants gun control - the NRA is offering me a 200k bribe and the anti-gun lobby is offering me 100k - I'm obviously taking the NRA's offer and keeping that relationship alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then just apply that to every issue and every politician and that's how the "shadow government" operates. George Soros would just be a major player with a lot of interests.

       Yeah and Trump's policies will help alleviate that. There will be a revolving door of corruption as we vote out the congress people who vote against our interest but at least if you're voted out you now have some employment/lobbying restrictions and thus the bribes will be more costly.

       Babysteps to get money out of politics.

      <p>
       Personally I think we should an avenue of legally pursuing death penalties for corrupt congressmen instead of just voting them out. Either that or direct democracy/meritocracy is the only way we curb corruption to a manageable level

       In my opinion Alex Jones is a fearmonger that uses conspiracy theories to spread fear, divide the people and push his own agenda. He mixes truths with half-truths and lies and offers no real solutions to any world problems while just making people more afraid and helpless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would even go as far to say he is there for precisely those reasons,  a puppet placed there by those in power to subdue the part of the population that have started to look for truths about the current geopolitical situation and our world in general outside the mainstream narrative (people looking into possible conspiracies...etc. ) and distract them while filling them with fear, anger and hopelessness/helplessness.

       You forget how he "snuck in" the bohemian grove complete with video and audio recording devices, fooled hundreds of guards plus the attending elite, and positioned himself at a perfect first-row seat angle to capture the cremation of care ritual in all its splendor and clarity.

       There was a time about 15 years ago that I thought Alex Jones was speaking truth to power. His appearance in the Richard Linklater film, Waking Life, was electrifying to hear as a 16 year old beginning to question the system. It was what first put him on my radar and I started listening to his radio program so after seeing the movie. This was around 2002-2003. For a while, he seemed like he was dead right about a ton of stuff - 9/11, Iraq, Bush war crimes, mass government surveillance, police militarization etc.  Sure he was bombastic and over the top sometimes but that's why I loved him. He was nothing if not passionate and I felt like his passion was well deserved and I wished more people got as fired up about the real things as he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then...something changed. Admittedly, I stopped listening to him as much as I got busier with life post-college. Then I see him start popping up in random youtube videos here and there a few years ago and he just looks unhinged and almost like a caricature of his old self. It's hard to describe but it just looked staged or something. And now this election cycle I see that he's got all his weight behind Donald Trump?! This is the same guy that I used to hear losing his mind when George W. Bush talked about how much easier things would be if the US was a dictatorship? He's putting his support behind a guy who routinely praises strong men and has an Authoritarian bent like no one else we've seen in recent history? It just doesn't gel with who he used to be and what he used to stand for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm left to come to one of two conclusions: 1) Alex Jones has officially lost his mind or 2) Alex Jones is being used as a puppet by the very people he used to warn all of us about. I am inclined to think it's #1. But #2 is also an intriguing option and not one I had never considered before. I remember even thinking during the early days about how much more on edge I was and angry I was and then hopeless I felt after listening to 3 hours of Alex rail on and on about how fucked we were getting by the Elites that I actually started to think "what if Alex is just a stooge put here to fill us with terror and half truths and distractions?" I dunno, it's like some one else said, it's almost like a conspiracy-ception! I dismissed the notion back then, and today I still feel like the simpler answer is probably true - after walking a razors edge for so long, he just ain't right in the head any more.
      </p>

       sorry for any typos, kind of rambled more than I thought I was going to when I started.

       Holy shit, I didn't realize that was Alex Jones in Waking Life.

       Actually kind of depressing now that I went back and watched it... Talking bout two sides of the same coin and how they give you a buffet of misinformation - now he runs infowars for the radical right.

        I think I might have actually been the one to make the "cospiracy-ception" comment your referring to, lol.

       There's definitely more than meets the eye with this one and I can't stop poking around. Now that I know Alex Jones' past it definitely makes things more interesting and helps explain the Soros links.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best guess off of the top of my head is that he's simply a puppet for Trump. That would explain him falling off of the radar, looking different, beginning new youtube channels, all that fucking money they apparently have (seriously, infowars is better filmed than MSM), and the overall craziness. He was either simply bought out by Trump and exploited to push his agenda as the white night for government corruption or the two of them are truly on a mission to rid corruption and are willing to lie their asses off for the greater good (but that sounds too much like the_donald so probably not).
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep coming to the conclusion that Trump is plotting to simply make money off of the usual military industrial complex, privatized prison systems, pharmaceuticals, etc while destroying the legislature hindering his and his interests' current operations and he's just exploiting the conspiracy theory/alex jones/, anti-MSM/fake news narratives to keep completely envelop his followers in these ideas that liberal (commies) are either batshit insane criminals, lazy idiot drug addicts or funded by Soros (explains why the_donald is so hysterically brainwashed and think you're a shill if you offer any debate).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, InfoWars is basically training them how to talk over democrats/opposing views in all of their "interview" videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't think Trump (or campaign managers) is that sophisticated take a look at this

       I've also been thinking about this a lot lately and in my opinion there's no one more angry about Trump winning than Alex Jones.  Jones planned on riding the whole "it was rigged" thing for another year after Trump lost, while still grilling "President Hillary Clinton" with all her baggage.  Jones' whole shtick is going against whichever president is in office so seeing how weak of a candidate Trump was (although widely popular), Jones doubled down on Trump losing in order to play the rigged card.  This plan backfired when Trump won so now Jones has the choice of becoming a full blown right-wing personality, or slowly distancing himself from Trump and going back his old approach.  This explains why Jones was more left leaning when Bush was in office and then went right when Obama got in.  It almost like Glenn Beck and Alex Jones swapped bodies.

       Yeah I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but every time I watched his shows it felt like I was watching a trailer for a horror movie.  It just feels slimy and sleezy to watch.  Lurid, but not in a good way.

       This was my comment a day ago when Alex Jones came up:
I mean, most of that shit comes from Alex Jones and personally think he is a plant of the CIA in counter intelligence (like Anderson Cooper). His role is to fill the airwaves with all sorts of crazy conspiracy bullshit (like lizard people) and put out factual stuff. He is poisoning the well of information. By putting out factual stuff and then tying it to the really crazy shit, no one will actually take any of it seriously, and those that will are off their rocker (thinking the world's government are full of lizards who are trying to raise the global CO2 temperatures so they can have a more habitable environment to live in).

       I actually have trouble believing that "some shadowy figures" as you called them (the wealthy elite) , had no hand in his rise and didn't help, promote, support and finance him.
Especially when you understand how powerful the media is in controlling the mass consciousness (and how much of the media is already controlled).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the enormous difference between "conspiracy theorists" and other people - we think many (not all)  things that promote and give further power and control to the wealthy elite are there by design, since the elite, though sociopaths they may be,  are very intelligent and indeed far from fools - but you think that these things and events are there by mere chance, which I just cannot bring myself to believe.

       My thoughts on Alex Jones for awhile.  Obviously a shill meant to distract those out for low hanging fruit.  He still believes the government is preparing to institute martial law and take us all to jail.

       I think you hit the nail on the head with hopelessness/helplessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it might be a little bit more than that, though.  I feel like when people listen to Alex Jones spitting all over the mic, they think, "Wow, this guy is really fighting for me, I guess I can keep going to my 9-5 job and drink myself to sleep every night.  No need to protest, this guy has it covered."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like they're fulfilling their urges to do something by just listening to a guy lose his shit over it.  Very similarly to the way that people will like a cause on Facebook, and then consider that their public service for the year.  Giving yourself the illusion of giving a damn.

       Exactly, that is another problem with Jones - he pacifies the population,  very well said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the fear itself that he spreads makes people passive, confused and unable to do anything to make a positive difference (because how can you act productively and positively from a place of fear?) .

       Yea, same thing happens with TV too. Some people watch some evil doer get his in a TV show/movie and it gives them that release of brain chemicals that makes them feel good kind of like how games supplement real accomplishments the same way and porn does the same thing with sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except since it isn't the real thing it's a fleeting feeling and it makes people go back to it more often instead of looking for real tangible things to do that will actually give them a long lasting sense of accomplishment and purpose in life. Our brains are wired to go for the easy/fast way.

       It's kind of sad how many people bought into that bullshit. Trump is a corrupt businessman, and corrupt businessmen are the people who corrupt politicians. Who in their right mind thinks Trump will be the one to get rid of corruption in politics?

       I don't know if Jones was actually put there on purpose, but that's definitely the niche he fills. When people start to sense things aren't right, when they start wanting to dig a little deeper, there's Alex Jones ready to baffle them with bullshit and leave them more confused than when they started (and sell them a little silver bullion and fluoride filters while they're on his website).

       Agreed. Thing I hate about Alex is that yes, he dives into some theories and gets tot he bottom, but then he goes off on a crazy rant about fish controlling the ocean water or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is controlled opposition. He will give you just enough then stop and say something totally bat shit crazy that discredits himself. Kind of reminds me of old Glenn beck. He was on to some stuff then went off the deep end.

       Completely agreed.  I used to watch Alex Jones back in the 2000s and while I occasionally could tellhe was going way too far out on a limb, I at least thought he was trying to fight the good fight even if he was occasionally(often?) misinformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now?  Eh. At best he's a peddler of goods who uses fear mongering to increase his sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Alex Jones was who he presents himself to be, going after people as powerful as he presents them to be..  why has he not died of a heart attack or suspicious robbery or something by now?

       I don't think he's a puppet just a useful snakes oil salesman. His end game seems to just be pushing super pills. I think the elites have fully taken up the ideology of crisis politics. Don't make long term plans just wait for the next problem and exploit it.

       The best description I heard of Alex Jones is "a humble water filter salesman." By being as loud and voracious as possible, and fear mongering the populace, you can get them to trust you, and once you have trust, you have the sale.

       Atrazine turns frogs eggs into predominantly female. This is true and has peer reviewed studies. Plastics broken down in the environment also mimic estrogen and have had similar effects on lower animals.

       Yea but that occurs naturally in those species. Frogs are not supposed to switch genders. IIRC it turns male frogs female, making it a lot harder to reproduce.

       Honestly, the fact that nothing shady has come up about Trump makes me think he's
       <em>
        shadier
       </em>
       than Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody's squeaky clean. Nobody, but especially not a billionaire real estate mogul. This means Trump is better at hiding the skeletons in his closet than Clinton.
       <em>
        That's
       </em>
       a scary thought. Whether it's the friends he's made, the backroom deals he's brokering, or whatever, Trump has the power to be a sleazy cheating fuck
       <em>
        and make it vanish
       </em>
       . Like, Russian hackers are leaking Clinton's every email in the last decade and yet nothing turns up on Trump? He opens casinos and develops real estate around the world without a single government pay off or deal brokered with organized crime? Nah, there's something weird as fuck going on there.

       Seriously, if you didn't only get your conspiracy news from this sub, you'd know that there are tons about Trump. I spent a lot of time on r/politics (I'm sure some people looking at my history would say I'm a shill), and there were actually a ton of conspiracies posted there, and also a ton of facts that people seem to just ignore about him. If you ask me, the media might hate Trump, but they focused on Hillary's emails the whole election and never pushed any of the shit he did in the past, so he got a huge pass that probably won him the election

       It's cause he throws so much crap onto the floor it's hard for the main stream to pick thru and find something legitimate. Everyone is so worried to report on something that could be perceived as wrong that they wait for the next guy to verify it. But by the time anything is moved on that story, trump has already said something silly at a rally and it's time to cover that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a way the pussy grab video kind of helped trump. It dominated the news cycle for so long and had no impact on his base/followers. By the time the media got over that it was too close to the election for anyone to do any real searching for anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but the whole Russian/trump connection did not get as much searching as it deserved. The media just basically asked trump camp about it and then let it be. His ex campaign manager helped dictators for crying out loud and had more then just connections with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump just so happen to be the perfect candidate in the perfect media to fall into the White House. The media is a fucking circle jerk and each one is to afraid to let go of the next guy to do anything important.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media made trump. They believed it was so in the bag for Clinton that they wanted a piece of the reality shit show that was trump. But instead of people tuning in to watch a meltdown they were tuning into a persecution of Clinton. The last month the only thing that was of substance was emails emails emails and trump driving it home and the media gave him free air time to spout whatever he wanted and make his own narrative.

       +8 right now. Surprised me, I avoid posting whenever conspiracies hits all because I expect to be downvoted, but I think that was because of the strong trump bias that seems to be shrinking. I believe one day everything we at r/politics saw in him will be proven, and people will be baffled by how they never heard about it and they'll regret being blinded by the emails and Benghazi.

       I wish I had a solid list, and if anyone seeing this has a link I'd appreciate it cuz I'm sure someone has kept track. But, off the top of my head:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Russian ties (nor just the email server, which still seemed fishy the last time i checked)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mafia connections
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People repeatedly point at Bill's ride on "Lolita Express" (I think that was the name of the pedophile's plane) while ignoring that the same book says Trump did the same (although the author has called theories theirs crazy IIRC), plus all the sexual assault accusations
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I know there's others, but then there's also all the confirmed things like how he never pays his contractors. I know there's way more, but I can never remember examples :(

       Mafia connections I think are a given, Russia thing doesn't seem to have much evidence behind it and he only went on the lolita express once. Not going again doesn't seem too bad.

       It's odd how his campaign fired multiple people after papers started saying they had Russian ties (reputable ones, so I believe there was evidence), especial whoever it was that had recurved millions for lobbying from the pro-Russia group inside Ukraine or something like that. Then there was a story on the front page a few days ago where a Russian minister of foreign affairs (or something like that) said they had constant contact with his campaign.

       That was Paul Manafort who received 13 million dollars. He was the former top advisor for Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych who was a Putin puppet. You might remember Yanukovych from the news a few years ago when his opponent in the election was
       <em>
        poisoned
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       After the anti-corruption uprising when Yanukovych was run out of the country back to Russia, Manafort came to America to work for Trump.

       I've been reading about Berlusconi a bunch. Rich mogul who entered politics solely because his businesses were tanking. Eventually a head-spinning list of corruptions came out, he's been in prison for awhile now. Who's been talking about Trump since the Apprentice? I feel his useless brand stopped getting gobbled up by dopes, he had debts and accusations piling up, the pathetic Trump University endeavor to sink him, so he decided to become president of the united states. Perhaps.

       Either that, or he just isn't as ballsy as Hillary was.
Hillary got caught because she had this highly complex
       <em>
        global network
       </em>
       of corrupt ties. She spread herself far too wide, and in the end it was too much to hide, too easy to break into. It collapsed under its own weight. 
I do think Trump has his own skeletons in the closet. I imagine he's got a knack for exploiting loopholes, so his sleazy behavior might not technically be illegal. I don't think his corruption is as far reaching as Hillary's though, and I don't think he's better at hiding them so much as they're easier to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again I might be wrong, this election has made it pretty clear not to underestimate Trump.

I can't wait till people start snooping and diggin into

       We had plenty of real examples of dickery and over 60 pending lawsuits against him, but I am sure it's barely the tip of the iceberg. Beyond looking like a fool constantly and saying dystopian incendiary things, not to mention making fun of everyone and treating people like shit on live TV, he's been a crook and dickhead his entire life, and the only thing that matters now is his brand and perceived power. Until he became president, however.  History will hopefully give us all the facts one day. I hope that day is soon.

       It's pretty hard to hide stuff when you have the IRS up your ass every year and a constant spotlight on you. I doubt he's never done shady shit, but most of his dealings are public by design. People expect him to be shady as fuck, but not too much floats to the surface despite constant attempts and finding dirt on him. With so many people hating one person, I'd expect a lot more dirt to constantly come loose on him, like with Hillary.

       Yeah but it wasn't until the 2nd debate that I noticed a huge influx of the_donald users. Wikileaks gained relevancy and this sub has historically been the main one discussing the leaks, so they came here.

       That was the most embarrassing non-answer I've ever heard. He had no idea how to answer the question, and eventually just stuttered out "That's why we have to drain the swamp!"

       We have to drain the swamp... because he hired a bunch of corrupt people. Because apparently there was nobody else. Fucking joke.

       I'm just gonna hope that he's keeping them in the cabinet temporarily because they have experience and influence. Once he learns the ropes he might not keep them around, I'm also thinking its a move to make him look like he is playing ball with the establishment. That's just me being hopeful

       Presidents really don't make super-temporary cabinet appointments. For the most part, who they appoint is who stays with them for all 4 years. And so far all signs point to Trump assembling one of the most corrupt and establishment cabinets I've ever seen.

       You're missing the point, and I think it's intentional.

       What happens if you move a bunch of people into the White House who have never worked in politics and someone wants to broker a deal with Iran? Nobody knows how to contact Iran, that's what. You bring in political insiders to learn from and utilize to accomplish necessary tasks. But you're not giving them free reign to make decisions for the country, so whether they're establishment or not is pretty irrelevant.

       Do you have any idea what the actual platform behind "drain the swamp" is? Apparently not, and just because they don't exist now doesn't mean they won't exist in the future. And you're expecting him to shoot himself in the foot in the meantime? Makes very little sense.

       My point is just that he can only be an actual boss if he has political experience to play the game around those old people. A big part of GOP establishment still hates Trump for being "open-minded ex-democrat". No way they don't do their best to manipulate Trump. Now he has to listen to them and I don't think he has the leverage to force changes on them.

       The man who was the mayor of New York City on September 11th, 2001 claimed that there were no successful islamic terror attacks on US soil before Obama's presidency. Let that sink in for a minute. Either he denied the existence of something he was very much present for, or he is admitting that 9/11 was in fact not what he and all the rest of them claimed it was. Giuliani's presence alone on the line up shows how criminal the whole gang is.

       Your argument was that someone needs to be there who knows what is going on. For this argument to be valid and Trump to still be considered "anti-establishment", the whole cabinet cannot be an insider echo chamber. If he doesn't have reasonable representation from outside of establishment politics then he cannot claim to be anti-establishment. You also set up a straw man argument by listing people who have nothing at all to do with governing as the alternative. I think no matter what you think of him, Bernie Sanders can clearly be put up as a shining example of someone who knows what's going on in politics even though he is squarely anti-establishment, and there are many more like him. Ron Paul, if you want one from the other side of the aisle.

       I've only seen one, chief of staff. What other cabinet positions have been filled?
Edit: I know about Bannon but didn't think chief advisor was an official cabinet position, correct me if I'm wrong. Still, who is the third?

       I'll admit that I've been touring around Hollywood today on vacation and missed this latest development, but quick research shows this man left Goldman Sachs a decade and a half ago (not sure that that qualifies as "straight out of Goldman"). And is it really a terrible idea to hire a banker to run the treasury?

       I'm there are intelligent, policy-minded respectable Republicans out there. But he picks corrupt politicians, idiots and scum. I am looking forward to a lot of what Trump is advocating for right now, namely anti interventionist stuff, but other than that I think America is looking at a rough four years.

       None of those are confirmed except for Priebus. And lol thinking Carson and Palin are establishment. What a joke. That's the funny thing about this sub, you guys are so eager to just be angry that you can't recognize a win, a moment to be happy. Donald trump - first presidential candidate to praise Wikileaks / acknowledge the globalist agenda spread by Soros / bring to light the fact that Saudis are currently controlling our government. This is the best conspiracy is ever going to get, hate to break it to you -- and it's not bad, the man is now the president of the United States. So what? Rally against trump and eat shit as Pence sells you out to bush oil interests? You guys are irrational

       Pretty big assumption there, but, again, no. I am replying directly to the fact that your reply attempts to link justifiable skepticism with paranoia. The words you chose in the above quote (post-hyphen) are more direct and rational, but that is not what was stated in the comment that I replied to.

      <p>
       Again, I have only made a comment about you linking paranoia to skepticism, especially when justified. There's no way you can know what I believe about Trump as I have never stated an opinion to that effect. This is just a poor attempt to redirect and obfuscate from the context of this thread.

       It seems you are defensive and passionate right now. I speculate it is a normal reaction to the potential reality of a consequence of ego and governmental action. No worries, I get it...been there myself multiple times, and will be there again I'm sure. Just try to recognize it and reply rationally to the context of the individual comment, not what you perceive as a
       <em>
        me vs. them

       dialogue.

       Being considered for Secretary of Defense and/or National Security Advisor is
       <strong>
        Stephen Hadley
       </strong>
       , a self-professed neoconservative who was Deputy National Security Advisor from 2001-2005 and National Security Advisor from 2005-2009. Hadley was among the
       <em>
        "Vulcans,"
       </em>
       the six-man team of advisors assembled by Cheney to guide Bush. Hadley was formerly a principal at
       <strong>
        the Scowcroft Group
       </strong>
       , an international consulting firm founded by Brent Scowcroft - one of the 'wise men' at the pinnacle of the U.S. establishment.

        shocked a group of Republican policymakers by suggesting, more than a year before 9/11, that removing Saddam Hussein from power was their "number-one foreign-policy agenda."
       </a>
       Prior to the attacks, he was among the officials who consistently interered with attempts to arrest or kill Bin Laden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hadley, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, presently sits on the board of defense contractor Raytheon, and is among its major stockholders. This did not stop CNN, NBC, FOX, Bloomberg TV and the Washington Post from giving him a platform to call for a U.S. missile attack on Syria following the staged chemical attacks in September 2013.

       Really, I wouldn't have voted for anyone. They
       <em>

       us to participate in the electoral system.

      <p>
       I think we need to begin organizing grassroots resistance against the globalist agenda, locally-oriented and action-based. If the informed elements of every township, city, state and country did this, focusing on frontline issues, instead of channeling all their valuable time, intelligence and energy into the controlled opposition heroes that the system gives us, the superclass would be shitting themselves.

So far we have Bannon, priebus and Sessions. All great men. Sorry you can't see it, but have fun constantly stepping on your own toes. R/conspiracy is its own worst enemy

       lol I clearly made you angry. Sorry your guy didn't win. Bannon is in the WH whether you like it or not, snowflake. It's hilarious you attack anyone who disagrees with you, even Milo. I guess because he's not a democrat he's not gay enough for you? The only intolerant people left in this country are Libs like you :) and just for your information, the prime minister of Israel even commented that he looks forward to working with Bannon.

       Of course the Israeli PM is thrilled.  He wants to tell Palestinians to fuck off, and doesn't care who he has to work with to do it.

       You have no understanding of the alt right or milo. I strongly encourage you to do some research before you blindly shoot your mouth off like this slandering people for no reason. Milo doesn't suppress gay people, in fact most of his speeches usually always involve him mentioning that he loves "black cock". You probably saw he's against gay marriage and immediately went all liberal REEEEE. Just for your information, he's against gay marriage because he is against the religious institution of marriage in general...it has nothing to do with being gay. And that's an opinion that actually runs counter to most of the alt right as they are totally FOR marriage equality dumb dumb

       there? Why do you think Nidal Malik Hasan, the man allegedly responsible for the killings at Fort Hood, was trained there?
      </p>
      <p>
       After his studies (or programming) at Virginia Tech, Bannon obtained a master's degree in
       <strong>
        <em>
         national security studies
        </em>
       </strong>
       from Georgetown, the prestigious Jesuit college in D.C. This school is largely viewed as a training ground for both the CIA and the State Department, and so based on the nature of his studies there it is highly-likely Bannon was receiving intelligence training.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then graduated with honors from the elite Harvard Business School in 1983 and enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Serving as a Surface Warfare Officer in the Pacific Fleet, he would eventually become a special assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations. How many anti-establishment crusaders are in the employ of Naval Intelligence?
      </p>
      <p>
       After his ostensible retirement from naval operations, Bannon found employment with Goldman Sachs. How many anti-establishment crusaders are in the employ of establishment-dominated global investment banks?
      </p>
      <p>
       He eventually founded his own investment bank, Bannon &amp; Company, with several associates from Goldman Sachs, and negotiated the sale of Castle Rock Entertainment to establishment billionaire Ted Turner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you realize that the establishment and the intelligence services sponsor agents-of-influence in every part of the political spectrum? There are plenty of figures like Bannon on the
       <em>
        "alternative right"
       </em>
       and the
       <em>
        "alternative left"
       </em>
       whose purpose is manipulation.

       He does run contrary to many Republican and Democrat establishment ideals and he was just on 60 Minutes talking about phasing out lobbyists in Washington. I hope that is true. It'd be nice to have a non-scumbag president for once. With that said, personally, I'd oppress as many people as necessary to get the kind of scratch Trump has. Then turn around, say "screw you America", buy an island and bounce. So already, Trump is a better person than me.

       Oh don't worry, he has oppressed plenty of people in order to make money. Also, looking at his list of people to take up some of the highest jobs, he's not going to reduce the influence of either 'the establishment' or lobbyists. He has already gone back at least partially on most of his key campaign promises (the wall, Obamacare, drain the swamp), so I wouldn't be too hopeful.

       The way Trump's campaigners swarmed in, took over Reddit, botted the everliving fuck out of every the_donald post until everything
       <a href="/r/all/rising">
        /r/all/rising
       </a>
       was the_donald, co-opted Pepe, co-opted the memeverse, co-opted Sanders supporters after they got the shaft from Hillary, and managed to establish a personality cult around one of the most vile, filthy stereotypes of the 1% imaginable... that was something to behold.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they're still at it. The phenomenon has now become self-sustaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Vote against Hillary" said one side...
      </p>
      <p>
       "Vote against Trump", said the other....
      </p>
      <p>
       And the divide and conquer two party "lesser evil"-tactics ensured another fucked up presidency with another fucked up financial elitist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama would have never made it without him making peace with Wall Street. Sanders refused to do it, and the way he was sabotaged tells you all you need to know about him. The only sort of candidate you can trust is anti-Wall Street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cue the whinging about the liberty of the free market. Yeah, we've seen that liberty at work the past 25 years after the Berlin Wall fell. Absolute fucking barrel-scraping, privatized, planet-destroying plutocrat pandemonium.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you do what? Elect
       <em>
        Trump
       </em>
       to fix this?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know why it was possible: because his fawning, memeing sycophants all over Reddit and the American electorate alike were swept along in Trump's complete epistemological nothingness: nothing is true today the way it was yesterday, and everything he does is evidence of the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump achieved the presidency by disturbing the very fabric of logic and truth to the point where the hapless electorate could no longer see him for what he was, and could only focus on the other side of  the establishment whorehouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no truth or insight possible into a man whose every malicious action can be explained away as evidence to the contrary by some elaborate scheme of collective cultist denial.

       Ironically, one has to hope it was all an act, because if it wasn't, God help us all, it's Putin and Trump oppressing both their populations, wiping their asses with human rights and a fragmented E.U. dealing with a trend of self-hate amidst migration, asylum and terrorism pressures feeding populist nationalism.

       This sub always showed promise ... it always showed self-consciousness at the right times. Tptb have always dangled populist false conspiracy theories before their populations as a distraction, while the worst problems generated hardly any noise amidst a conspiracy of silence.

       Hillary had no real supporters. I would honestly be genuinely surprised if she got more than 100,000 votes in the primary, and 10,000,000 votes in the general election.
      </p>
      <p>
       She could barely fill a fucking middle school gym on her best day, but you're saying she got 60 million people to vote for her? Bullshit.

      <p>
       The truth is every single state was red in this election, and it is only a testament to her cheating engine that she got a single electoral vote.

       Sometimes that's how you keep it real... by trying to be as contrary as possible and see if you can get legitimately shut down. It doesn't mean you belive what you are saying... it is just a postulated theory to be confirmed or rejected.

       I'm not supportive of Trump in the least, but something is very suspect about a

       in which nothing is taken from the victim, who is shot multiple times.

       I've lived in a shitty neighborhood for most of my life. People get killed all the time in robberies gone wrong, nothing taken. All the time.

       In cities with shot trackers, cops are on the scene within seconds. And after Seth got shot they responded immediately. You stick around to root through someone's pockets after shooting them, you end up in handcuffs.

       All that considered, we're still left only with the
       <em>
        possibility

       of a robbery. I'm not aware of any evidence that substantiates this or any other conclusion. Why should it simply be allowed to fade away?

       Doesn't the fact that nothing was taken and that he was shot multiple times make it

       likely that he was deliberately singled out and murdered? These circumstances certainly do not conflict with such a scenario.

       He was killed in a neighborhood that had a spate of armed robberies. He had just taken a job with Hillary Clinton's campaign and told his parents it was a dream job. Intelligence officials have said there is absolutely no way he was involved in the DNC hack, that it was sophisticated beyond anything he could do.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is literally zero evidence to support the idea that he was assassinated by Hillary or the DNC or whatever. Its just a bullshit idea peddled by a guy addicted to attention (Assange) and bought hook line and sinker by people too stupid to really stop and think about it.

       I don't think r/conspiracy actually
       <em>
        liked
       </em>
       Trump, so much as we were preoccupied with exposing hillary's corruption. What I saw on this sub, is that Trump was a tool of contrast/comparison against Clinton's foul play. People here were quick to point out media biases and violence against Trump/his supports because its an injustice, which even if you don't like him is universally agreed to be unfair.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was mostly neutral towards him, favoring the third party candidates. Now that he's won though, I'm more willing to focus attention on him. I have a lot of hope that he might do good things, but am also ready to start getting outraged the moment he starts doing bad.

       users of r/conspiracy. Which I still feel was the majority of the users here. Yes, there were plenty of trump and putin nuts here too, but I didn't really see brigading like that in the pro Hillary subs. From what I saw, the anti-trump comments did get downvoted, but only when they lacked a fair argument. Neutral "I hate them both" or "remember, trump is also an evil elite" posts were generally upvoted. And given the high paranoia everyone had of CTR, I can understand why anti-trump comments got downvoted a lot.

       Trump paid a guy with a proven history of making attack videos by falsifying interviews  and making things up to make attack videos by falsifying interviews and making stuff up. This campaign head is a CEO of a media company known for manipulation of truth, now he holds a position in the federal government. This is exactly the kind of stuff this sub should be interested in, but we don't  hear a peep about it.

       Agreed. In fact, I believe that
       <strong>
        the collusion between (the criminally corrupt) Hillary Clinton, the DNC, the Washington elite (and the compromised DOJ in particular), the media and the polling organisations was the most pervasive and blatant State conspiracy of the modern age.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This Continuity of Government cabal manufactured and promoted a gigantic deception (that Hillary was a popular and viable presidential candidate) in order to steal the election, and they FAILED.
      </p>
      <p>
       Billions of dollars were spent, thousands of lies were disseminated to promote the big lie, and millions of people were systematically brainwashed  into supporting a criminal for the highest office (not just in the US but around the world).
      </p>
      <p>
       I am proud that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       was at the forefront of exposing that corruption and waking people up to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that she has been dispatched, I hope, to the dustbin of history, Donald Trump's sins and misdemeanours will inevitably get more attention from us. I hope that all the Trump supporters who have found this subreddit in the last few months will stay with us and help to monitor the new president's actions and policies so he remains accountable to the people, and doesn't become corrupted by the Washington machine.

       I think the good thing about Trump is that, because
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       many people despise him, he might be more likely to be held accountable for his bad actions. I'm pretty sure even a good chunk of the people who actually voted for him hate him. He's walking on thin ice so to speak, so he must tread carefully to avoid upsetting the American people.

       Yeah.  If you're going to claim to be anti-establishment, own it.  As soon as someone grabs hold of the reigns of power, they are now the establishment.  We can obviously root for them to do good, but we help them do good by keeping a very close eye on them which disincentivizes bad behavior.

       Totally agreed. Just like the Snowden is a panopticon bullshit. If anything at all hits the mainstream, suddenly it's a conspiracy. If Ron Paul won the election, there would be people in here who theorize that he secretly works for the Federal Reserve.

       Well, that's the ridiculously one-dimensional way of looking at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say the more reasonable conclusion is that those of us in agreement with the OP
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       supported him. We were in fact frustrated that this sleazy fascist creep - a friend of the Clintons (their daughters are friends too) - was receiving so much support from otherwise-informed people simply because he's been dressed differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       He received the official endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police and has openly stated his intentions to drastically expand the powers of law enforcement. He has also openly stated his plans to expand U.S. involvement in the wars in the Middle East, and not only endorsed the intelligence services' right to employ torture but said their leeway should be expanded.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is this man a threat to the power elite when his statements and actions suggest he's furthering their agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only has he already backpedaled on his half promises, but one look at his campaign staff, advisors, transition team and the people being contacted for cabinet positions reveals a
       <em>
        "who's who"
       </em>
       of lobbyists, Wall Street bankers, defense executives and military intelligence assets, including truly-odious personalities like alleged Octopus member Ed Meese.

       I'm a Clinton voter and you make a great point. Didn't hear shit about the environment in any debates or on major subs. This shouldn't be a wedge issue either. The environment should be a top priority for both parties, like it used to be in the 60s/70s.

       Clinton brought it up during the debates (and in her speeches), but there was no point in making it a question. If it were a question, the answers would have been a detailed plan from Clinton, and Trump saying it's a Chinese hoax to hurt or economy, so the moderator's would have been attacked for asking such "biased" questions.

       And what happened about the private Trump server that was in direct email communication with a Russian owned bank? Putin became pretty chummy after Trump won. Trump did campaign with foreign politicians, which, in the modern age, is pretty looked-down upon. What did Trump sell to Putin?

      <p>
       What's up with Trump wanting to dismantle NATO?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does he want to arm Japan with nukes and a standing army so it can continue to escalate tensions with China over the Senkaku Islands?

       Nothing*. Hillary fear-mongering. Trump said NATO members need to pay their 2% of GDP.
      </p>
      <p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Look up the % of GDP spending here:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Obama confirmed that Trump is ok with NATO:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Obama told reporters that Trump "expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships" when they spoke last week at the White House.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       *
      </p>
      <p>
       And whether he knew it or not, on one point, Trump was almost cribbing directly from Obama’s notebook when he said this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political and human costs — have to do it — of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so. They look at the United States as weak and forgiving, and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only four of 28 other member countries, besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia. The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense. And if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Strong words — that fit right in line with what Obama said in his speech to Europeans last week in Hanover, Germany (emphasis added):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “We need to stay nimble, and make sure our forces are interoperable, and invest in new capabilities like cyber defense and missile defense. And that’s why every NATO member should be contributing its full share — 2 percent of GDP — toward our common security, something that doesn’t always happen. And I’ll be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own defense.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       If you want a conspiracy, here it is: Russia would love nothing more than European countries to not spend their GDP on military but be dependent on USA. All Russia would have to do then is have only one target to weaken.

       Trump can fuck off with his 2% !
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all 2% of trillions is not the same as 2% of just billions that some countries have, some countries are just too poor to afford 2%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly most of the countries even that 1%-1.5% they afford now, they use to buy weapons from USA while US uses most of those trillions to make those weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       3rd, it's not about the military budget only. USA gets a market for normal products, natural resources, influence, support, a theater of operations away from their land, allies and lots much more in return. Example: US company Bechtel should have made 400 km of highway in Romania with 2.5 billion euro, we ended up paying 5.6 billion euros for 62 km. That's the military budget for 3 years.

       He isolationist. There's no money in mutually assured destruction. Russia's successes can be shared. China is the true enemy now. Japan has to be the bulwark against that threat. Let then exhaust each other in a war.

       I don't believe that he's a respected member of the establishment. Even G W Bush recommended Hillary over Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump certainly has a beef with some big banks, who apparently let him down a few times, and this might be popcorn times. 
His 9/11 truther ambitions ditto. If he talks just a little bit, it would be fantastic, but he might talk even much more to embarass the crooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not so sure what to expect for his foreign politics, given that he thinks of John Bolton. Cannot be much worse than Obama though.

       (Strictly for the sake of playing devil's advocate) He used his wealth and power to create more wealth and power, which is the basis of capitalism. I can't fault the guy over that. But to say Bush would take "the lesser" of any evil is ridiculous. That guy was a straight up puppet that probably had (definitely had) a hand in planning and executing the largest "terrorist" attack our country has ever seen. If Bush was pro-Clinton, then that is a damn good indication that it's bad for America. Shit, if Bush said "hey jump in, the water's fine", I'd probably toss a match in first just to make sure it wasn't gasoline and scan the tree line to make sure Chaney wasn't around with a blow torch.

       Get off it. Hillary and Bush are in the same club. They don't think about "the lesser of two evils". That's a line for us masses. Either Bush voted against Trump because he's not in the club, or because they want us to think he's not in the club. It has nothing to do with who they think is evil.

       Neither you nor I know how to get into the club but I don't think it's just by having lots and lots of money. Also, I'm guessing there is more than one faction. Their are certainly nuances of the social structure of the shadow elite that we are unaware of.

       We have played the lesser of two evils game for so long that this was bound to happen. Sadly, neither reps or dems can pull their heads out of their asses so this is what we get. Until people start accepting that they aren't going to get a good candidate by voting the lesser of two evils, the escalator to hell will keep pressing on.

       Clinton's camp purposely "elevated" Trump during the Republican primaries so that he would be the "pied piper" candidate. He was set up to be knocked down. Reflecting back on how I perceived him as a candidate 5 months ago, I think that strategy was working. Obviously, we now know it was a major mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       After he secured the leadership, that media coverage has been nearly 100% hostile to Trump. You'd have to perform some serious mental gymnastics to argue that the goal of their coverage was to propel him to victory. I actually still think the whole Trump phenomenon is ridiculous, but the Democrats are just reaping the whirlwind here.

       You're totally right, and I recognize that prospect. Ultimately, making a firm decision on this issue (is Donald just part of the master plan?) is almost impossible because there's still too much we don't know. I'm trying to stay open to optimistic scenarios, too, just so that I don't get too down thinking about the whole thing. (I'm recognizing my own psych. bias here.)

       I think him not being respected by his fellow establishment members was a significant reason why he ran. He's so petty about personal slights, this is the ultimate "I'll show them". But the thing is, they still dont respect him and if he does a poor he'll die being even more of a joke among that group.

       His advisers may make him keep his hands to himself, but they can't make him keep his mouth to himself. He can't open it without offending someone. And that half-assed "Stop it," he said on 60 Minutes was soooo heartfelt. Where is the "If you support me, you will not behave in a way that endangers another human being"? Nowhere.

       No, beyond his segment in Waking Life. I think he's either an idiot, or more likely someone who makes things up to push his brand. He knows if there wasn't some big conspiracy behind an attack/event no one would tune into his show or bother checking Infowars.

      <p>
       But regardless, I understand that people around here do like him. I just don't think they should follow and trust Trump because he has Jones' approval.

       Honestly, the Trump supporters in /conspiracy should know to question him now that he's won the election. All of you should know that TPTB wouldn't let him win unless he serves their goals. The only thing that can vindicate him now is an assassination. If he isn't killed during his presidency, we should all know who he was really working for the whole time.

       Does it really seem that crazy to you? If you accept that their is likely a global behind the scenes power structure doesn't it naturally follow that they would likely have their hands in the leadership of the most powerful nation on the planet? Or do you really believe that one ex marine with with access to a book depository was responsible for killing the leader of the free world?

       Who said I accept that there is a "global behind the scenes power structure?" The power structure is right out in the goddamn open. Massive political parties funded and controlled by wealthy special interests.

      <p>
       People just want to believe it's something more sinister and all-powerful because it absolves them of responsibility. We're not lazy and apathetic - we're hopelessly outmatched! Stop it.

       Oh my god are you serious? There's evidence against Hillary, because of wikileaks. Even without wikileaks, there's more against Trump. I can't even imagine if someone dug deep.

      <p>
       Have you not even TRIED to find problems with him? He admitted to not paying taxes through loopholes. He admits to not paying contractors after they've done the work. He didn't ever pay those singing American Trump girls at his rally, or his polling company. He's had over three thousand lawsuits, many regarding unethical business or not renting to minorities. TRUMP FUCKING UNIVERSITY.

       lol, gross exaggerations. Trump univeristy gave seminars on real estate, what was corrupt about it? You have nothing kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does Trump have more corruption then Hillary who received $25,000,000.00 from Saudi Arabi. Her campaign was funded by foreign entities, which is a crime. Fucking muslims that behead and stone women and still have slaves shouldn't be electing the US president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton stole millions from the Hatians and she should be in prison 10 years for every child that has died due to her charity theft.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious you are still a child since you have never filed taxes before. You are telling me that you don't claim any reductions on your taxes? Trump claimed losses and you think he paid 0 taxes? Are you retarded? Do you know what PROPORTY TAXES are? Obviously you don't need to pay those for your moms basement.

       Sigh.

      <p>
       So some of that is true. But you accuse me of exaggerating then quote facts from fake news. If you can find any if that in the leaked emails, that'd be great. Yes the foundation took money from SA, that's bullshit. The rest... exaggerated...
      </p>
      <p>
       But now you have to defend Trump WITHOUT just saying how bad Hillary is. So go ahead and do that.

       Also ad homonym attacks make you look stupid. And ironically young. Like you need to ask your parents what taxes are.

       If you want to understand the Trump love, read this transcript of his, less than a month before the election. Trump was speaking our language. Sure, he was doing it to gain power, and he likely has no interest in rocking the boat in a meaningful way. But, I think it was music to a lot of our ears to hear a candidate talking about broad-reaching establishment corruption by the upper class with the pure goal of gaining further enrichment.

       The word "conman" gets thrown around a lot, and I'll reserve judgement for Donald. I do think, though, he's great at getting what he wants, and making you think that it's what you wanted as well. And, much like Obama, what Trump says =/ what Trump does.

       Trump has proven he'll say just about anything, though. How many of his key campaign goals has he changed his mind on? Not that it's wrong to change your mind, but he's flipped on a lot of issues, much like Clinton.

       For me, the big question mark is still "why?" Clinton could be read like a book. Sure, you're against TPP after Sanders supporters show it's a big reason why they're supporting Bernie. You're just going to support it again after you're not accountable to them anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Trump, though? Who knows what behind-closed-doors conversations he's been having? Who knows what his biggest priorities are? Business, and specifically real estate, is his only obvious influence. He's going to come out of this presidency worth at least 50% more than he is now.

       It's funny people are making a big deal about him refusing the President salary, when he's supposed to have billions (or at least hundreds of millions) tied up in real estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he gets real estate values to go up 10% during his Presidency he'd make millions more than the paltry 400k salary. Not to mention things of non-monetary value like helping draft laws that give more bailout guarantees to big business or reduce his liability to pay taxes or damages in lawsuits. None of which will get as big a headline as "Trump takes $1 salary".
      </p>
      <p>
       We already know Trump is a big fan of gaming the tax system to his benefit (claimed countless corporate "bankruptcies" to avoid debts and tax). The idea he would want to clean all that up after a lifetime of taking advantage of it is unbelievably gullible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question is how long can he carry on business as usual with all the Washington insiders and corporate elites he's surrounding himself with before his supporters realize it.

       I'm not the OP you wanted sources from, but here are a couple showing the swath of Republican insiders on Trump's Cabinet, ie. the swamp rats in his "drained swamp" and many of which are staunch Bush era hooligans.

       Reince Priebus, Chris Christie, Jeff Sessions, Rudi Giuliani, Steven Mnuchin...yeah, sounds like a real swamp draining there.  What a complete farce.  Insiders, insiders everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know, the one making me laugh the hardest at the backflips it's going to induce in delusional Trump supporters is Steven Mnuchin.  16 years at Goldman Sachs...16 years as a Wall Street insider at one of the most corrupt banking corporations which crippled the US in '07 and caused the very money crunch that Trump has referenced at every turn to fire up the working class.  How exactly can Trump supporters still claim Trump is the anti-corruption candidate with a Cabinet containing Steve Mnuchin at the head of the Treasury?  It's fucking insane.

       Yeah the problem with that is the media jumped from one thing to another because there was so much and they were focused on talking points. If they really wanted maximum impact, they had to dig into it but they didn't spend nearly as much time as they should have really "exploring" it like we all explored the Clinton email case and had hours of testimony &amp; legal documents which were FAR more informative than a news broadcast.

       Just goes to show that when you machine-gun things like they did without really covering the impact, it doesn't sink in. I said all along Wikileaks's method of building a story &amp; being persistent (even on weekends) was really effective. They leaked the first emails in chains first, then next, then next, until you hit Pizzagate shit, Brazile shit, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I could go back to Benghazi (which IMO still has not been fully delved into specifically the Marc Turi connection - real
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       material) as something that was drawn out so heavily, so much detail as to the misconduct, that it left a mark on people like the email scandal did.

       The only reason this sub "loved" Trump is because the MSM was so unbelievably biased and astroturfed that we had to get "Truth" (read: the other side of things) from here or

        I believe Clinton is corrupt too, but the major difference I've seen between him and Clinton this election is that we've barely seen ANYTHING about Trump's behind-the-scenes dealings. We've been fortunate enough to explore massive investigations against Clinton, look at her and her foundation's financial records, see thousands of leaked and released emails, but we can't even see Trump's tax returns. I really don't like that there's some kind of assumption he's clean when he should be an obviously shady character and we know little beyond what he tells us.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's a metric fuckton of dirt on Trump too, but it never gets talked about in this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, there's far more concrete evidence for Trump engaging in pay-for-play with Florida AG Pam Bondi than there is for the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play, but all
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       wants to talk about is the latter. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this to dismiss Clinton Foundation issues. The Foundation is shady as fuck for sure. But regardless, the time devoted to each issue in this sub is completely out of whack with the strength of evidence in each case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another example: people in this sub were dredging up two decade old sexual assault allegations on Bill Clinton that have been resolved out of court, and simultaneously turning a complete blind eye to the multiple sexual assault allegations levied at Trump
       <em>
        right now
       </em>
       , which are in fact supported by Trump's own words captured on tape/video. Again, not trying to dismiss Bill Clinton's misconduct. He's obviously a predator. But time devoted to each issue in this sub is, again, completely out of whack with the strength of evidence in each case.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point being that there was no semblance of truth or non-partisanship in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for the last 10+ months. This place turned into
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       2.0. And frankly, despite this post being on the front page, it's still mostly the same as before. Clinton lost the election and is no longer relevant in US politics, but people are still focusing on her instead of discussing the multitude of legitimate concerns following our current President-elect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why I can't take this place seriously anymore. I'm done. It has become what it used to hate -- gullible group-thinkers, useful idiots being manipulated by the powerful.

       It's because Trump appears like he WAS an insider, not that he IS one.

       The assumption was that he knows things the rest of us are not privy to and resisted because of them.

       I don't get the sense that he has this hidden agenda he's trying to foist on us. I mean he's going to pretty much say something and then do it. And if he changes his mind on it, he'll tell us and do something different - but he won't hide it.

       What does it matter about Trumps back door dealings. He wasn't a politician his whole life influencing law making and sending troops to fight his wars. There's a difference and people seem to blur the lines. Yeah I can agree, this sub is not meant for promoting a candidate but it just irks me.

       Why I like Trump is because hes not afraid, or as afraid, to speak his own thoughts. For example he was interviewed on 9/11 there he said he couldbt understand how only one plane to each of the building could make them collapse, generel meaning i got. He seems to disagree to the political correctness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also FBI anon seemed to say there was little dirt on Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tax returns arent that important to me since i dont know if hillary has herself released hers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe even though Trump is a billionare/at least rich he has a patriotic feel for his country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish also to know if the title of nobility actually was completly ratified
      </p>
      <p>
       He really seems to care about his supporters, has multiple rallies, tries to listen to some of their ideas, making an application for job website for his, either transistion team or administration, or both, or they are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       People critizise him for getting money from his father, then goes and builds a large organization
      </p>
      <p>
       Hes a time traveller conspiracy. He has connection to Nicola Tesla through his uncle

       His run for Pres was first, revenge against Obama for making fun of Trump. His ego can't take any bruising because he is like a 13 year old girl.  Second, now he has to do this job.  He has no clue how to do it, and he hasn't spent any time up till now trying to learn.   You can't tweet a recession or a Hurricane away.

       It just amazes me that so many DT supporters who claim to be all about draining the swamp and taking big money influence out of politics don't seem to realise that when he says things like "I have top guys advising me on the issue" the top guys he's referring to are the exact same super-rich, politically motivated billionaires that already manipulate Washington. If you think Trump is getting his advice on jobs from anyone other than the same industry leaders destroying the job market then you're deluding yourself.

       There's enough information out there, if you're willing to look for it, that shows Trump is a corrupt businessman.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you trust Alex Jones too much, it probably means you're not getting the full spectrum of information that's out there... And what he's selling is a mixture of truth and conspiracy theory...
      </p>
      <p>
       And you can't tell which is which until a long time later - and then it either won't be mentioned again or he'll make up new conspiracy theories to explain why events didn't happen that he predicted.

        believe Clinton is corrupt too, but the major difference I've seen between him and Clinton this election is that we've barely seen ANYTHING about Trump's behind-the-scenes dealings. We've been fortunate enough to explore massive investigations against Clinton, look at her and her foundation's financial records, see thousands of leaked and released emails, but we can't even see Trump's tax returns. I really don't like that there's some kind of assumption he's clean when he should be an obviously shady character and we know little beyond what he tells us.

       This. People point out that Trump is better because of all of the dirt on Hilary. The reason for this is she is a politician and no matter how good a politician hides their less scrupulous dealings, there will ALWAYS be a paper trail because they are a civil servant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, like many billionaires, have no civil obligations and have much more powerful means to hide even delete their shady practices. Ditto for Soros, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, etc. At most you will find is some indirect connections,

       Personally I think that even though the CTR stuff was going on during the election the pro-Russia movement was even more boisterous. But maybe I'm crazy for thinking that. I dunno seems like of there was one place to talk about outside forces trying to manipulate American politics this would be the place to do so.

       There are many pieces of evidence and a lot of reasons to believe Russia was influencing Trump's campaign, whether Trump himself knew about it or not. Unfortunately, in here that always becomes "fake Clinton propaganda" or "Russia's our ally" with no one wanting to dig into it.

      <p>
       Not to mention the complete dismissal of Trump's possible pedo and rapist nature, while claiming everyone from low-level WH staffers to Obama himself is involved in secret satanic pedo parties.

       Trump feeds off fortune, power, and fame. He hardly has a great reputation in the business world itself. His goals are achieved through his name power and his charisma. The idea that he's running for the middle class is beyond insane, when nothing in his history suggests he has any interest in helping anyone other than himself and his associates.

       I dont think anyone sees him as clean, so much as a possibility for a clean slate in our current political landscape. Being able to get away from money that drives politics is a huge deal, and one of his declared plans for his "first 100 days." Im no supporter, but its kind of easy to see how he would be fine with not utilizing his new political status for personal financial gain, when he can just leave in 4 or 8 years and go back to doing all the underhanded albeit likily legal shit he was always doing to keep on making more money than he ever could have as a politician. Unlike Bill and Hillary, who literally prey on the system to amass thier small fortune.

       construction tycoon. It is unfortunately a part of the sector, which exists because of corrupt bureaucracy, it isn't something the actual entrepreneurs are at fault for. If you want to live in this world you'll never really be able to keep your hands clean, unless you go into a monastery.

       I doubt they bot. Spez would have detected it by now. He's not been shy about handing out sanctions to them before and botting is super easy to see.

       I think it's much more likely that they are just good at manipulating the algorithm, because half of them are from 4chan.

       They have some bots, but that's not really the interesting stuff... they have browser extensions / greasemonkey javascript that allows them to upvote all posts with a key press, basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like... manual botting. Or a much more circlejerk version of RES's upvote/downvote shortcuts.

       Possibly - but you have to admit, being able to have the vast majority of quickly rising threads, with thousands of upvotes in just a couple hours and just a couple dozen comments, for months on end, including during times when most americans are sleeping - that's very, very suspicious.

       Ehh, it's 4chan. Most people just plain don't upvote threads, they don't have to do much to manipulate that. It doesn't actually take many upvotes to put a post on /rising/. Reddit is a pretty flawed system in that regard.

       Are you referring to the one time some one ask him "Who are you voting for?"
      </p>
      <p>
       He replied by saying both names:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/59k22p/hey_its_reddits_totally_politically_neutral_ceo/d9929mu/?context=3">
        Hillary
       </a>
       first and then
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/59k22p/hey_its_reddits_totally_politically_neutral_ceo/d9929yb/?context=3">
        Trump
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He literally said both names to not raise any anger on either side. He also changed reddit's algorithm to gimp the_donald's ability to get on top of r/all as often. Sure is a funny way of supporting Trump.

       This. Exactly. This sub has been over ran by Republican workers hired by Trump's campaign to push doubt across the country. Obviously not saying that the Democrats don't need their fair share of criticism, but it's been obvious for the past 6 months especially that the majority of posts were made by hired hands to accelerate trumps campaign.

       No, they've been pushing items that are a non-conspiracy issue as conspiracy heavily on the daily. Likely hired Indian teams to work for low pay to constantly bombard this sub by pushing a conservative viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not correcting the records.  The other piece is that trumps campaign constantly says the media is owned by liberals and that they need to "level the playing field"... this is a blatant mistruth, as 90% of the media is owned by conservatives. By saying the opposite, the conservative campaign is using a sales tactic known as "placing blame on them, to take that focus off of you." It's when you know they can easily make a negative point about yourself and before they do you blame them for having this negative attribute. You see this tactic uses many times in arguments, you know the person is going to be called a liar or that they 'don't care', but before they do they will blame that reason on the other person -then the other party will feel like their not fighting fair if they say, "no that's you!" I've seen the Trump campaign use this tactic over and over.

       Look at his transition team. It's corporate lobbyists, giant banks, wall st insiders and career politicians.

       Maybe some economists?  Some Nobel Prize winners?  Anyone but greedy corporate CEO's?

       These CEO's already shipped millions of American jobs overseas and destroyed our economy less then a decade ago.

       Why the hell would these rich, corrupt lobbyists and banks suddenly turn around and help the same American people they've been fucking over for profit for decades?

       Not to mention, now that he will be the president, he is the ULTIMATE TPTB. Any government conspiracies from now on are going to implicate him until he's gone. So if they want to be able to say he's innocent, they should agitate for him for leave or be forced out of office.

       <strong>
        JE is Jeffrey Epstein
       </strong>
       , the convicted sex offender and pedophile kingpin. He owns an airplane, referred to as
       <em>
        "the Lolita Express,"
       </em>
       and a private island, in addition to numerous homes. It has long been alleged by numerous highly-credible sources that child prostitutes were brought to Epstein's
       <em>
        "parties,"
       </em>
       attended by the rich and powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Epstein's circle of friends include Trump, Bill Clinton, Edward and Evelyn de Rothschild, Queen Elizabeth II, David Rockefeller, Prince Andrew, Duchess Sarah Ferguson, Edgar Bronfman, Henry Kissinger, Peter Soros (George's son), Viscount William Astor, Ted Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, John Kerry, Tony Blair, Jose Aznar, Richard Branson, Alan Dershowitz, Michael Bloomberg, Rupert Murdoch, Ed Koch, Ehud Barak, Kevin Spacey, Michael Jackson, Mick Jagger, Courtney Love and
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       others.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of them appear in his infamous
       <strong>
        <em>
         "little black book,"
        </em>
       </strong>
       <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1508273-jeffrey-epsteins-little-black-book-redacted.html">
        which was leaked and can be read here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that there are pedophile networks operating in every nation at every level of society and in virtually every walk of life. These networks are largely intertwined and a part of a larger international structure under the control of the same elements that are in control global drug and arms traffic, both underground trades repeatedly shown to be inextricably tied to human trafficking operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would appear based on his address book alone that Epstein's ring is at the pinnacle of this global network. The unique concentration of the world's most powerful, closely-interlocked families  - Rothschild, Bronfman, Astor, Kennedy, Rockefeller and Windsor - makes that clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is how Trump has described Epstein, convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault against children:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        ""I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy, he's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.""
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Epstein and Trump certainly appeared to be close:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Epstein created a number of other odd categories, including one called "Jeffrey." There were dozens of names in the Jeffrey category, including Ehud Barak, Alan Dershowitz, then–Senator John Kerry, former senator and lobbyist George Mitchell, powerhouse DC lobbyist Thomas Quinn, and David Rockefeller.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Trump was also listed in this section. Under his name were 14 phone numbers, including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump's security guard and houseman.
        </strong>

       This claim is merely sourced to their
       <em>
        "investigation"
       </em>
       and the only sources they quote are Trump's attorneys, legally obligated to represent his best interests, and an unnamed
       <em>
        "associate"
       </em>
       of Trump. Furthermore, their claim that Trump and Epstein
       <em>
        "had no relationship"
       </em>
       directly conflicts with the evidence in Epstein's address book and with Trump's own statements about their fifteen-year friendship.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should keep in mind that
       <em>
        Radar Online
       </em>
       is a tabloid that has relentlessly supported Trump in the same way many other establishment publications have been backing Hillary Clinton. In its early days, it
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maer_Roshan#Career">
        was actually partly-financed by Epstein himself.

       Around 2011-2012,

        Trump's close friend

       David J. Pecker.

      <p>
       American Media also publishes
       <em>
        The National Enquirer
       </em>
       , which enthusiastically supported and endorsed Trump, and which leaked the information about Ted Cruz's extramarital affairs. After ownership of
       <em>
        Radar Online
       </em>
       passed to American Media, its founding staff and editors were
       <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/trump-sued-for-sex-crimes-via-epstein-here-are-the-facts-updated/">

       I gave you background on
       <em>
        Radar
       </em>
       because it is not simply relaying information from other sources but citing
       <em>
        its own investigation
       </em>
       as the source for the claim that Epstein and Trump no longer had a relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did find reference to
       <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton">
        a 2007 article in the New York Post
       </a>
       reporting that Epstein was banned from Mar-a-Lago. However, this was publicly announced weeks after he had plead guilty to sexual crimes against children and so it's likely this was simply for optics.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they really had no relationship, why did he
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       have fourteen numbers for Trump in his address book?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, Epstein isn't the only member of Trump's circle who has been directly implicated in organized pedophile operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       From
       <em>
        The Franklin Cover-up
       </em>
       by John DeCamp:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Gray's associate Wilson was apparently continuing the work of a reported collaborator of Gray from the 1950s -- McCarthy committee counsel Roy Cohn, now dead of AIDs. According to the former head of the vice squad for one of America's biggest cities,
        <strong>
         "Cohn's job was to run the little boys. Say you had an admiral, a general, a congressman, who did not want to go along with the program. Cohn's job was to set them up, then they would go along. Cohn told me that himself."

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ms. Rosenstiel claimed that in 1958 she and her husband went to a party at a New York hotel, where they met Hoover
        <strong>
         and McCarthy witch-hunt lawyer Roy Cohn.
        </strong>
        Hoover, whom Cohn introduced as "Mary," was supposedly wearing a wig, a black dress, lace stockings, and high heels. Hoover went into a bedroom, took off his skirt to reveal a garter belt,
        <strong>
         and had a couple of blond boys — one wearing rubber gloves — "work on him with their hands." Cohn and Hoover then watched while Lewis Rosenstiel had sex with the boys.

       Rudy Giuliani, who is
       <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/rudy-giuliani-john-bolton-are-leading-candidates-for-next-secretary-of-state-1479156004">
        currently being considered for Secretary of State
       </a>
       , headed the
       <em>
        "investigation"
       </em>
       of the pedophile operations at the prestigious U.S. Military Academy. Despite overwhelming evidence, Giuliani did not secure a single indictment and in fact facilitated the protection of the ring:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The West Point case, among others, was alleged to be linked to the Presidio case. As The Times Herald Record reported in June 1991, the "incidents [at the West Point Child Development Center] unfolded against a backdrop of satanic acts, animal sacrifices and cult-like behavior among the abusers, whose activities extended beyond the U.S. Military Academy borders to Orange County and a military base in San Francisco, parents charged." The case first broke in July 1984, when a three-year-old girl found herself in the emergency room of the West Point Hospital with a lacerated vagina. She told the examining physician that a teacher at the daycare center had hurt her. The next month, the parents of another child leveled accusations of abuse at the center. As the Mercury News reported, "by the end of the year, 50 children had been interviewed by investigators. Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Despite abundant medical and psychological evidence and literally dozens of child witnesses, and despite "950 interviews by 60 FBI agents assigned to the investigation," the investigation, "led by former U.S. Attorney [and future mayor] Rudolph Giuliani" produced "no federal grand jury indictments,"
        </strong>
        according to the Herald Record.
        <strong>
         "In 1987, Giuliani said his detailed investigation showed only one or two children were abused." Giuliani's contention was directly contradicted by an independent investigation, as the Herald report divulged: "a still-secret, independent report - produced by one of the nation's top experts on child sexual abuse - confirms the children's accusations of abuse."
        </strong>

        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It would later emerge that one of Giuliani's
       <em>
        "oldest friends"
       </em>
       is Fr. Alan Placa, a Catholic priest implicated in pedophile operations:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Rudy Giuliani's consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, has for years employed a Catholic priest who was accused by a grand jury of orchestrating the over-up of nearly 60 separate molestations allegation -- a priest who allegedly partook of the activities himself.
        </strong>
        The priest, Alan Placa,
        <strong>
         is one of Giuliani's oldest friends
        </strong>
        ; in turn,
        <strong>
         Giuliani has become Placa's highest-profile defender.
        </strong>

       This same network was about to blow wide open when the Saville scandal was unraveling. I lost track of it so I don't remember what happened. If it was all pinned on Saville as a loner or someone else took the scapegoat.

       Maybe, but they also ensured that the movement (which was very reddit based) didn't get co-opted by anyone else. For instance it would have been a slap in Sanders face if the movement got co-opted by t_d the way they sort of took over other subs.

       nah, the tea party was purely an anti-Obama movement and after he was elected the second time the energy behind it fizzled.  What you're saying is true though and is why it had no leaders.  Plus AstroTurfing by Grover Norquist and others undermined its legitimacy.

       That's some terrible logic. So you only tolerate outsiders? What if the outsiders are corrupt themselves?

       EDIT: I have no issues with this sub being critical of Trump. If I want a 24/7 Trump rally I go to The_Donald. Echo chambers are how we get shit like Hillary Clinton and shadow governments.

       There was a clear conspiracy against Trump to get hillary into office. Similar to what happened to Bernie.

       I think that was pretty much dubious as all hell. There was a fair bit of Trump bashing, but very little was made of potential ties to the Russians, his taxes, etc., relative to the amount of talk about some pretty big stretches for Hillary.

       Donald Trump supporters have a really creepy personality cult and master-submissive slave relationship with their lord and savior Trump, frankly i've never seen something like that, not even with SPORT FANS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit : For those who say "It's just humor"
      </p>
      <p>
       Well it's not humor anymore when it turns into into a real and systematic way of obstructing any critic against Trump, banning any one who dissent from the "Trump is perfect" narrative, and drowning any critic of him with whataboutism (But HRC did this, HRC is gone, so now you guys have to find other ways to defend him) and insults. It's also telling that Trump supporters don't feel confortable when they are in another sub when their lord and savior can be criticized, they are too used to their safe space.

       it is odd this masochism by proxy and attraction to strength for it's own sake. I imagine a small but not insubstantially so number of trump fans 'enjoying' whisky because it's what don draper drinks. Stupid sexy draper.

       This is so true! Some will gladly start an argument to defend Trump's honor....even if they are wrong or have no substance to their claims. A Trump supporter (friend of a friend) last night was harassing my almost 70 year old mother on Facebook. My mom stated her opinion in a kind and civilized way then he creeped on her page and was trying to tear her apart. I stuck up for her, asked him to stop, and he genuinely scared me with his volatile remarks towards my mother and myself. He was ready to terrorize any non-Trump supporter.

       They've gone full blown SJW. They've even created a safe space for themselves over on 8/pol/ and anyone that tries to bring in any type of wrong think is banned instantly. They're all completely unaware of how much of a joke they are and it's honestly pretty hilarious. They even play the victim card constantly and have threads about how people attack them for being Trump supporters or about how the world is against them. They're lack of self awareness in regards to how they've become the very thing that they criticize other groups like SJWs for being is probably worthy of a good case study.

       Take what you will from it, but I find it hilarious. The fact that the establishment can't control the idea of it (especially the media) or whether people are serious or not about referring to Trump as the God-emporer makes it even better. It irritated the opposition &amp; establishment and gets under their skin, which is the whole point of trolling..and Trump has done some legendary trolling this election year. I mean, Hillary Clinton herself targeted a fucking green cartoon frog named Pepe as a white supremacist. Her
       <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/donald-trump-pepe-the-frog-and-white-supremacists-an-explainer/">
        campaign website
       </a>
       sourced an article where the "white supremacist" they interviewed about Pepe was actually a Jewish teenager who took on a Taylor Swift/Jared Taylor pseudonym. Just think about that: an actual journalist was too stupid to even catch on to the fake name and the Clinton campaign just accepted it as a sound article. Like, how stupid are they and it just questions their ability to identify and distribute news.

       It's not just about saying "god emperor" it's about how they treat him in general
      </p>
      <p>
       No critic of him is accepted, and when a critic is unavoidable, they either use a whatabaoutism or reply with a formulaic message like "Society is so pc".
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything he does/says is considered amazing high tactical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       A caricatural confirmation bias (we all are prone to a degree for it) but the Donald fans could get you anything from a far dark fringe weakly-argured publication in the far-east if it confirms that Trump is amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning and insulting any remotely dissident voice etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's not just about saying "God", they really treat him like fervent religious people treat the figure of god.

       Still fits the "let's pretend we are Warhammer40000 Space Marines and let's pretend Donald Trump is the God Emperor of Mankind!" your disgust at what it looks like if taken seriously doesn't undo the grotesqueness present in a contemporary political figure spoken of as the living god of a Theocratic Junta... which would explain away the naivete at taking any internet support of Trump at face value. Anyone can switch words around after writing fanfic. notepad++ is  a nice example.

       Take what you will from it, but I find it hilarious. The fact that the establishment can't control the idea of it (especially the media) or whether people are serious or not about referring to Trump as the God-emporer makes it even better.

       I see the same team mentality from both sides. I really don't care. I use Reddit to hear from proclinton supporters and voat for protrump. I like truth and you only get it from hearing both sides. Truth is people don't like to feel like they are not welcome by the "in group". People naturally team up and you can't be a team without opposition.

       Following the phenomenon has been extraordinary. The fever and deflection's been intense, and then we watched this shit get cycled into memes and through social media until the point where Marina Abramovic was asked about performing satanic blood rituals with politicians and elites during dinner. Truly remarkable spin job, and it worked. The Big Lie assigned fully to the establishment left.

       We needed a 10 month circle jerk of donald only because we knew what would happen if clinton won.   However now that trump won we should start keeping an eye on him to make sure he does the things he said he would...

       TPP is bigger than the US and will be passed. NAFTA, hahaha, that's laughable. Does he really think he's going to bring jobs back to the USA when shits already way inflated as it is. You think your produce is expensive now? and Lockherup... Trump loves the Clintons, period. Can't believe so many has bought what this expert con artist has sold.

       It's coming. CIA had wiretaps on NY FBI office, Putin, Manafort, Glen Greenwald, Scott Walker, Rudy Guiliani, James Comey, Julian Assange, Roger Stone, and a man in Florida who tried to switch the voting machines. They're also releasing his tax returns in the Times next week, an Apprentice video where he calls someone a nigger, and a conversation he had with some Epstein guy about having sex with a 16-year-old. Obama waiting for a period of calm. They have the navy (7 seas/7th floor) helping them devise the rollout for next week, but needed a period of calm. A lot of elite mobsters and career criminals are getting locked up for actual crimes with proof of intent and we're probably going to have another vote before Christmas. For once, something is actually bigger than Watergate....on a global scale.

       My understanding of Trump is that he's not a loyalist to a party or an ideology. He does what he thinks at the time is the right thing to do - which leads to reversals of position on many subjects. If he were a rock-ribbed yellow-dog Democrat, or if he were just a New York Republican, charges of "flip-flopper" would have some meaning. But they don't, because he doesn't have a rigid ideal he adheres to. When he changes it's just a change, not an abandonment of principle. Combine that with the fact that he's 101% full of bluster, very self-confident, and accustomed to getting his way, and he's explained pretty thoroughly in my opinion.

       Well, he has advocated nuclear war, advocated overturning the 1st, 4th, 5th, 8th, 14th, and 15th amendments, supported the Russian invasion of Crimea, been a proponent of nuclear proliferation to countries like Japan, talked of renegotiating treasury bonds and collapsing the global financial market, asked foreign espionage agencies to hack political opponents, claimed climate change was a hoax, tried to gut the EPA, proposed increasing the national debt by $5 trillion dollars, and accepted funding from Russian sources, among other issues.

       It's crazy how easily people were duped by trump and just how misinformed the voters were. You could have been casually paying attention to the issues and known he was an abysmal candidate. Every rational complaint you could have about clinton you can also very easily apply to trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention passionate Trump supporters are absolute cancer. I have never hated a political movement more in my life. They're even worse than regressive left SJW's. They talk in memes. They don't know how to communicate without passive-aggression. They embrace anti-intellectualism. They supported one of the worst candidates we have EVER SEEN.

They bent the democrats over and proved that the democratic party is corrupt as can be. Republicans got the presidency, the Senate, the House, and the Supreme Court.

       Bernie got screwed by the DNC; Absolutely backstabed and ignored. Bernie should have been up against Trump this general election but the Democratic party refused to take the opinion of the masses and instead took the opinion of the elite.

       I completely disagree. Bernie doesn't spread hate, fear and encourage violence among his supporters. And most importantly, he's not a goddamn moron. The only thing Bernie and Trump supporters have in common is that they both hate the establishment, that's literally it.

       That similarity is pretty powerful though. Obviously it was a major variable to Trump winning. Many people felt beaten down and ignored by the establishment who were on the Sanders train. When it looked like he too got shafted by the establishment, they turned to the other outsider. It was the ultimate poke in the eye to the elites.

       For the record, I'm with you on this. I've just been thinking a lot this past week about all of this, trying to make sense of it all.

       I agree that the establishment and the DNC needed to lose and get a rude awakening, but not under these circumstances. If it were any other candidate than Trump, I'd be rooting for the GOP after Sanders lost. Hell, I'd take GWB or even Romney over Clinton after knowing how they fucked over Sanders, but since it was Trump or Clinton, I'd rather she win than him.

       100% agreed. After she won the primary, I considered not voting at all in disgust, but eventually went to her side (holding my nose) just to prevent Trump. Turns out that lack of enthusiasm for Clinton was pervasive, and was another variable to Trump's win. I just hope Bernie paved the way for the future of the Democratic party.

       Who does Trump hate? He's never encouraged or spread any hate of any kind whatsoever. I'm actually interested to see whom you think he "hates".
      </p>
      <p>
       Spreading fear? This is very subjective so I'm not sure what you mean, but I do know that Liberals/Democrats are a much more sensitive bunch than anyone else. Fear of ISIS? You betcha. Fear of losing jobs to increasing illegal immigrant acceptance? You betcha. Fear of losing freedom of speech? You bet Trump is. Putting our liberties at risk is a fair reason to be fearful of our country. Are democrats not spreading fear of a Trump presidency? They are as well, so I'm not sure why you're bringing this up.

       You kidding me? How many times has he antagonized people of other races, insulted them, lied about them. Not just people of other races but women too. If you really don't think Trump is a fear and hate monger than you probably are too or you're just goddamn stupid like he is. Maybe he doesn't really believe what he says and he's just appealing to his base of racists and sexists, in which case he might be smarter than he seems and you're all just morons for believing him.

       Have you been living in a different universe? Did you hear him say most Mexicans are bad, or insulting the judge's decision because of his Mexican heritage, or trying to ban all Muslims and tag them, implementing stop and frisk and essentially legalizing racial profiling, saying he sexually assaults women, insulting McCain because he was a POW, insulting the disabled reporter. The list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       There probably isn't a single demographic he hasn't insulted or antagonized. Trump fans are just enablers of hate, fear and inequality and if you don't see that there is no hope in reasoning with you morons. All of you are ethically and morally lost. Deplorable is the right word to describe Trump and his fans.

       He never said most Mexicans are bad. He said those illegally crossing the border to enter the U.S. often do not bring the best along with them. How many illegal doctors, lawyers, rocket-scientists do you know? - I can tell you - ZERO
      </p>

       Insulting a judge because he's Mexican? Where did this happen? I assume you're talking about the Hispanic Indiana Judge, right? Do about 5 minutes of research on this topic for me so I won't have to respond to this idiotic comment.

       Banning all Muslims? LOL what? Muslims are free to enter the U.S., so I'm not sure what you're talking about. Individuals trying to enter the U.S. from Syria or Iran? Of course Americans want them to be properly analyzed.... Would you allow anyone in your home without knowing they are good people? - of course not.

      <p>
       Stop and frisk? Go ahead, stop and frisk me. Guess what? You'll find a cell phone, a wallet, and my keys. Maybe a kleenex if it's cold outside. You surely won't find an unlicensed gun on me, but if you'd like to look go ahead.

       Sexually assaulting women? You mean all the cases that have been debunked? This has as much verifyable evidence as me saying you've raped me.

      <p>
       Finally, insulting McCain? You mean the same way Obama and the democrats did during 08'? Yeah, the democrats were brutal towards McCains health and war history. Trump on the other hand said one off-base statement. I don't agree with what he said toward McCain, but actions speak louder than words my friend.

       One of my co-workers, who is an engineer, told me his parents crossed the border illegally. He went to a top 10 engineering school, and is a good &amp; smart dude. This is just an anecdote, and I'm not even saying most situations turn out this way. But Trump implied the opposite, that most are criminals, which IMO is unwarranted fear mongering. In his initial speech he never said "illegal" or "undocumented", which I believe was a calculated move (i.e. dog whistle). Why do you think white nationalists support him across the board? Where were they for Romney, McCain, Bush?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the truth is somewhere in the middle. Most illegals are just trying to make a better life for themselves and their families. You're more likely to find one in a restaurant kitchen than a dark alley waiting to mug you. Certainly we should secure our border and deport criminals. Seems to me like we've been doing a good job of that under the Obama administration. Just look up his numbers and compare them to Bush (or any other administration).
      </p>
      <p>
       Like voter fraud, this was an overblown issue, just to fire people up. Seemed like a risky move to me at the time, but looks like the gamble paid off.

       The masses on the left didn't support Bernie, unfortunately. Talking about older Democrats who were afraid he was too far left to appeal to independents and undecided. I do believe Bernie had the deck stacked against him, but even straight up, Hillary wins the primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that there were many Bernie supporters who turned to Trump, and there oddly is some overlap there. When you have progressives blasting you, it doesn't bode well for your chances of winning.

       I appreciate your opinion. I personally do believe that Bernie would have had a better chance at presidency than Clinton, but there is no way of entirely knowing. Bernie certainly had the younger vote, but Clinton likely had the older vote, but who exactly can know for sure what the outcome would have been if the democratic candidates were flipped.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do hope, however, that this continues to open a more respectable discussion amongst eligible voters. Bernie surely helped to draw appeal from millennials and younger voters, and I do think that anyone getting involved with politics is a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully, with more people getting involved with politics, we can have a country that is more representative of our citizens opinions and values.

       Yeah, there's no way to know. I think Clinton picked up old guard Republicans that were disgusted by Trump, where they may have just opted out of voting altogether if Sanders was the nominee. But I think Sanders would have appealed more to working class people who voted Trump in key swing states.

       The rules of the game was to win the electoral college, not the popular vote. How does it feel to lose the presidency in the way that our country's democracy has worked for hundreds of years? Probably bad, ey?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the presidency was won through the popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have had a completely different game plan. If American football was won by who got the most rushing yards, then both teams would completely change their game plans in order to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go figure Trump won. He followed the rules that have been decided for hundreds of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the losing team got more rushing yards than the winning team, should they get the victory? NO, because they lost given the rules of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       You likely have been given a participation award your whole life from losing that you don't understand what it truly means to win or lose. Take a step back and realize that you lost regardless of any false circumstance you can think of.

       Tour fear of him going to war with Russia is a unfounded and based on bullshit reporting.  His campaign was about peace with everyone.  Russia declared, the day after he won, that they are willing to work with Trump.  Clinton was a hawk like no other.  She wanted war with Russia.

       For the record I'm an independent and think both candidates were garbage.

       But the whole Clinton wanted war with Russia thing is far and away one of the dumbest accusations that came out of the campaign. That was when the Trump campaign realized it could literally say anything and people would buy it, and the media would repeat it.

       Crimea is historically Russian and they overwhelmingly voted in a democratic referendum to return to Russia.  It was exactly what the people wanted, not some hostile takeover as described by Western Propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saudi Arabia exports violent wahhabist terrorism across the globe and is the main funder of ISIS.  They buy massive amounts of weapons to support the Military Industrial complex, and absolutely ravage helpless nations such as Yemen.  They profit almost exclusively from selling oil and destroying the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is surrounded on all sides by advancing NATO forces and US military bases.  It has been fending off a massive geopolitical and economic war being waged on it by Western powers.  The war is waged through sanctions, West-backed Saudi move to sell oil so cheap that Russia must sell at a loss, Western takeover of neighbouring Nations (US was heavily involved in the Ukraine coup, almost identical strategy to Iran in 1953), and proxy/resource wars such as in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia isn't blameless, but it is the only country with the balls to stand up to the ultimate evil in this world: The Western War Machine.  But.. if you didn't know that, what the hell are you doing in this subreddit?

       I mean, he said that he would do them, so I think it's less reasonable to think that he wouldn't.

       Knowing how he is prone to changing opinions at the behest of a crowd though, makes one doubt every word he says.  It's like he was a politician all along.

       My statement was a little too blunt, that was my error, but if anyone really thinks he will take away any of the amendments; something that crazy, that just could not happen. The backlash would be unreal, as unreal as that really happening

       Oh yeah, of course.  I didn't mean to be dismissive, just wanted to stress that it's still important he said those things.

       However, I do think that there is a remote possibility.  I'm praying that it never happens, but I can imagine, in the worst course of events, Trump revoking certain freedoms to preserve a good image for himself or his administration.

       i'll use the amendments, as i feel that would have the most backlash. Taking away most of our bill of rights, is not something that one side agrees with and one side hates, no one wants that.
1st Amendment; every one wants this, maybe an absolutely tiny minority, and the second amendment, applies to most trump voters in general. i think if he were to try something like that, we would see REAL protesting, with everyone coming together as one, to stop such an unconstitutional act from ever happening. Of course, maybe i have too much faith in humanity

       I think that the difference is ""traditional"" conspiracy theories emerge when somebody finds something weird and tries to come up with an explanation, while the conspiracy theories being cooked up by the Donald are merely an attempt to discredit their political opponents.

       I agree, though now that Trump is the president-elect I think that his actions need to stand on their own. Clinton's actions may have been worse but that does not make Trump's actions acceptable.

       But many people don't seem to realize how incredibly dangerous this is. Given that he has no real (as in reliable) policy or platform to work from, the first time he really has to make a hard decision it will have a random and unforseeable outcome, and such extreme uncertainty at that level is how markets crash and wars (the truly seriously nasty kind) get started.
      </p>
      <p>
       World politics do not tolerate uncertainty, and Trump is (and ran on a platform of) being a wildcard incarnate.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if he says we should go to war with Russia at 3am on Twitter? Oh my god.

       He must be the world's most clueless guy then, hiring Bannon for his propaganda campaign and now for the white house. He must know the hatred Bannon's built himself around and helped to stir up in this country. Without ideology or morals at all, Trump's a vacuum for anyone who helps him win and look good.

       I think this is exactly the case. Trump has no way of knowing how damaging the things he does can be for the rest of the country. It terrifies me not because he's an evil person but because he's a deeply ignorant one.

       That's what he comes around to in every interview. They ask him about his stance on social issues and he's like "why are you worried about that? I'm trying to get the country back for the people, and bring back jobs, not worry about settled law."

       Abortion is an exception to that though. The people who are against abortion truly believe it is murdering a child. It isn't just about the woman's right to choose but also about the life that was removed with no say.

       He isn't against gay marriage. If you've seen his most recent CBS 60 minutes, he said there is no point to overruling the marriage equality act. Mind you, the act was passed in a court with the majority being conservative, 5-4, in fact.

       He was pro-choice years ago, and he changed even before he ran. While he has been running and a bit before he was anti-abortion.

       He was never against gay marriage. Not once. Nor was he against trans-rights. Trans-rights he has said from day one he protects but thinks should decide what to do with the bathroom issue, not him.

       The first time Trump mentions he is anti-abortion was his speech to Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011 so no it wasn't before he was running. He literally said "I just don't feel good about it," Trump said. "I don't feel right about it. I'm against it, and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it's like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I'm opposed to gay marriage."

       Well, regardless of your feelings of how "flip-flopping is not flip-flopping if you're not a politician," he's definitely a politician now.  He's already reversed his positions from what he was saying on the campaign trail, not sure why you're failing to recognize even that.

       He was a politician before, too.  To get major construction projects done, politics is a thing you need to do.  Politics, or be super late and way over budget, and your hair is all pulled out from frustration at the WHYCAN'TYOUJUSTGIVEMEADANGPERMIT people from the City.

       It needs to be more widely-known because people don't understand the nature of the man, and they are scared and confused when there is plenty of other stuff to be scared and confused about.  My opinion is that the paragraph explains Trump.  The rest of the paragraph is the result of analysis.

       That might make sense if his positions didn't change from one day to the next. Yeah, pragmatism is often good. What isn't good is denying you said something 24 hours after you initially said it.

       You don't need to be an ideologue to flip-flop. If you say "This is my policy" one day, then a week later you say "Nevermind, my policy is now the complete opposite".
      </p>
      <p>
       Then that's a flip-flop, regardless about whether you adhere to a strict ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course sometimes people should, and do, learn something and change their position on it. The difference there is how often it happens, and how obvious it is that something is just pandering to whoever they happen to be speaking to at that particular moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has most definitely flip-flopped a significant amount.

       I think that was the key to this election, and it may mean that even people like Bernie Sanders are on their way out. Parties are done and none of them seem to realize it. Both the Democrats and the Republicans were severely de-legitimized by this election cycle. People are realizing that it is all a joke.

       You know it sounded ridiculous at first but, honestly, a smart man couldn't have done better than Trump has of hiding his intentions from most everyone. Makes me wonder if there really is something going on in that golden head of his.

       Well, then we can't trust him. Even if it's just a tactic to throw people off how can we be certain of where he stands on anything? He could be Jesus or he could be Hitler, but I personally would not be willing to take that chance. Better the devil you know than the one you don't.

       Before the election, it was either/or to many. Damaging Hillary meant electing Trump. Admitting Trump's flaws meant electing Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that's over, so maybe we can finally admit that Trump is the most full of shit person to ever win the presidency. Nearly every fact or stat he said was a lie, and his policy proposals wouldn't pass a financial review by a fifth grader.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, in less than a week after winning he walked back like half of his ridiculous promises. Maybe it won't be a literal wall and Mexico paying isn't a priority, not looking at a Muslim ban yet, maybe we won't repeal Obamacare yet, not immediately deporting all illegals, we are probably moving on and not appointing a prosecutor for Hillary, etc.

       Why would you assume that because he says Trump has no truth to offer that he's saying the DNC is nothing but truthful.

       That's all that this election was about it seems, one side would criticise the other and the other would say "nuh but yours is worse because...." without actually looking at any valid criticisms. Literally just shit flinging the entire campaign.

       ok, but trump got elected, you can't blame Clinton for anything or compare them anymore. If trump fucks up, and then you say something like "Clinton would have done worse" you're missing the entire point. don't hold someone else accountable for his actions and don't compare them as the campaigning is over and responsibility is trump's.

       what would you like to blame on him ?
      </p>
      <p>
       20 million more with health care
      </p>
      <p>
       4.5% unemployment.
      </p>
      <p>
       and he deported a lot of illegal immigrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can blame him for that as well as anything else negative he has done.
      </p>
      <p>
       oh and bin laden.
      </p>
      <p>
       and trump is already filling cabinet with lobbyists and corrupt politicians, like he said he wouldn't hahahaha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you are blaming the last president, then might as well take that train all the way back. Obama didn't really leave as shitty a situation as bush. it's obviously not perfect, but it's never really been.

       I get your point, but honestly I will always blame her for forcing me to vote Trump. All she had to do was stop being a two-faced piece of shit for ~18 months of her goddamn life and she just couldn't do it. Fuck her and the DNC and the rest of her crooked cronies, now we HAVE to watch it burn, because of her. I hope Trump's book really was his Mein Kampf and his fear mongering and chauvinistic, ignorant bullshit was completely faked. That would be the greatest slap in the face for career politicians imaginable.

       Well staying home was a choice, but I firmly believe that if you don't participate in the election you forfeit any rights to an opinion on the outcome, and I have opinions so I had to do something. Gary Johnson is a bumbling moron and Jill Stein believes printing new money settles debt, so I was pretty much forced to vote against Hillary with Trump. Maybe Bernie has a shot in 2020 if he's still alive.

       The left is a religion. Criticizing Clinton does not mean much as Clinton will quickly be replaced by another useful idiot. So, the argument that Trump has no truth is countered by the leftist party, that is the DNC. It is absolutely in line philosophically to make this comparison.

       Write what you want. But, after 600 days of unchallenged insults from the left, I'm tired of it. You insist on insulting Trump without evidence to back it up, I'll be insulting the left,except that I have evidence to back up what I say.

       This is the conspiracy sub, and we all just lived through one gigantic conspiracy that actually happened but instead of dealing with it the leftist side of the aisle only focuses on insulting Trump. It's childish and misses an opportunity to learn from the nightmare we just went through.

       There's evidence of a Trump conspiracy too. Sorry just because you're partisan doesn't mean we can't criticize your "God Emperor" (pro-tip: they're both corrupt). In the conspiracy subreddit we don't ban people for dissenting opinions.

       The Mercer family is much, much more 'populist' aka fascist than the Kochs and basically wants to make things white again.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they want a white, 50s style America again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mercer's basically gone on record saying that. It's their goal.

      <p>
       That and with automation, the wealthy don't need Mexicans anymore, they have robots to keep labor cheap, so it's time for them to go.

       Trump is a narcissistic megalomaniac. He seems to say what he thinks you want to hear. Clinton is out of her mind crazy. They both suck. That is not the point. My point is if you want to insult Trump, give me some evidence to back it up. If it's just an insult, keep it to yourself or expect a response in kind.

       She's many things...ambitions, calculating, cold, egomaniacal, narcissistic, but she's not crazy.  There's zero doubt in my mind that she would mostly do what's best for the country, even if you don't entirely agree with it.

       Actually, it is. Trump doesn't represent much of the conservative community, so it's not the same to insult Trump as to insult conservatives. But, the left is like an unthinking ball of emotional turmoil. Regardless of which useless idiot is the "leader", should they lose, the religion simply replaces them and keeps going. Thus, the most effective nomenclature of the left in this country is the DNC.

       I don't care if people insult Trump, but the first comment is only focused on Trump. If you are going to be insulting, at least give some evidence besides your own opinion. Geez, I'm so damned tired of the never ending unchallenged insults from the left.

      </p>
      <p>
       Leak his emails and tax returns. Then we can compare.
      </p>
      <p>
       But holy shit. Even still. OK, forget the crazy shit he says. What about failing to launch a casino, embezzling millions from it to turn a profit while not paying the contractors that built it. That's just ONE of his business ventures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take Trump university. A scam to get money from people promising real estate knowledge. Neat. And he paid the Florida attorney general to not bring the case, and she didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't ever pay those dancing freedom girls from the rally!

       Much better. Ok, Hillary was in public service which is why her work is open to scrutiny. What Trump did was private, and much harder to investigate. Doesn't change the things Hillary did, but it's true that Trump is no consolation prize.

       Muslims were very easy to fold into the narrative. Sharia law is a form of extreme theocratic totalitarian socialism, The Quaran replaces Das Kapital, and thus the crazed actions of some are used to villify an entire ideology and culture. Now we have church and state happily hand in hand in response, our own extremist reply.

       For one, I simply look at who are the biggest pushers of climate change, and how important it is to them. They want that sweet, sweet carbon tax, and to deindustrialize the West. It's pushed by the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Clintons, Obama, Gore, etc etc etc. ALL THE USUAL SUSPECTS that should cause people on this sub to at least be suspicious if they are knowledgable
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       on the subjects covered in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a very, very clear agenda of destroying the West right now, through mass immigration, through impossible debt, and through deindustrialization. The way TPTB always set up these things is like, oh, you either accept climate change, or you hate the environment and want us all to drown in rising oceans or a new ice age. I mean Al Gore owns plenty of property that, if he is right, will be flooded. Remember when all the top climate scientists got caught doctoring data? It was a huge scandal, but it just got pushed right under the rug.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am personally all for massive shifts in the way we conduct business, capitalism, and all the rest of it, but how does deindustrializing the West, while allowing China and India and whoever else to fill the gap, how does that solve anything but fucking over Europeans while allowing other countries to become prosperous and take over the world? For me its not even about the science, I'm not qualified to comment on that, and I wouldn't pretend to be. I am very, very concerned about the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT the fact that the mainstream media and every other politician tries to ram climate change down our throats 24/7 makes me not trust the agenda one bit.

      <p>
       It's not an agenda, it's a fact. And they're shoving it down your throat because people need to accept it because it will destroy the planet if they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if your evidence for not accepting is because people you don't like believe in it, you're a goddamn idiot. You'll notice at no point in your post did you address any of the evidence. Just "these people probably have ulterior motives because reasons!"

       So if these fucks were serious about climate change then surely they would order business not us consumers to change their M.O. ie make products that last and cancel debts so we dont need a system that requires constant consumption to pay the debt off.

       Cancelling national debt won't do anything to help the environment. Active steps need to be taken. That's a really outlandish idea though, never heard that one.

       The repayment of unrepayable debt has to be covered by endless over-consumption of goods that require ENERGY to produce.
       <br/>
       The economic model we have requires us to destroy the planet.
       <br/>
       So sorting out the debt problem ....etc

       All earths problems are EASILY solved.

       I want your thoughts on this:
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can agree that industrial nations produce CO2 as a byproduct of their economic productivity, then limiting emissions caps production, which hurts their economies. I can't think of any reason for a nation to cut back on its industry and hurt its own economic growth other than a larger force with which it cannot battle alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically if the two countries most poised for growth in this century have chosen to limit their emissions, what does that tell you about what the people at the very top are seeing that we are not?

       You're saying that China and India have chosen to limit their emissions? If they have even actually done that, which I honestly doubt, all their CO2 models that I've read about say we have gone past the point of no return already, so if they really wanted to do something about it, wouldn't they just have shut everything down and declared absolute emergency? Or maintained the bare essentials?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, more likely, they have agreed to go along with the agenda in a limited way for publicities sake, because they have been pressured to do so by big banks.

       You lost me a little bit back there so I'm just going to try to summarize your point:
      </p>
      <p>
       "We should not do anything about climate change because it costs money and we don't want to pay money. We're also unsure of the return on this investment. [And of course something about big banks because why not.]"

       I'll bite. Do you know the level of CO2 in the atmosphere by percentage composition as of today? It's less than 0.1%. Do you know what it was during prehistoric times, like the age of dinosaurs? More than 10%. Do you also know about how vegetation THRIVED in high CO2 levels? CO2 is plant food. Reducing its levels drastically will impact farming, agriculture and vegetation as a whole and our survival as a species will be threatened heavily. Please note, that this is not an endorsement to open pollution; stopping pollution is a great idea, and a step forward to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels should be encouraged nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know the current state of the shitshow that is the carbon tax industry? Do you know that one of the biggest profiteers of that industry is Al Gore? Also, are you aware that all predictive climate models have FAILED so far? And that the trend in the garbage of a concept called "global average temperature" has been a completely flat line? Are you aware that the size of the Arctic Ice Cap has actually increased, the same Ice Caps Al Gore's rubbish documentary An Inconvenient
       <del>
        Truth
       </del>
       alleged would melt off completely by 2008?  Did you know that polar bear census has reported an all-time HIGH in its population??

      <p>
       Finally, I got one word for you: Climategate. Do let me know your thoughts on this scandal which reveals how prominent climate "experts" manipulated data before publishing to suit their agenda

       You are the one not knowledgeable at all though...There isn't a national scientific academy on the planet that disagrees with man made global warming and 97% of climate scientists do. Do you think they are all bought out? Sweet Jesus. Wait, you are a conspiracy nut so you probably do.

       Jesus man, just google "blue ocean event". That is literally the only thing you need to look at to accept global climate change. If you think that this is a debatable subject at this point, then you are the one making the rest of us look like crazies to the rest of the world, and guaranteed, you will be among the dangerous desperate people once this shit accelerates beyond denial.

       and of course, to determine the effect and severity, we only 'literally' need to look at ONE thing. Not other things with it, like 800,000 years of temperature or co2 data. but ONE thing.

       Not one guy, ignorant public opinion in general. All of the things you listed stem from this problem. Historic CO2 levels, changing weather patterns, etc. are all great pieces of evidence but anyone who is genuinely trying to get the truth should be able to accept climate change as something that is really happening just based on research into blue ocean event alone. Someone can look at co2 levels and still be skeptical about their effects. A blue ocean event is very clearly a sign of change.

       OY VEY NAZI'S what about Jewish communists/zionists/globalists that ACTUALLY are trying to take over the world? And have done so, to a large degree? I can't discuss that because Jewish controlled Hollywood has programmed you to think that the only thing that must never be questioned is the underlying motivations or actions of the precious chosen people?

       "Racist" is just an empty pejorative. Doesn't mean anything. There's nothing secret at all about Jewish power, if you open your eyes to it. Nazi's don't control the USA or the banks or Hollywood or Israel. Jews do. Don't like that fact? Doesn't change the fact that it's a fact. You should watch

       Well that's not how it works. I don't have to prove anything is false. Believing something stupid without any evidence means you deserve to be called stupid. Like religion, people always say "Well you can't prove it isn't real so you can't criticise." Things don't work that way. I'm not saying anything is true or false, I'm saying that believing shit with no evidence is stupid and just shows that you just believe whatever fits in line with your agenda.

       Where do you think we are? It's a conspiracy sub. Labeling someone stupid because they may believe something you don't is a prime example of how you discredit the opposition. Something the powers at be would do. I bet you haven't even looked into said conspiracy. Some of it lines up and is quite spooky. The fact that you are saying this is one subject we can't cover just adds more fuel to that fire.

       Again, you're misunderstanding. I'm not labelling somebody stupid for believing something I don't. I'm labelling them stupid for believing something for which there is no evidence to believe and for which their only obvious reason for believing is because they have an agenda and so everything needs to fit neatly into it. And a bit of overt racism as well.

       rallying behind Trump considering the threat Hillary pose(d?) (and I honestly think it's dishonest to consider pro-Trump stuff pro-Republican since the RNC tried everything they could to deny him the nomination and the presidency) BUT I agree with you that this sub is infested with shills and disinfo agents and is altogether mostly a cesspool. Someone needs to drain this swamp!

        Climate Change Denial

      <p>
       The debate is whether or not Climate Change is
       <strong>
        Anthropogenic
       </strong>
       , which is very debatable, and frankly it is quite proven that regressive world policies surrounding "climate change" do nothing but stifle economic and industrial growth for smaller companies and developing countries. Climate Change in of itself is a natural process no one denies...

       Second, they are actual ideas. You don't have to like an idea for it to be an idea. Racism is an idea. Eugenics is an idea. Creationism is an idea. Calvinism and fatalism and nihilism are all fucking ideas, regardless of the dangers they may or may not bring along.

       Have you read the report from Iron mountain? Old conspiracy from prob before you were born, whole section on using a climate "emergency" as a method of controlling the populace. Im not saying protecting the environment is bad, but if you want people on r/conspiracy to not speak in a skeptical manner on how our government and world governments address this or why...well you are on r/conspiracy after all....
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe there are huge issues with our environment, but to leave off the table questioning official responses or to even suggest it cannot be capitalized on by groups who dont have the environment's or our best interests in mind seems a bit dogmatic.

       Of course the climate changes, that's almost a given. Now anthropocentric global warming, and pretending we're going to do anything meaningful about it any time soon, that's a joke. So in reality both sides are right, from a certain point of view.

       I don't see aliens as way out there- not after researching the subject quite a bit. I think "humans are all alone" should be seen as way out there. For a really serious look at the subject, read Richard Dolan's "UFO's and the National Security State." For an accessible Internet read, check out this web site that a redditor made:

       Certainly not alone in the Universe, and whether or not we're alone in this solar system is absolutely up for debate. I didn't want to lump those three things together. I hold UFOlogy in high regard. I'm not a believer in any one theory but I've seen and heard enough to be convinced that

       As a Trump supporter that listens in on the Alt-right, I 100% support the need to separate politics from this sub. It's one thing to report polls being manipulated, but it's completely different to promote political agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, keep the WikiLeaks and exposure to DNC corruption coming because those are actual conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And more importantly: keep an eye on Trump. He's in the military-industrial complex's hands now, so even if you believe Trump is for the people, his life and family can be threatened in ways we can't even fathom. Doesn't excuse his behavior -- mostly explains why all presidents seem to sell their souls: they kinda have to----.

He's in the military-industrial complex's hands now, so even if you believe Trump is for the people, his life and family can be threatened in ways we can't even fathom.

       that was damning? That was a long list of nothing.  What you're mad at wikileaks for not naming a source?  the MSM never names a goddamned source, and unlike wikileaks, the info they have doesn't self verify quite like leaked emails do.  or does it?  Timing their releases; are you mad that the genius of this was enough to steal the election?  Or are you mad that it took publicity away from the MSM and showed the world what kind of cheap bullshit liars and hacks they are?

       Wikileaks suggested they had info on Trump, but Assange himself said

        "it wasn't worth it."
       </a>
       That leaves a whole lot of room for interpretation; what Assange might consider juicy, others might not and vice versa. Considering the AMA underlined these practices, it was more than damning.

       No one is mad at them for it; it's just hard to verify info of which you can't identify the source, which is why people argue down this road. You seemed to have picked up on that people don't trust MSM for not naming sources, but then go on to more or less say, people should just trust WL because their leaks are "self-verifying" (whatever the hell that means)

       As to what wikileaks has on trump.  It is all speculation as to what is contained.  Just as the MSM chose not to report on any of the wikileaks emails WL can so choose not to report on leaks they recieve.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of shit flung at trump this election in and of itself gives good reason to assume that the wikileaks material is irrelevant.  And if such material were relevant and MSM is reporting on even fabricated trump stories why were they not privy to said leaks?

       It's curious how aggressive some of those comments are, and how quick they are to condemn Wikileaks. Some of which were straight up calling them out as an arm of Russian Intelligence. Others claiming that it's impossible to verify authenticity of their content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a conspiracy for ya: Turning an AMA into ammo to allow the old establishment to discredit them, and give a future candidate cover from anything damaging from Wikileaks. Render them to the state of RT, which is handily dismissed without consideration. Doesn't matter what it is that is being dismissed, but if it says RT in the corner, out with the trash. This is sowing seeds for a future effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to remember, we're now in a time where a politician was able to say just about anything, and despite 'fact checkers' (and I do use that term very loosely), still won in the end. The art of persuasion is very strong, with Trump being one of the best at it. So his opponents are going to start ramping up their game. Wikileaks is a prime target for such a counter offensive. Taint them with Russia, or make the idea that what they have isn't necessarily accurate or outright lies, they could get people to outright dismiss anything from Wikileaks. Perception is king. Control people's perceptions, and you control reality.

       Partisan fervor peaked after the election. Wikileaks thought the opposite would happen when they did their AMA, since they showed the world how these political organisations that people invest so much of themselves in, don't care about them at all.

       No, you didn't add the word "some" into your post until just now, so you pretty much just insinuated the entire leaks were nothing.

       Of course, I really don't think it's fair to assume what is or isn't in unreleased leaks. Either way, RNC wasn't for Trump till he won the nomination, so I'd not be surprised if they were less organized DNC copy-cat plans to get Jeb or Cruz or something else elected.

       No, with the context of the original post you commented on, I was pretty much picking on one specific email. According to the Wikileaks staff in the AMA, what they had on Trump was less significant than the DNC email, so I was citing it to point out the exact absurdity of that claim. If they were claiming that what they had on Trump was less important than the DNC emails as a whole, they were insinuating that they were less important than the least important DNC email. Which is Podesta's fucking lunch.

       That doesn't make sense, and why assume? Wikileaks was clear, they don't censor, so you get your recipes. The RNC stuff was written in the context of a investigate journalist or something, and it was weak sauce, so you get none of it.

       Really? It's not hard to grasp. Wikileaks doesn't want their brand to be associated with weak sauce leaks. If they leak something, they want people to read it, not think to themselves "but they released those boring RNC
       <del>
        e-mails

       whatever last time, I'll give it a pass and wait for the media to report on it".

       It's against their stated purpose to act as censors at all. Not releasing something just because it's weak is censorship and makes them a gatekeeper, which is something Assange has always been against.

       Every single media outlet is a gatekeeper. You think The New York Times, or whoever, publishes what sources they've talked to for a story that leads nowhere?
      </p>

       The alternative to what Wikileaks is doing would be to publish
       <em>
        every single
       </em>
       authentic thing that gets submitted, which runs counter to their goals regarding impact.
Imagine how that could be abused by those who'd want to lessen the impact of leaks.

       Can you explain like I'm retarded how it's damning? I'm not even sure if Assange had internet up when this AMA was done, so who knows what type of authority whoever was doing the AMA had. He's also dropped some pretty damning stuff on the US even before Obama was president (stuff on the war in Afghanistan, etc).

       That said, I think Wikileaks has its flaws, and some of them major, like its non-disclosure agreements + some of the things their defectors have said about them.

       I've not thought them to be intentionally partisan before, but now you've got me searching for evidence to the contrary

       I'm pretty sure in that exact quote you're taking this from, Assange said if you have anything other than second hand quotes, please send it in.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it sounds like they received second hand info that wasn't verifiable and didn't decide to release it because it's kinda bullshit to post something that could in all intents be fake.

       People have already mentioned the Trump stuff but there was some other shitty stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't remember the exact quote but it was something along the lines of "We release our leaks to have the most political, social, and cultural impact."
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people will defend it, but if you are going to admit to "controlling the narrative" so to speak, don't act like you're a zealot for transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
       To add to this they said the stuff they had on Donald wasn't important. Someone then asked if that was their criteria why did they feel it was necessary to release the social security number of a person who donated $10 to the DNC. As you can probably guess they didn't answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was another question about how in 2010 Assange claimed to have something huge on Russia but never released it and then, two years later, was given a show on Russia Today. Again, no answer there.

       Yeah, plus they won't release information that can be found elsewhere. Like if they had the 'grab her by the pussy' video, it wouldn't be necessary to release it because it was plastered all over the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that is why they didn't release anything on him. Because anything they got either couldn't be authenticated, was elsewhere, or wasn't news worthy by their standards. I tend to trust Wikileaks, though.

       Why would you believe that Trump is for the people? Because he tells you? He has never demonstrated any interest in his life in doing things "for the people."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you a different narrative: he is "for himself." And he understood that in order to appeal to people, he'd have to tell them he is working for the little guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your biggest clue that he just lied to people to get elected is his bogus promise that he'll bring back manufacturing jobs. People who are "for the people" don't tell the people obvious lies. This is an obvious attempt to get people to vote for him so he can call himself president and do what he wants.

       He has all of the signs of classic Narcissistic Personality DIsorder, which means that he is extremely insecure and also craves attention and praise, and he fears that others will perceive him as incompetent.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was bored and wanted to be president so he could say "I got to be president." And he used his celebrity to appeal to morons who trusted that this billionaire could magically fix things.  Never mind that he's only a billionaire because his dad was a finance/business genius. Trump is just a trust fund kid who, according to finance experts, has actually done worse in business than if he'd just put his holdings from 35 years ago into unmanaged stock funds and let it sit there.

       I dated a girl once who had NPD (only lasted a month) and I can safely tell you these people are fucking dangerous. She did some pretty evil shit just for the hell of it.

       A lot of people aren't aware of what true narcissists are. You did a good job of explaining it but l'm going to add some more stuff in. These people are
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       void of empathy. Other people are objects to them. They feel the same way about their wives as they do their cars or their televisions. They're extremely manipulative. They can't truly love anyone but themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard for mentally healthy people to comprehend narcissists. Just try to imagine how easy it would be to lie and manipulate people if you literally saw them as objects. It's effortless. Any pain or unhappiness you cause is meaningless to you. The only thing you're susceptible to (generalizing here) is shame.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the weirdest part is that they admit they're narcissists. They'll openly talk about it like it's nothing. The girl I knew who had it was almost proud of it.

       I just don't think there's any way to lower costs for manufacturing in the US enough to compete with the third world countries where so much of our manufacturing is being done. Unless, of course, our middle class becomes so desperate and poor that we start looking like Mexico and Russia, with much, much worse wealth inequality (this is the direction we'll go in with his tax plans, according to experts).

       What the fuck man? Things can't get much worse? What the hell are you talking about????!!! Ahhhh!!! Holy shit, so ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things can get much, much worse. Look around the world. Do you have any knowledge of global economics? America is up on a very high pedestal, the world's superpower, and doing pretty well compared to the rest of the world on everything else. And even if you don't like some things the establishment does, this is thanks in no small part to the "corrupt" and "incompetent" establishment. Be assured: we can fall a long, long way from here. It's incredible that you just take for granted that things can't get much worse.

       I was referring specifically to the tax code. It's pretty bad, and I don't see it getting worse.

       We're on a pedestal because we fooled everyone into using the dollar and now force them to use it at gunpoint. It's possible that if Trump actually audits the Federal Reserve like he said, that the root cause of the global scarcity could be resolved.

       Even if you completely eliminate all taxes on manufacturing it still wouldn't be able to overcome sweat shop labor. Unskilled manufacturing jobs are gone from America forever. The ugly truth is that we need to change and we need an educated workforce to do it. Skilled manufacturing jobs won't be exported but someone needs to pay for the employee's education. The cost of college in the US is so high that no one wants to foot the bill so everyone would much rather avoid the issue or lie about it when they can say they will bring those jobs back.

       In Philadelphia recently, he promised to bring back the Philadelphia Navy Yard, a huge Naval shipyard, where Navy ships were built and repaired.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Navy Yard is now the location of an office park, with 150 business tenants, including some corporate headquarters. Thousands of office workers are employed there. There's also a shipyard still, but it mostly works on cargo ships; the location is unsuitable for work on modern aircraft carriers (too shallow, I think). And there are still US Navy offices.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, Trump made a promise to bring back specific manufacturing jobs which is impossible for him to fulfill. The best that can be said in his defense is that he probably had no clue about what he was talking about, and only knew that there used to be a big shipyard there, that closed.

      <p>
       If it's more profitable to manufacture elsewhere, that's what will happen. Business will always take the path of least resistance towards profit. The idea is to point it in our direction.

       Obstruction of justice, perjury, destruction of evidence, mishandling of classified material those are the really provable ones. Then to a lesser degree thanks to degrees of separation and plausible deniability there is her campaign colluding with the media, collusion to sabotage a primary candidate, working directly with superPACs. Judgement issues such as the direct hiring of the corrupt DWS when she was outed from the DNC and replaced with the also corrupt DB. She lies and lies and changes her stances with the wind in the guise of "evolving" while also talking about public faces vs private faces. She's a 100% establishment politician and that's something people didn't want anymore. At least Donald owns who he is and so far all this talk of him betraying his voters hasn't even happened yet. It's all conjecture. He loves gays, condemns the violent behavior of some of his supporters, and Hillary can't even be arsed to make speeches denouncing the people rioting in the streets in protest of the fairly elected President. Jesus man take off your fucking blinders.

       She was accused of these things, and the Republican FBI director said she did none of these things. No charges. No indictment. Which part of that don't you understand?
      </p>
      <p>
       We often let politicians off after doing illegal things, but when Clinton is accused of things, investigated, and exonerated, we blow it up.

      <p>
       Look: it is quite clear that you never would have voted for her. This requires you to exaggerate her flaws to convince yourself why you should vote for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, you have no evidence that Trump will do a good job and tons of evidence that he will be absolutely terrible.

       No, actually he said she did all of it but it wasn't malicious intent so he (against all understanding) decided not to indict. It was ridiculous.

       right?  Even if I went with Comey's recommendation, the contents of the emails prove she broke the law more than once.  Why are people calling for Donna Brazile to step down?  She leaked questions to DNC/HRC campaign.  Where was this info found? In the wikileaks emails.  Why should I doubt any of the other emails that lay out how she coordinated with PAC's and sent agent provocateurs to sabotage Bernie and Trump?

       You mean the child sex ring that is completely made up with zero evidence? I saw a report like 2 weeks ago that the indisputable evidence of this sex ring was coming out before the election. If any actual evidence existed, that evidence would have undoubtedly come out.

       Well, you have to assess for yourself if you think they are for the people. The guy is lowering taxes on the rich. Experts say he will make inequality much worse and make the economy worse. Experts also say that Hillary's economic plans would be much better "for the people." Meanwhile, she has the environmental policy that is "for the people" too, and so many other policies that are for the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What actual policy does Trump have that's actually for the people? Can you name one that appears to be legit?
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you just objectively look at the two candidates, it's pretty clear that Hillary's policies are more for the people.

       The most obvious thing is on taxes. Experts from
       <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/latest-trump-tax-plan-adds-trillions-national-debt-clinton-plan-trims-deficits-taxing-wealthy">
        the Tax Policy Center (a non-partisan research group)
       </a>
       say Trump's policies will cut taxes on the rich and mostly benefit corporations, raise taxes on some in the middle class, reduce federal revenue by over $6 trillion, add trillions of dollars to the debt, and basically be very bad for the economy over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton would raise taxes on the rich, reduce taxes for the poor and middle class, and overhaul corporate taxes, resulting in an increase in revenue of $1.4 trillion that she would have used for education funding and other initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's tax breaks might look good in the beginning, but this will totally decimate the ability of government to function for us the way it should.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a total fucking disaster for the little guy and they don't even understand it.

       Well, perhaps what you're talking about are his
       <em>
        claims
       </em>
       that he's done things for people? I know he bragged about donating money to 9/11 charities. But there's no evidence that he donated any:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He has also claimed to donate millions of dollars to charities for veterans and others, but evidence has only found that he has donated about $10,000:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, there is verifiable fact that he just lied about donating money, so he benefited from the perception that he donated the money while donating little to nothing.
      </p>

       Are you really letting him off the hook for this?

       theres more stories like this, alot more. i sincerely doubt he hasnt given a substantial amount to help people over the years. everyone who knows him says he's a good guy, mike tyson included, and tyson can smell bs from a mile away. just my 2 cents. i do think this sub should be for conspiracy though, something p   i z z a related perhaps

       OK seriously. Answer me a question: Does it matter to you whether anything you read is false or true? This is not a hypothetical question. Can you answer this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because this story is FALSE:
       <a href="http://www.snopes.com/donald-trumps-marine-airlift/">
        http://www.snopes.com/donald-trumps-marine-airlift/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the true story? Trump previously owned this plane -- a commercial plane (not his private plane) when he tried to create "Trump Airlines." This airline failed in 1990, and Trump lost control of this plane. This was a year before these military veterans were flown in this plane with "Trump" on the side.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US military chartered and paid for these flights. Again, they paid a company that owned this plane after Trump owned it. Trump had literally nothing to do with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it possible that many -- perhaps even all -- of the stories like this that you've read are actually false?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're willing to believe this story without doing a simple Google search to verify it's veracity, I have no faith that you actually verified the veracity of any of the other stories. In fact, I assume that if you believe this bullshit, that you'll believe any bullshit as long as it supports what you believe about Trump.

       Not sure if you trust the Washington Post (if not, who do you trust??) but The Washington Post interviewed a military veteran about this and debunked it here:
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/11/too-good-to-check-sean-hannitys-tale-of-a-trump-rescue/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Or why don't you try reading the Snopes article, instead of dismissing it without reading it? At least I read the dumb article that was referred to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snopes references an interview with Lieutenant General Vernon Kondra, retired Air force.  Here's the description with background from Snopes, with his words in quotes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are several references to a 1990-91 contract for Trump Shuttle to carry personnel across the United States, between the East and West Coasts, on a standard LaGuardia-Dover-Charleston-Travis-Chord-Kelly-Dover-LaGuardia run.
       </p>
       <p>
        "It worked very well, and the crews loved it, and really thought that we'd done something special for them," Kondra recalled in the oral history. "It was a helluva lot better than using 141s [cargo craft], which we could use for something else."
       </p>
       <p>
        But Kondra said that the notion that Trump personally arranged to help the stranded soldiers made little sense. "I certainly was not aware of that. It does not sound reasonable that it would happen like that. It would not fit in with how we did business. I don't even know of how he would have known there was a need."
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Seriously though, I really would ask you to try to reevaluate your blind devotion to Trump. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but maybe start next week? You don't have to start liking Democrats, but at least start questioning what you are told. Because I can tell you without a doubt that some of what you're seeing is just false information being passed around by a bunch of people with an incentive to have you love Trump's policies.

       I've got a little secret for you: you won but you lost. Your life is going to get worse because of Donald Trump. For a little while, you won't see the difference because the inertia of Obama's economic policies will make it look like things are going OK. And then Trump will lower your taxes and things will maybe even temporarily go a little better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Behind your back, Trump will be lowering taxes a lot more on rich people, and revenue for roads, schools, police, and other important social infrastructure will erode. Then Trump will tell you that this is clear that government is a failure, and then you might vote for him again because you'll think that all of this is not his fault. And then your life will get worse. And in 8 years, if Trump won re-election, your life will be definitely worse. The country will definitely be in worse shape -- there is no denying this given that his plans will lead to a massive revenue shortfall of over $6 trillion. He'll engage in a war with ISIS that could escalate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you think he has it all under control, and you have no evidence for believing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I'm saying is that you own this. You own these problems now. The sad thing is that you think this is just a game between two teams of equal merits. What's actually funny -- in a black comedy sort of way -- is that you have no ability to understand that your dear leader is a feeding on your misguided fears -- fears of a terror threat that statistics show is under control, fears of an economic problem that Trump will make worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll take some solace in the fact that I tried to tell people what would happen and they wouldn't believe me. I hope you'll remember in 10 years or so that the liberals were right.

       I wasn't OP, but I can tell you my opinion.  Yes, he's a rich mother fucker, but he's also been shunned by both parties for the most part.  He is "technically" outside of the establishment, or was.  I think that's why people are putting more behind him.  Yes, he's a rich fuck, but he's just a rich fuck.  He isn't a player in my eyes.  He might have an agenda, he almost certainly does, but I don't think it aligns with the current establishments. Time will tell, though.

       He is outside "the establishment" as far as "the establishment" has been narrowly defined.
      </p>

       Is everyone automatically free of corruption? Absolutely not, but I'm speaking relatively.  He's the new fish in the pond, so he deserves more slack than someone who's been swimming in the soup for 40 years.  That's my only point/position on that.  I get that he's done some bad things, and he lied, but that's not the same as furthering an agenda like a global gov't.  It's just not the same thing.  Trump is peanuts comparably.  I'm defending him insofar that he's not as deep in as the real players.  That's it.

       The idea that being in the establishment is worse than not being establishment is just based on a hunch. It's not based on any evidence. I mean, we have no evidence that an anti-establishment outsider can be a good president. So you're just guessing, and that is really scary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I hate his policies. Do you know his policies? Most of his policies are totally untested and incredibly risky. Part of the thing about the establishment, even if you don't like it, is that it uses tried and true policies and doesn't try to take huge risks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of like this, I guess: Do you want a gambler as the president or not? That's what he is, and he'll be gambling with all of our futures.

       It is also said that he is absolutely terrible to his contractors, that he has a terrible reputation in the building industry of asking for services, getting services (often from small businesses), and then refusing to pay full price for services. When people threaten to sue, Trump tells them he will defend himself until the people lose more money than if they just accept what he's offering.

       Footage is also anecdotes. Footage is just a small sample of people saying "he's great to work for." There's also people who have, you know, said he sexually assaulted them, so there's those "anecdotes" too.

       Hillary's email thing was concluded to have no merit by the FBI director, so there wasn't even enough evidence for charges, let alone enough evidence to be proven in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, despite the fact that you are satisfied that all of Trump's transgressions have been not proven in court, you still probably think the email thing is a huge deal. Funny how that works, huh? It's almost as if you prefer Trump, and you're just using Hillary's email scandal as an excuse for why you're voting for a person with questionable credentials and shitty policies.

       Do you really think that Obama did a bad job on foreign policy? Trump acts like this is an easy thing to do, and he's fucking delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama used diplomacy and drone campaigns more than his predecessors, pulling out ground troops when possible. Far from perfect, but all in all we stayed out of conflicts and avoided excessive military spending, avoided a lot of dead veterans, and let people in the Middle East fight things out. And we've occasionally helped the "preferred" side in conflicts between two groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary would do about the same as Obama did. Trump says he is going to go over and destroy ISIS. Do you really think that Trump will be less involved in military conflicts if he plans to do what's necessary to destroy ISIS? This will require either ground troops or major bombing campaigns (or both).
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, there is risk that these actions will trigger something worse, like getting other nations involved against us. World War III is not ridiculous to consider as a possible development.

       First of all, let's just get out of the way that you're apparently preferring a guy who praises Russia and Putin while criticizing someone who takes on Saudi Arabians as allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush destabilized the Middle East. Most of the things happening there are an outgrowth of the Iraq War and then the subsequent Arab Spring.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you figure that Hillary created anything? The thing about being allies with Saudi Arabia is that it has always been an uneasy alliance that is preferable to having them as enemies. Haven't you ever watched any movies to understand that you sometimes need to make allies you don't love? You know, "the enemy of my worst enemy is my friend."
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand why she and other leaders have been allied with Saudi Arabia, all you have to do is ask yourself if we'd be better off with Saudi Arabia as an enemy or a friend. Similarly, we have been better off to do what we did in Iraq, or to continue putting pressure on them while preferring diplomacy and restraint?
      </p>
      <p>
       I worry that Trump does not understand the value and importance of diplomacy, of our traditional relationships, even the relationships that come with questionable people.

       Thank god for people like you man, I see way too many people on this sub question everything, it's good to see someone draw reasonable conclusions from conspiracies instead of just accusing any person in the government who holds power of being responsible for everything. People are blaming Hillary for ISIS, Saudi Arabia, Iran, hell soon enough they'll blame her for 9/11 and both Gulf Wars.

       I agree. While its okay to support a candidate, Its not okay to give any of them a free pass because you support them.

       Its also not a requirement to be an anarchist to participate in this sub.  There are a lot of misconceptions in here about "litmus tests" being a viable way to discern who is a shill and who is a real person.  I find that to be a ridiculous notion, its entirely possible that real people hold the same opinion that a shill is being paid to promote.  Obviously someone who holds that opinion is paying them to promote it so there is always at least ONE.

       So he was elected to drain the swamp, but instead he's morphing into a typical politician. Take a look who bubbled back up in the swamp when he was selected to join his cabinet. The very worst of the worst.

       I think there is a large segment of the T_D that is just like the "Hillary Shills" that they claimed to fight. There are the genuine members that could not tolerate her (with fair reason too) and liked a lot of his platform for the right reasons. But the utter hypocrisy of many supporters seems to be lost on them. What I like that comes from this sub's core members is that all people of power are scrutinized. The fact that Trump hasn't released his tax returns is very telling of what kind of guy he is and that he's most likely got some real skeletons in his closet. Those, if they do exist (and I would put my money on yes) need to come to light just as Clinton's did.

       It is somewhat nice that we can look at Trump's behavior in office and derive some answer to the old question about whether or not the President actually has any control over his administration or whether it's all just for show.
      </p>
      <p>
       He definitely has an ego. Some shadowy people in suits showing up in the oval office telling him what to do, when he considers himself the most powerful person in the world, will certainly illicit a reaction.

       Well, it was the alt-right that introduced me to Operation Paperclip which inducted Nazis into our space and intelligence agencies to get ahead of Russia during the Cold War.
      </p>
      <p>
       It backfired.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agencies went rogue by becoming so classified the country is now suffering a deep state much like the SS during Nazi Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my experience most alt-right news is about global economics and how today's military-industrial complex is exploiting the Federal Reserve, the War on Drugs, and the War on Terror.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, let go of the left-right paradigm: it's a fucking illusion. The establishment controls both sides.

       Thank you for being reasonable, it actually took me by surprise. I have very rarely seen anything reasonable following the phrase "as a Trump supporter." I think Trump supporters would gain a lot simply by being respectful and reasonable, instead of intentionally flooding every possible forum and outlet they can with memes and aggressive, rude rhetoric. Thank you!

       This is exactly why I don't want this sub to get political: it's just theater. God damn, did you read any of my comment? The military-industrial complex, aka. leaders of the deep state, control everything you're whining about----. Why waste our time aching over the left-right paradigm on this sub and focus on real conspiracies, -- and keep the political talk in the political subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you really wanna get into it, PM who you think we should have supported this election, and we can go from there----; it'll probably be hilarious.

       The point is, you shouldn't like anyone blindly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if I gave you a name, I wouldn't want you to trust me on blind faith and like that person.  Look them up, see what they've done in the past, and think if you would do the same in their position.  Plenty of senators actually have decent voting records, and that's surprising because incumbents are usually pieces of shit.

       Seriously though, vote out all incumbents.

       Not really. Free and honest information has no worth to someone with no identity or conviction. At that point a person is nothing more than a pseudo-sentient organism of no worth.

       You will never know a world that starts with truth, only ends with it. At least, that is the only hope you can carry.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, you can take an honest stance based on lies if you believe them to be truth. And, without an ID, an ego, that something which corrupts truth, you could never ever find the direction to seek it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Information isn't flawed, reason is. Information is the product of reason, and even in lies there is a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you know the "truth" in anything? Honesty is not truth, by the way. Unless you mean transparent information, which isn't truth, either.

       what are you, like 15 years old? Your attempts at sounding philosophical and deep are weak and sad. Why don't you learn from what the above poster is saying, try waiting until you actually have good information before you waste your time subscribing to a belief system. Otherwise you just end up unqualified like you are now and nothing you say has any value.

       Because I grew out of that kind of thinking more than 15 years ago. The fact that you misconstrue my efforts as an attempt to sound deep shows your level, not mine. Most people grow out of the pursuit or expectation of explicit trust long before they reach 15. The rest are people who still see themselves as children, wanting truth delivered to them on a plastic airplane spoon, complete with sound effects and the unconditional love of a parent.

       Pretty soon you guys will have to confront the truth of mortality, but not before we get over Santa Claus and the easter bunny.

       The only truth you'll ever know comes from your own reason.

       It doesn't, actually. It's sad, like I say, because you
       <em>
        think that it sounds more intelligent
       </em>
       to write the way that you do, but it actually makes you look very stupid, or that you're maybe using some sort of translation software. I understand the general idea behind your comment (
       <em>
        ur dumb lol
       </em>
       ) but the words themselves don't actually make sense. It's bad writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allow me to walk you through it. You used "where" instead of "since", but "where" doesn't make any sense in that sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, "satisfies the issue" isn't anything that makes sense. You don't
       <em>
        satisfy an issue
       </em>
       . It's bad.

       It does make sense. You were trying to make a point, which was the issue. I'm glad the video satisfies the issue where your intellect cannot. Which means means you lack the ability to articulate yourself in any way of your own, but you wanted to try.

       Yikes. Once again, you're just not using English correctly. "articulate yourself" is incorrect - you can just say "articulate", the "yourself" is redundant. And there's no way you're going to be able to argue that "satisfy the issue" is in any way grammatically correct... it's simply nonsensical. You don't satisfy an issue. It's just not correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to try to simplify your writing so that it becomes clearer. I think you'll find that fewer people will misinterpret your comments that way. Using phrases like "articulate yourself" or "satisfy the issue" is going to lead to confusion.

       I don't care. Communication is full of nuance, and I'll use it, whether or not it confuses you or everyone. "Articulate yourself" is fine form. In fact, it's meant to point to a direct subject; you. Not an idea you have, but yourself.

       Sure, but the rules of grammar exist to
       <em>
        facilitate
       </em>
       communication. This isn't a matter of nuance, it's a matter of being intelligible.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Articulate yourself" is wrong because it's redundant. The word "articulate" as a verb means "to speak" or "to communicate", so it's obvious that when you say "you lack the ability to articulate" that you're speaking about
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       as the one that's articulating. Understand? This is what I mean when I say that simplification will go a long way towards making it easier to communicate for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, if you're fine with literally adding unnecessary confusion when you communicate, then carry on!

       I'm still waiting for r/conspiracy to get interested in the allegations that the Trump campaign actively worked to purge the names of about 1 million voters from the voter rolls in several battleground states, targeting names of people with last names like "Garcia," "Jackson," etc... that are probably minorities. This investigation started long before the election. It appears to have purged far more than enough voters in several close states that it could have swung the election.

       That would explain why he kept saying "It's rigged" over and over again.  Once or twice?  Okay that's just an egocentric idiot.  But half a dozen times?  You're making it a talking point.  It's come up as strategy.  Betting on voters believing you and switching sides to vote for you?  I dunno.  But there's a really common tactic in both business and politics that when you're caught or about to get caught doing something shady, you immediately start accusing the other side of doing it first.  So that when they try to accuse you, they sound ridiculous, repetitive, less shock value in the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw it in the debates when he kept sniffling all the time, then people were accusing him of being on coke, and then suddenly he starts accusing Clinton of being on drugs during the debates, for no discernible reason?  It's a strategy play.  So maybe accusing it of being rigged for Clinton was to deflate anyone accusing him of rigging it if he won.

       Frankly, I've assumed that the election was completely rigged for Trump the second he started attacking Hillary over it. And what do you know, the lose of the election won. Nothing screams "rigged corrupt system" like a person losing my millions and millions of votes, and forcing his way into the white house anyway.

       I'm too burned out from all the hours spent reading Podesta's emails to care about investigating much else. For me, much of the interest in HRC is that she's supposed to be good but we all knew she was really bad and finally got the proof. With Trump, I think a lot of us always knew he was bad and wouldn't be surprised by anything he's done.

       There's no evidence that she was involved in any "rigging." As far as I can tell, the few instances of any unfair behavior by her campaign were done by overzealous campaign workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always find it strange that people have to assume that when a campaign worker associated with a candidate does something wrong, that the candidate must have instructed the worker to do something wrong. And let's not forget that we have no hacked information from the Trump campaign, so all we have is leaks from Hillary's side.

       My god, the current DNC chair was a debate moderator who fed her questions prior to the debate. How is that not rigging an election? It's cheating the Americans out of the right to a fair and democratic election.

       During the primaries, he aides took some steps to make it easier for Hillary to win and some cheating, yes. This doesn't mean that they rigged it, nor does it mean that Hillary was involved in any gaming of the system.

       Unless you are assuming, for example, that Chris Christie is guilty of corruption because his aides committed corruption?

       And that Sir, is why there is absolutely zero fucking accountability in the American political system. As long as the candidate cannot be proven to be  colluding with their staff then they can walk scot-free. What happened to Leaders being accountable for what their employees think they can just go ahead and do??

       At the same time, however, you need proof. Our country was founded upon the principle of innocent until proven guilty. Punishing someone you "know" is guilty by fabricating evidence or charging them anyway without evidence is a slippery slope to a dictatorship.

       Honestly I think proof is irrelevant here. Individuals wouldn't be doing these things if their bosses made it perfectly clear that they did not support these types of subversive elements and will fully co-operate with any investigation if suspicious activity is found.

       Proof is never irrelevant. If courts did not have to rely upon proof then the powerless would be completely at the mercy of the people who have power. Abuse still goes on, and it always will. But it can be way, way worse. Our laws of protecting citizens are perhaps the most important laws we have. If you erode that then we will have nothing.

       Let me re-phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof has a place and the culprit should always be held accountable. But sometimes a lack of evidence makes this impossible. In the case of Hillary Clinton for example with her aides deliberately colluding with the DNC to discredit Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should Hillary Clinton, who benefited extremely from this subversion not be punished? It was her aides who did this but does she hold no responsibility for this travesty whatsoever? I don't believe so. Sure the specific aides who engaged in this should be prosecuted.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why shouldn't she be punished as well?????

       Essentially, she was punished for having aides cheat through the public opinion backlash, and ultimately losing the election.  If you want to actually fix the problem, you need to restructure how campaign finance, elections, etc work.  Otherwise you're just satiating yourself until the next scandal.

       But I just said that the greens are not an option in this situation. It's either fries or pizza, either Hillary or Trump. You accused me of preferring one puppet over another. But if we're calling them puppets, I picked the better puppet.

       Your idealism in refusing either puppet doesn't make you better, and it doesn't make you less responsible for whatever Trump does. It doesn't mean you saved us from anything. It just means you sat out the process.

       Furthermore, I saw first hand how Bernie delegates were given provisional ballots during the state and county conventions and then were told their votes don't count since they are provisional and they will only be counting the regular ballots. Bernie delegates were cheated out of their rightful votes. We can also look at the exit polls in California as proof that the Democratic primary was rigged.

       It's sad that you can look at the spooky levels of idolatry on r/the_donald and assume everyone there is a genuine supporter of his, and then assume astroturfing when a Hillary supporter speaks up.

       Can you at least acknowledge that you're aware of the propaganda and astroturfing on Trump's side? Or are you delusional and think his side is above that?

       Nothing in the emails proved the democratic process was rigged, no matter how hard you guys wish it did. Yes, Donna brazille gave her a heads up on some debate questions which was scummy. But there's no evidence of voter fraud, no evidence of electoral fraud, no evidence of manipulating the election beyond campaigning. You guys succeeded in convincing the country there was a conspiracy when there was none and you managed to get Trump elected. Be happy enough that we have to live with that now and stop trying to push this crap.

       No she stacked the DNC election process heavily and overtly in her favor. She didn't rig it. It was disrespectful to all registered democrats. It was supremely conceited to think that guaranteeing her candidacy in this political climate, coming off of 8 years of vitriol against Obama, would easily guarantee her election to the presidency. She made a choice that cost America dearly, and because she wanted to be president she deserves every bit of blame a president would for the consequences of their actions even if those consequences are not entirely her fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were a number of people who did attempt to rig the campaign in her favor but ultimately the DNC is not a strictly democratic institution, it is a political party so any chicanery that happens within it is not the same as rigging an election. It does make me loose trust in the ability of the perpetrators of that sort of rigging to respect the institution of democracy, but it doesn't strictly break that institution.
      </p>

       Sanders himself is responsible for his own failure. Had he taken his campaign seriously from the start he would have gone into the primary season with a solid ground game and pushed hard to compensate for the lack of name recognition. He did not do that until later in the campaign, and consequently was too hamstrung to push back against everything Hilary was doing to shut him out of the political discussion. He wanted to be president and he gets judged similarly: that was his fault and ultimately he is responsible for his own loss.

       This is just the worst excuse ever to let Clinton slide. Especially when that self-same person is worried about handing power over to another politician guaranteed to use corruption and graft to his advantage. This unearned cult of personality around Clinton is proof of the awesome goddamn power of American media to mindwash otherwise cogent adults into supporting the State line, no matter how insane or bogus.

       It's not letting Clinton "slide." I would have been very skeptical of her as president. But this is me making a pragmatic decision that the overall picture of Clinton is that she's done nothing worse than what Trump has done, and that she has much better policies and much better competence for the job.

       Yeah let's just forget Hillary stole millions of the Haitians, and hundreds died because of it. Or that the Podesta emails showed she could have done something about the four men in Benghazi but decided to do nothing. Or the countless other controversies she has been in over the years, or the amounts of laws she has broken. Or the fact that she knew her husband was a rapist and did nothing, but threaten their victims. She rigged the primaries for the DNC also. And she has hands down ruined countries. I can keep going.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it turns out Trump has done a lot, Hillary has got all the politicians beat, even if you put them all together.

       She didn't steal millions of the Haitians. Benghazi was a tragedy, and a very minor tragedy compared to what US presidents and Secretaries of State ever experience. So I guess you give her no credit for avoiding other tragedies and only blame her for this one?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which laws has she broken? None. She's never been convicted of anything. Any scandal or allegations I've seen against her have turned out to be bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since you're reading shitty news sources, I'm seen you've seen lots of made up stories about her breaking laws.

      <p>
       What evidence is there that Bill Clinton raped anyone? There are no videos. No pictures. 3 women said he assaulted them -- and you believe them. And maybe he did do it.  But the same exact evidence exists that Trump raped/assaulted women. So why do you believe those 3 women who accused Bill, but you don't believe the 15 or so women who have accused Trump of assault? And Bill was not running for president!

       No because those women came out early, went to court, got paid off, they have proof they met Bill Clinton, and haven't changed their stories once. There stories fit too, a lot of the women.. and it's been more then 3.
      </p>

       What do you make of the infamous "grab her by the pussy" tape? Even if it was "locker room talk" it still shows his attitude towards women and his own fame in regards to what he can get away with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if he was just trying to brag and sound "cool" in front of Billy Bush (lol), his words clearly show that he has thought about what he can and do to women.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know much about the allegations towards Bill except for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. What evidence is there to support the claim that he raped women? I don't necessarily doubt it, but everything I've seen about it seemed to be not very substantial. What evidence is there?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you say there is "more evidence" of Bill Clinton's allegations than there is of Trump's. The evidence against Trump is a primary source. I guess it's up to interpretation, but an audio recording of him saying he can get away with sexual assault is pretty damning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say Trump was just a normal guy that we both knew, and he was being accused by multiple women of sexual assault. Let's say there were a tape of him joking about sexual assault. I'd wager that we would both at least suspect that he did it and that a court would see that as pretty strong evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I believe that the claim about the airplane seat not moving up was proven to be false by people who worked for the airline company themselves.
       <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/14/news/donald-trump-jessica-leeds-armrest/">
        The fact that the rest moved was in the flight manual (which is another primary source)
       </a>
       .
       <a href="http://qz.com/808368/photos-of-airline-seats-from-the-1970s-and-1980s-undermine-donald-trumps-denial-of-groping-allegations/">
        Another link.
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore why would any of these women risk putting themselves out there in the public eye and say they were assaulted? None of them wanted money. It wasn't a case of someone wanting to be paid off in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the alleged victims I've seen have seemed very genuine and distraught over the whole thing. I suppose that's not a very concrete point since it's my own opinion, but it's not nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what do you make of the fact
       <a href="http://leakyou.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Donald-Trump-Accusers.png">
        most of the accusers
       </a>
       groped all were tall, attractive blondes?
      </p>
      <p>
       It really seems like the accusations hold water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Curious about Clinton though.

       Gennifer Flowers who did have sexual relations with him, and is well known, came out and even said Bill had a sex addiction.

       He didn't joke about sexual assault. And its funny near the end of the campaign, after a audio comes out, so many women all of a sudden come out claiming he sexually assaulted them. But a lot of those stories were already found out as fraud, or had major holes in their stories. Like details that didn't make sense at all.

       Also those links are saying that there is armrests that go up in first class, yes in some planes. But most do not have armrests that go up like your 2nd link suggests. That's very few. And even in your first link they mention she got the flight wrong.

       Bear in mind when you consider the email scandal that she is on tape saying how insecure and easy to investigate email is. Leaked emails from Clinton are

       You're talking about a level of fraud that includes a tiny number of people on both sides who voted twice. This is about using the entire voter rolls to delete millions of voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kind of fraud you're talking about is completely trivial relative to this kind of systematic fraud.

       It is impossible to be anti-establishment when you are a cornerstone of its enablement, went to school with it, joined all its clubs, knew all its connections, went to the weddings and invited to your weddings all the kingpins.

       I know that's part of his plan, and to give him more legitimacy and reach out to the evangelicals. It was a smart move to get elected. But the VP has a lot of power and it's unknown how he'll deal with Trump when they have major disagreements while he's in power.

       Fact is, the DNC leaks are so massive and all-encompassing that there's enough there to feed this sub for months. The timing of it during a heated election would naturally attract those who oppose the DNC as well as the usual conspiracy theorists (not using term in a negative way).

       Have you seen some of these appointments? Google Myron Ebell, who very well could be the next
       <em>
        head of the goddamn EPA
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason Chris Christie won't be our next attorney general is because
       <em>
        his former aides are facing 20 years in jail after being convicted of conspiracy.
       </em>
       Which is fantastic, by the way, because that chubby fuck would have ended recreational weed and severely restricted medical weed across the US in the first 100 days.

       But you still have the publisher of Breitbart as head of strategy, possibly a creationist and all-around nutbar as secretary of education, on and on. It's clear Trump isn't picking the top minds or the most qualified people for his cabinet - he's using the appointments as favors and rewards for his friends and political supporters. Which is about as establishment as your get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say what your want, but this administration could have us yearning for the days of Clinton/Kerry/Holder/etc.

       "The Fed" is the Federal Reserve, which has nothing to do with marijuana laws. "The Fed" does not refer to the federal government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you've got it the wrong way around. It's states that aren't allowed to reverse federal laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any law within the competence of the federal government can override state law if Congress wants it to, iirc. And the federal government has pretty broad lawmaking powers, including the power to ban cannabis.

       Ok, you're wrong. Those state laws are in direct violation of federal law. They've been allowed to continue because the Obama administration and his justice department have essentially agreed not to prosecute.

       But an anti-weed attorney general - like Christie - could most assuredly decide to reverse course and give all states  six months or a year to shut it down.

       Yeah no. That's not how things work. The people in California and Colorado didn't just wake up on election day and decide to vote for legal weed. It took years and years and years of lobbying, fundraising, and campaigning - licensed, straight edge, nerdy looking lawyers studying laws and meeting with elected officials and inching their way closer to a ballot initiative. Even then it took a bunch of failed referendums to finally pass.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what it will take - and then some - on the federal level. People like you, who stand in the background and call for rash actions and scream about anarchy and revolution and all that bullshit, never accomplish a damn thing. Because that's not how the world works.

       People have been so freaked out by politicians ending recreational Marijuana, but I honestly think it's impossible at this point. States are already breaking federal law by allowing it so the only option the government has is to enforce the law by military force which would just be outrageous and the benefits for them would not be worth the extreme amount of civil unrest that would cause

       Sorry to cherry pick one line from your comment, but "possibly a creationist" is over the line? You are on a sub where inter dimensional lizard people are a possibility, and that the Rothchilds are behind a mass global conspiracy, or that bigfoot or aliens may exist, but creationism is the line you draw?

       creationist is a big line to draw for realists (and anyone with a basic understanding of 4th grade science)... i mean youre talking about a large voter base who believe dinosaur bones are a) faked by satan, or b) a test of their faith
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact that someone like pence could possibly push that agenda in education is directly contradictory to the 2nd amendment.. if youre a christian and you want your kid to learn that crap, well thats what private schools are.. fuck off from the public education system
      </p>
      <p>
       there is absolutely zero reason christians should be pushing their agenda into government programs, but hey, its what the republican voter base wants

       I don't see the connection. The guy above me was saying Hillary was the worst SecState ever - I'm making the point that having a Secretary of Education who believes the world is like 7,000 years old is way worse. We literally had that exact same argument 91 years ago.
       <em>
        91 fucking years ago.

       I'm not ok with regressing that far.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your point - which I don't really get - I think you're confusing the word conspiracy with "crazy theory." Watergate was a conspiracy. It was real, carried out by real people at the highest levels of government, and it was one of the most significant political events in American history. Who said I have to believe in lizard people to post here?

       The_Donald is just guys who think anyone who doesn't agree with them is a cuck and a place to deny existence of any sort of social injustice. They don't really care about 'draining any swamps' or checking excesses of the government or corporations. Matter of fact if those excesses are beneficial to a class they belong to they happily endorse it.

       CisWhiteMaelstrom once made a heavily upvoted self post about his plan to take over reddit through satellite subs and controlling the front page of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       . He was removed as a mod a couple of times, but had tons of alts and followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason the Reddit admins are cool with it.

       There's a difference between anti-Hillary and pro-Trump, though. Personally, I was just as terrified at the idea of Hillary becoming president as I was/am of Trump becoming president.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one thing to believe in a candidate or a party, or be heavily politically involved -- it's a whole other thing to essentially be in some sort of weird Trump/meme cult, with the primary goal being to flood every possible forum with hateful rhetoric.

       I wouldn't be surprised, I had to unsub from uncensorednews after one of the mods said "any country that allows n*****s to succeed is doomed to fail."
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub isn't necessarily alt right, though.  We were very anti-Hillary, because she was the candidate that we actually knew about and had dirt on (Dem primaries, pay to play, Clinton Foundation, Benghazi, health issues, etc. etc.).

       T_D started posting here like crazy the day of and night before the election, because the Pizzagate "story" broke.  I had seen some pro-Trump spam before that, but it was nowhere near this volume, and it wasn't vote brigaded as badly.

       Dear god that shit has been making me not want to use Reddit anymore. I mean, I appreciate that Reddit is supposed to support free speech, but they've made a habit of banning hateful and scary inappropriate subs (r/fatpeoplehate, r/picsofdeadkids, etc). I think the only reason they haven't banned r/The_Donald is that they don't want to handle the backlash, which I understand after the meltdown that occurred after r/fatpeoplehate was banned - but still, this shit is getting out of hand. It isn't funny, it's just garbage threads filled with incredible hate and cult-like rhetoric. It's really making this site unbelievably unpleasant.
      </p>
      <p>
       For fucks sake, r/The_Donald started as a freaking 4chan operation. It's a joke, but they ban anyone who calls it out and the sub successfully snowballed to the point where they now just have strength in numbers. They're everywhere, too! It's one thing to spew bullshit in a designated bullshit sub, and that's bad enough, but so many of them are flooding every sub they can, and just finding reasons to be hateful across this entire website. Something needs to change. This shit is too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, you didn't "meme Trump into the White House." Nobody wants to see infinite "pepes" and nonstop ludicrous and hateful rhetoric. Somebody needs to start a petition or something. I really wish they'd all just go to voat like all the r/fatpeoplehate morons did.

       Afterthought: Why have they not been banned for brigading? That's a reasonable basis for banning them, as it's clearly a violation of the rules. They've very obviously brigaded anything that wasn't pro-Trump on a number of occasions, and Reddit admins were aware of it! Even now they make a habit of brigading posts and comments, and it's just become sort of accepted since they've essentially flooded Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't fathom why all of what they do isn't considered to be a big deal. It's disruptive, disrespectful, and childish.

       I'm really neither, and I don't know why you have to be insulting to voice your opinion. That's what's getting you such a bad reputation. I didn't once say anything about hate speech, and that was intentional, because that's a very charged phrase with a very specific meaning. I said hateful, which is an adjective. Perhaps I should have said aggressive? Mean? Argumentative? All you're proving right now is that, when anything contrary is said, you can't have a respectful discussion and instead resort to assumptions and name calling.

       The fact you are trying to compare
       <a href="/r/the_Donald">
        /r/the_Donald
       </a>
       to those sub reddit is ridiculous. Your definitely implying that it has grounds to be banned because you deem it "hateful" in which is not. Again you are being ridiculous.  Talking like an elite jackass doesn't make you right either you know. As for name calling, sorry it's hurts your feelings so much but I can't help but call bullshit when I read it.

       Wow, you're right. You've completely altered my opinions by calling me an elite jackass. I think I'll do the same next time I'm trying to debate with someone who disagrees with me. Thank you! I gotta go now, let's talk later.

       Seriously, I haven't heard anyone use the phrase "alt-right" seriously, ever. Only CTR use that, and it's also a term coined by Hillary in the same speech she claimed Pepe is racist iirc.

       edit - Ok, let's be honest. Crap about Trump tax returns and the completely disproven claim that Trump is working with Russia are being upvoted. This sub is being brigaded. I am fully making that claim now.

       If alt-right is synonymous with seeking truth, then yes. Otherwise, not really. What you're seeing is the exposition of the vast corruption of democratic party and leftist policy. Recognizing that doesn't mean someone is alt-right, right, or whatever. Are we not allowed to have objectivity?
      </p>
      <p>
       People confuse unbiased as somehow meaning that things will always be equal, but that's not the case. It's the same idea against black crime. They cite a disproportionate amount of blacks as being evidence of institutional racism. They want "balance" like you can't have a greater percentage of blacks in prison over whites. Well, why not? If blacks are committing criminal acts at a higher percentage, then it is what it is.

       Because T_D was doing the majority of the digging through wikileaks to take down Clinton. It was a mutally benificial relationship at the time. Now that he has won the sub is going to have to dig on him too because his administration is now the most powerful and unchecked administration in history. Senate, house, white house, and supreme court. He will get away with murder.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Disclaimer: I feel like he is playing the Clintons right now. I think he is not going to be prosecuting them because once he swaps FBI directors he will have complete control of the entire government and he will OWN the Clintons and get whatever the hell he wants past. I also am okay with this because I want all of the right wing stuff to pass. Mass deportation, tax code change, entitlement reform, gerrymandering, and anything else that brings us back from this PC culture where kids are absolute pussies. I am done with the left and I want them absolutely annihilated from the history books.

       That's why I said the comment section. Reddits front page is a boon. Once you go away from the front page and into specific subs you're looking at 10% of the userbase. Once you go into the comment sections, you're looking at 10% of that 10%. If CTR are spending any time downvoting individual comments, that's a massive waste of money that would be better spent on either getting on the front page of reddit, or target Twitter of Facebook.

       Again, an insignificant amount of people that visit reddit actually look through the comment section. So even if 5-6 million pair of eyes saw this thread (probably an overestimation since conspiracy isn't a default and most people don't browse /all, only 10% of them are actually going to click the link, 10% of those will read through a meaningful amount of comments giving you about 50.000 pair of eyes. Even if you double the people seeing it on the frontpage that's still only 100.000 pair of eyes on an anonnymous forum. It's significant to reddit for sure, but I'd be extremely surprised if it was a target of any priority for any organization aiming to seriously influence the national discourse through social media.

       So you want to silence half the country and eliminate them? That's sounds a lot like fascism. PC culture is a small part of the left. Those that are for PC culture are ignorant and regressive, and in no way represent the actual values of the vast majority of left-wingers. Just like how insane racists/homophobes are in no way the majority of right-wingers. I am a left-winger, but I totally agree with some right-wing ideas and would like to see Trump implement them. But there are also left-wing ideas that are also good for the nation. It's all about finding the common ground between both groups to improve the nation. Trump's plan for infrastructure is a great idea, for instance. Edit: Your downvotes have NOTHING to do with CTR. You stated you want the entire left annihilated from the history books. That right there is the type of thinking that only increases the divide. It's not a healthy way to look at people. I am left, and I in no way want to annihilate anyone just because they are right wing. That's like saying I want Christianity and all Christians wiped from history because the Westboro Baptist Church pickets soldiers' funerals.

       It'd be nice if the guy actually followed through with something he said, or at least one of the things I'm hopeful about.  Do we know if he actually has a firm stance on anything other than "ISIS is bad"?

       It's impossible to tell though, isn't it? I'm not out there marching in the streets but I am very concerned that nobody seems have to have the slightest idea what his actual policies are going to be. "He's gonna build the wall. No he's not gonna build a wall he only said that to get votes." and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what matters most here is who he picks to serve on his cabinet since they will most likely be the actual decision makers during his term. Trump seems to be more of a figurehead than a political playmaker.

       Rumor has it that Ben "pyramids were grain silos" Carson is a potential pick for secretary of education. Can't be a good omen.

       Mike Pence is indeed a terrifying person to have as the backup QB of America. I am praying that life in the Oval Office is a lot more like VEEP than House of Cards. People are saying that Trump's decision to pick Pence as his running mate was the best life insurance policy he could have taken out. Probably true..

       what I mean is, /pol/ is very contrarian. many of them don't actually care for trump or like his policies, they only memed him into the white house because it was funny. as soon as he starts doing the usual politician thing, they will despise him as much as any other.

       I am sad that you are willing to push your country to civil war. There are many millions of liberals who are not going to be enthused by being "absolutely annihilated", regardless if you mean in policy or not.

       We have the guns not them. We make the food in rural farm towns not them. The military backs Trump, and the police back Trump. The only war would be them getting the shit beat out of themselves for a couple days and then surrendering. It's time for them to get back to reality.

       Nah. For better or worse, Trump was democratically elected. I'm cynical, but I think people try to do good overall, so I'll wait and see what he does. Plus, if we (liberals) just full-stop refused to participate in the democratic process, we'd be the Republican congress! Ha ha.

       Ok, let's play with your numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrat voters (e: sans "illegals") made up 17.9% of the US, Republicans made up 18.5%. What a majority! You've almost taken a full 1/5th of the population!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so clear now, I take everything back. Even with 3 million dead grannies and Hector the illegal alien, the American public has
       <em>
        mandated
       </em>
       that the Democrats be crushed! Liberal thought must be eradicated! Death to political correctness and safe spaces! We've got to make it safe for REAL Americans to live without any sort of unpleasant or disagreeable thoughts being shared by people around them!

       You're the one threatening people with "absolute annihilation". It's still violence and aggression even if you're able to talk the United States military into doing it for you.

      <p>
       But by all means, go ahead. Kill all the liberals. Slaughter all the people responsible for the United States's success. You'll be left with a third-world country inhabited by nobody but primitive, vicious savages like yourself, the laughingstock of the entire world.

       I said I want the left to be absolutely annhaliated. I want left teachers to be fired, I want left media to lose all funding, I want the stigma of millennials to be so bad they can't get hired and have to go through retraining for reality, I want pc culture gone. If you want to keep rioting and killing people then eventually we would be forced to fight you over it. At which point you will promptly cry "It was a prank bro!" after getting your ass beat. The left is dead and you don't even get it. It's finished. The right hasn't had this much control ever. It's been 100+ years since they had this much control. Everything is going to change and you can riot all you want but it's done. Your safe spaces are done. Your liberal socialism wet dream is done. It's all done.

       But they are representative of liberal parts of the country. You might feel that the coastal states aren't part of the "real America" but America is made up of the people that live here so actively putting them down all the time and pretending like they're such evil people gets you nowhere fast.

       If that is how you meant it you shouldn't have included the word "else" after anything. When you write it that way it modifies "anything" to include the previous mentioned topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least adding it has made the meaning ambiguous; however, had you not included it would be clear that "anything" was meant to refer to topics other than the previous one.

       Your comma explanation doesn't make any sense. All lists are separated by commas but that doesn't mean adverbs only apply to the word prior.

       Who says I'm left or right? Arguing with you is like arguing with Trump's brain. Nothing there. Just lefty this and lefty that. Sounds an aweful lot like crying. But wait.... i thought that was a liberals only move. People want a little more balance in their lives, not this left/right crap. Most people see that there is a lot of blame on both sides. But you can't admit it's a grey world we live in can you?

       I said "I feel" not I know. He released the John Miller tapes himself as a distraction. He is capable of anything and is smarter than most know. He also released the old taxes and changed the narrative for weeks. I'm just saying he only cares about winning and getting what he wants. If keeping the Clintons out of jail to enslave them because he has their dirt will win him the game he would do it. I am okay with this. I believe the end justifies the means. Some do not agree with this but I do.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the ends? Who knows. Maybe he wants to conquer the whole world. Maybe he actually wants to help America. With Clinton I knew she hated this country. With Trump it's a coin toss and that is better odds than Clinton gave me. Only time will tell.

       I have no doubt that Hillary was the face of a more publicly known effort for globalization, I'm truly curious what angle do you think Trump would be  playing?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's definitely a coin toss, one I hope ends up in our favor, but I'm really doubting he'd make any attempt to conquer the world, especially at his advanced age.  If he achieved that within a few years, he might actually deserve it, lol.  Don't get me wrong, I am seriously interested to know your thoughts.

       He is a narcissist. He wanted to be president because he thinks he is better than everyone else and can do the job better. I genuinely believe that's all it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he will be good for America, he will get illegals out, and he will slow down the crawl of globalism. Or they will all work together to destroy America because we elected him. One or the other.

       Edit:  Good conversation, BTW- I look forward to your response!

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He is a narcissist.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not under the belief that he is.  I know that people keep saying this, but I'll vehemently disagree that even his public persona does not demonstrate any narcissistic tendencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm, of course, referring to the textbook narcissist, not the internet colloquial narcissist.  I know that arguing that Trump is not a narcissist may seem unconventional and irrational, but just hear me out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first cue that somebody may be a narcissist is their inability to handle criticism.  Since they have no ability to self-reflect, any critique, serious or no, will reward you with anger and often times vindictive behavior.  Even the slightest damage to their ego will result in fury of an inappropriate level.  Part of Trump's charm is his ability to make fun of himself, and not take himself seriously.  This by itself may demonstrate an ability to adapt and overcome narcissism, but my understanding is that it's incredibly rare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, narcissists believe that their way is right, and people around them should simply accept it.  Narcissist, naturally, find their way into management, but don't usually last very long.  This is usually because they hire people who worship them with compliments, rather than properly evaluating their competence.  Trump has demonstrated that he is quite capable of hiring and calling on people of competence rather than appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue, however, that Hillary is a classic narcissist.  All of the signs are there, especially her complete failure to understand what has happened and why since the election results.  She would have been the end of America.  Even if Trump rapes our economy, and fails to deliver his promises, we at least dodged a major bullet there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not arguing that you are wrong, I just wouldn't let his public personality get in the way of valid skepticism.  He is most definitely not a classic narcissist- somewhat egotistical, maybe, but definitely not mentally handicapped by self-absorption.

      <p>
       It's a good point but Trump might just be used to criticism from being in the limelight for 30 years. He also never lets things go and I think he does react to criticism.

       That's entirely true, which means that it must be very hard for him to accept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark my words- if we continue to make fun of him relentlessly, and he is a narcissist, he will crack.  Eventually.

       Narcissists only crack when they are losing. If they are winning the believe you are just jealous haters. Trump has been on a decade long winstreak. Until something bad happens we won't know.

       Yep, CTR upped the ante AFTER the election, because that makes such great business sense.

       The reason that scapegoat is finally being downvoted is because there literally no reason for them to exist.With the way you people attribute every dissenting opinion to them you would think Liberals don't actually exist.

       Jesus Christ people have been saying this for months. It's pretty convenient that this finally becomes visible now that the election's over. It's almost as if there's been some foul play or manipulation of some kind happening. If only there was a word for something like that.

I believe many of our ideologies would be leaning to the left; gay rights, women rights, clean energy, even immigration.

       Lol you're a massive buffoon if you actually think Hillary Clinton is "evil"
      </p>
      <p>
       The woman is a career self promoter with a huge ego, but she isn't hell bent on ruining the country like you Trumpies have decided she is. She just wants to rig the system to make herself look good.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still a scummy thing to do, but if she's rigging the system to make herself look good, that means she'd be inadvertently trying to improve the country to make herself look good as the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       What point would it serve if she got elected, said "hahaha I'm evil you idiots" and started destroying the country? Everyone would hate her, which is the opposite of what she craves
      </p>
      <p>
       So my choice for president was between an egotistical election rigger with 30 years of political experience, and a racist/sexist/elitist real estate agent with zero political experience whose entire motivation is to punish the people who've wronged him

       Well the majority of Trump's campaign centered around draining the swamp, going against the Washington Elite, and the fact that he's a person without Washington ties.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far Donald trump has gone back on several campaign promises and made Reince Preibus--the leader of one of the organizations he campaigned against--his chief of staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he appointed a guy from the largest pro-trump media company as his closest advisor (Bannon)

       I'm fine with it.  As an independent these things don't bother me at all.  We'll see how it works out after 4 years but all your fear mongering and "he's racist, bigot, misoginist, antisemite blah blah blah" is completely unfounded.

       Yea from extremely biased sources.  Do you know the definition of racism?  It's not "anyone who uses the word "nigger".  It's, anyone that feels their race is superior than others and TREATS them like inferiors.  Trump may use a "bad word" that you dislike but it doesn't mean he's a racist.

       WHAT?  He's responsible, somehow in your mind, because his words are instigating hate?

      <p>
       I don't think anything he said is instigating hate!  He's completely realistic that we cannot just mindlessly support illegal immigrants.  He's completely right that we must VET muslims coming from certain war torn areas because the military is warning some could be terrorist!

       He frequently encouraged people to beat up protesters at his rallies. He told a Mexican news reporter to "go back to Univision", which was clearly a lazy euphemism for "go back to Mexico". He suggested a complete ban on Muslim immigration before dialing back the comment days later. He's in favor of bringing back stop and frisk, which was ruled by a judge to be a racially discriminatory method of policing.

       I saw the univision one, that guy was being completely irrational and was asked to sit down many times.  He just kept yelling at him.  He needs to go back to somewhere.  He worked for univision...  that's why he should go back there because he's no longer welcome there, being as rude as he was.

       Some people that become violent and push and shove, deserve to get beat a little at those rallies.  I heard about that rally nonsense and I disagree he said "beat him up".  You're reading into that shit.

       And I don't know any more than you about the Univision situation, but I believe the reporter was upset because trump had been ignoring him for half an hour and answering questions from almost everybody else in the room--on the day after some of trumps worst comments about Mexicans

       The difference between what Trump says and what you and I might say in the privacy of our own social circles is that these are the things he decides are worth saying on national tv when he's running for president.

      <p>
       So he either has no filter on his thoughts or he has much more sinister thoughts that he doesn't say in public.

       A lot of people voted for him because he's a good business man and didn't think for a split second about how a narcissist without a filter might impact foreign relations

      <p>
       The posters around here don't push other subs agendas, from what I can see, obviously some false narratives will make there way in. However, the good posters here research what they want to investigate and provide their own sources. With the last place they would ever need to rely on for information being   R/the_donald.

       So, by that logic I can post 19 fake stories and 1 real one? The point of a post shouldn't be to purposefully mislead, or push an agenda. It should be a well-reasoned, semi-plausible conspiracy. Spirit cooking, definitely doesn't fall into that category.

       The point you are making is that I can't have had a high standard, and further that point by saying r/politics has a low standard, thereby I have to lower my standards everywhere?

       Well first off, there was plenty of reason for people to see spirit cooking and Hillarys campaign chair and then an exact definition of spirit cooking posted on reddit by the very host inviting the Podestas to partake in a spirit cooking, and say wtf, we want answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And secondly, what I am saying is that for a sub that is a little nutty by nature, r/conspiracy should not be held to the same standard as r/politics. r/conspiracy's whole role is to take a look at often limited evidence,  make educated guesses, and discuss it to either debunk the evidence or bring light to it in hopes that more evidence can be collected. Wikileaks was/is an exhaustive amount of evidence pointing to a number of possibly huge conspiracy theories that just happen to be very beneficial to the Trump campaign. If there was, or rather when there is an exhaustive amount of evidence handed out to the public about Trump, r/conspiracy will surely pour over it like wild.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/politics on the other hand by definition is supposed to be discussion on the governance of a country, not propaganda supported by a multi-million dollar campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are disgusted with r/conspiracy for doing what conspiracy theorists, by definition, inherently do. If you are not more disgusted by r/politics behaving in a way counter to its very definition then you are creating a double standard and you are a hypocrite.

       How many of Trump's emails have you seen? How many of his tax returns have you seen?

       2 years later, you will focus on Trump because now he is the "power" that is attacking your rights (like the left does now), and ignore whomever challenges him as bastions of freedom and truth.

       I loved coming to this sub and having actual discussions with you guys. It's opened my eyes and helped me to understand your side. Now I'm called a bitch for asking questions. It's ok, I don't give a shit because it's the internet, but there has been a noticeable change here. Much angrier, which is so strange because you guys basically won! I'll never understand cognitive dissonance but it's those who willfully practice it who blow my mind.

       Some of my favorite conspiracies have evidence. Even circumstantial evidence. The idea that Trump is working with the Russians is mainstream media propaganda. I mean, there's a conspiracy there, but it's not the one you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you watch Russian media, they're super critical of Obama's actions in the middle East, so by extension, they criticize Hillary. A bunch of them thought Trump "looks more presidential" as well, make what you want of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump working with the Russians isn't a conspiracy theory to me because it doesn't explain anything. He's be more likely to work with China or India. That's where the money is.

       Because she wants to impose a no-fly zone over a country that specifically asked Russia for military assistance.  What was she going to do, shoot down Russian planes flying over a country that asked for Russian help?  What right did she think she had to go sticking her nose in a sovereign country's airspace?  Putin said she would bring about a world war because she is a neoconservative warhawk.

       Well,
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       got their hands on the Podesta and DNC emails. So either some group with decent hacking chops supports Trump and was selectively leaking to support him, or two such groups leaked them very close together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the obvious culprit is Russia; they could do it, they have motive (Clinton was strongly anti-Russian.) As someone pointed out upthread,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5b013v/reddit_users_declare_war_on_hillarys_paid/d9kotxa/">
        there's evidence
       </a>
       paid Russian trolls (which we know are a thing) were pushing Trump on Reddit. The Russian state media also seem distinctly pro-Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several
       <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/all-signs-point-to-russia-being-behind-the-dnc-hack">
        cybersecurity firms
       </a>
       claimed that the techniques used to hack the DNC were charictaristic of the Russian government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some emails had metadata in Cyrillic saying they had been edited, and typos in Cyrillic (probably attributable to the spellcheck automatically altering them); this doesn't prove the text was deliberately modified, but it does show that someone using a Russian-language computer was fiddling with the files.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, "Guccifer 2.0" has made numerous mistakes suggesting they're lying about their identity. They claimed to be Romanian, but spoke only a little broken Romanian. Their english notably improves when discussing politics, suggesting there's an english-speaking political expert there working as part of a team, rather than a lone individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that US intelligence is lying, or has evidence it's Russia that they don't want to disclose (NSA?), but it's also possible they looked at all this and went "duh, clearly Russia".

       You guys can't be serious. Reddit was for Hillary since day 1. The reason t_d got popular was to counter the hate the rest of the site had for trump. There is no place that spoke positively of him, so people got together and made it their safe space. Reddit is liberal as fuck along with the rest of the media. All I read was trump hate in basically every sub. Hell r/politics (a default sub) was fueled on trump hate. You guys are delusional and so far separated from the majority of America. People may agree with you on this site, but I promise things are different outside reddits circle jerk (as proven by the election results lol). Btw can you pass the salt?

       Also I think generalizing Reddit is wrong. Yes it does tend to lean one way over another but the community is large enough that it has elements from all aspects of society.  You also have to admit t_d is just as guilty as ignoring their own candidates scandals as much as

       It is surprising to someone that 2 superpowers are doing business with each other? That elites have business dealings outside their own country? This is proof of collusion how exactly? I have read all the supposition articles, I have seen it all. What I haven't seen is proof. I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if both are in knee deep with Russian mafia, in fact I believe they probably are. That doesn't mean Mother Russia is influencing our election through secret Trump connections. But, what you should do if you believe this strongly is to make a post and lay your evidence out.

       It only appears that way because, during the election, Trump was not a policy maker and had no history in the estabishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a sub dedicated to watching the establishment. Hillary was a subject of interest because of her decades of involvement with the establishment. Trump is only beginning to be involved with the establishment just now.

       It's just that Donald's cabinet picks are waking people up to what they should have known months ago -- that Donald is part of the same elite and he's never going to deliver on his promises to drain the swamp.

       We don't know what his strat is yet. He probably knows what you thinking and he's not in bed with anyone. He will try to make them feel like he is in their pocket, he has to or else he sabotages himself. You will see some serious 4d chess I promise.

       His refusal to put his business in a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       blind trust, his refuse to disclose his tax returns, and his seeking security clearances for his kids are far greater conflicts of interest than anything Clinton has been accused of. He's surrounding himself with the very people he said he'll remove from Washington. He's been going around in interviews walking all of his promises back -- the wall, repealing Obamacare, everything. He's not going to do a single thing he campaigned on. He'll spend the next 4 years being an establishment pawn. And you're still going to be roaming these subs, still finding
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       new crazy way to defend him.

       His business is too vast for a blind trust, and blind trust are s bit of a joke anyway. He trusts his kids the most, and will most likely run the government from his tower. He has no interest other than making sure to not fuck up. He's not elite, they so far despise him.

       I've been coming here for months calling Trump an idiot and a plant who only got to be the Republican candidate for president in order to make Clinton look electable by comparison. I always end up with positive comment karma when I do this.

       It's more that the Hillary corruption aligned so well with discussions here. As the need for the_donald to uncover how corrupt Hillary was dissipates, you'll find there is no need for them to crossover here.

       There is still much to be done with regards to the hillary corruption that links so hard to everything we as conspiracy theorists have been talking about for decades.

       I think it's actually a combination of a few things. People who supported Trump realized the media and other organizations are conspiring against him quite obviously, then found this subreddit a place to discuss that. Another group of people who were aware of media manipulation and related things were drawn to Trump because if the establishment is almost unanimously attacking him, he might be able to shake things up. Also, since the establishment is conspiring against Trump, there is a ton of material to choose from that gets posted here.

Since there really weren't a lot of examples of the media unfairly supporting Trump, and plenty of biased media coverage that supported Hillary, it was like 90 percent posts that seemed anti-Hillary and favored Trump, causing some people to claim it was an "alt-right neofascist subreddit."

        A newly released media analysis found that the “biggest news outlets have published more negative stories about Hillary Clinton than any other presidential candidate — including Donald Trump — since January 2015.” The study, conducted by social media software analytics company Crimson Hexagon, also found that “the media also wrote the smallest proportion of positive stories about her.”

        For her part, Hillary Clinton had by far the most negative coverage of any candidate. In 11 of the 12 months, her “bad news” outpaced her “good news,” usually by a wide margin, contributing to the increase in her unfavorable poll ratings in 2015.

       The reason you get dv'ed on this isn't the source itself, it's the false comparisons used in the source.  Not difficult to see the dates and the differences just 6-11 months make.  Trump wasn't even a credible candidate until November 2015, and the huge field that wasn't Hillary diluted the rest.
The fact is the media had readers/viewers eyes on the red meat that was her very real deficiencies.

       I mean, considering Trump is a human meme (even in the 80s he was more or less a WWF villian) he got the exact type of coverage he needed to cruise into victory (always front and center for debates). Even if the general election was 50/50, the media handed Trump that 50/50 shot on a silver platter, far from conspiring against him.

       No examples of the media unfairly favoring Trump? Maybe the fact that Hilary emails received more coverage than all other issues combined might show some bias? And you are trying to tell me Trump doesn't have a variety of skeletons in his closet? And now that's he elected good luck in investigating him. You will end up disappearing...

       It was never that way, it just looked like it at first when people from all over reddit flocked to it. Once people caught on to the fact that the founding mods were already mods of the_donald and had their own agenda they unsubscribed and all that was left was the altright group. They used the guise of protesting bias to draw people in order to legitimize themselves and help smokescreen their own bias.

       I got banned from r/the_donald because before Trump's AMA it was announced he would only be taking vetted questions to which I replied "then that's not an AMA then" BAM banned.  Oh well.  Not like anything intelligible was coming from there anyway.

       because I posted in the Donald saying if they wanted to be taken seriously and get an actual message across, they should probably stop fucking shit posting almost exclusively.

       If Trump's success has proved anything, its that when you're up against a really shit opponent, getting your message across to people doesn't matter nearly as much as firing up people who are already on board.

       I have a suspicion that there is a bot that does it to anyone who posts there. I was banned after I commented on something a few days ago about hoping the pre-existing conditions restriction in ACA stays even if it's repealed. Didn't even realize it was a the_donald post but sure enough -- banned from enoughtrumpspam.

       I agree, there is not an ounce of actual discourse in that place and any attempt of actual discourse will get you banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I'm may have had 2 or 3 posts in the whole place and some of it was with no other intention but to make a mockery of things, that I will admit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another one I would like to share was a post titled something along the lines of "I am standing in line to vote in, whatever state, who should I vote for? I simply replied with something to the effect of, don't you think you should research who you're voting before you are standing in line to vote. The response I got., "Fuck you troll," or maybe it was "fuck you shill." Which ever it was I don't care to go back and look for it, you get the point.

       Agreed.  But we have mods who stickied
       <em>
        advocacy
       </em>
       threads through the election, which asserted (using mod power) that FBI/NSA weren't Deep State but they were only staging a "counter-coup" &amp; the Clintons were the true Deep State with superior power to the Pentagon itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advocacy in any direction is just more Psychological Operations narrative crafting.  But mods aren't elected.  And there will be nobody held accountable.

       Trump used the quote, "Drain the swamp in Washington.", when asked about removing corruption. The term originally is implied with removing the breeding grounds for mosquitoes. During the primaries he was basically calling out everyone in the RNC that was involved. Now he is assigning all the people he once said contributed to the swampiness, i.e. swamp men, to his staff. Additionally, today he announced some of the Bush Era administration that was attributed to the war in Iraq being considered.

       Awww that's nice and handy it's after the election. Since this sub just acted like an second arm of the elite. Promoting non-stop for a Republican win. Remember those guys?

       The whole conspiracy movement is a fictitious movement of the right wing to invent reptilians and satanic circles, to distract from actual out in the open conspiracies. The real power in this world is money and corporates rules that world. r/conspiracy just helped elect the most elite inner circle President the US has ever seen.

       I mean to be fair, The_Donald is intended as a 24/7 Trump rally and isn't meant to be a place to criticise him. There are other republican/right/conservative subs for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem more is The_Donald users who carry those rules over into every sub they visit... Personally I'm a Trump fan and common The_Donald user, but I leave the The_Donald mentality where it belongs; in The_Donald and nowhere else

       Let me elaborate, Trolls for that sub have created multiple subs to push their agenda and try to take over existing subs to push their agenda, hence this thread. They are literally trying to be the voice of Reddit and that's a fucking problem.

       You know, that's funny because right wing news is literally nothing but propaganda. They elected the King of all Liars as pres. During the race, Trump lied more than Clinton by a lot. Good job fighting liars and corruption by electing a con man!

       He was always part of the establishment. He was born into money and privilege and has used it to his advantage his entire life. The only reason he's an outsider is because he's such and rude and abrasive asshole that he doesn't fit in polite society. People are people, and people don't change. Today's version of the aristocracy would treat him just as they would 200 years ago. He's too uncultured to fit in with the rest of the elite so they snub him. That doesn't mean that he isn't one of them though.

       I get it, I see what you're saying. I'm an individual, so there is no "you people" to rally against here.

       You think Trump is establishment, and when it comes to business, I would agree. But I think the business world is a much smaller sub-set of the power pyramid in control of the globe. So, to me, Trump is "establishment" middle management at worst. I do not think he is establishment politics, I don't think he was ever at the bohemian grove, etc.

       Maybe, and I wouldn't put it past TPTB. Controlled opposition and all that.

       I don't think he

       , but I am absolutely worried he
       <em>
        will be

       . I've said it before in this sub and I'll say it again: I like Trump. I voted for and support Trump. I sure as hell do not

       Trump.

       Part of the justification for the war that the Bush administration put in place was the concept of "enemy combatants". By reclassifying the terrorists Bush was able to use a possibly illegal loophole to not give the same rights as enemy soldiers would receive. This is what they used to justify waterboarding and Gitmo. Obama inherited these rules and never got rid of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later the US government learned of American citizens that were terrorists. And they wanted to launch a drone strike on them, which is tantamount to an assassination, no matter how you rephrase it. But they were Americans and afforded all rights of citizens. And for obvious reasons the US government can't just kill its own citizens. And born citizens cannot be stripped of their citizenship by the government, even if they're terrorists. But by saying they were enemy combatants they were able to justify them being enemy soldiers and thus valid military targets.

       Well, considering how many conspiracies came to light thanks to Trump's campaign, you think you'd be a little more appreciative.

       We look at the bigger picture here. Or we try to, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       You believing that the anti-Trump meme is a genuine conspiracy is what we look at as "nothing to see here, this is clearly intentional."
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-whichever candidate memes are intentional. They serve a greater purpose which is most likely manufactured division among the general populace. If people are hating each other for no reason, look at what the left hand is doing and you'll see right through what they're trying to make us believe.

       Personally, I'm going to wait and see what he does because I was colossally wrong about one of my conspiracies that the election was rigged, and that Trump wouldn't be allowed to win by TPTB (all of whom were pushing Clinton).
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, guys... it's the easiest thing in the world to sit back and say, "he's as corrupt as the rest of them." It's a lot harder having high standards for politicians. But this election gave me hope that people DON'T blindly trust politicians without one iota of critical thinking because it that was the case, Clinton would've been elected in spite of her being a corrupt criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally am going to give Trump a chance. I didn't vote for him (or anyone), but I have nothing to lose from it, since the guy's already in office. Some things do give me concern like his transition team and appointees, but let me see what he actually does, because thus far, the Time Warner/Comcast merger is falling apart, the TPP fell apart, Canada and Mexico invite NAFTA's renegotiation, I feel relieved knowing we might stop bombing the shit out of Syria and the Midd East... I'm cautiously optimistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This election made me realize I'm not good at predicting the future, so when it comes to Trump as president I'm going to simply answer "I don't know yet."

       Why is this eminently reasonable comment being shit on by so many downvotes? Trump hasn't taken office yet. The initial cabinet picks aren't promising, but his true aims will materialize soon. There's plenty to be concerned about, but he's still mostly a wildcard.

       If the last 20 years of presidents have been any indicator, there are probably more reasons to believe that Trump will turn out to be a shit politician like all the others who make empty campaign promises.

       At the same time, I wish this community would also remember that the only thing constant about life is change. I'm guessing if this community was around during the reign of the Catholic church, we'd be bitching about the Pope and others would be saying, "you're stupid if you think things will change around here." Same with the monarchy. Those changes had to happen from within these institutions, too... it wasn't really an overnight thing, but a gradual transition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we're on a similar cusp when it comes to the iron-clad grip of the banks/corporate rule that's been going on for centuries in this country. I like to hope so, and I think our social climate is ripe for such change. All of the signs are there.

       I hear you. I think it's correct to say that every "conspiracy theorist" longs for disclosure. In Donald Trump, we
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       to have some chance of that, just based on some of his rhetoric, regardless of how we may feel about his policies. We'll figure out soon enough whether he's a disappointment in that regard.

       I can see how that would appear like he's their enemy, but I simply think its because they believe Hilary would be more competent at carrying out their agenda, not that Trump would ever seriously consider taking them on when he is so deeply embedded in the current system.

       The guy openly bragged about buying politicians like Hilary in the past and we're supposed to believe he's not going to be corrupt?

       Trump just has incredibly little experience in anything like the job. No matter what your world view, experience still counts for a lot. Trumps inexperience just means he'll be leaning more heavily on the insiders he's surrounding himself with to make decisions for him, though he'll call it "delegation".

       He's already packing his staff with GOP regulars and corporate lobbyists. Look at how Wallstreet has reacted to his election. Those are the only two signals you need to see whether he's going to challenge the establish order or just carry on the way things are whilst doing a few token gestures (like building a few hundred miles of

       Your perspective is totally valid, and may be exactly what ends up happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       The counter perspective is that experience in politics hasn't necessarily been
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       experience. The life-long politicians haven't made for the best presidents. Trump's run several hundred successful companies (and 5 that declared bankruptcy, yes) and has amassed billions doing it. If he leverages that wealth of managerial experience managing huge projects/companies to reduce our $19 trillion deficit, and makes life easier for Americans via job creation, lowered taxes, better healthcare, and better infrastructure, and negotiate better trade deals then great. Big business doing well does not necessarily have to be synonymous with being terrible for Americans. His policies are not perfect and is not my ideal political platform (which would consist of things like slashing military spending, investing in clean energy, single payer healthcare, etc), but his isn't a BAD platform, either. I can survive four years of it easily, if he does what he says.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to Wall Street, the market initially nose dived when he took office (peso is still recovering), but it stabilized when he arguably showed he wasn't going to be a total wildcard since markets hate unpredictability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I again stress that in 4 years I might look back on this post and say, "wow, I was an idiot for thinking things could be different." But hey, I felt like an idiot (but was so happy to be proven wrong) when Trump won because I thought the election was rigged to render that impossible. Maybe your judgment's proven much better than mine so that you're more confident in your views. But mine hasn't so I'm waiting to see.

       Sure, I don't think anyone who's ever made it that far is ever going to seriously challenge the system. There's too many filtering mechanisms to stop someone ever getting to that point. Even if they go in with the best of intentions there's a million compromises big and small they have to make to get that kind of power.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Contrary to Trumps hype, the vast majority of the wealth he has made is from speculating in real estate with inherited money, and by bribing/negotiating with politicians to grant him permission to build that he then subcontracts out. He takes advantages of all kind of tax/debt loopholes that people without millions of dollars imply can't afford to. He does not want a level economic playing field. He's proud to pay no income tax for 18 years whilst some schmo on 10k a year pays 15%. In his mind that's smart, not corrupt or unfair.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also many cases of him fucking over contractors by refusing to pay and then using his superior wealth and ability to sustain prolonged lawsuits to fuck them out of the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare how much money his subcontractors have made from actually constructing his buildings compared to how much he's made from all the speculating and deals with government and debt write offs to see what kind of capitalism he's an advocate of.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's the exact opposite of a Elon Musk type billionaire who made his money from creating valuable things. Trump considers himself a success if he uses a bankruptcy to get out of millions of dollars he owes, or buys up property that triples in value without him having to do anything to it. He doesn't care whether he's helping other people or profiting at their expense. Big chunks of the financial sector will love him for that since he'll be fine with maximizing growth and debt, and we may get a short term bubble out of it but long term it will be more boom and bust.

       The choice was to choose between a career criminal and a buffoon. I only supported trump because he was not clinton. So whatever happens, it can only be positive since he already delivered.

       I felt the exact same as you. I spent the entire election cycle trying to read and disseminate Wikileaks as much as possible to warn voters what they were getting if they voted for her. I paid zero attention to Trump because my rationale was, "we survived Bush and he surely can't be worse than that."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then after the guy got elected I went back to learn more about him, and was happy to learn I actually don't hate most of his policies. And if he doesn't execute on them then my standards are still so low that it won't matter too much.

       To be fair, if we follow the money we'd see one candidate who was basically a prostitute for donors (no matter how corrupt, like Saudi Arabia) and a guy whose campaign was almost entirely self-financed by either himself, or small-medium donors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll have to try and find as much info about the SuperPACs and large donors that comprised of roughly 18% of his campaign dollars, but generally, his campaign financing makes me trust him more, not less.

       Edit: Just looked at those donors and they're really quite boring: real estate groups, lawyers, etc. Then you look at Clinton and see that Soros contributed a whopping $10 mil, and, well...

       The Mercer family is much, much more 'populist' aka fascist than the Kochs and basically wants to make things white again.

      <p>
       And they want a white, 50s style America again.

       Mercer's basically gone on record saying that. It's their goal.

       Your whole comment is basically, "This concerns me, but I'm going to wait to see if I'm concerned."  You even say that you realized people don't blindly support politicians, and then go on to imply  you're going to blindly support this one.  It's insane.

       The election may still have been rigged. In the US, rigging tilts the ballot. It doesn't guarantee a win. The system is too robust to be rigged that egregiously.

       Where? Mexicans shoot border jumpers, and Canada requires far strong stricter criteria than the USA.  Unless you're Jewish and get accepted immediately into Israel, pretty much anywhere will deny you anything but a travel visa.

       There are all kinds of ways to immigrate to a country, I'll probably apply for a residence visa, depending on where I decide.  I'm college educated in the tech field, so that makes things a bit easier.

       I've always wanted to go.  Honestly, the election just made me realize I've only been waiting for a good enough reason, and that my family sucks.  I'm just trying to decide now if I want to get settled in a new place first, then explore, or vice versa.  Don't want to spend too much too fast and limit my options.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of the places I've been, Southeastern Spain and Southwestern Italy are two of my favorites.  If you ever get a chance, visit Sorrento, Italy.  Changed my life.

       Germany is amazing as well, sadly I only got to see a small part of it (Landstuhl area).  That would definitely be at the top of my list for places to explore before I settle down.

       Did you really get to eat fresh sushi straight off a boat?  Please tell me you're just trying to make me jealous.  Now I'm tempted to just buy a houseboat and try to make it across the Pacific to the Toro stocks.

       Yeah, was up at 3am for that trip, it was crazy.  Actually I can't verify the sushi was truly just off the boat lol, but it was just down the street, so we made assumptions ;-)
Worst part of Tokyo sushi is knowing it doesn't exist in the US :_(

       I'll never be a centipede, I'm not stupid enough to buy in to the idea that one person will always have my best interests in mind.  I don't want to be identified as someone who would vote for either of the two main assholes in the last election, either.  It's not about being a "better person," lol.

         Men, all this stuff you hear about America not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of bullshit. Americans love to fight. All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, the big-league ball players and the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. That's why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war. The very thought of losing is hateful to Americans. Battle is the most significant competition in which a man can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base.

       Americans lost Vietnam.  So badly, that a president pardoned everyone who bailed because the war was so stupid.  I'm planning on getting out before there's a draft for another stupid one, because I'm actually not a little boy, unfortunately.  I don't want to get drafted.

       So you've read all 2,000+ comments? The post is on the front page for a reason. This is not the place to promote the guy or a pro trump agenda. I was vocal about the pro trump shit going on here
       <em>

       he was selected as president and there are many more who agree with the OP.

       I never said you couldn't attack or criticize Trump, I am saying it's clear that CTR is still out in force. Espeically when i just woke up to see all the stupid responses in my inbox. There is nothing wrong in people being optomistic that a candidate might actually listen to them and is not part of the political and media establishment.

       But you are claiming the CTR got this thread to the front page when it isn't the case. You say the comments section is DEFINATELY a sign of that but how? People were talking about this
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       he was selected and have legit gripes, so popularity and concerns shouldn't automatically mean one is CTR.

       People can feel optimistic about Trump in the forum devoted to him. We don't need people here spreading an agenda.

       OP is a "redditor for 1 month". Pretty much anything against Trump will be upvoted around reddit.. when the losers are not on the streets destroying property in their butthurt rage, they're on the internet posting anti-trump shit.

       If one cares about america, we should probably rid it of disgusting elite children sex trafficking, just a thought.

       Doesn't "pizzagate" rely entirely on 4chan pedo-ring projection of their slang and taking a single sentence out of an entire email out of context?

      <p>
       I admit I haven't read too much into it, but I remember reading about the gift basket around Christmas that is apparently central to the entire thing and seeing literally nothing to tie it to kiddie diddling.

       I'm going to double post just to make sure you see this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "attached image on this one" is... a photo of two women and a girl eating pizza. It is entitled "pizza.jpg" and the main message states, "As John said, it doesn't get any better than this."
      </p>

       would have us believe that "pizza" is actually some kind of sick pedophile code for the little girl, and that presumably the actual pizza is only in the image for reasons of plausible deniability. However, I was curious about
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       this picture was being shared, so I did a little detective work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The e-mail was sent by "

       This is a photograph of a little girl enjoy a celebratory meal with her mother, who mere days ago was rescued from a North Korean prison, shared by one of the people who made that rescue possible. And you're claiming it as evidence that those people are actually running a child sex trafficking ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the danger of politically-motivated investigations. You weren't "investigating"  the Podesta e-mails to find out the truth, you were investigating them to find dirt on Clinton. For every question you asked, you "investigated" until you found an answer you liked, then stopped investigating instead of double-checking to make sure the answer was actually true. If you'd genuinely been looking for the truth, it would have taken you five minutes on Google to realize what that photo really was.

       Actually, the jpeg isn't child pornography at all. It's a photo of some people eating pizza. One of the people is a child, but she is fully clothed and mostly just seems to be enjoying the pizza.

       Oh, it gets better. It's not just a picture of "some people eating pizza", it's a picture of two women who, four days beforehand, the sender had managed to get released from a North Korean prison, plus one woman's daughter, enjoying a celebratory meal.

       I have a friend who went to school with a guy who got arrested for violently raping a 13 year old. Not your standard grooming, but full on hanging her up, choking, handing her drugs, violently beating her up rape. He hung out with him in class a lot and was really chocked from hearing the news.

       The worst part about that story is that that was the seventh guy or so. So she's been with six other elderly guys, that girl must've been through hell.

       <p>
        From there you can easily link to James Alefantis for Comet Ping Pong. see his incriminating instagram posts discussing pedophilia. Besta is right next to Alefantis' two businesses, and they had a distinguishable pedophile symbol in their logo, and have connections to an orphanage.
       </p>
       <p>
        There right there is enough to gross any decent human being out. So shills, naive-nay-sayers, random trolls, welcome to #pizzagate. it's fucking sick, and anyone who idly sits by not helping should do the world a favor step aside and shut up.

       A well-put summary that hits the major beats in the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm generally a pretty skeptical person, so I'm not inclined to believe interpretations from either side - TPTB/MSM or conspiracy sites/alt news/etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever "satanic pedophile rings" come up, my skepticism gets cranked up to 11. I think the whole "spirit cooking" thing is stupid bullshit that weakens the other more disturbing allegations. I mean, it sounds like Podesta attended a "spirit cooking" event by that macabre performance artist lady, but I do believe that's all it is - a weird experiential art piece. I'm an atheist who is attracted exclusively to adult women, and my apartment is full of creepy Norwegian troll sculptures, I have a framed monster eye sculpture on my wall, I like to go to intense extreme haunted houses... and creepy taste =\= occult childfucker. I don't think we have any basis to say Podesta is worshiping demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, when you get the
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       innocuous stuff out of the way, there is definitely some legitimately shady looking stuff. Those instagram accounts give me the most pause. I agree they give me a terrible feeling. But that's what it is - a feeling, primed by an existing interpretation I was already privy to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there could be something horrible here. But the constant talk of undeniable proof is just as closed-minded as the average zealot. We need more investigation, less posts with BREAKING or CONFIRMED or PROOF in the title (unless something is legitimately confirmed), and definitely less people getting their undies in a knot over a stupid fucking performance artist.

       I haven't dove into the subject but the parts of that instagram post history really creeped me out. Seemed like every post was made with a wink, and people responding were wise to what he was saying. It was odd, very creepy.. It's very good that people are looking into this..

       The one thing that stands out to me out of all of it... why the fuck was Besta Pizza's logo a literal symbol for male child porn?  Yeah it was tilted a little. The rest of the things reaching quite a bit. But damn that logo is hard to justify.

       Had anyone ever seen that symbol before all this (like they knew it was a pedo symbol?) It was just a triangle spiral. A pizza slice is shaped like a triangle. It was a really simple design.

       Lol pizzagate? That entire thing trump supporters made up because they desperately wanted dirt on Hilary and her friends. It's pathetic that they take anything and everything out of context to make it fit into a puzzle they want.

       and a daughter belonging to one of them eating pizza together. What they mean is that their jobs don't get any better than reuniting a family by saving people from North Korea. Apparently they were sent this photo after the fact and shared it amongst themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another

       of them getting off the plane from North Korea and seeing the daughter and the husband.

       They turned the Clintons using their influence to save journalists from North Korea and reuniting a family at the end of it into the Clintons are involved in child trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       They then decided that all pizza related words in the emails are code for child trafficking and continued digging and came up with other innocuous things and construed them similarly, connected it all together.

       The site wants to talk about Trump and ignore the left.  This is what this outrage is mostly about, it's an extension of the Sorus funded riots and CTR manipulation desperate to bring the attention away from the left's corruption that is breaking in droves, and since there's almost nothing to tie Trump to pedophile rings as much as there is the left...you get pedophile enabling concern troll whiners making posts like this.

       Do you not realize that at almost all times the top post of r/all is a r/the_donald post? And that in this sub in particular, any discussion of something that puts Trump in a negavtive light is almost always met with downvotes and the poster is accused of being a CTR shill?

       Blame CTR and the corrupted mainstream media, because that is where the anti Trump material mostly comes from and it's mostly bullshit.  THAT is why it is downvoted most of the time, not because it is true about Trump.  And the_donald reaches the front page despite the censorship because his support is huge.  Just like despite election fraud, Trump won the election.

       So you're admitting that anything negative about Trump gets downvoted in a kneejerk fashion out of fear of the boogeyman CTR and MSM? Seems like a solid excuse to stop using your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, the_donald reaches the front page because that sub is a safe space that bans dissent and intentionally games Reddit to get their posts at the top of r/all.

       No I said it's downvoted because most of it is bullshit.  Prove your case instead of calling for censorship.  The site admins have specifically targeted the_donald to censor the sub, not to mention the influx of an army of scumbag CTR shills, so you are as full of shit as they and the MSM are.

       The persecution complex with Trump supporters is strong. You think Reddit is actively trying to censor them, when half of all posts on r/all are the_donald threads. Not really understanding the logic there.

       Sorry but you got played bro. Just like Obama exploited those in '08 wanting hope and change, Trump exploited people like you that have "anger at their country for shaming any idea that was not acceptable and want to just burn it down." Nothing will change and maybe next time around you won't be so quick to jump on the bandwagon.

       k. The fact that every establishment in the world was against him is enough for me to know they didn't want him. Did he lie to get the presidency? Probably 1000 times. But that's not why I voted him in. I voted him in to slow them down and cause them problems. I wanted him to slow down the left. He will and that is enough for me to be happy about him over Clinton. He won barely in the end because he flanked them in WI MI and they couldn't win even with FL being stolen. This is the only reason they failed. He went up to MI where they had not put in preparations to steal because they are blue states and they didn't have time. He came in at the last moment and beat them. Will he be a good pres? Who knows. Did the elite want him? No. Hell no. That's enough for me.

       How do you think he got 3+ billion dollars of free media coverage during the primary and general? That's not what "every establishment in the world" being against him looks like. A true anti-establishment candidate would have been ignored by the media (similar to how Bernie and Ron Paul were). Everyone likes an underdog, and that's what the media and establishment delivered in this years "election".

       In Hillary's emails they said Trump was easy to beat so they asked their surrogates in the media to pump him up to knock out the republicans they couldn't beat. In the general it was nonstop attacks from those same surrogates. It's in the emails.

       AS somebody who likes a liberal-institutional foreign policy, I would love for Russia to play a big part int he international system so long as they follow the norms. The big thing T_D is blind to is that Russia doesn't want Trump because Trump likes them, they want Trump because, based on what I've seen, they own him more than banks owned Hillary.

       No, it really hasn't.  There was a lot of focus on Hillary the last few months because SO MUCH conspiratorial dirt was being dug up on her it was like a goldmine for the sub.  During the primaries this sub was very pro Bernie and the only place talking about the rigging of the primaries.  The good longtime users here are all obviously past the whole right vs left mindset and I think most people here just saw Trump as the lesser of two evils.

       Yes, this sub was a cheerleader for Donald Trump. You know why? Because for the first time in maybe fourty years, a globalist or a person controlled by a globalist does not occupy the office of President. That is a monumental achievement. And people like us made it happen.

       And not even a week later we get threads decrying him from shill accounts, trying to inflame arguments in the userbase. What benefit does this thread have besides trying to cause a split in the userbase between Pro-Trump and Anti-Trump commenters?

       Globalism and Communism are the same thing. I don't see how Trump is a fascist, he doesn't stick to the left / right paradigm for example supporting states rights by allowing them to decide on gay marriage, but at the same time promising to protect LGBT rights.

       I'm thinking we'll probably need this place after Trump has a chance to affect free press and speech laws though, so I want to try to help keep it as unbiased as possible while I still can.

       Thanks for understanding. He has been so anti-free speech during his election, and has almost flipped once winning the election. I will keep it in mind to stay nice, no matter how hard it is. But then again, what is a good counter argument for "you fucking shill CTR"? Haha.

       bitch, he is the exact definition of an oligarch. A rich businessman, from a rich family who uses his money for political power. He has paid bribes, and used eminent domain to gain more money/power...he has been in the know with many in the political field, and now he is in line for the presidency.

       Peter Thiel has shown no previous interest in Trump, in the Republican party or in any of the policies Trump advocates (Thiel is actually a libertarian/anarcho-capitalist not a protectionist nationalist), but he donates a million dollars to Trumps campaign, then gets invited to speak at one of his rallies and suddenly he has a position on Trumps transition team.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm shocked at how many people who complained about elites buying political influence seemed totally on board with Trump just outright trying to buy his way into power rather than bribing someone already in power.

       The usual shit you should have heard by now. Narcissistic billionaire who has no idea what life is like for us brags about sexual assault, has hateful rhetoric that has already caused countless hate crimes, doesn't have shit for legitimate policy, "drained the swamp" with a bunch of establishment Republicans including known corrupt ones like Christie, doesn't even pay his workers if he knows they're too poor to sue him, has economic plans that experts say will royally fuck the economy, denies climate change because there's money to be made, supports the horrible private prisons because there's money to be made, etc. Just an all around piece of garbage.

       Where do I even begin? This is shit straight from his mouth, dude. None of this is anything but factual. The apprentice tape is where he bragged about sexual assault. About 50 tweets have him calling climate change a hoax. His establishment cabinet? That's just a thing that's fucking happening as we speak. Tons of people have told their stories of Trump refusing to pay them, and he's being sued by so many people. If you're seriously this in the dark, get googling asap. You know nothing about Trump and that's fucking ridiculous.

       I agree he has been civil, but my intention wasn't to be rude either...being this willfully ignorant is unacceptable if you're going to openly support any candidate. I feel I should be able to point that out without being considered a dick. If I didn't go about it in the most polite way possible it's because I was genuinely surprised/upset by what he was telling me.

       He didn't bother to pay much attention at all to his candidate. I pointed out the biggest things people complain about, and he had never heard of them. That tells me he literally doesn't look at anything but extremely biased sources like Breitbart and whatever else

       How so?  I read the candidates policy on everything.  Hillary, Stein, Trump and Gary's and here you come along and tell me abojt the scandals i
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       Know about?  Who cares if Jill was a hippy or Trump loves to bang chicks or Hillarys photo whwn she was in HS?  I dont think ANY lf that is relevant to who becomes president.  All that matters is my tovernment represents me as best they can so I vote for that person.

       I never mentioned fucking high school pictures or anything like that. I'm talking about recent, relevant stuff. His stances on things, even. You said you'd never heard of any of it.

       Is that a technical term for you looked it up? There unquestionably are years of business dealings between Trump and Soros. Best part is the candidate that ran against the Goldman Sachs Candidate is about to put a 17-year Goldman guy in his cabinet...that also use to work for Soros Fund Management...

       what about all of the other people considered for cabinet positions? Gingrich isn't establishment? What about Bolton? Giuliani? Those aren't establishment GOPers? Pretty interesting that Trump declares himself anti-establishment while only considering establishment republicans for cabinet.

       yea pence is a pretty underwhelming VP choice anyways. Offers nothing to the ticket since he was guaranteed the evangelical vote anyways, and Indiana is a red state.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the fact that he's only considering establishment republicans for important cabinet positions proves that he's not anti-establishment. If he wanted to "drain the swamp," maybe you shouldn't tell your voter base to re-elect the incumbent GOPer instead of alt-right congresspeople, and maybe you shouldn't only consider establishment GOPers for your cabinet. But I voted third party, so what do I know?

       Too late. You guys let them spread their shitty witchcraft/pizza conspiracy theories here, and now they've made it their third/fourth home.

       edit: downvotes don't alter the truth. It was a weak, ridiculous conspiracy theory, and you all upvoted it to the top for the better part of a week. You let the roaches into your house, you can't just ask them to leave now.

       If you suddenly decide that "pizza" is always a reference to pedophilia, then you can believe that everyone is a pedophile. But that doesn't make it true.

       I wouldn't suddenly decide that everything related to pizza is about little kids.  And I don't think redditors will think that way either.  If we look into it, debunk it, and move on, how will that hurt the cause?  I'm really against suppression of leads in this instance.

       The_Cheeto needs to start to understand that their candidate won without political scrutiny because he had no political history.  Now: We're one week deep and his political history is growing.  Time to see if he holds up, and they're accepting it because they won but they're already starting to get nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe, just maybe: This was actually an important decision and memeing your way into an election may be been a dumb idea? But what do I know, I'm just one of the 350M America affected by this.

       for making this thread which shouldn't even have been created in the first place if the situation of this subreddit wasn't as bad as it is now. I respect that some users are also Donald Trump supporters but they shouldn't brigade this subreddit which was meant as a free-thinking space. Everyone can criticise everything if they can bring up proofs or elements of proof and arguments. Noone is sacred and untouchable for real

       Hillary Clinton email scandal is blown completely out of portion by the Trump campaign. She is at most liable for a small role in faction a kin to parking over the white stripe in the parking lot Donald Trump makes it sound like she parked on the white child. He knows it's bullshit. He's lying to you so he can get elected.

       Yeah well it's this kind of false confidence that propelled Clinton to the nomination and the loss. I hate trump, btw.  I don't even want to capitalize his name, because he even gives capitalism a bad name.  Capitalization, too.

       No, the DNC propelled Clinton to the nomination.  And I hate Clinton, btw, but I don't think that using improper English is going to fix anything, but then again I don't try to turn everything I do into some sort of self-satisfying social statement.

       I haven't seen what you're claiming here, OP, you're projecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm looking at the front page of this subreddit right now and I only see one post talking about Obama deporting more illegals than Trump is saying he will, and one other post asking why Clinton hasn't denounced the anti-Trump riots, both of which don't sound like it's promoting either candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like the mods haven't gotten any reports of what you claim either, because they haven't said any thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you provide an example of what you're speaking about? Pretty sure that the mods will or would typically remove a post that doesn't fit this subreddit or belong here.

       Yeah unfortunately you're right.  Look at the active accounts right now, +3500 plus, more than twice what has been typical for the past few weeks and even more than was present on the eve of the election.  This place gets manipulated hard by thousands of sock-puppet accounts on a daily basis.

       None of the top comments are real criticisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm interested in his potential. I didn't vote for him, but there's pluses to having an outsider run the show for once.
      </p>
      <p>
       His stance on climate change is absurd. I don't understand why people would want to even deny it. Even if climate change was just made up, why wouldn't we want to pursue renewable resources instead of mining the earth for its remaining stock of oil? Guy wants to put coal back on the map when it's a dying industry. There's no money in it for the long run. I don't understand why a business man wouldn't want to make a better long term investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baffling. Everyone protesting is scared of their civil rights going away. That'll never happen. The people won't let it happen. But humanity dying is going to happen and no one seems to really be protesting that aspect.

       I'm just answering OP's question. As I said, I'm interested in his potential and never expected him to fix everything, I hope you didn't misinterpret my comment to think that, as I'm not sure where I stated that. Feel free to support the guy all you want but I recommend not blindly follow him. Learn to think critically for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some things I have hope for. Congressional term limits are a plus. Hopefully the guy knows how to make money and can stimulate the economy, but putting it into resources that damage the earth and put our ability to survive on it at very high risk is as I said before; absurd. It might make him look good in the short term with temporarily increased profits and jobs, but it will not fair well for us long term. The earth is at

       . Climate change isn't some insane liberal agenda people are trying to push on conservatives to scare children into being hippies. It is a scientific fact. This is the fate of humanity. And for a world leader to be idiotically opposed to it is fucking retarded.

       Ever since the U.S. election, the amount of anti Hillary bias way outweighed anything negative about Trump. Which made me think this sub had become a front for

       To be fair to r/the_donald, they have been more on top of a lot of conspiracy information than r/conspiracy has at times. While there is a very obvious bias towards Trump on that sub, the vast majority of topics were about things that had little to do with Trump himself, rather disproving things said in the MSM, or trying to expose Soros, even going through all the wikileaks emails trying to piece together the pizzagate pedophile stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I get where you are coming from here, but r/conspiracy has more in common with r/the_donald than you think.

       That forum plainly states, in the rules section, that dissenters and SJW are not allowed. They don't want anything to do with those who don't deepthroat Trump. If you are not aligned with him, you will be banned and I'm speaking as a person who was banned after three short posts. So if this place has no agenda, why are the mods allowing this to happen?

       You need to understand reddit and social media in general as to why that is important. I will start off by saying that is not anything unique to r/the_donald. If you simply post a comment on the_donald, you will be instantly banned from many other subreddits. It doesn't matter what you said in your comment, you are instantly banned from many other subreddits because of it. Many of those subreddits are ones controlled by CTR(or were) along with the infiltration and subversion of Reddit in general. Look to the Warrant Canary being removed this year as obvious proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes it isn't ideal, but it is needed in the current climate for them to impose those rules on that subreddit.

       You need to understand that I already understand reddit and social media in general. We aren't talking about what happens in other subs. We are talking about what happens in this sub and the trump sub. The trump sub does not allow for dissenters and SJW, it says it right there in their rules section. So that means they have an agenda. This place was never meant to have a political agenda because the majority here are apolitical. So you can't point fingers at other subs and blame them, while turning the blind eye to the Trump sub and ignoring their posted rules, while trying to justify the takeover here. This forum hasn't done anything to trump supporters so why are we penalized with spam?

       I never said I was giving the_donald a free pass. I was simply trying to explain why those rules are in place. They were fighting against a paid shill army in CTR, as well as Reddit as a whole as it has been taken over by the globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were in a war trying to elect who they thought was the best chance at saving the US. If that meant banning shills/dissenters/SJW's to keep the boards as clean as possible to promote their message than so be it. Like I said, they are biased towards their candidate and did what needed to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for what I originally said, I give them credit for talking about things not being discussed anywhere else on Reddit, even on this sub. The majority of posts were not so much about Trump, but about conspiracies in the MSM, in government, in globalism/NWO, in Secret societies, in spirit cooking and international pedophilia rings etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know whether you are a shill or just an impassioned r/conspiracy nut concerned with the sub...but I would be happy with the_donald as I have seen more people wake up to the realities of the world there than anywhere else in my decade long adventure into the belly of the conspiracy beast.

       You don't have to say that you are giving them a free pass but your words imply it. What does fighting against a paid shill army in CTR and reddit have to do with
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, they are biased in their candidate, are still biased in their candidate, but what does that have to do with them overrunning
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       forum? Why are they promoting the message
       <em>
        here
       </em>
       when the majority here are apolitical and this forum is devoted to conspiracies?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for giving them credit, well, there was absolutely nothing I saw in the sub that wasn't discussed here, in depth, with a bit more insight. Even if what you are saying is true, what does that have to do with pushing a political agenda
       <em>
        here
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't know if
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       are a shill, a trump deepthroater, or the man on the moon. What does any of that have to do with infiltrating this sub and making it the_Donald 2.0?
      </p>
      <p>
       Realities of the world and a decade long adventure? Seeing people wake up? If you or
       <strong>
        ANYONE
       </strong>
       else believe they are going to decide the leadership of the most advanced country on the planet, by filling in bubbles next to names printed on paper, then you're still asleep. And that's my decade long adventure into the belly of the conspiracy beast talking.

       Maybe I missed out on the "infiltration" of this sub as it went to shit a long time ago and I really stopped paying attention to it. Real talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been trying to give this sub a chance to redeem itself, and every time I am more and more disappointed. Just look at the recent threads regarding wikileaks and the international pedo rings. I see more comments that are what I would expect from a Huffington Post comment section than I do anything relatively conspiracy related. Seriously...it is fucking depressing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe we are going to decide the leadership of the most advanced country on the planet by filling in bubbles next to names on a piece of paper. What I do realize is that in this rigged system we have to go with what we are given. Do we want immediate war with Russia leading to WWIII by electing Hillary Clinton who was the only candidate for a no fly zone over Syria? Or do we want an "outsider" who might possibly change things up a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no good choices here, and I don't think for one second that Donald Trump couldn't be compromised by the elites, but he is our best shot right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as a political based subreddit is concerned, the_donald was as far from politically centered as anything I have ever seen. Everyone about it has been for the most part upbeat and positive with a bias more towards conspiracy than politics.

       This is where you are wrong. Your falling into the trap of letting something or someone choose for you by allowing yourself to be convinced that your choice is limited. That's how authoritarian systems work. They create the perception of limited choice so they can manipulate the masses between the choices they create.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is you do have a choice, you can refuse to consent to a system that has been proven time and time again that it will do what is in the best interest of the TPTW the same choice you would have if you ran a company that was taken over by corrupt individuals. Refuse to consent and take you money and support elsewhere.
Everybody that claims they have lack of choice is just deciving themselves because they don't want to let go of the ship that has protected them for so long. The ship is sinking, just let go, you don't need to be pulled under by the weight of false choice.

       Go back to elementary school, maybe learn how auto correct works, I mean you have so many advantages at your disposal my friend. How on Earth you still display yourself as a complete idiot is beyond me.

       I am glad that you don't visit crap subs, but you are definitely banned from many subs by simply participating on r/the_donald. Whether you are aware of these bans doesn't matter, you are automatically banned via bots that probe reddit.

       Actually it's the ther way around. Political ideologies will always find ways to use the truth for there own adgenga. The problem is that poltics is an agenda that most of us no longer consent to. We know that is designed to disempower people regardless of the candidate. The question is are you going to align yourself with truth, or a political figure head designed to steal the energy of truth so that it may use it for its own purposes?

       Donald Trump is part of a deep Islamist conspiracy. He was born in Pakistan as Dawood Ibrahim Khan. His campaign stirred up anti-muslim sentiment in the west which pushes moderate Muslims to the arms of Islamist groups like ISIS.

       Because since the internet was a place for regular people from around the world to discuss ideas with each other it has been seen as a threat by those with power.  We saw it this election for both sides, tons of brand new accounts spamming for their sides rhetoric.  Reddit has been compromised, maybe it was already, but we have definitely seen it now.

       A lot of people had excessive expectations for Trump.   Trump like Obama,  knew how to pump/sell to a lot of people based on hope,  them projecting their hope for a savior on a schmuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,  there will be a lot of let downs.   Emperors do not give up their powers,  and do not blow the cover of their secret operations.   Forget a real investigation into 9/11.    Its a national myth,  and no matter how nuts the official version is,  its like the official version of the NFL or major league baseball.    Too many people have too much invested in it.    Too many people would be sidelined for complicity if the truth came out.    But history will
       <strong>
        NOT
       </strong>
       look kindly on these megalomaniacs,  not for Pearl Harbor or Hiroshima/Nagasaki/Vietnam/Iraq etc.  which also were undertaken with duplicity,  premeditated genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well,  back to the subject.   Two mob factions had a war and the people they operate their racket against took sides.   Get ready to pay your protection money to the mob that won.   And celebrate the mob that lost getting whipped,  if they do get whipped.   Trump will probably pardon them,  at this rate.

       One is a subreddit created for one specific person. There was never any trickery or pretending, it was
       <em>
        known

       as a Donald Trump online pep-rally from the second it was created.

       The other is called r-politics.

       Except they love to pretend they're free speech advocates and that liberal cucks can't handle disagreement in their safe spaces. They're hypocrites. I've seen people in this very thread say they were there for months and were surprised they were banned the second they said something critical of trump, so clearly there's some pretending going on.

       One sub's users will downvote you to oblivion. The other's admins will ban you. Not really compatible. One is the definition of a safe space, the other isn't. The_Donald is a safe space.

       I've criticized Obama as an amoral drone killer who's been worse on transparency and whistleblowing than Bush, and who had no real intention to shutdown Guantanamo because of the bad headlines it would produce, and I've not been banned for it.

       I've also said Hilary is blatantly corrupt and that voting for the lesser of two evils is wrong, and I've not been banned for it.

       It's not the creation of a Donald Trump fan club that's hypocritical, its doing so when you call out safe spaces and liberals for not tolerating disagreement and think yourself superior somehow when you do exactly the same thing, and pretend "but we're intentionally creating a Trump safe space!" makes a difference.

       I got banned for defending another guy who was defending himself because he was dating a single mother. Everyone was calling him a cuck and that his girl was a cancer to society, etc.

       Okay prove it then. Pretend to be a person with what you think a reasonable criticism of Trump might be and see if you get banned or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I mean a genuine criticism like "I'm uneasy about Pence as a VP pick" or "I don't like there's so many corporate lobbyists in his transition team", not some softball shit like "He should tell Obama to go fuck himself"

       openly says if anyone criticizes Trump report them and they will be banned. It's not a place to discuss politics, it's a place to support the person you're voting for.

       That's what a safe space is. I'm not sure why you think them being explicit about what they're doing makes it less hypocritical when they rave about liberals being triggered and offended by any opposing views all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they really believed their shit about challenging views and free speech they wouldn't want a safe space. The fact they admit that its a safe space is not relevant to that point.

       "Safe spaces" are commonly on college campuses and in places where open discussion and open minds are supposed to be encouraged. They intentionally block out the noise so their echo chamber goes undisturbed.
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       members are more than willing to debate, but if they
       <em>
        allow
       </em>
       it in
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       than it's going to clutter the subreddit and take away what it is about, memes and circlejerking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this trend was not started by
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       , it was a trend started by
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . I have tried to debate in their multiple times or bring up an opposing viewpoint, but within seconds I'm -10.
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       has the choice of allowing open debate whereas
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       does not, or they can choose to counteract one extreme with another.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can call it what you want, but changing a definition or viewpoint to try and catch someone being a hypocrite doesn't make them hypocritical, it makes you a fuckin moron lol.

       Posting this here cause this topic has some visibility... If anyone is wondering how moderators got compromised... on reddit and elsewhere... check out that topic I remember from a while back...  This is what they sent in a PM

        "Thanks for responding.
I'm a student at the Salt Institute in Portland studying radio documentary and am doing a story about content moderation. As of now the scope I have for the story is that I don't really think the general population has any idea that these jobs exist. Content Moderation is absolutely necessary but it's all behind the scenes and it would be interesting to learn more about it.
If you would like to talk about your experience doing some of this work it would be great if we could set up an interview wherever you'd like."

       Sure starting to sound like CTR in here. I can understand questioning Trump, he should be looked at and is in power now, but to completely discredit Alex Jones(who is one of the biggest, more mainstream conspiracy theorists) or anyone who might question how much control Jews might have sounds like your just trying to silence people. You may not agree but it is a conspiracy sub, all this should be grounds for debate and looked into.

       The Deep State called Hillary's bluff and decapitated the official, visible state, unless you consider having a cartoon character for president as having a legitimate head of state. So the Deep State itself has protested radically in order to remove the Clintonian parasitic carapace from its back, in doing so it has mutilated itself, indeed left the official state essentially headless for at least 4 years. Anything is possible, all is up in the air. The main question is, does this portend more or less war for the world?

       I just dont see how someone can be self seeking if they endured a year long smear campaign. Just doesn't make sense. There has been so much corruption exposed because of his campaign. It would make no sense for him to publicly call the MSM out  on their bullshit and become an enemy of the DNC, when he could have just joined the left and had an easy ride to victory. I think hes the real deal.

       Have you never heard of the phrase "No such thing as bad publicity"? He was getting millions of dollars of free advertising from all the controversies he stirred up.

       Even if Trump lost his fame would have been propelled to an all time high.  This a man who puts his name on every building he gets a chance to. He was planning on launching a TV network off the back of the hype if he lost.

       Trump won almost entirely based off opposing Hilary and proposing populist protectionist policies like cracking down on immigration and foreign trade. He would have never made it through DNC primaries, and he wouldn't have had a candidate so embroiled in scandal and thoroughly uncharismatic to go up against.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact Trump previously praised Clinton to high heaven and described himself as a democrat before going back on it and deciding democrats have ruined the country and Clinton is terrible tells you all you need to know about whether he believes what he says, or cares about principles more than power.

       Why does he go on reality TV? It doesn't pay enough to be worth a billionaires time. Not everything is about money. The man is clearly a raving egotist. Getting your name in the list of presidents is worth about 10,000 skyscrapers with your name on it.

       What do you deem more credible? That a man who got rich bribing politicians (which he openly brags about), avoiding paying tax (which he also brags about), using corporate bankruptcy to get out of paying his debts (which he brags about), and the legal system to fuck his contractors out of money (this one he doesn't brag so much about), suddenly decided to run for the good of the American people?

       Just curious if you knew about any of those allegations before he started his campaign, or are they just things you picked up from the year long smear campaign I mentioned? This seems to be more proof of my argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump is doing everything simply to boost his ego, then why wouldn't he just take the easy rout and run as a democrat?Why risk tarnishing his name? Why put so much energy into bashing the DNC and the media when he could have easily just joined the left and had an easy ride to the top, all while being praised by the MSM? With the current political climate, nobody in their right mind would run as a republican candidate in hopes for an easy victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say ''no such thing as bad publicity'', but if someone could make the choice to be seen as a ''racist bigot homophobe child molester'' or ''an intellectual, businessman, genius'' ( which is how the media would have portrayed him if he was on the left) who the hell would choose the negativity? Like I said, it makes no sense that he is doing this to boost his ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the whole ''Trump didn't pay a bunch of contractors'' thing I think is an oversimplification. Just one of those quick jabs people keep in their arsenal and use when the time is right.  Trump was running a multi billion dollar empire. There are alot of moving gears within businesses that large. Sometimes there are penalty claues if a person finishes a job late, or if its a shit job all together. Sometimes mistakes happen. Wasn't ''the list of contractors Trump didn't pay'' all the way back from the 80s to present day? How can someone run business that massive for that long and not have issues?

       I could post a  list of a bunch of good things Trump has done for people, where there is no way he could have gained anything in return. Would that change your position that everything he does is motivated purely by self interest? I doubt it. You seem to be pretty set in your idea of him.

        Just curious if you knew about any of those allegations before he started his campaign, or are they just things you picked up from the year long smear campaign I mentioned?

      <p>
       Would that make them not true?
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't hear about Hilary laughing about getting a child rapist off until the smear campaign against her kicked off, doesn't mean its not true. I did hear about Trump U being a scam a few years back though when the first lawsuits started coming in.

       <p>
        Trump was running a multi billion dollar empire. There are alot of moving gears within businesses that large. Sometimes there are penalty claues if a person finishes a job late, or if its a shit job all together. Sometimes mistakes happen.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If this is just the natural result of having a billion dollar empire, where's Elon Musks equivalent scandals and lawsuits?  Where's his repeated bankruptcies?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a more philosophical problem with the way Trump makes his money even ignoring the allegations of fraud and breach of contract. At the very least Trump himself
       <del>
        admits to
       </del>
       brags about gaming the system, trying to pay as little tax as possible, using corporate bankruptcy to repeatedly get out of paying debts, using ties and bribes to politicians in order to get special favors. Even if all of the lawsuits against him where false, he still revels in stacking the deck in his favor using his wealth and influence. He also has a huge amount of money tied up in property speculation, instead of actually producing value. That is not the kind of businessman I admire. I admire people like Elon Musk, people who want to make money by producing things of value, not just by gaming the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Musk has far more money than Trump, started off with much less of an advantage and still hasn't a fraction of the lawsuits against him as Trump did.

        If Trump is doing everything simply to boost his ego, then why wouldn't he just take the easy rout and run as a democrat?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do you think he would have won the democratic primary on a ticket of "build the wall", "shutdown on muslim imigration", "Obama is the founder of ISIS and btw remember when I kept asking to see his birth certificate"? The birther stuff alone was enough to kill his chances at primary and election with democratic voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump got less votes than Romney did. Going up against someone as corrupt and uncharismatic as Hilary was a golden gift he would have lost on a democratic ticket (which he wouldn't have won anyway).

      <p>
       I don't recall saying everything he does is out of self interest. I think I said something like I don't think he ran for president out of some altruistic urge to do good, and that putting his name on everything and becoming a reality TV star are clearly about his ego. But I don't think Hilary ran for altruistic reasons either.

       Seems far more realistic than the idea that a character like Donald Trump would transform into a man of the people in his late 60s. The man has spent his entire life stepping on poor people and being a nasty asshole to anyone who would listen.

       I think the problem lies within Reddit itself. T_d is popular because it's one of the only places that doesn't constantly bash trump. So, they take it to the other extreme and praise him. 
Maybe if Reddit actually viewed Trump without hate, t_d would go away. It's the only place for his fans to really talk positives because nobody else does. Yet he won the election, so that shows the bias and even the demographic of Reddit. It's hard for this to be a place of fair discussion when it's ALL hate. It pisses me off and I'm not crazy about the guy either.

       It's more that the Hillary corruption aligned so well with discussions here. As the need for the_donald to uncover how corrupt Hillary was dissipates, you'll find there is no need for them to crossover here.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is still much to be done with regards to the hillary corruption that links so hard to everything we as conspiracy theorists have been talking about for decades.

       Would be good if this post was accompanied by some conspiracy theories surrounding trump, instead of just whining about it.

       Threads like this were being posted once or twice a week for months but they were always aggressively downvoted. I usually sort by 'new' so I saw them. I guess now that Trump's won the election the funding's been cut back on the Republicans' version of CTR, so the anti-Trump stuff has more chance to gain traction.

       Personally I think it's a little more simple than that. The average user of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is 1. happy to upvote anything damning about an authority figure, regardless of the legitimacy of the story, and 2. feels threatened and oppressed by "the powers that be", whomever that might be.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the election Hillary represented the "establishment" and Trump represented the "underdog" here (however inaccurate that characterization may have been), so naturally the users of this sub upvoted anything damning about Hillary and ignored anything damning about Trump. Now that Hillary is out of the picture and Trump will be president, Trump now represents "the powers that be" so this sub has turned on him. He's now the oppressor they're looking for because he has the power, so he'll be the focus of this sub for the next 4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, this is a much simpler explanation than thousands of paid shills trying to control the posts on a niche subreddit. But believe whatever you want to believe.

       Not that anyone here cares, but I've unsubscribed because of this. The pro trump/anti Hillary propaganda is just too much. Unless it's about either or both being lizard people, I've lost interest.

       Way too early to offer real criticism, it's just guesswork and speculation at this point. We'll have to wait to see what he actually does in office. Even more than most people, it's going to be what he does not what he says.
      </p>
      <p>
       I speculate that he is being disingenuous when he says he won't go after gay marriage and abortion rights - he won't need to do it himself if he appoints the 'right' people to the supreme court.
      </p>
      <p>
       He appoints priebus, and bannon at the same time. While priebus can be seen as a moderating influence / olive branch to the republican establishment, bannon is most certainly a giant 'fuck you' to the establishment and doesn't bode well for the current 'see, he really is a moderate after all' sentiment.

       Dear r/conspiracy

       If you want to spam r/all with conspiracies, stop spamming it with political shit. We Indians couldn't give half a shit if a sex scandal about Hillary and Trump came out on the same day.

       The person who posted this does not speak for the

       In my opinion, it seems like CTR took a few days to reorganize and then started to inflitrate large subreddits outside of r/politics (since that had become far too obvious) and this post is the perfect example of their work to divide people.

       I've modded gigantic Trump communities. I've modded small nationalist communities. I've interacted with die hard Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not one of them genuinely believes Trump is infallible. We all have our issues with Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be some that support wikileaks now that will hate them if they ever release anything about Trump. That's just how people work, and this post isn't going to stop that. You're not that powerful.

       What you can do is stop eating your friends and start accepting their quirks. Let us dig into what we find interesting, and eventually we'll find something you find interesting too.

       That's how TPTW operate, the create an illusion of change and work to limit that change as much as they can. It's been in operation for a long time, you saw it with Obama, and you will see it with Trump.
      </p>

       You really need to let go of any system bringing change that you don't have direct infulence over.

       So even though there's clear evidence of the media conspiring against Trump, you still think he's some kind of puppet. I'm not saying 100% ruling that possibility out, but posters feel that Trump was a big fuck you to the establishment and it's why he has a huge presence here.

       And is how that bad thing? Reince can't be Chief of Staff and RNC Chairman at the same time. This leaves an opening for somebody to take over Reince's place, somebody who's more in line with what people for who voted Trump want.

       Just because he was elected doesn't mean that he's suddenly a part of the establishment.  Trump is going to be in a position to tear aoart the corruption we've been talking about on here for years, why wouldn't we support him?  We don't need to be entirely impartial just for the sake of it, let's base our opinions of others of their actions.

       Honest opinion: You don't want an echo chamber in either direction. Bring your theories and let people hold them to the light. If they hold them to the light and they check out, great. If they don't, also great. Just because you have a bunch of people here who support Donald shouldn't stop you from doing anything in particular. It just means you might be called out more when you drop theories about him, and that should neither be good nor bad.

       That would be fine and dandy if his supporters weren't so nasty and juvenile. They've been stinking up this sub and internet comments' sections across the internet for over a year now. They need to be called out.

       I thought the whole point of Trump winning was anti-elite/power to the people sentiment. The_Donald is just kissing Trump's ass and letting him walk all over them. There is little Trump can do that they won't find some way to justify with mental gymnastics, reminds me of the people who supported George Bush.

       I've been in the middle this whole election and can Honestly say that there was only 1 real trump sub Reddit the entire election which was The Donald, maybe even HillaryForPrison. Everything else was an echo chamber of why Hillary is amazing and why trump is the devil.  Let them have there safe space. Reddit/google/Facebook was an enormous safe space for Hillary. Just an observation, please don't hate.

       Well, here's the good news; from what I gather from The_Donald (and I've been active since it was at 13k subscribers), we're excited at the prospect of him being president next year. That being said, we're on our toes watching for any type of 180 that signifies that he's going to go back on his campaign promises. If he gets out of line, we'll likely be the first to speak up.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, his recent appointment of Reince Priebus to a cabinet position was scrutinized; from what we can gather, it's a case of "keep your friends close, and your enemies closer" to lessen a chance of rebellion from the guy. It also helps to have insiders who know the ins and outs of the corruption plaguing D.C. to assist with routing out the corruption. We absolutely plan on holding him accountable for everything he does; if he steps out of line, we'll be absolutely speak out in opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dealing with the corruption in Washington is a bipartisan issue.

       Hahaha. What makes you think they're enemies? Have you been following Trump's campaign? Look here:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "He is very likely Chief of Staff,” said one person familiar with the conversations. “Trump legit listens to him.”
Priebus took on a leading role in encouraging Trump to stay on message in the final weeks of the campaign, holding multiple calls with the candidate daily since he became the presumptive nominee in May, and frequently traveling on his plane.
        <em>
         Under Priebus’ leadership the RNC took on an unprecedented role in managing the nuts-and-bolts of Trump’s data, field, and finance operations.

       "Thank you pointing this out, I was going to unsubscribe from this subreddit but now I won't..." then the comment usually goes on to bash the_Donald subreddit.

       News flash people, Trump very likely had his own version of CTR but it was probably much more organically fueled. It was clear he dominated Clinton in social media, if she could take over

       and have shills running amok he totally had some crazy shit going on too.

       All these people saying

       was used and we couldn't see it, just shut the hell up. Many saw it, many complained, and well that sort of thing is always possibility when you try to have a sub with minimal censorship. Been happening here for a long time and for many different reasons.

       I have no idea why no one is pointing this out on here. Trump just got to the Presidency while circumventing the lobbying system. The lobbying system ensures that politicians basically owe favors once they get into office. If they want to get re-elected, they have to please the special interests. This acts as a means to control politicians. Trump doesn't owe anyone any favors because his campaign was mostly self-funded. He also has billions of dollars at his disposal. The President is exempt from the conflicts of interest laws surrounding investing. This means that he can help push through legislation that deregulates certain markets that he's invested in. It wouldn't even be illegal. That would make him a ton of money. He can then funnel this money to the election campaigns of the politicians who are loyal to him. His plan is to severely limit the power of lobbyists in Washington. Good, right? No, not if the President just made a ton of money and could use that money to fund congressional election campaigns. Severely limiting the power of lobbyists would set him up to be the main financier of election campaigns. He'd basically own Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could then push through legislation that creates congressional term limits. This would make it so that he could just wait out the members of Congress that he couldn't force out by just funding their competition's election campaigns. From there he could pass any legislation he wants or have them appoint whoever he wants to the Supreme Court. He could also impeach anyone he wants. That would get rid of any checks or balances to the President's power. He has set up a blind trust which is run by members of his own family. Usually these are used to provide some transparency with regard to the President's investments. Having your family members run it basically ensures that that information will be kept secret. This guy just found a legal loophole that he could exploit to make himself America's first dictator. We just put him in a position where he can take advantage of that loophole. We're dumb as fuuck.

       Small point, but Trump didn't mostly self-fund his campaign. He donated around 25% of the total amount raised (or $66 million), some ~$10 million of which was paid back to himself and his children as reimbursement for travel expenses and use of family-owned entities like hotels and such. His PACs raised $33 million just from people writing checks of a million dollars or more, people like Robert Mercer of Rennaisance Technologies (interesting little hedge fund if you want to look into it-- the two CEOs were both top donors to the Hillary and Trump campaigns). None of that negates the rest of your post however.

       The brain has no part called imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagination is the ability to form a mental image of something that is not perceived through the five senses. It is the ability of the mind to build mental scenes, objects or events that do not exist, are not present, or have happened in the past.

       Real people see it. Be sure of that.  The rest is just CTR trying to change public opinion and the people that get temporarily swept up in it. Their game is over, critical mass is just around the corner. I predict that in 10 years time the game will be over, we are in the middle of this change now.

       You do realize that a large portion of people here are apoliical don't you? A large portion of us believe presidents are selected, not elected and so it wouldn't matter. In addition, we are of the belief that this place should be about conspiracies and not promoting political agendas. That's where the disconnect is happening and it's people such as yourself who confuse it with being envious. No one is envious of success because, as I stated before, many of us (I'd say the majority) believe presidents are selected so we don't see success where you do.

       It really felt like it was flowing down hill in one direction though during the elections... I think that's the point. No doubt it came from both sides but let's be honest here.

       Trump has been the only candidate willing to call corruption out though which is why this place is probably filled with Trump fanboys. Did CTR get paid to post this shit thread? Who the fuck cares if people like Trump? I guess you want your sub to die by telling people what kind of content they can post instead of letting the community decide. I'll never come back to this place after reading this and I'm not even really an ardent supporter of the_donald. quit telling people what to do basically. if people in here like Trump, it's probably for good reason. who are you tell them what to post? get over yourselves, dweebs. your candidate lost, get over it.

       Except the people that corrupt the politicians are ALSO corrupt. He's admitted to corrupting politicians (legally of course) but that doesn't change the fact that he's corrupt. Not to mention this "Drain the swamp" candidate that ran on being "anti-establishment" has now employed the most establishment guy there is as his chief of staff. Stop kidding yourself.

       I only subbed because I heard this one from my room mate a few months back when he said he was gonna leave the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right around when that black guy sniped the two cops, the theory was that riots would be spreading. Big ones. BLM had already had a few riots, but there were going to be more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Trump would get elected. Obviously, this did happen. We are having riots now because of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next step is that Obama will deny the results of the election. He'll call for "boots on the ground," (that term seems to be very important) and enact martial law of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this time, cops have been silently disarming citizens. This was kind of true. Obama did call an executive mandate for more gun control. Executive mandates don't necessarily do anything though, it's just an influential person declaring their intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now the nation is under military control, Obama will declare himself President for another term, any citizens who still have guns will be systematically confiscated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then things are supposed to somehow devolve into all out civil war. You either join the cops and kill people or resist and get killed. I'm fuzzy on any other details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Haven't heard any conspiracy like that on here since joining though...

       It's simple. There is so much corruption, conspiracy and overall evil surrounding the Clintons and the DNC that Trump supporters are very engaged in waking people up to what is really going on. Most people get the majority of their information from the MSM and Facebook, so they have been grossly manipulated. There are overbearing and ill intented Trump supporters of course, but the majority are level headed people who appreciate facts and liberty. And no matter what insults people throw our way, we will fight for what is right. ps this dog needs no lap, kid.

       How ironic this is, with the crimes the Clintons have done not only involving her email server but the billions of dollars stolen from Haiti and hundreds of thousands dead because of it, with the middle east in shambles and 10 year old girls being made sex slaves and raped, tongues hammered onto tables every single day. Will you admit these crimes? Are you not delusional? If President elect Trump makes even a tenth of these kinds of crimes against humanity, I will be one of the first to call him out on it. Until then, no amount of immature name calling with zero facts will quiet people like me, because we believe in what is good and what is logical. Peace.

       I'll explain it for you. It is ironic to say that trump supporters are delusional to the misdeeds of their candidate when Hillary Clinton is literally responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of people and yet her supporters, like yourself, seem not to care and instead focus on unimportant things. I am not filled with hate, but you seem to be. I'm mostly disappointed and disgusted with about 50% of the American public. Bring me your facts and evidence, and I will listen to you. That is how discussion works! So far, you've literally provided nothing. Edit: After checking your post history, it is obvious you are uneducated, and in past "discussions" focused on unimportant grammar, while yourself making a plethora of grammatical errors. You spend your time watching and thinking about sports, and preaching to other people about how stupid they are without providing any positive reinforcement. You're a burden on all around you, and a disappointment to your family. Examine yourself closely, and maybe you will wake up. Good luck.

       While I agree the forum is intended for conspiracy.

       Your initial request to bash said candidate by equally derailing the topic of conspiracy; Could easily be mistaken as an HRC post which is subconsciously trying to promote the opposing candidate-

       If any of you are dumb enough to fall for the opposing opposites propaganda, you deserve to be confused. They fucking trick you guys in eve single election. And every time you fall for the false change that is supposed to be created. Do you actually think that TPTW are really going to allow real change?

       So let me get this straight. People like your work and are attracted to this sub, and your solution to that is to call them out because they're pro trump. Get a life buddy and stop being such a hipster.

       So you're admitting that anything negative about Trump gets downvoted in a kneejerk fashion out of fear of the boogeyman CTR and MSM? Seems like a solid excuse to stop using your brain.

       This claim is merely sourced to their

        "investigation"

       She was accused of these things, and the Republican FBI director said she did none of these things. No charges. No indictment. Which part of that don't you understand?

       I'm not the OP you wanted sources from, but here are a couple showing the swath of Republican insiders on Trump's Cabinet, ie. the swamp rats in his "drained swamp" and many of which are staunch Bush era hooligans.

       Reince Priebus, Chris Christie, Jeff Sessions, Rudi Giuliani, Steven Mnuchin...yeah, sounds like a real swamp draining there.  What a complete farce.  Insiders, insiders everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know, the one making me laugh the hardest at the backflips it's going to induce in delusional Trump supporters is Steven Mnuchin.  16 years at Goldman Sachs...16 years as a Wall Street insider at one of the most corrupt banking corporations which crippled the US in '07 and caused the very money crunch that Trump has referenced at every turn to fire up the working class.  How exactly can Trump supporters still claim Trump is the anti-corruption candidate with a Cabinet containing Steve Mnuchin at the head of the Treasury?  It's fucking insane.

       Well, you have to assess for yourself if you think they are for the people. The guy is lowering taxes on the rich. Experts say he will make inequality much worse and make the economy worse. Experts also say that Hillary's economic plans would be much better "for the people." Meanwhile, she has the environmental policy that is "for the people" too, and so many other policies that are for the people.

       So if you just objectively look at the two candidates, it's pretty clear that Hillary's policies are more for the people.

       It is more along the lines, that the_donald has been cherry picking what the want to push from this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The posters around here don't push other subs agendas, from what I can see, obviously some false narratives will make there way in. However, the good posters here research what they want to investigate and provide their own sources. With the last place they would ever need to rely on for information being   R/the_donald.

       At the same time, however, you need proof. Our country was founded upon the principle of innocent until proven guilty. Punishing someone you "know" is guilty by fabricating evidence or charging them anyway without evidence is a slippery slope to a dictatorship.

       Clinton brought it up during the debates (and in her speeches), but there was no point in making it a question. If it were a question, the answers would have been a detailed plan from Clinton, and Trump saying it's a Chinese hoax to hurt or economy, so the moderator's would have been attacked for asking such "biased" questions.

       We know he can't, it's just the fact that he wanted to. It's not so much the things he wants to do that are dangerous because he'd have to do gymnastics for most of it, but it's his rhetoric and what it incites from many of his followers that is dangerous.

       Snopes references an interview with Lieutenant General Vernon Kondra, retired Air force.  Here's the description with background from Snopes, with his words in quotes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are several references to a 1990-91 contract for Trump Shuttle to carry personnel across the United States, between the East and West Coasts, on a standard LaGuardia-Dover-Charleston-Travis-Chord-Kelly-Dover-LaGuardia run.
       </p>
       <p>
        "It worked very well, and the crews loved it, and really thought that we'd done something special for them," Kondra recalled in the oral history. "It was a helluva lot better than using 141s [cargo craft], which we could use for something else."
       </p>
       <p>
        But Kondra said that the notion that Trump personally arranged to help the stranded soldiers made little sense. "I certainly was not aware of that. It does not sound reasonable that it would happen like that. It would not fit in with how we did business. I don't even know of how he would have known there was a need."
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Yeah I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but every time I watched his shows it felt like I was watching a trailer for a horror movie.  It just feels slimy and sleezy to watch.  Lurid, but not in a good way.

       I mean, he said that he would do them, so I think it's less reasonable to think that he wouldn't.

       Knowing how he is prone to changing opinions at the behest of a crowd though, makes one doubt every word he says.  It's like he was a politician all along.

       I think you hit the nail on the head with hopelessness/helplessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it might be a little bit more than that, though.  I feel like when people listen to Alex Jones spitting all over the mic, they think, "Wow, this guy is really fighting for me, I guess I can keep going to my 9-5 job and drink myself to sleep every night.  No need to protest, this guy has it covered."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like they're fulfilling their urges to do something by just listening to a guy lose his shit over it.  Very similarly to the way that people will like a cause on Facebook, and then consider that their public service for the year.  Giving yourself the illusion of giving a damn.

       There was a time about 15 years ago that I thought Alex Jones was speaking truth to power. His appearance in the Richard Linklater film, Waking Life, was electrifying to hear as a 16 year old beginning to question the system. It was what first put him on my radar and I started listening to his radio program so after seeing the movie. This was around 2002-2003. For a while, he seemed like he was dead right about a ton of stuff - 9/11, Iraq, Bush war crimes, mass government surveillance, police militarization etc.  Sure he was bombastic and over the top sometimes but that's why I loved him. He was nothing if not passionate and I felt like his passion was well deserved and I wished more people got as fired up about the real things as he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then...something changed. Admittedly, I stopped listening to him as much as I got busier with life post-college. Then I see him start popping up in random youtube videos here and there a few years ago and he just looks unhinged and almost like a caricature of his old self. It's hard to describe but it just looked staged or something. And now this election cycle I see that he's got all his weight behind Donald Trump?! This is the same guy that I used to hear losing his mind when George W. Bush talked about how much easier things would be if the US was a dictatorship? He's putting his support behind a guy who routinely praises strong men and has an Authoritarian bent like no one else we've seen in recent history? It just doesn't gel with who he used to be and what he used to stand for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm left to come to one of two conclusions: 1) Alex Jones has officially lost his mind or 2) Alex Jones is being used as a puppet by the very people he used to warn all of us about. I am inclined to think it's #1. But #2 is also an intriguing option and not one I had never considered before. I remember even thinking during the early days about how much more on edge I was and angry I was and then hopeless I felt after listening to 3 hours of Alex rail on and on about how fucked we were getting by the Elites that I actually started to think "what if Alex is just a stooge put here to fill us with terror and half truths and distractions?" I dunno, it's like some one else said, it's almost like a conspiracy-ception! I dismissed the notion back then, and today I still feel like the simpler answer is probably true - after walking a razors edge for so long, he just ain't right in the head any more.

       sorry for any typos, kind of rambled more than I thought I was going to when I started.

       I don't know if Jones was actually put there on purpose, but that's definitely the niche he fills. When people start to sense things aren't right, when they start wanting to dig a little deeper, there's Alex Jones ready to baffle them with bullshit and leave them more confused than when they started (and sell them a little silver bullion and fluoride filters while they're on his website).

       Let me re-phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof has a place and the culprit should always be held accountable. But sometimes a lack of evidence makes this impossible. In the case of Hillary Clinton for example with her aides deliberately colluding with the DNC to discredit Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should Hillary Clinton, who benefited extremely from this subversion not be punished? It was her aides who did this but does she hold no responsibility for this travesty whatsoever? I don't believe so. Sure the specific aides who engaged in this should be prosecuted.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why shouldn't she be punished as well?????

       It's interesting how you hate on any Trump supporter yet you whine about how Trump "hates" certain people. Your opinion is clearly so biased and ingrained that there is no hope in helping you to become a more tolerant and accepting person.

       You're talking about a level of fraud that includes a tiny number of people on both sides who voted twice. This is about using the entire voter rolls to delete millions of voters.

       The kind of fraud you're talking about is completely trivial relative to this kind of systematic fraud.

       I don't think he's a puppet just a useful snakes oil salesman. His end game seems to just be pushing super pills. I think the elites have fully taken up the ideology of crisis politics. Don't make long term plans just wait for the next problem and exploit it.

       Agreed. Thing I hate about Alex is that yes, he dives into some theories and gets tot he bottom, but then he goes off on a crazy rant about fish controlling the ocean water or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is controlled opposition. He will give you just enough then stop and say something totally bat shit crazy that discredits himself. Kind of reminds me of old Glenn beck. He was on to some stuff then went off the deep end.

       Completely agreed.  I used to watch Alex Jones back in the 2000s and while I occasionally could tellhe was going way too far out on a limb, I at least thought he was trying to fight the good fight even if he was occasionally(often?) misinformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now?  Eh. At best he's a peddler of goods who uses fear mongering to increase his sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Alex Jones was who he presents himself to be, going after people as powerful as he presents them to be..  why has he not died of a heart attack or suspicious robbery or something by now?

       Yeah, was up at 3am for that trip, it was crazy.  Actually I can't verify the sushi was truly just off the boat lol, but it was just down the street, so we made assumptions ;-)
Worst part of Tokyo sushi is knowing it doesn't exist in the US :_(

       It's not humor anymore when it turns into into a real and systematic way of obstructing any critic against Trump, banning any one who dissent from the "Trump is perfect" narrative, and drowning any critic of him with whataboutism (But HRC did this, HRC is gone, so now you guys have to find other ways to defend him) and insults.
It's also telling that a lot of Trump supporters like you don't feel confortable when they are in another sub when their lord and savior can be criticized, they are too used to their safe space.

       They've gone full blown SJW. They've even created a safe space for themselves over on 8/pol/ and anyone that tries to bring in any type of wrong think is banned instantly. They're all completely unaware of how much of a joke they are and it's honestly pretty hilarious. They even play the victim card constantly and have threads about how people attack them for being Trump supporters or about how the world is against them. They're lack of self awareness in regards to how they've become the very thing that they criticize other groups like SJWs for being is probably worthy of a good case study.

       OK. Let me tell about myself , since you were being so kind in sharing your place and view of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in Serbia, it's in eastern europe and was until 1991 a part of a country called Yugoslavia. Look into Josip Broz Tito (who was our 'marchall' and a socialist dictator) and look into the making of Non-Aligned Movement. I'm 43yr white male. When I was born , our country experienced major economic boost , coming from a int.loan , but economy was so blooming it was easily payed off. There are some analysis that citizens of Yugoslavia actually felt and made up to 50% more money / consumer power (?) in the small period of 2 years. At that time 1973 - 75,6 . Now comes 1980 and our beloved dictator dies of old age (had a one of the largest funerals in history - by foreign delegation attendance, look it up, too). It took about 10 years for shit to hits the fan and nationalism to start blooming (YU consisted of 6 republics and about 8 major nations: Slovenians, Croats, Muslims, Serbs, Macedonians, Montenegrians, Kosovo-albanians, and some Hungarians) I'm a minor minority nation, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, with incentives from Western Europe (EU Union in forming) and NATO in forming, Slovenia and Croatia decides to secede. All hell breaks loose, 'cause Croatia had about 15% of Serbs living in it, they wanted to keep living in Yugoslavia. Also , they remembered 2nd WW , when Croats had a strong fascist movement of Ustasha. 
Western world allies Croatia to secede , war starts, first Croatia, then Bosnia, then Kosovo. Serbia are bad guys , all the time. 
In retrospective, the reason for this was always the way of independence and non-aligment being rooted very strong in Serbia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically , western europe, USA, and NATO helped very much for a country of 20 million same language speaking , with strong independence movement, strong economy and strong army, to fall apart to 7 small , nationalistic countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       In comes EU and USA to buy all the good industrial resources, and make us work like slaves for a small vage for them. Divide &amp; rule. 
My country - Serbia was made to look like it's full of villains (look up some holiwood movies) , savages and nationalistic retards. 
And it was made to look like that - by American Democrats. 
When in fact, the only countries that were accepted into EU were Slovenia and Croatia, countries that are almost purely ethnically clean. (Look up Croatia - operation Storm / Oluja , which made almost all Serbs to flee to Serbia , 10% of Croatia population) Oh, that made with a help of NATO and USA liberals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros all the way involved in 'making of these civil societies'. Fact. 
Comes a 1999 and a Kosovo problem , long in waiting, since Serbs and Kosovars had their share of disputes. Again, with the incentives from the West, Kosovo demands indipendence (how lucky for USA that it has some major mining grounds and resources to serve in next 50 years). Liberal politics from USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here comes the first european bombing of independant country since the 2ndWW.  That bombing of Serbia could've easily instigated 3rdWW if the Russia was strong as it is now. Luckily for Serbia (which is to 'blame' for all wars ever (look up 'Gavrilo Princip')) , it did not grow into major world conflict. 
Kosovo albanians payed of their debt to western world by being a major drug trafficing country, and with an illegal trade of people and organs (look-up 'Organ theft in Kosovo , Yellow house')
      </p>
      <p>
       Comes 2000, and we were overthrowing our 'dictator' Milosevic (who , by the way , wasn't at all nationalist, but more of a socialist with a strong non-nationalistic view for Serbia) , and happily run into this 'Brave new world' of freedom and democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, 16 years later, we are still waiting to be accepted to European Union, still getting lectured of democracy, still being called savages (by England and USA, most prominently) , and with having now a gullible , easily manipulated (from West) goverment. Still waiting for a better pay , better life, better day. I am a minor minority in Serbia, never had a single nationalistic problem in life, live in a city that has the most variants of religions and churches, probably in the whole eastern europe (see 'Novi Sad' it's a beautiful city - chosen to be Cultural capital of Europe for 2020.) , still waiting to not be called 'savage' by the western societies.
Here is an example of a City sign in my neighbour, written in six languages ... it was always like this here where I live.

       </a>
       Savage , isn't it ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm seeing a major influx of Syrian , Iraq, Afganistan refugess , passing through my country and city , going to EU to seek a better life. Every day. Croatia and Hungary (both part of EU) had built their walls already, they did not need Trump for that.

       So, all I can think when looking at american liberals protest against Trump is this: even though your purpose and goal is credible and worth fighting for, you people live in the bubble and not seeing that Democrats and liberals with a MAJOR HELP of Soros and so called 'open societies' are actually blackmailing and destroing countries , inventing wars to sell arms and take resources.
And your protests against Trump are used, organized, or helped by some major villains, as seen throughout the world. Well, if you don't chill and learn about what's going on, you will now see the same shit that I in the Serbia, some dude in Iraq, Libya, Sirya , and Ukraine were seeing all these years.  Maybe it's for the best. Maybe you need a rude awakening.

       His refusal to put his business in a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       blind trust, his refuse to disclose his tax returns, and his seeking security clearances for his kids are far greater conflicts of interest than anything Clinton has been accused of. He's surrounding himself with the very people he said he'll remove from Washington. He's been going around in interviews walking all of his promises back -- the wall, repealing Obamacare, everything. He's not going to do a single thing he campaigned on. He'll spend the next 4 years being an establishment pawn. And you're still going to be roaming these subs, still finding
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       new crazy way to defend him.

       Because, really, you've become what you once criticized -- blind group-thinkers, useful idiots being manipulated by the elite.

       Certainly not alone in the Universe, and whether or not we're alone in this solar system is absolutely up for debate. I didn't want to lump those three things together. I hold UFOlogy in high regard. I'm not a believer in any one theory but I've seen and heard enough to be convinced that
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       is going on.

       Single error? Your posts were riddled with them, which is why I said anything at all. There were multiple points I made originally that you did not even acknowledge.

        Donald Trump has lined up three New York hedge funds, including money from billionaire George Soros, to invest $160 million in his Chicago skyscraper, a key piece in perhaps the largest construction financing in the city's history, according to real estate sources and public documents.

       The best description I heard of Alex Jones is "a humble water filter salesman." By being as loud and voracious as possible, and fear mongering the populace, you can get them to trust you, and once you have trust, you have the sale.

       lol I clearly made you angry. Sorry your guy didn't win. Bannon is in the WH whether you like it or not, snowflake. It's hilarious you attack anyone who disagrees with you, even Milo. I guess because he's not a democrat he's not gay enough for you? The only intolerant people left in this country are Libs like you :) and just for your information, the prime minister of Israel even commented that he looks forward to working with Bannon.
