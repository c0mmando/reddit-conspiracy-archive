       I sit here after the last month, even the last year of ups, downs and and blindsides of what is going on in our country, America. Some things make sense, many things do not however I know my own heart and the heart and spirit of those around me and around our great country and the thing that brings me the most hope is, We are Good.
      </p>
      <p>
       On more than a few evenings, myself (a 50+ white male) and my immediate neighbor (a 60+ African American male) share beers and discuss what we have seen, how our world is in need, and how we think and feel it needs to heal.  Do we agree?  Often we do, occasionally we do not, however our mutual respect prevents us from hatred, in actuality, we take pride in the fact we can embrace our differences and learn through each others eyes not accepting the values and ideas projected on us at mere face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       We both read, listen, and watch, the media around us and we decipher the truths for ourselves.
Sharing the views from our years of experience from one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I ask of all of you, a very small request, take a few moments.
Not to discover what you are spoon fed but to look inside and see who you are.
Are you one who hates your neighbor, wishing them harm, or would you prefer they care about the safety of your neighborhood, your family, and the general welfare of your local community knowing that if the latter is true they show you the same respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are turbulent times, jobs questionable, many not knowing if they can feed not only themselves but their families.  I was recently told myself that my job no longer exists after New Years Eve and I will enter 2017 unemployed.  I’m worried and I find myself entering our holiday season with little prospect.  I raise my head up, not because of a politician or a changing of the guard in Washington, but because I am an American.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m a part of this great melting pot of cultures, bringing together ideals from around the world to create a mutual dream.  If you prefer to burn flags and riot in the streets I do not stand with you nor does any of my inner or even my outer circle of friend, and neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is no manifesto, nor is it a cry out for help, it is a viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you feel it doesn’t deserve respect or your time, feel free to disregard it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a voice calling out, and there is a chorus ready to join in and move forward. 
We would like you to join us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are the watchers, It doesn’t matter who sits in the big chair, our eyes, and ears are on them, and they always will be.  We must choose, as one, if we move forward or allow ourselves to be pawns on their chessboard.

       I think most American's don't talk politics with their neighbors let alone with people from different back grounds like you do. It has been pushed so hard for so long that talking  about sex, religion and politics is a social no no. But I believe that the core of all the tensions felt in the last 8 years stem from those three topics. If people took more time to learn about different ways of life and how in the grand scheme of things most stuff really isn't that big of a deal.

       This sub and reddit as a whole to an extent gives us access to unfiltered views and a forum where we can discuss our differences. I think we do a pretty good job of it, especially in the last year since
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       stood strong while other subs faltered and had agendas pushed.

       I felt slightly uncomfortable butting in on a coworker's conversation today just to comment but they were talking about the protests so I had to. Turns out, they were right with me that the media is driving people completely insane and the reaction is far over the top. I think this cycle may have planted the seed for many people to finally reject the usual suspects.

       it's been so obvious for so long it was bound to happen. looking back on the last 16 years compared to the previous years the major difference you have is social media. TPTB have used it as their greatest weapon to influence public perception.

       We, all of us, Americans or not, are surrounded by "rabbit holes" we can explore them however they all have their darkness and some are best left avoided and we must trust that the goodness we know of ourselves exists in many around us that have the power to counter it, since alone we do not.  We are in a world of distrust, and will never move forward until we can change that.

       My bloodline leans more towards the native Shaman traditions, not of any religion but respectful of all, more a philosophy.  If we cannot heal ourself or our brothers and sisters, and those closest to us, how can we heal a world?

       However, all things must end, even their game.  Eventually, something will come along that is more powerful than they are and they will lose.  When that will be and what form it will take, well, that's another story.

       I felt slightly uncomfortable butting in on a coworker's conversation today just to comment but they were talking about the protests so I had to. Turns out, they were right with me that the media is driving people completely insane and the reaction is far over the top. I think this cycle may have planted the seed for many people to finally reject the usual suspects.
