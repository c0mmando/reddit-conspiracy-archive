    <div class="md"><p>Those &quot;splinter subs&quot; tend to die out pretty fast... granted, <a href="/r/hillaryforprison">/r/hillaryforprison</a> has had a good run... but Soros doesn&#39;t have the same mass name recognition, nor does he have a public media presence the way that she did, so idk. </p>

<p>I feel like stacking posts here in subs that are already active has the best shot at getting traction until the movement is closer to a tidal wave.</p>

<p>Move all activity to a small sub too soon and it won&#39;t get the exposure it needs to become a groundswell movement. That&#39;s just my opinion though. </p>

<p>Understand that Soros, like the real owners of this country, are flagless, nationless, and soulless. He has worked with Red Team and Blue Team. Going after Soros is taking advil for cancer.</p>

<p>There really is no easy-to-digest information about him - but if I had to say something I&#39;d say:</p>

<p>The real problem is Zionism. When you find out how many people in national and international governments are Zionists and Jewish, then you will start to get the picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Expose 911.</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick, the Israelis blew holes in the WTC using explosives, then used CG to add planes to the footage taken of the explosions.</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p><a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207</a></p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report</a></p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a></p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html</a></p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>Soros organisations in question that were added to Russia&#39;s stop list:</p>

<p>-Open Society Foundation</p>

<p>-Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation (OSI Assistance Foundation)</p>

<p>They&#39;re like a cancer spreading everywhere actively engaged in subverting governments. The Russian&#39;s outside of their borders are most concerned with Soros in Central Asia and Caucasus and the Balkens. </p>

<p>The spider web is vast and truly global in scale. You may need an extra lifetime to fully get to the bottom of this particular cesspit.</p>

<p>He does it via manipulating policy using think tanks, NGOs that organise chaos on the ground like faking protests and false flag events, rigging elections, by stock/ property/ currency market manipulation, or getting subverted governments to do his dirty work for him. </p>

<p>TL:DR The real life version of Blofeld from the bond movies but much more successful and much more evil.</p>
