        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t want to be registered in some database, maybe even have a little badge stitched to my clothes or tattoed on my arms.</p>

<p>How is it that these fascistic signs of tyranny are completely glossed over or haphazardly justified? What scares me is not so much Trump himself, but how people react to the idea of alienating an entire subset of Americans just because of their muslim faith.</p>

<p>Completely ridiculous. I tell my kids not to be bullies, but then you have someone running the office that has thrown multiple categories of people under the bus in order to get what he wants. And this guy would not accept the results of the election, unless it was in his favor. What does that tell you about his character?</p>

<p>Now Trump, the business man he is, also has a pragmatic side to him, in which he pedaled back on some of the groups he attacked, but I have yet to see any form of reconciliation towards the muslims in America. The void that is left is painfully obvious to the global community, so much that the Israeli opressors are ready to hasten their structural genocide of Palestine given the recent remarks of their right-wing government.</p>

<p>In the end the people get the leader they deserve, I just wish that the consequences of the choices they make would not end up in so much suffering of the innocent. Clinton, being a lesser evil in some regards, would probably uphold the current status quo, which is &quot;good enough&quot; considering the volatile alternative that is Trump . In my opinion, the most competent and fair leader to be president would have been Ron Paul given his genuine desire to make America great again.</p>

<p>In the end the question remains, how would a muslim survive America the next 4 years? What are your opinions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of buzzwords being thrown around in this thread. Radical islam, fundamental islam..</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the difference. What <em>is</em> radical islam? And how can I have ties to a religion that is by definition ephemeral? </p>

<p>Do you mean ties to terrorist organisations? Because that is very different language and much more concrete. </p>

<p>I feel that these buzzwords create a disconnect, fueled by ignorance in which &#39;anything&#39; a muslim says or does is radical. It reminds me of a youtube video in which an Arab business man was taken down by a swat team, because hey, he is muslim, therefore radical?</p>

<p>I have met, seen and spoken to thousands of muslims, how can you help me identify a &#39;radical&#39; muslim?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What is radical islam?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My definition of pathological Islam:-</p>

<p>a}  It does not recognise individual consent.  Either a person becomes a Muslim or is put to death; that is the choice in front of him.  I know not all of you do this, and most of you probably do not; but some do.</p>

<p>b}  It primarily propagates itself via death in general terms.  Again, you either become a Muslim or you are killed, and you are killed if you leave Islam.</p>

<p>c}  It insists on imposing the Sharia legal system on entire societies, including non-Muslims.</p>

<p>d}  It refuses to recognise the spiritual legitimacy, or basic right to exist, of literally anything or anyone that is not explicitly Islamic.  Radical Muslims are like the Daleks; they want to destroy everything which is not culturally or religiously part of Islam.</p>

<p>e}  Wherever radical Islam goes, an increase in rape statistics follows.  Islamic male refugees have been heard making statements that they travelled to Europe specifically with the objective of raping European women.</p>

<p>Again, I know that the majority of you are good people.  A problematic minority does, however, genuinely exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Muslims and all americans are welcome to help denounce the foreign enemies, the soros army, in the united states, reject soros, reject terrorism and be smarter than the bigots who with their bigotry undermine the battle against soros and terrorism, trumps statements were against the american system of failed vetting, not against all muslims, he knows that terrorism can disrupt the transition from foreign controlled oligarchy to freedom so he wanted to have a new vetting system in place, help us become free of this foreign controlled oligarchy and then america will be better on the world stage and not a belligerent as it has been for 40 years of infiltrated oligarchy.  Fear not, it is not out of bigotry that trump spoke or will speak, he is trying to secure a nation while overcoming the oligarchy at the same time, muslims and all americans can help, love one another as you would love yourselves.</p>

America doesn&#39;t have a cookie cutter person of how they should look. So you should not pass judgement on a fellow American who happens to be part of a certain religion.
Americans are not just white.
Americans are white black brown, people who don&#39;t wear a lot of clothing, people who wear little to no clothing, people who are straight, gay, bisexuals,  people who are Christian,  Jewish Muslim and people who do not believe in God.

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. We have seen it recently happening in Tunisia, in which Tunisia&#39;s governing Islamist party voluntarily stepped down because it no longer represented the people it was governing. It goes to show that the islamic religion is not out on conquest for worldy power, but for a better position in the hereafter. </p>

<p>I think you should add that nuance to your image you hold of muslims. Furthermore, a government or ruling party is <strong>not</strong> a religion. Muslims are not all Saudi-Arabians, nor are all Saudi-Arabians muslims. How the people wish to be governed is up to them, they will make errors just like the American government does. </p>

<p>I disagree. But I would like to hear your reasoning behind it why you think America is better than 95% of the world out there.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think you have a rather disturbed idea of what the fundamentals of Islam are about. These are fundamentals:</p>

America is a country of immigrants and the problem is that there is a fear that white supremacy will go down as non white people repopulate and there are different colours and religions that can one day have the same power that a typical white male has</p>

<p>That is a rather omnious threat. You justify the idea that muslims should get the nazi treatment. You also seem to identify yourself as Israeli, rather than American given the response you radiate. So I am mystified why you believe to represent American interests. Is it perhaps that you feel threatened by this thread that you feel like you should represent America <em>for</em> the Americans, despite your fascist Israeli colors showing through?</p>

<p>That’s one thing on which Christians and Muslims can agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish to directly refute Mr. Shoenfeld’s claim that I “cast aspersions on American Jews.” I do not cast aspersions; I forthrightly damn, and pray that God damns, any American–Jew, Catholic, Evangelical, Irish, German, Hindu, or otherwise–who flogs the insane idea that American and Israeli interests are one and the same. The nation-state of Israel is an intolerable burden to the treasury and security of the United States, and Washington’s current relationship with Israel–sanctioned by the AIPAC-funded political leaders of both parties–is one of several factors that are leading to full-scale American participation in other peoples’ religious wars. <strong>– Dr. Michael Scheuer</strong>, former CIA chief, head of the Osama bid Laden unit, in <em>The Anti-Americanism of the Israel-Firsters</em></p>

<p>The best part about judaism is that they’re told by their elders that everyone on earth wants to commit genocide on them, and therefore they HAVE to lie, cheat, steal, rape, kill, torture, and debase all goyim to prevent it from happening… except those actions are exactly why we want to do it in the first place.

<p>Those are Arab or Asian nations with each one their own individual government and policies. The demographic is muslim and therefore of similar faith like mine. It&#39;s like asking blue eyed Africans to migrate to Switzerland and live there, that kind of logic is ridicilous. Realistically, you are basically paving the way for muslim-only neigbourhoods, just like Jews were &#39;concentrated&#39; in a single area during the Nazi era. The more you talk, the more disturbing similarities you display.</p>

<p>Every muslim in the world knows atleast 3 or 4 chapters of the Quran. It is an ancient custom to memorize the Quran, practiced by hundreds of millions around the globe each day. But given your ignorance around islam and us muslims you are showcasing, I can understand your disbelief.</p>

<p>I distance myself from your view of Judaism, it is an ancient Abrhamic religion that has been practiced in peace by many Jews all over the world for many generations. Just like muslims and christians peacefully practice theirs. What you are probably referring to is the rather modern ideology that is <em>zionism</em>, developed by the right-wing Talmudic elite. That is <em>very</em> different from Judaism on itself. But one cannot deny that there is a correlation between Judaism and zionism, most Jews support an Israeli state and are at peace with the structural genocide on the muslims and christians on Palestinian soil. I believe it will worsen under the Trump administration, just remember that God sees everything, and e is the Almighty.</p>
