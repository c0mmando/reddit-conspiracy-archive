    <div class="md"><p>i think the people at the top know how history rhymes, but they would feel awkward trying to explain it, we can play a role in the education of the populace via twitter, facebook etc, based on the 240 year cycle of history we can provide a map for our arguments and education going forward.  Through our intellect we can achieve our country&#39;s freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a start, but I feel it will take more than intellect alone.  It will take great wisdom as well - which is not entirely the same thing.  Intellect is intelligence.  Wisdom is knowing how to use and apply that intelligence, which many of us don&#39;t know how regardless of how &quot;smart&quot; we are.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He funds the DNC.  50 million people voted for the DNC candidate.  You are going to have to convince 50 MILLION people that they have been fooled, lied to and manipulated their entire lives and everything they have ever believed in has been wrong.</p>

<p>Good luck with that.  I have experience in this area and I promise, very few will take the red pill.</p>

<p>Therefore, Soros will always have supporters here. He will always have people he can manipulate and that will riot and wage war for him.</p>
