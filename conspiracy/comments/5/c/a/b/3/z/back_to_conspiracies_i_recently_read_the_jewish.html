       but that does not, in any way, shape, or form, prove that the holocaust didn't happen.  If anything, that could be psyop disinfo and no little old lady ever went to jail.  (I see the article--I've seen it before---but until I see pictures of her behind bars, it's just an article...and even if she did go to jail, it doesn't prove that the holocaust happened...it just proves that the libtards have control.)

      <p>
       I guess my point is that millions of people died in a labor camp, in Auschwitz, under Nazi rule, and the majority of them were Jewish.
Kind of seems like a bad thing to happen to people, no? Maybe seems a little disrespectful and ignorant of their suffering to say that it was all a hoax? Maybe also seems like spreading such an absurd and distasteful notion with impunity and self-righteousness would damage not only the feelings of the survivors' descendants, but also the impression other people form of you? no?

       I'm a huge fan of the rich man's trick video if that's what you're talking about.  But that video doesn't go into the holocaust as much as it does the JFK assassination, which was the best part.  Have you even watched TGSNT yet?

       The hoax part is the gas chambers, revisionists as far as I know do not argue about the existence of labor camps and the death of a whole lot of people including Jews (but also Gypsies, homosexuals, foreigners...)

       Yeah I'm fine with that, but it's the same thing as calling 9/11 a hoax or a fraud and completely leaving out any overtones of sadness for those who were affected directly.  It's ignorant, and doing it in a self-righteous tone (which it so often is) is infuriating to see.

       Once you accept that Oswiecim became a labor camp used for mining coal for the Nazi's, doing so under the direction of the American Nazi's running the show, then you'll start to understand how this "hoax" business is at best inaccurate.

       Growing up in Willowdale ON as a kid, a lot of elderly jews had number tatoos. If this is some sort of conspiracy, either it fooled them too or number tatoos were the shitty tribal tatoos of the '30s and '40s.

       Nobody disputes that the Nazis persecuted the Jews and other minority ethnic groups (gypsies), political (communist) or other groups (freemasons, homosexuals). Nobody disputes that the Nazis arrested and sent large numbers of them to forced labour camps where prisoners were given ID tatoos. Nobody disputes that towards the end of the war (when the Allies cut off German food supplies) tens or hundreds of thousands died of starvation in the camps and from diseases like Typhus.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is no evidence that Hitler, or the Nazi High command ever gave the order for a Final Solution, and neither is there any document demonstrating that a plan existed to terminate all Jews, or any documentary or physical proof whatsoever that any concentration camps had "gas chambers" for killing humans. Neither did the Nazis make lampshades from human skin or produce soap from rendered human fat.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is denied is the term "holocaust" - it wasn't used during the war to explain the plight of Jewish labour camp inmates, or indeed until many years after the war. Neither Churchill, Roosevelt, de Gaulle or Stalin ever mentioned the word in the media or their writings - it only became a buzzword as late as the 1970s. The word itself means "burnt offering". Odd, don't you think? Until you understand that according to the Torah, before the Jews could return to the Promised Land, 6 million would have to "disappear". The narrative of the gas chambers and the crematoria served that purpose, and as a result the state of Israel was created and gifted to the Jews by the UN in 1948 (as per the promise made by Lord Balfour).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, whilst a very significant number of European Jews perished during WW2, the Jewish death toll was nowhere near 6 million (which, as I already mentioned was a pre-selected or "typological" number with a special significance for zionists). In fact it was almost certainly less than 10% of this figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holocaust revisionism is about revealing the historical truth behind the Holocaust, and demonstrating that the currently accepted narrative is based on many falsehoods and gross exaggerations.

       don't think what? they were spongers? i never knew them so i don't know but a roughly tattoo'd number on their arm proves very little. it certainly doesn't prove the camps were death camps. for one thing if they were, why are they still alive?

       I'm pretty sure most information these days is a psyop/counter-psyop.  They are trying to strengthen the anti-Zionist narrative with this one.  Watch the clips of the holocaust and tell me whether they look fake to you or not.

       I guess my point is that millions of people died in a labor camp, in Auschwitz, under Nazi rule, and the majority of them were Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of seems like a bad thing to happen to people, no?  Maybe seems a little disrespectful and ignorant of their suffering to say that it was all a hoax?  Maybe also seems like spreading such an absurd and distasteful notion with impunity and self-righteousness would damage not only the feelings of the survivors' descendants, but also the impression other people form of you?  no?

       There's a whole lot more footage than that.  There is a lot footage of emaciated people.  Does it need to have been an extermination for you to feel sympathy?  If there was no extermination but they used that narrative to secure Isreal, does it change the suffering of the individuals?  Does one more rich man's lie really make you resent an entire race of people for it?

       That's fine, but to some extent, saying there was no holocaust is like saying that blacks were never slaves in America because so many black people are doing well now.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a big difference between saying something is a hoax and saying that it has been used as propaganda.  You can make the argument that the holocaust was used as propaganda.  You cannot make the argument that it was a hoax (nor should you feel comfortable doing so).

       Lol, the German concentration camps had better conditions than any other actor in the war. They were not worked to death. They died from typhus and starvation mainly towards the end of the war once the allies had bombed all the supply routes. No supply routes=No food, no medicine. You can blame the allies for their fate.

       Guys... holocaust was and never will be a Hoax. I have been in Dachau, i have been in Auschwitz. This thing is terrible and it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       One can argue it wasn't 6 million , maybe just 5 million or maybe 7 million. That is not the point to hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know for sure, and this is what you have to fully understand, how this machine of killing started, evolved and operated to its full extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we know this you may ask? Because germans were very sophisticated in bookkeeping in Numbers! This terrible machine is very well documented from the selection of the detainees ( blood lines, cranial or nose inspection, feet and such ) to the transport ( which detainee goes were, family ties and stuff), to the records of each detainees performance( hours worked, tortures, medical records, attempted escapes...) and the orders given whom to kill, when and how.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all led to the Nuremberg trials... not because someone thought it was nice to stage... the allies found all this evidence, secured it and took care that no culprit can burn the papers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have to agree with some of you in one point: Indeed in Germany it is not allowed to deny the holocaust, this is correct. Due to demands of free speech i would like to see that gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine yourself, sitting at the bar, someone walks up to you, has a small talk with you... and somehow you get the notion that this dude is denying the holocaust... i would accept his free speech, despite having a different opinion. Because he instantly paid a price to get laughed at..
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my 2 cents

       Nobody disputes that the Nazis persecuted the Jews and other minority ethnic groups (gypsies), political (communist) or other groups (freemasons, homosexuals). Nobody disputes that the Nazis arrested and sent large numbers of them to forced labour camps where prisoners were given ID tatoos. Nobody disputes that towards the end of the war (when the Allies cut off German food supplies) tens or hundreds of thousands died of starvation in the camps and from diseases like Typhus.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is no evidence that Hitler, or the Nazi High command ever gave the order for a Final Solution, and neither is there any document demonstrating that a plan existed to terminate all Jews, or any documentary or physical proof whatsoever that any concentration camps had "gas chambers" for killing humans. Neither did the Nazis make lampshades from human skin or produce soap from rendered human fat.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is denied is the term "holocaust" - it wasn't used during the war to explain the plight of Jewish labour camp inmates, or indeed until many years after the war. Neither Churchill, Roosevelt, de Gaulle or Stalin ever mentioned the word in the media or their writings - it only became a buzzword as late as the 1970s. The word itself means "burnt offering". Odd, don't you think? Until you understand that according to the Torah, before the Jews could return to the Promised Land, 6 million would have to "disappear". The narrative of the gas chambers and the crematoria served that purpose, and as a result the state of Israel was created and gifted to the Jews by the UN in 1948 (as per the promise made by Lord Balfour).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, whilst a very significant number of European Jews perished during WW2, the Jewish death toll was nowhere near 6 million (which, as I already mentioned was a pre-selected or "typological" number with a special significance for zionists). In fact it was almost certainly less than 10% of this figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holocaust revisionism is about revealing the historical truth behind the Holocaust, and demonstrating that the currently accepted narrative is based on many falsehoods and gross exaggerations.
