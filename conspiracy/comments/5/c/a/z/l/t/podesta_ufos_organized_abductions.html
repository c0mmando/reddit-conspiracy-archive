<p><strong>PODESTA IS POSSIBLY HEAVILY INVOLVED with CHILD TRAFFICKING + AND RITUALISTIC PEDO SHIT</strong></p>

<p>Spirit cooking / Pizza-Pedoesta-Gate etc...</p>

<p><strong>PODESTA IS A LEADING UFO EXPERT AND SUPPOSEDLY WORKS WITHIN A SHADOW GOVERNMENT</strong> 
He has several times attempted to release UFO files saying &quot;America was ready for the Truth&quot;</p>

<p><strong>COMMUNION THE MOVIE + THE LIGHT WANDS IN KIM NOBLE&#39;s ART</strong></p>

<p><em>look at this picture and video clip from the abduction scene in the movie COMMUNION:</em></p>

<p><em>NOW look at these 2 works by the child abuse victim artist Kim Noble:</em> </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t seen this amazing movie or read the book Communion based on Whitley Strieber&#39;s real life accounts, then you are missing out.   In the movie the Aliens use a wand type device to control the human. I saw this SAME device in Kim Noble&#39;s artwork. The beings holding the wands look tall and slim, and one seems to be teleporting or translucent </p>

<p>(Kim&#39;s art was found being used for concert poster for a show at Comet Pizza) created by Sasha Lord Present who works with Comet)<br/>
<a href="http://www.sashalordpresents.com/poster-art/">http://www.sashalordpresents.com/poster-art/</a> </p>

<p><strong>ARE THESE CHILD ABDUCTIONS ACTUALLY BEING USED AS OFFERINGS TO ALIENS AS A FORM OF PAGAN RITUAL SACRIFICE??</strong></p>

<p><strong>IS THE SATAN THING A COVER FOR SOMETHING EVEN DARKER AND MORE SINISTER INVOLVING ALIENS??</strong></p>

<p><strong>IS THE WAND AN ALIEN MKULTRA MIND CONTROL DEVICE ?</strong></p>

<p><strong>HAVE I GONE OFF THE DEEP END??</strong></p>

<p>THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS</p>

<p>(YES I READ CHARIOTS TO THE GODS - YES I BELIEVE HUMANS  ARE IN CONTACT WITH ALIENS - I BELIEVE ALL RELIGIONS AND GODS ARE BASED ON OUR TRUE STORY OF HUMANS BEING LEFT HERE BY ALIEN OR BEING A DESCENDANT OF THEM)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The aliens in Communion are fictional representations of the people that actually used the &quot;wand&quot; device on children. </p>

<p>The UFO stuff in the Podesta emails should actually be more alarming because it points to some of these emails potentially being part of psyops unrelated to Podesta and his pizza parties. </p>

<p>My guess, Project Blue Beam predictive programming. Which makes me question how many other things in the Podesta emails are fake/misdirection topics to distract people.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but its not crazy to think that information about Ayy lmao are put out into the public domain as misinformation. Because in order for the conspiracy minded people to believe a Project Blue Beam type event, then they would need a paper trail of alien/UFO documents to reinforce the potentially spectacular and fabricated events to come. And whats more effective than to have someone who is high-up and well connected discussing it in correspondence with others.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Podesta and friends are LARPing and wanted it to leak so the public will believe it when project blue beam shit is pulled off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, and I realized recently that same shit is directly <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5cb7r9/false_flag_to_invasion_to_war_to_human/">connected</a> to their wars, and overthrowing misaligned governments around the world. This is truly messed up.</p>

<p>The ET aspect is even less known, and friends would think we&#39;re even crazier if we were the messenger. But it&#39;s the truth, and <strong>it&#39;s starting to come out</strong>. When these truths are known by the masses, THAT would literally be the Revelations, and end times outlined in the bible.</p>

<p>The universe is holographic, this means that civilizations keep repeating in cycles with the same themes and same archetypes.</p>

<p>One outcome - and this is what&#39;s happened to all of our ancestors - is that we suffer through endless war, apocalypse scenarios where everyone is having to defend themselves from riots and burglary etc. However, it can end up on a more positive note where we evolve into a space faring race like Star Trek. </p>

<p>Edit: in practice, breakaway groups split from their original home, so some during an end times scenario will likely travel to another planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure about OP&#39;s theory.  I think that gives this arrogant sicko WAY too much credit</p>

<p>I&#39;m reading through podestas UFO shit and I can tell you: he doesn&#39;t know crap.  He&#39;s being forwarded stuff like David Wilcock--one of the owners of GAIAM who claims to be in contact with &#39;high level people who are going to give us disclosure&#39;--he&#39;s been saying this shit since before 2012.  So far, no gd disclosure.  I can&#39;t help but like Wilcock and his stuff, but I always feel he&#39;s getting little orgasms under his metrosexual purple and grey garbs from unending wellspring of duper&#39;s delight that new age people get from the attention people give them, feeding their evidence-free nonsense like channelling the xanatardians from the pleiades.  (see how easy?  now you can too)</p>

<p>Looks like he didn&#39;t have a productive conversation with an astronaut who seems to know way more than podesta does...like &#39;US will be the 25th country to disclose&#39;, talking about zero point energy interdimensionals and moon colonization</p>

<p>Podesta managed to FOIA the usaf over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kecksburg_UFO_incident">widely-witnessed incident in keks-burg pennsylvania</a> that was unresolved--they thought it was a craft or a meteorite for decads think it was either a foreign spy satellite or a US spy satellite they made up to look alien in the chance it fell to earth, which it did.  Those are the theories. Anyway, his claim to fame is he got a foia advocate group to sue to get the foia info.  Hell I did something like that earilier this year with the FDA over cannabis--sans the &#39;sue&#39; though I had foiaadvocates.com lined up to actually sue them, instead fda went over their limit and eventually dox&#39;d up, which I posted here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> if you want to see (search fda cannabis foia)</p>

<p>ps sorry for the language, I&#39;m getting reserach exhaustion</p>

<p>Global consciousness remains one of my top priorities. I envision our species entering deep space as advanced, cooperative, consciously aware and nonviolent. We are not alone in the universe. How we relate to other intelligent life matters. <strong>Understanding how nonviolent ETI from the contiguous universe travel to Earth by means of zero point energy is key to our acceleration as space-faring humans.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Also saying that NOT ALL of people with potential different DNA are potentially bad.)</p>

<p>(ALSO JUST IN CASE: information should be subjected / questioned/&quot;tested&quot; - in the case the information could be false )</p>

<h2>[Comment I posted earlier]</h2>

<p>What if &quot;aliens&quot; (and their potential technology) are working with/(influencing?) &quot;governments&quot; and potentially even &quot;secret societies&quot; / groups?
(potential examples: bilderberg , &quot;united states shadow government&quot; , (religion name here?) , &quot;illuminati&quot;(?) , (potentially other groups / [secret?] &quot;societies&quot;?).</p>

<p>I have done some research on &quot;aliens&quot; and potentially figured out about some sort of &quot;alien&quot; group that seems to be potentially wanting the NWO (as in a potential agenda). ([HOWEVER] I learned about some information from people that seemed to have an agenda tied to them [people that seemed to be deceived or also potentially &quot;in on it&quot;])</p>

<p>(Here is this also)
[–]Mrexreturns 1 point 8 hours ago: It is a control system for unlimited power. It uses endless scheming, deception, thought control and revolutionary uprisings to acheive its goals. It exploits what man treasures such as peace, free will, diversity and the environment to spread fear, weakness and chaos. It weakens the nations that it hosts by infiltration until they are ripe for total conquest. Its final goal is to make all countries and personalities as 1 being, and if they succeed humanity can be transformed into a group of hivemind cyborgs to attack other planets in the far future, hence the promotion of &quot;Space Exploration&quot;.</p>

<p>--[Adding in information]
Other research that I have potentially learned:</p>

<p>*Apparently in the past the &quot;anunnaki&quot; apparently manipulated people.</p>

<p>*Apparent &quot;tall white&quot; aliens having something to do with &quot;USA&quot; (or shadow government &quot;in&quot; &quot;USA&quot;). // This could potentially be an alien &quot;group&quot; interacting with the &quot;USA&quot; (also saying that there could be multiple &quot;differences in DNA&quot; &quot;within&quot; a group)</p>

<p>*Apparently there was a &quot;tall white&quot; encounter where apparently a &quot;tall white(?)&quot; asked someone to either bow down or to kneel on the legs? - later on apparently a &quot;tall white&quot; apparently referred to someone as a &quot;pet&quot;?</p>

<p>*Apparently people have been raped by &quot;hybrid&quot; aliens.</p>

<p>*Apparently an alien group is / (was?) implanting people / of which apparent implants apparently have the capabilities of: monitoring / &quot;controlling&quot; / and also in an apparent &quot;number of ways&quot;. (remembering one of karla turner&#39;s lectures) (&quot;controlling&quot; potentially being able to &quot;block&quot;/&quot;hack&quot; the neural-network of the mind / brain (as potentially also the &quot;brain stem&quot; [neural-network(?)]) - as this apparent &quot;blocking&quot;/&quot;hacking&quot; can apparently cause &quot;paralysis&quot; / potentially even &quot;instant sleeping&quot;. &gt; &quot;wands&quot;?</p>

<p>*Apparent alien hybridization program </p>

<p>*Apparently an alien group is being oppressive against the so called &quot;greys&quot; (as in a potential &quot;alien&quot; fascist group system)</p>

<p>*Apparently The &quot;greys&quot; seem to be either &quot;indoctrinated&quot; or are also potentially against what &quot;someone(s)&quot; are doing to &quot;them&quot;?</p>

<p>*Apparently there is technology that can &quot;hack&quot; the mind / brain into &quot;seeing&quot; &quot;something that isn&#39;t actually there&quot; (And potentially even &quot;disguise capabilities&quot; (looking like someone else))</p>

<p>*Apparent cloning technology that can apparently clone someone (with potential &quot;same&quot; appearance)</p>

<p>Apparently someone was abducted for a few days - later on(?) (during abduction?) apparently a clone was used to &quot;replace&quot; the &quot;abductee&quot; for the days when the &quot;abductee&quot; was being abducted.</p>

<p>*Apparent group of &quot;aliens&quot; that are(?)  / were(?) removing implants, to apparently counteract what another alien group had done(?) / doing(?).</p>

<p>*[ALSO] [POTENTIAL THEORY] google halloween 2016 with a cat holding a &quot;wand&quot;.</p>
