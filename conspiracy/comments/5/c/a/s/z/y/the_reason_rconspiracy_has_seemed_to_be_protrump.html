        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know many people here don&#39;t support Trump, or fully support him, and even hate him.</p>

<p>However, the things Trump has said, pointed out, and attacked are things that 90% of this sub has focused on, hardcore, for years. Suddenly, our narratives were out in the public forum, people were waking up and learning, getting angry about them, just like we have been for years. He upset the corrupt, conspiring establishments, both domestic and global. Coupled with Wikileaks, Trump started a national awakening. Baby steps to understanding the true nature of how rigged and corrupt everything is. He put the issues in laymen, simple terms for the general public to understand.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this sub became pro-Trump, so much as we have all just been excited and ecstatic that the message was getting out there. Now when we bring up conspiracies to people, we&#39;re not getting shutdown, we&#39;re having actual discussions.</p>

<p>Just my two cents. </p>

<p>Now every online voice that does real independent news and doesn&#39;t bother hiding their bias from Dave Rubin to Alex Jones to Young Turks to especially Wikileaks and The Intercept are going to have a way bigger influence and way more credibility going forward. </p>

<p>This is a good and healthy thing for actual free speech and actual journalism and for exposing conspiracies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed OP. He makes big promises, but just like every other president something happens as soon as they take office and then next to none of those promises ever come true. Maybe it&#39;s because they realize they really have very little power, any big move against the puppet masters and they are done for. </p>
