       I know many people here don't support Trump, or fully support him, and even hate him.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the things Trump has said, pointed out, and attacked are things that 90% of this sub has focused on, hardcore, for years. Suddenly, our narratives were out in the public forum, people were waking up and learning, getting angry about them, just like we have been for years. He upset the corrupt, conspiring establishments, both domestic and global. Coupled with Wikileaks, Trump started a national awakening. Baby steps to understanding the true nature of how rigged and corrupt everything is. He put the issues in laymen, simple terms for the general public to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think this sub became pro-Trump, so much as we have all just been excited and ecstatic that the message was getting out there. Now when we bring up conspiracies to people, we're not getting shutdown, we're having actual discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.

       Well that's the job of a "Gatekeeper".  That's the guy who takes you 90% of the way to the target and then stops you at the gate.  Trump is Zog's 9/11 gatekeeper because 9/11 is that last 10%

       Good point, it has been pleasant for him to say some things, but pretty much 98% of them are just limited hangouts anyway

       It's a nice thought, but keep wishing. Presidents love the establishment. They're people who have spent their entire lives trying to reach the top tier of said establishment.

       Except for Trump who has so thoroughly destroyed the Establishment and especially the Establishment media that their credibility is in the shitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now every online voice that does real independent news and doesn't bother hiding their bias from Dave Rubin to Alex Jones to Young Turks to especially Wikileaks and The Intercept are going to have a way bigger influence and way more credibility going forward.
      </p>

       This is a good and healthy thing for actual free speech and actual journalism and for exposing conspiracies.

       "Destroyed the Establishment" meaning he's proven them wrong to the point of destroying their credibility of the average layman. The average layperson can now detect beyond any shadow of a doubt that the talking heads on TV have no clue what the fuck they're doing and that they try to talk and sound like they know what they're doing.

       this was very "pleasing" to hear, probably all our thoughts right now. And as he says,  we will see if he really is anti establishment or just want to build his own establishment. I remain hopeful but not much.

       Agreed OP. He makes big promises, but just like every other president something happens as soon as they take office and then next to none of those promises ever come true. Maybe it's because they realize they really have very little power, any big move against the puppet masters and they are done for.

       Hitler wasn't such a bad guy. He was an insider who realized the Jews were in charge and tried to save his country. Psychopath, yes. Hero of his people, yes. It's not black and white, I'm saying Trump is like Hitler as in he will bring change. Clinton's just as bad
