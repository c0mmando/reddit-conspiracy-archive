I&#39;m seeing a whole lot of terrible posts about people being yelled at in the streets, told to go back to their countries. While I know that these types do not make up the majority of people in the country, it makes me sick that anyone feels as if they have a right to scare the crap out of people born in the US and make them feel unwelcome or fear for their safety.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want a Clinton victory, but if even half of the shit I&#39;m reading about kids in school bullying Hispanic kids, telling them they are going to chucked on the other side of the wall is true.....well fuck. </p>

<p>Everyone needs to ask themselves why they are so angry? Is it because of something specific Trump has actually done? Or is your anger based on assumptions, rhetoric, and claims the media makes? Because I&#39;m pretty sure the guy hasn&#39;t even taken office yet, or laid out any policies for anyone to criticize yet. Calm down.</p>

<p>Was defeating Clinton worth creating an environment where racist&#39;s feel emboldened?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, yes, because the alternative under Clinton would have been to begin WWIII against Russia and China both - which Clinton was all but swearing would happen and where we would have gotten absolutely <em>stomped</em> in.  A civil war w/Trump as president will suck, but it won&#39;t be as globally catastrophic as WWIII under a Clinton presidency.</p>

<p>They BOTH fucking suck, as I have been saying from the jump.</p>

<p>Trump seems to be a racist piece of shit.  Clinton is a fucking criminal psychopath.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Additionally, there is also the possibility that a Trump presidency will show EVERYONE how horrible a farce it all is and will actually be a catalyst for even more people waking up - which, of course, would actually be a good thing.  There&#39;s a possibility that the attempt at racism may actually spawn a MASSIVE civil rights resurgence that&#39;s stronger and even more powerful than anything the 60s ever saw under MLK and Malcolm X.  That would be great.  Trump could, paradoxically, be responsible for the strongest minority push ever in the country.</p>

<p>I&#39;m ultimately for equality for all - black, white, native, Mexican, Asian, etc, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m seeing a whole lot of terrible posts about people being yelled at in the streets, told to go back to their countries.</p>

<p>No but clearly it was worth defeating her so low information hillary supporters who <em>still continue to not have a grip on reality</em> could feel emboldened to come to this sub, to continue to shame us for our incredible victory in a 2 yr long antipropaganda war to  keep a criminal gangster who makes al capone look like a child from coming to power., an audience that is extremely well-versed not only in Hillary Clinton and Bill Clintons <strong><em>decades of criminality</em></strong>, but the reality of our mainstream media and social media landscape continuing to harass and harangue us with false narratives, gaslighting us to a degree I&#39;ve never seen before in my entire 42 yrs of life, using the taxpayer resources of the CIA, NSA and OBama to boot, all the while engaging in treason.</p>

<p>So go on, and continue to talk like you know something.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he&#39;s a sandwich of what&#39;s actually happening</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For real?  Lets just start with the fact that these people are out in the streets tearing shit up.  When I gotta get to an appointment and these cocksuckers are blocking the free way waving mexican flags saying go back to mexico is proper.  You didn&#39;t see things like this from republicans in 08 or 12, but when you have a job to do and responsibilities you don&#39;t stay out all night trashing private property.  </p>
