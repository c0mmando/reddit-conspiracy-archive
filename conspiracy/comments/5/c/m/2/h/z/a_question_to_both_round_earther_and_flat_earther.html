<ol>
<li><p>For round earthers - If the earth is round then how come me and many others can sometimes see the moon during the day? Won&#39;t the moon be on the other side of the world?</p></li>
<li><p>For flat earthers - If the world is flat than shouldn&#39;t you be able to see every single city or landscape from anything in the world with a telescope? Have any of you tried that?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people find this to be a stupid topic, but I find it fascinating, not because either side has convinced me, but because NASA a known group of NAZIS and propagandists are the sole source of information outside our atmosphere. It leaves me immediately skeptical, and I just simply want other/ competition groups to test their theories as well. I know for one NASA is full of shit, and two that whoever is right, it&#39;s inconsequential to our daily lives. Many good points are brought up by flat earthers that I don&#39;t necessarily buy just want to see them challenged, debated, and you know actually proved. So until we have a marketplace of information this discussion will continue. Right now there is a monopoly of information and if you trust the United States government as the sole source of information on anything at face value, you are incredibly naive.</p>

<p>Also, there are dozens of people who have come out from multiple walks of life (pilots, navigators, sea captains, scientists) that have said &quot;the Earth is not a globe&quot;. </p>

<p>Dude, paperclip was like 70 years ago.  And guess what?  The Nazi&#39;s had some of the world&#39;s premier rocket scientists at the time.  Snagging them for the USA was a brilliant move.</p>

<p>This is untrue.</p>

<p>LOL, you think you know that.</p>

<p>They only seem like good points if you are too Dunning-Kruger to see how retarded they are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So until we have a marketplace of information</p>

<p>LOL.  We&#39;ve had open discussion of this topic for more than 2300 years now.  The Earth was proved round MILLENIA before NASA existed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now there is a monopoly of information</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No there isn&#39;t.  Did ancient astronomers rely on NASA?  Of course not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and if you trust the United States government as the sole source of information on anything at face value, you are incredibly naive.</p>

<p>Bingo.  It is trivially easy to prove that the Earth is round and not flat.</p>

<p>And w/e that youtube knows is not my concern; there are plenty of channels dedicated to it.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question: with Pizzagate, you&#39;re getting some evidence to support the long running theory that secret society members are occultists and satanists.  If the most informed people on the planet believe in God, then why do you believe anything that goes against the information in those texts?  You&#39;re pretty clearly ss though, so there&#39;s no real benefit in arguing this.

<p>no, that doesn&#39;t prove anything as flights in the helio model follow a more circular path and do their best to stay close to land.  In both models, landing in Alaska was likely.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>yes there is.  first of all, large objects cannot be discs due to basic physical laws.  A disc, even made of something like diamond or graphene, would be crushed into a ball by the pull of its own gravity if it is the size of the moon or sun.</p>

<p>second, we can see these objects rotating, and they always present a disc to our view.  The only shape that looks like a disc from every angle  is a sphere.</p>

<p>Curvature is obvious and seen daily.  Flat Earth is trivially easy to debunk.  Respond to my submitted posts if you dare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I&#39;m saying is just because the sun and moon are round, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re spheres. Consider the sun and moon are much closer than what we&#39;re told, and the sun shines on the earth like a spotlight. Just consider how that&#39;s possible, regardless of what we&#39;ve been told our entire lives and for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>For flat earthers - If the world is flat than shouldn&#39;t you be able to see every single city or landscape from anything in the world with a telescope? Have any of you tried that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Air looks pretty see-through close up, but it&#39;s actually full of water and dust particles. Think of looking through fog, you may be able to see 10 feet in front of you, but then it&#39;s just a wall of mist after that. Same thing with air, just a lot less dense so the effect is only noticeable over bigger distances.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good example of a mountain in the distance.

<p>From what I have seen in terms of flat earth videos etc, you can see about 100 miles far on a clear day, and even then the object is very hard to see (also depends how large the object you are looking at). You can see a bit further with binoculars or a good telescope.</p>

<p>EDIT: Added Same thing with air...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> you see the moon during the day?  The sun and Moon have very different orbiting cycles.  Ive never seen a full moon during the day, though, because that implies that the sun is &quot;behind&quot; us, so it&#39;s probably nighttime.  If you look at the daytime moon, and look at which way the reflected light is coming from, you could probably use that information to figure out where the sun is.  It&#39;s all so very magical. :)</p>
