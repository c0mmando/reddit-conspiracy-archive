       Yes, this also scares me and wakes me up to just how serious this situation is.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I'd like to know that there are no other possibilities. One such being, had there ever been a situation where so many users visited an archived / way back machine version of a website that the act of so many people visiting the page/resource is what caused the page to.be removed?
      </p>
      <p>
       also, is there any sort of open source initiative that has a communication outlet via normal web, and darknet web protocols (tor, i2p, freenet, retroshare, etc) to prevent such censorship as we continue?
      </p>
      <p>
       And one last "also", is there an accepted method of archiving/collecting evidence (digital/electronic) that is accepted as standard practice amongst most law enforcement agencies in the world?  --- if so, could someone share with us that method and it'd be a method which all research participants would adopt, making it easier in the end to have people new to the investigation to accept that " yes in fact this screenshot was once live, but the original page was removed/edited AND the archived version of it had also been tampered/removed".
      </p>
      <p>
       Does everything that I am saying above make sense?

       First, no, I don't ever recall this happening. I thought archive.is's motto was something like "information should be open for all to know" or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       To your second question, yeah, actually -
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getaether/">
        Aether
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Decentralized, so theoretically no one can delete or edit other people's posts. Then again, it also means it takes a little setup and a lot of time to sync. It's not so much for file sharing though. I'm pretty sure it has at least SSL encryption, but it does operate on "clearnet".
      </p>
      <p>
       As for "accepted methods" there are a bunch of them. A tool on *nix distros is called wget that can recursively fetch a whole page at a time and convert all the links to local so you can browse it offline. It takes a while though 'cause you're running it on a slower connection and you have to turn the speed down or the site will probably throttle you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then for sharing it, creating a torrent with a good few offshore trackers and putting a magnet link to it on Aether might work. A torrent is a good method for ensuring it isn't shut down, but also exposes the IPs of anyone spreading it to anyone who wants to look.

       George Galloway?  As in the Scottish guy??  You do realise he is a follower of an organisation that covered up a paedophilia ring for over 20yrs, and if you were to bring that up, you are told you are just as bad as the paedophile for bringing up the past.

      </p>
      <p>
       But couldnt it be he didnt know they did that ? i mean you said he was a follower and maybe he didnt know at the time.

       Well it is his favourite football (soccer) team, this peado ring was busted 20 yrs ago, this never gets mentioned.. swept under a very large carpet. But.... never mention that or you will be blocked immediately. He also likes to consider himself a Catholic/Muslim depending on the situation. He hates the UK government as it fits in with his love of Irish terrorists, sorry Freedom fighters!

       Too many rules over there for me. In fact, too much going on over there in general. Honestly, its kinda scary in there.

       I'd be careful going around toting threats like that... Just saying it could backfire further down the road. Can never be too careful man.

       George Galloway?  As in the Scottish guy??  You do realise he is a follower of an organisation that covered up a paedophilia ring for over 20yrs, and if you were to bring that up, you are told you are just as bad as the paedophile for bringing up the past.
