Someone give me an example of him lying or fucking up.  He&#39;s well-spoken, reasonable, convincing, energetic, and apparently honest.  Someone tell me I&#39;m wrong.  And if I&#39;m not...How is he surviving in congress and why didn&#39;t the RNC tap him for the nomination?  Man, I used to be such a blind liberal bigot who would write off politicians of the other party.  Now, I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s the only one doing his job in congress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Here&#39;s the thing, though. After watching these &quot;heroes&quot; for fucking years doing their same futile song and dance routine: Massive fraud or high-level conspiracy (ie Lerner at the IRS), followed by gasping members of congress and the &quot;hearings&quot; which include 98% of the questions being dodged or them taking the 5th.</p>

<p>From Daryl Issa and his &quot;championing&quot; for the people during the TARP bullshit and subsequent massive bailouts and hyper-hubristic bonuses those pricks gave each other. And what did it all amount to for the people? Jack fuck. I am not saying I don&#39;t fist-pump myself to death when these &quot;saviors&quot; bitch-out all the fraudulent shitbags like Lynch or the FBI, etc. But, when you step back and look at what it&#39;s really gotten us? Triple the amount of fraud and treason and conspiracy. My jaded view is these guys are controlled opposition, in that they are incredibly &quot;satisfying&quot; to get behind and cheer on - but to what end??. In other words, it isn&#39;t too difficult to imagine these fuckers all in the same steam bath clinking glasses at B Grove.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, exactly. They pull up short. They scold with strong postures, but it&#39;s never with any real teeth. It&#39;s always thanking some &quot;chair&quot; for &quot;yielding time&quot; so they can throw us all a bone - bitch at this person for us, who will never see any real punishment. It&#39;s also funny to see the rest of the room of committee members hushed as they are. This only adds to the theory these dudes are taking one for the rest of them filing their nails waiting for the &quot;hearings&quot; to end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  Trey Gowdy sure <em>talks</em> a good game, but the fact is, if you check his record in congress, he&#39;s accomplished nothing.  All he does is talk, and it seems it all started when these emails came out and started to make a lot of hay from them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t trust any of the current politicians in DC.  I firmly believe that EVERY ONE OF THEM won office, because they had something seriously $ucked up in their past, and were thus &#39;electable&#39; and controllable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely I think he may pull up short. That&#39;s what he did with Benghazi - not because it was a &quot;nothingburger&quot;, because it wasn&#39;t, but because it got too hot politically. It is indeed unwise to have heroes, especially in politics. If he follows through I&#39;ll be very happy, but I don&#39;t trust him or his pals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t really help the argument&#39;s case. It&#39;s basically reinforcing the idea that these complaints are more about partisanship rather than helping the effort.</p>

<p>&quot;Armchair quarterbacks and partisan Democrats seeking to undermine Chairman Gowdy&#39;s thorough, fact-centered investigation are nothing new,&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gowdy&#39;s spokesman would say that!</p>

<p>I think Fitton&#39;s view is that the Congressional GOP are part of the swamp and therefore have limited interest in exposing the whole story. (He also thinks that they don&#39;t go about things very competently, a criticism that has some merit.)</p>

<p>These guys do pull their punches. For example on the Clinton email story they&#39;ve held a series of hearings with impressive speeches but they don&#39;t exercise the powers they have. Instead they&#39;ve been writing letters demanding action from the FBI and DOJ - the very agencies that conspired in a cover up and fix.</p>

<p>I would love to see Gowdy, Chaffetz and Co. take real action, but at this stage I&#39;m skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you watched any of the proceedings you just referenced? Because it sounds like Gowdy and the group are being inhibited by those agencies and you&#39;re placing the blame on the wrong group of people based purely on partisan speculation. You said yourself they&#39;re actively hounding the FBI, why turn that around and say it&#39;s just an act? I don&#39;t see any merit to this theory, sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;ve watched all of them. I&#39;ve also watched the Benghazi hearings. Gowdy says some very good stuff. And you&#39;re right about their activities being inhibited: they were stonewalled by Clinton and the State Department and were aided and abetted by the Congressional Democrats. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an &quot;act&quot; exactly. I just don&#39;t see evidence that they are prepared to go the whole way in exposing what is going on. For example Benghazi involves arms trading in which the CIA was a participant. Are Republicans prepared to expose a CIA operation?</p>
