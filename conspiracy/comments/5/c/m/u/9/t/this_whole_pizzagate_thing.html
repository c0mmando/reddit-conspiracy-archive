       Now that I am beginning to read all of this..... oh my God the mountain of circumstantial evidence seems unreal.  What is this?  Why is this not on the front page of this sub?  Am I just going nuts?  Wikileaks couldn't even deny it in the AMA.  Why wouldn't they just tell us it's not true, WTF is going on here?  We used to have stupid bigfoot stories and alien landings and shit here.   But this....

       This should be everything right now.  The evidence isn't definitive, but for fucks sake who tapes a girls hands to a table and puts that shit on their IG?  We need a sticky at the top with all this shit, until it's proven to be false. This is way more than this sub has ever looked at before (bigger than 9/11).
       <br/>
       Sticky this shit to the top until we can all say this is BS.  But right now, very minimum, some fucking creep owns a pizza joint that a LOT of high power people are seen at.
Maybe Hillary doesn't even know.  I'm not saying this is her.  But how in the fuck can you think this is an OK place to visit?

       I agree completely.

       From my experience the mods here don't sticky the real stuff.
Case in point, current sticky is an unverified 'AMA' we all suspect is bullshit. Prior to that it was the 'counter-coup' video which had 0 actual evidence.

       I actually have a three year old daughter......  And no, I would never do that.  It seems humiliating to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if we are all wrong, you are right, and I feel bad for them.  But a lot of damn coincidences.  Ever had someone mail you a handkerchief you forgot at someone's house?  "Hey you left you handkerchief at my house, want me to overnight that to you?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe these people are just really weird?  Could be, it really could.  Weird people who just happen to use pedo symbols?  Weird people who just happen to tape girls hand to tables and post that shit on instagram?  I would never, but ok.  Weird people who just happen to have connections to other pedos?  Umm... okay.  Weird people who just happen to have a 1200$ german dolls for sale?  Um, yeah weird sure... Weird people who just let their babies stick money in their mouth (parental advice, money is dirty and newborns are more likely to get sick that the rest of us.)  Ok yeah, shitty parenting going on here... Little weird.  Gonna send some kids over for entertainment?  I prefer like, movies and shit....  Little weird.  Weird creepy Jeffery dahmer look alike art in the house?  Yeah, little weird.  Couple of your favorite artists happen to draw little kids in vicarious situations.  Yeah, a little weird.  You like spirit cooking?  Umm.. yeah a little weird?  Instagram some dude with a pizza over his dick?  CUM visit?  Yep, still weird.  Having a empty weird creepy cooler room that's completely empty?  Yeah, weird.  Need to password secure part of your pizza site?  Yeah, little weird..
      </p>
      <p>
       Whole lot of little weird things going on.  Guess they are just a little weird.

       I will admit I have had a lot of weird friends, some of them artistic, and they come with some similarly weird interests.. Interests in serial killers, hiding phallic or vaginas in there artwork, "hail satan!" (Ironically), and photoshoots of people being murdered or fake dead people. Artists can be some pretty weird fuckin people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this stuff does go the step beyond weird when there are so many connections between these important and influential people and the symbols used and everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah. I'm not completely ready to dismiss this as just weird artistic expression. Nor as weird coincidences. We'll see where this all goes!

       So, what you are saying is, we should just let it all go?  Hope it's a coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand what you are trying to say.  I get that.  But if there is a 10% chance this is happening is it not worth looking into?
      </p>
      <p>
       You very well could be right.  But at this point, so could all of these people that think something bad is happening.  This is an extremely sensitive topic.  They are kids though.  They can't protect themselves.  I feel like if we are going to err, then we error on the side of children.  I am not going to report anything myself, because I know there isn't enough to report.
      </p>
      <p>
       But say these posts are right, and children are being harmed?  I know, it's shitty either way.  It's an unfortunate set of circumstances.  I don't know what to do, so I will do nothing.  I don't know what to think.  Maybe I am overreacting because I have a child of my own that happens to be the same age as some of these kids?  I don't know.  I don't know what to do, but I feel like we all need to know one way or the other so it stops if it is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR.  I get your point entirely, and very well this could all be BS.  But fuck, it's a lot of circumstance and it would seem unfair to the children if we were not looking into it further.

       I'm not trying to discourage anyone from doing research. However, I AM trying to discourage people from harassing potentially innocent people when obviously the evidence so far is inconclusive at best. People need to be much more careful with their language when discussing this stuff, and be sure to remind everyone that these people are
       <strong>
        innocent until proven guilty
       </strong>
       . I understand there are a lot of reasonable people investigating this who are aware of that point, and I have no issue with those people. I'm only worried about the types of people who might cause real-life harm without any solid evidence to back up their suspicions.

       I'm not from this community but I've had similar thoughts. Overzealous people had been leaving comments all throughout the jimmycomet ig, obviously fake/sketchy reviews on yelp, and @ing people allegedly involved all over other social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigating and collecting objective data is hard when people are changing the story by interfering so publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also want to point out, if you guys are really feeling very sick and overwhelmed over this, consider balancing your investigation with volunteering for victims of sex trafficking or something else where you know for sure you are helping!

       Distasteful?? And you have some doubt about the reference? Just google chicken lover. Man you are willfully blind, just going to call that out.

        I agree with you about that one image so far being the only legit reference so far to actual pedophilia

       Did I say that? That's not at all what I think. I think you need to open your eyes

       I'm not going to link you the photo because then you'll just avoid doing any further research and stick to your surface perspective. That pic is all over the place if you actually look into this.

       Just because it's not part of your experience doesn't mean it's a stretch.

       Not all members of this investigation are involved in harassing the social media accounts etc. That's unproductive as fuck, plus the provoke means they're going to reflexively cover their junk. I think it's mainly the throwaway accounts on Twitter blowing up the story, random other people seeing that story, and jumping in on the hate bandwagon.

       In order for this to be nonsense, the connections that have been investigated so far would have to be either meaningless, or false. So far they are not proven to be either.

       If you want to be skeptical, if you want to disprove it, go research.

Every bit of information helps, and if I am wrong well I killed a few hours of time I was going to be on Netflix watching a cooking documentary or a comic book movie.  I'll have to find a way to live with that haha.

       Stop defending pedophiles, holy crap, what is wrong with some people. What does it take to get it through your head? You need video evidence of Barack Obama facefucking an infant? You're not going to get that, you need to use your brain to parse through the information and make judgments yourself. Nobody can make these judgments for you, and by constantly shielding yourself from making real decisions you're not being a skeptic, you're being a coward.

       You're on the conspiracy sub and the theory is legitimate. Hell even if it was just silsby trying to sneak kids in a bus over the Haitian border it would be enough but now we know that alefantis uses #chickenlover in baby pictures and that podesta has 3 underage kids waiting for him in a hot tub. Podesta, an unmarried man with no children... I think they are smart enough to not leave any real damning evidence and had no idea that we, the everyday citizens on reddit, would be looking into their private communications and connecting suspicious dots

       You got some weird friends, man. I don't know anybody that would duct tape their kid up in public in a dive pizza joint. This isn't even close to the amount of evidence, however. Comet Pizza was just the Achilles heel of uncovering a huge mountain of links. It's some sick and twisted stuff. It takes time and dedication to fully research and isn't for the faint hearted. What's going on behind the scenes at The Clinton Foundation is being exposed. 4channers (some of the best on the case) have been getting threats for doing what they are researching. Weeks of research are getting scrubbed. DDOS attacks occur when new evidence rises. It's not for no reason. I have a feeling you lightly reviewed the tip of this iceberg, and just brushed it off because you have a couple friends that have innocently duct taped their kids. Thankfully, the FBI is investigating the CF, making it a high priority case. Those of us who have actually been researching into the people that link to the CF are praying this comes to a stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree that people shouldn't be harassing the comet pizza people publicly. This is a very delicate case and could mess things up with the true investigation, and some folks could be innocent bystanders.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Of course we don't want this to be real. But some of us will no longer turn a blind eye to what the political elite have been doing for decades.

       Again, the artists and comet pizza is only what started the investigation. I know all about The Occult, subcultures, and "weird" things in general. Kinda what made me an outcast growing up. If THAT was the only thing going on I would brush it off too. It frustrates me that thats the only thing that gets pushed to the front page, but it's incredibly hard now to keep the actual digging into the Clinton Foundation at the front and center. It's gone incredibly deep and is getting deeply silenced. For good reason, because it goes back decades with many investigative "mysterious" deaths along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that people are innocent until proven guilty, but I applaud the hard workers here, on 4chan, all over the world that are helping bring this to light. I wish people would stop contacting those involved, because it only results in threats to the investigators and information getting scrubbed. Especially since this thing is so incredibly vast, their is bound to be some innocent people that have gotten accused.

       i'm fascinated by it, it seems so purposefully deceptive - when I you talk to people about it they use very cunning ways of making it seem like there's too much evidence to question and that they've seen the real proof but when you question them on specifics they back right off to really vague things that prove absolutely nothing about anything...
      </p>
      <p>
       what really gets me though is the holier than thou attitude of all the posts about it when they're calling the things people have posted disgusting - these posts are all coming from the chans, mostly 4 and 8; the former known for inventing Pedobear the latter literally a known haven for pedos... like genuinely 8chan is known for it's pedo boards, ED has all the info and the info on the underage girl 4chan convinced into sharing nudes and bullied until she killed herself... since when was 4chan appalled by dark imagery and rock music? it all just seems a little fake....

       yeh that's a possibility, heh or maybe they know for sure but they can't share the actual evidence because if anyone knew they looked at the places it came from they'd go to jail...
      </p>
      <p>
       one of the things i saw was about a disused rail line that was somewhere near the pizza places and the evidence that linked it to the pedo conspiracy was that in a photo it showed a closed down Pizza Express, as if all Pizza is now part of the conspiracy?! the thing is they're throwing this up as part of REALLY long and needlessly complicated posts which barely make any sense but they're using it as 'evidence' when making even more exaggerated claims, especially long lists of really extreme claims but you argue about one of them and they say 'oh that's not important, it's everything else that is important' but they'll never actually point to anything they're willing to stand by.
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean it's probably coincidental but i recognise the tactic of consensus building from a book i read about cointelpro, make it seem like there's lot of people who already agree and who have spent far more time researching it that you're able to and then simply bombard people with it until they accept it's something that people believe, and people begin to think that many if not most people believe this even though they've never really met anyone that admits to thinking like but they write it off as it must be because they only know people that think like them... I mean i'm not saying it's the CIA i'm just saying that a lot of conspiracy theorists have read the same books i have, a lot of stratfor style nutters who think they're living in a film have as well - heh i mean it could be putin using his assets to muddy the water over the political system or some oil company shills trying to sink clinton and any hope of climate protections being put into law...
      </p>
      <p>
       but then there are plenty of people who are just willing to believe the flat earth youtube videos for no reason at all, maybe it really is just a case of people seeing what they want to and being over excited about being part of something..?

       Conspiracy theorist was a label invented by a certain three letter agency to marginalize criticism. You can discover this fact on tour own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy means to breath as one, even when there are no direct connections between two entities. Conspiracy is a valid branch of economics and law.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to detect conspiracy, you need to see correlations or movements in data, which in this case we have plenty of. Correlation never confirms causation, but it is a big hint.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as evidence, I will admit there is no smoking gun such as OJ Simpson's glove, which is what most normal folks need in order to distill the overall patterns in the data down into one singular and quantifiable bit of intel that sways public opinion one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a case of binary proof (either/or) but a case of stochastic thinking that depends on probability. Based on the overall patterns of behaviour, it looks as though the pizza joints are a front organization for something else. That something else could involve human trafficking at worst or a program for conditioning and detecting possible victims at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we collectively process more data, it seems like there is probable cause for a law enforcement to move on this matter, either through surveillance or arrests. But if they move on this, those higher up will likely walk free while the lower level operatives take the fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also open to the possibility that this is a mass case of confirmation bias, and we are on a witch hunt fuelled by the echo chamber of social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, I prefer to look at this through the lens of Bayesian inference; as new data come in, I update my prior assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask everyone else to do the same. It's the only way to stay sane when you process this data.

       Unruly children don't have expressions on their face like things have been stuffed up their butt. Unruly children protest when they are punished not show expressions of glee at things stuffed up their butt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unruly children cry and scream. Men do not have hard-ons in those circumstances either. Look at the man standing behind the child in the photo.

       Too many people have had their entire lives ruined being given knock-out drugs multiple times and raped in the ass for you to disregard the multitude of victims by demanding that people not be suspicious or that they look the other way. When will you start kicking down doors and digging up fields?
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop caring more about the doors, fields, and the peoples' feelings. What part of there being entire lives ruined do you not understand? I demand that you begin to hear the universe scream.

       Posts about pizzagate get down voted hard. The suppression is real because the conspiracy is real.

       Please also do not start linking until you have evidence archived and saved in an external hard drive (some evidence archive sites have been compromised). They are scrubbing info when it gets linked to.

       It could also be because you guys are looking at ANYTHING with the word pizza in it and linking it to some child porn scandal.  There are so many straws being grasped at it's mind boggling to me that it makes coherent sense to a bunch of you.

       I'm totally fine with people going down that road and believing it and whatever, but when anyone disagrees or isn't seeing this super-strong link that you're seeing you guys lose your shit.

       It seems more likely that they are pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a lot of people being in on it doesn't cause me to discount it. Many pedophile "rings" have been busted and its not uncommon for the arrests to number in the dozens in one sweep. Yeah I would think its entirely possible there's groups operating out in the open and making innuendo comments on Facebook. Whose going to believe it?

       That is an excellent system of thought and I highly respect you for that. However, that one picture is just one of much evidence that's been compiled together. Also take into account that these organizations are actually wiping the evidence online real-time as the findings are published to the subreddit (but everything is archived of course, so it just makes them look more guilty). I can link you an informative video on youtube if you're interested that explains it quite well

       Honestly this is what makes me think it's not true.  Might as well leave your calling card at the scene of the crime.
       <br/>
       However, people like Jared or Jerry Sandusky don't seem normal enough to realize how fucked their behavior is.  I can't imagine molesting a kid, so I can't be in their heads.  But to advertise their place like that seems nuts even for someone who's crazy

       I didn't say anything pedo  this and that all i said was nobody ties up kids for jokes atleast not the parents i know. Often victims of child abuse are conditioned to it and they are from horrible circumstances. Facebook friends are different to real friends ofcourse people will friend powerful people to move up corporate chain and build contacts.  By trying to talk sense into us people your vermant defence of these people is only serving to incriminate them further.

       r/pizzagate subscriber growth has been interesting to watch. Awareness is growing. Slowly, but with strong interest forming at the base. At anytime, 10-15% of the total subscribers are online. That is incredible analytics and means that the people who are subscribing are obsessed with this. I smell a shit storm coming soon. Let us hope justice is served. Stay vigilant of CTR and concern trolls.

       It's just a lot when you put it all together, there is well researched information at the pizzagate sub.  Maybe I just "want" to believe, but really I don't know why I would want that.  I'd much rather have a UFO be real, or 911 exposed.

       This whole child abuse thing is taking place inside the families and is going on from generation to generation. The children they get from the outside are being killed after the crime. (They are obsessed with ancestry and child abuse as this e-mail shows:

       Pizzagate is very very complex. Apart from the people who have been following it since day 1 and doing their digging, it's impossible to navigate in it. We'll need easy to follow short compilations of evidence, and as I always say, RELEASE THE AUTISTS

       Sadly, the victims probably don't have parents. Some of the people connected to this scandal also are also involved in running orphanages and anti-trafficking operations. Those are perfect covers for kidnapping parent-less children.

       I never said they've been wrong. I said they were now controlled, and censored. They haven't even released anything for the past couple days...The Podesta emails don't add up to original statements of size and amount. Emails are being hidden.

       The Clintons damage and corrode everything they touch.  Why limit damage estimates to (theoretically) socially useful institutions?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's truly a humorous God if, in addition to corroding the democratic process, probably destroying the DNC, corrupting the FBI, DOJ and eroding faith in government even further, if $hillary also brings down a child-trafficking ring/pedophile-network that has successfully hidden for decades.

       See you dig a little and have a revelation like that, but others who just sniff the #SpiritCooking surface are like, "Psh, whatever. No real evidence. You're ruining people's lives with these allegations."
      </p>
      <p>
       I say, there's no real harm if nothing comes of it. Their entranced fans will still love them and ignore the evidence anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are 3 or 4 threads warning us about this investigation, as if to tell us to stop. That's why it's not flooding the sub like it was a couple days ago.

        Maybe it's a form of projection for a lot of these people who are pedophiles themselves? (I'm just kidding, btw, before people jump on me for saying that.)

       yeh that's a possibility, heh or maybe they know for sure but they can't share the actual evidence because if anyone knew they looked at the places it came from they'd go to jail...

       one of the things i saw was about a disused rail line that was somewhere near the pizza places and the evidence that linked it to the pedo conspiracy was that in a photo it showed a closed down Pizza Express, as if all Pizza is now part of the conspiracy?! the thing is they're throwing this up as part of REALLY long and needlessly complicated posts which barely make any sense but they're using it as 'evidence' when making even more exaggerated claims, especially long lists of really extreme claims but you argue about one of them and they say 'oh that's not important, it's everything else that is important' but they'll never actually point to anything they're willing to stand by.

       i mean it's probably coincidental but i recognise the tactic of consensus building from a book i read about cointelpro, make it seem like there's lot of people who already agree and who have spent far more time researching it that you're able to and then simply bombard people with it until they accept it's something that people believe, and people begin to think that many if not most people believe this even though they've never really met anyone that admits to thinking like but they write it off as it must be because they only know people that think like them... I mean i'm not saying it's the CIA i'm just saying that a lot of conspiracy theorists have read the same books i have, a lot of stratfor style nutters who think they're living in a film have as well - heh i mean it could be putin using his assets to muddy the water over the political system or some oil company shills trying to sink clinton and any hope of climate protections being put into law...

       but then there are plenty of people who are just willing to believe the flat earth youtube videos for no reason at all, maybe it really is just a case of people seeing what they want to and being over excited about being part of something..?
