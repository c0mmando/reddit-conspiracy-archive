<p>2: Are the moon and sun flat and how does all that work?</p>

<p>3: How is the earth held together, how does gravity work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a flat earther but my childhood friend is a religious flat earther so I&#39;ll tell you what he believes.<br/>
1. The <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Orlando-Ferguson-flat-earth-map_edit.jpg">world would look like this </a> and under the earth there would be pillars supporting the hollow, flat earth <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/waSkF3uVPdE/hqdefault.jpg">like this</a><br/>
2. Genesis 1:14-18  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. 16 God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He thinks that the moon is a semitransparent and self illuminating light of equal size to the sun.<br/>
3. There is no gravity. Psalm 93:1 &quot;The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength,wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.&quot; The world us unmoving and we&#39;re basically stuck inside a dome with an unbreakable firmament aka Van Allen radiation belt above us.<br/>
4. He said the seasons change because of the odd rotation of the sun and moon around the earth.<br/>
5. There would be an arctic wall surrounding the entire landmass of earth instead of there being polar ice caps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hell aka Sheol or death. 
1 Enoch 22:1. And thence I went to another place, and he showed me in the west another great and high mountain [and] of hard rock. 2 And there was in it four hollow places, deep and wide and very smooth. How smooth are the hollow places and deep and dark to look at.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Then Raphael answered, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said unto me: &#39;These hollow places have been created for this very purpose, that the spirits of the souls of the dead should assemble therein, yea that all the souls of the children of men should assemble here. And these places have been made to receive them till the day of their judgement and till their appointed period till the period appointed, till the great judgement (comes) upon them.&#39;</p></li>
<li><p>I saw the spirits of the children of men who were dead, and their voice went forth to heaven and made suit. 6. Then I asked Raphael the angel who was with me, and I said unto him: &#39;This spirit--whose is it whose voice goeth forth and maketh suit?&#39;</p></li>
<li><p>And he answered me saying: &#39;This is the spirit which went forth from Abel, whom his brother Cain slew, and he makes his suit against him till his seed is destroyed from the face of the earth, and his seed is annihilated from amongst the seed of men.&#39;8. Then I asked regarding it, and regarding all the hollow places: &#39;Why as one separated from the other?&#39;</p></li>
<li><p>And he answered me and said unto me: &#39;These three have been made that the spirits of the dead might be separated. And such a division has been made 〈for〉 the spirits of the righteous, in which there as the bright spring of water. 10.And such has been made for sinners when they die and are buried in the earth and judgement has not been executed on them in their lifetime. 11. Here their spirits shall be set apart in this great pain till the great day of judgement and punishment and torment of those who †curse† for ever, and retribution for their spirits. There He shall bind them for ever. 12. And such a division has been made for the spirits of those who make their suit, who make disclosures concerning their destruction, when they were slain in the days of the sinners. 13. Such has been made for the spirits of men who were not righteous but sinners, who were complete in transgression, and of the transgressors. they shall be companions: but their spirits shall not be slain in the day of judgement nor shall they be raised from thence. 14. Then I blessed the Lord of glory and said: &#39;Blessed be my Lord, the Lord of righteousness, who ruleth for ever.&#39;</p></li>

<li><p>Think of it as a disc with a dome above.  The edge of the circle is an ice wall (called Antarctica).  What&#39;s underneath is as much a mystery as whats in the center of the globe model.  We have never drilled more than a few miles into the crust.  Everything we know about the center of earth is theory.</p></li>
<li><p>No they aren&#39;t flat but they are closer and smaller than we are told.  </p></li>
<li><p>Gravity might not be reality.  Density can account for everything we are told gravity does.  And the electric universe model makes much more sense than the gravitational model.</p></li>
<li><p>no Hemispheres and the distance and path of the sun creates seasons. (I&#39;m still studying flat earth and this is a point I don&#39;t know alot on yet)</p></li>
<li><p>again the path of the sun accounts for this.</p></li>

<p>I am earth shape agnostic but I thought i would throw you some of my ideas on this.  I would suggest watching this YT playlist.. it is very informative: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm6Vq0bTTCDj8fuDVfqcytiuxbVj_Lyq4">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm6Vq0bTTCDj8fuDVfqcytiuxbVj_Lyq4</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you explain Coriolis force if the planet is not round?</p>

<p>Coriolis force is what drives the winds away from the equator because the earth is rotating. This causes the prevailing winds, the direction of spin in wether systems (I.e.it is the reason that hurricanes spin counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This video tries to explain away Coriolis force by saying &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter, its stupid&quot;</p>

<p>That is not an argument worth the wind it was spoken with. The person who posted this video and who narrates it does not even understand what Coriolis force is and why it works the way it does, he simply chooses to say its stupid. The videos title is misleading because it does not at all attempt to use Coriolis force to explain a flat earth, rather the narrators just ignores it and claims that its false... (When you can take endless measurements to see that it is not false)</p>

<p>I weep for those of you who &quot;learn&quot; from people like the person who posted this video... I am no longer going to post my ridiculous theories of measuring things and believing in theories supported by overwhelming amounts of data. I am actually in school for this stuff and so it really frustrates me to see people who are so uneducated about our planet (probably the reason the earth is going to shit and people just seem to endlessly pillage it for its resources, with understanding will come compassion).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gravity works in a vacuum.  The easiest way to see it yourself is to get a burned out lightbulb, where the filament has burnt out.  It sits at the bottom of the glass shell.  You shake it, and gravity still works.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot about gravity that is unknown, and the current math for it is &quot;off&quot;, but denying that it exists is absurd.  I challenge any gravity denier to jump off their nearest cliff, and inform us of the results.</p>

<p>I&#39;d go on about the other points, but talking to flat earthers for too long turns into a never-ending devolution into absurdity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It started with astronomers like Aristotle seeing the spherical shadow of the earth on the moon causing the sun&#39;s light to be blocked then they observed other planets and noticed that they were round spheres and concluded that our planet was probably pretty similar. Then there were experiments done by Eratosthenes in ancient Greece to determine the circumference of the earth and he was only off by 0.16%. Much later a French scientist created a device named the Foucault pendulum that also proved the rotation of the Earth. Many museums and universities have Foucault pendulums on display.</p>

<p>Having discovered the evidence of God, they didn&#39;t want the sheep to know the truth, knowing that such a discovery would change the world in a profound way.

    <div class="md"><p>Ancient Near East
In early Egyptian[7] and Mesopotamian thought the world was portrayed as a flat disk floating in the ocean. A similar model is found in the Homeric account from the 8th century BC in which &quot;Okeanos, the personified body of water surrounding the circular surface of the Earth, is the begetter of all life and possibly of all gods.&quot;[8] The Israelites had a similar cosmology, with the earth as a flat disc floating on water beneath an arced firmament separating it from the heavens.[9]
Both Homer[13] and Hesiod[14] described a flat disc cosmography on the Shield of Achilles.[15][16] This poetic tradition of an earth-encircling (gaiaokhos) sea (Oceanus) and a flat disc also appears in Stasinus of Cyprus,[17] Mimnermus,[18] Aeschylus,[19] and Apollonius Rhodius.[20]</p>

<p>Ancient India
Ancient Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist cosmology held that the Earth is a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru)</p>

<p>Norse and Germanic
The ancient Norse and Germanic peoples believed in a flat Earth cosmography with the Earth surrounded by an ocean,</p>

<p>Ancient China
Further information: Chinese astronomy</p>

<p>In ancient China, the prevailing belief was that the Earth was flat and square, while the heavens were round,</p>

<p>Everybody knows about gravity so they all have some pretty awful &quot;explanations&quot; as to why it does not exist. There is seldom an explanation these guys can think of to explain Coriolis effect away, as in most cases they have never heard of it, and the shitty youtube channels they get their flat earth theories from have never heard of it either.</p>

<li><p>How would anyone know?  Who says there is an edge?  Some people think it could be an infinite plane. Our known world is thought to be enclosed by Antarctica <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rs8wjZYIEEg/VinyzHEsnAI/AAAAAAAAB4s/oRXi1JJ-kow/s1600/Azimuthal%2BEquidistant%2BProjection.jpg">which is a ring of ice</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>They&#39;re lights.  That&#39;s really all we know.  Could be spheres, but they&#39;d be much smaller and closer than mainstream science claims.</p></li>
<li><p>Gravity is only needed to explain a ball earth.  Why does something have to hold the earth together if it&#39;s a flat plane?  There aren&#39;t people standing upside down on the bottom in the flat earth model, so there&#39;s no need to explain a force that draws them to the center.  It&#39;s just up and down and density determines what rises and falls.</p></li>
<li><p>The sun is thought to circle roughly over the equator.  So the further you get away from it, the colder it will become.  Depending on the time of the year, <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2cec772233e8cfa4067f3b92a142d346?convert_to_webp=true">it&#39;s path changes so that it&#39;s over the topic of Cancer/topic of Capricorn</a>.  So during &quot;northern hemisphere&quot; winter the sun is further south, during summer it&#39;s further north.</p></li>
<li><p>Same as last, the sun is closer to the equator and furthest from the center of the circle of the earth (north pole) and Antarctica.  This makes them colder.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to burst your bubble dude but you are just so far off on #4 man.</p>

<p>I am going to go ahead and assume you have not studied meteorology or environmental science. Gravity is not the only thing that is explained perfectly by the round earth theory. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2mec3vgeaI">Coriolis force</a> is a great example of why the weather acts the way it does and why we are able to predict it.</p>

<p>Anyway back to your point #4 there. The equator being closer to the sun than the poles does account for <strong>slight</strong> temperature differences, but it is not even close to being the cause of why it is cold at the poles and hot at the equator. The amount of solar radiation that reaches the poles and places near the poles is so much less becasue of the fact that the earth is round. (It is a compressed sphere, imagine somebody standing on a beach ball flattening it a bit at the top and bottom but the rest remains spherical).</p>

<p>If you do not understand what I am trying to tell you (but you actually want to try to understand it) then go to <a href="http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/climate/sun_radiation_at_earth.html">this site</a> and look at the 2nd picture from the bottom of the page. You can click on the picture to see the difference in the suns energy at the equator, 30 degrees form the equator and 60 degrees from the equator. </p>

<p>The gist of it is that the same amount of light/solar radiation is dispersed over much more square footage as you distance yourself from the equator because of the compression of the earth near the poles.</p>

It&#39;s hypothesis attempting to explain our obeservations with the presumptions that the earth is round and the sun is giant and far away.  It isn&#39;t any sort of proof that those presumptions are true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you are right that a theory is a theory but everything i put forth is not theory, granted there are a lot of theories i put forward like gravity, etc. but these theories are based on facts like it or not. It is a fact based on years and years of measurement that the wind is drawn in opposite direction in each hemisphere (a fact supported by the theory of spherical earth but not by the theory of a flat one)</p>

<p>There were some facts, not theories but facts... For example, the fact that the poles are further from the sun than the equator but it does not make a big difference in solar radiation that reaches the surface is not a theory but a fact. You can measure the distance to the sun, you can measure the distance from pole to equator... These are measurements not theories. You can measure the energy/light and its speed. These are not theories but known constants.</p>

<p>You see, you can measure the amount of solar radiation that reaches the earth at various locations. And you can measure the amount that leaves the sun. You can also measure the distance between the earth and the sun. When you take these numbers you can see how far the poles of the earth are from the sun in comparison to the equator. You can use these numbers combined with the how much energy the light from the sun carries to see that there is actually factually a minute difference caused in temperature caused by the distance of the sun.</p>

<p>If you want to bother reading the links I provided you can maybe learn how to differentiate between what a theory is and what a fact based on scientific measurement is. From these facts theories arise, but fundamentally these theories are based on facts.</p>

<p>You can disagree or agree with the theories I have highlighted in my post, however it is fundamentally false to assert that all of what was put forward was theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>4,5.  If the sun was circling over a flat disk, and it moved closer to north during summer, this would make its orbit smaller.  That means either the 24 hour day would become shorter, or the sun would have to move slower, to compensate.  The inverse is also true.  During southern hemisphere summer, the path would be much longer than the &quot;24 hour&quot; cycle, so the sun would have to speed up significantly.</p>

<p>None of these byproducts of flat earth-sun rotation gibberish have ever been observed.  The sun doesn&#39;t change speed, and our day is still 24 hours.  I&#39;m eagerly awaiting a nonsensical, outlandish rebuttal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no religion.  I&#39;ve talked with flat earthers in the past, to fight back the onslaught of grotesque stupidity in the &quot;conspiracy&quot; genre.  </p>

<p>I first noticed the trend when YouTube tried to keep shoving this crap in my face.  if I looked at any conspiracy-type topics, YouTube decided that all of my recommended videos should be about flat earth.  I even had a couple family members mock me because they thought I was a stupid flathead.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at several hours worth of flat earth presentations with an open mind.  I wanted to check it out, because I&#39;m interested in alternative history/geology/etc.  After sitting through it, I saw that it was very easily proven false.  Not just &quot;debateable&quot;, or &quot;probably wrong&quot;, but completely and utterly falsifiable, and built on a foundation of complete ignorance.</p>

<p>I keep engaging in these debates, but I&#39;m losing hope that any flatheads will ever realize how demonstrably false their &quot;theory&quot; is.</p>

Think about it this way -- before one can begin to explain what&#39;s above, they should first understand what is just under their feet.
