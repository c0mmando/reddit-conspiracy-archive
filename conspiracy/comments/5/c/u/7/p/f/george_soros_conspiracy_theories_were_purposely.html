<p>I hear that usernames on Reddit beginning with the letter &quot;s&quot; and ending in &quot;n&quot; are pizza pedos.  No evidence, I hear it all the time.</p>

<p>How you search for evidence is: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do a search for Soros. (search engine of your choice) </p></li>
<li><p>Review results. </p>

<p>2A. Articles neutral or positive about Soros are propaganda, misleading, flat out lying, paid for by Soros, the damn MSM. </p>

<p>2B. Negative articles making tenuous connections and references to cabals, zionism, satanism, etc are always correct. These sites will often have names including words like &quot;truth&quot;, &quot;evolution&quot;, &quot;natural&quot;, &quot;planet&quot; etc. </p></li>
<li><p>Draw your conclusions, discard any information not fitting &quot;evil incarnate&quot; narrative. Feel free to incorporate paranormal activity and possibly pedophilia into your theory. (Bonus points if you find a picture of Soros eating pizza.)</p></li>

<p>As for Soros, he&#39;s been analyzed for quite some time in academia. He has been linked to many of the color revolutions in Eastern Europe, and he is likely tied to many other disruptive movements. The current protests and BLM movement are just two examples. Also, the guy has mental issues. You can watch interviews where he states that even from an early age he saw himself as something like a god and suffers from messianic delusions. </p>
