       Pardon my language.

      <p>
       So the election happened, and everyone lost their shit. I personally was more upset that the Clinton administration was caught red-handed when they cheated their way to the nomination, and no one did anything about it. But whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protests are still going on across the country. Los Angeles alone has been protesting every single night since Wednesday. I was there...
      </p>
      <p>
       People are angry. People are worried. Fuck, I've seen people burst into tears, it's like they're grieving. The fucking KKK is publicly organizing (just an example) and people are being hurt and killed, even.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now there's this Pizzagate bullshit! Have you guys looked at this?!?

       There's a significant amount of evidence that suggests our own fucking government is a part of some global, elitist, pedophilic sex trafficking cult clusterfuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...

       <strong>
        what
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And then I think about the Bohemian Grove, and Eyes Wide Shut and a number of other popular "theories"... and... I don't know, man. I feel like we are on the brink of mass exposure. I feel that now, more than EVER, we are in the best position for the truth to finally come out. NWO, shadow government, Rothschild Dynasty, Aliens from the future- WHATEVER THE FUCK.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am
       <em>
        sick
       </em>
       of feeling like I don't matter, of being lied to and brainwashed over, and over, and over, and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am
       <em>
        tired
       </em>
       of being distracted. We just sit back and do nothing when everything we need to change the world for the better is at our fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to do something. Read, write, contribute, dig deeper, we can't be afraid anymore.

       Jimmy Dore reported that Clinton got 6 million fewer votes than BO did in 2012.  Too many read Wikileaks.  They couldn't wag the dog enough.

       Yup. A family member of mine, though, tried to claim that the DNC was an independent organization and we either had to deal with it or switch parties. To her, that what Clinton did was how politics were played, and she's clearly the better player so we should vote for her.

       Voters like her were what made me think Clinton had this in the bag.

       Its good to hear that others have run into this logic.  I had a close personal friend tell me that all the shit that clinton and the foundation have done is "business as usual for politics" and that "it does not change their vote".  I was shocked, still to this day i am shocked.  I never supported Trump, but after watching Sanders at the DNC i knew that i could never vote for a Clinton.

       You would think that the DNC would have realized Clinton was not the best candidate at the convention.  They had to work really hard to quell a rebellion, but thought nothing of it.

       Yeah, I get that. But that sure as hell doesn't give the DNC license to elevate the candidate of their choosing. The impartiality clause means they should act as referees; not a decision committee that gets to ignore the will of the people.

       Same, and I stayed home this election (Sanders supporter)... which makes me look like an apathetic voter, when in actuality I just stopped believing in the political system.

       It took a Trump victory, of all things, to renew my faith that our votes might actually be legitimate.

       And they go out and burn down their own damned buses and convenience stores, instead of the DNC, and beat their neighbors up because they can't get to Trump, who is not the one who fucked them. WTF indeed.

       Yep Soros is paying to have protestors bused in to start these riots. It's taking advantage of the confusion/anger many are feeling after having been lied to all election season long by the media.

       Except, as revealed by the Podesta emails, Sanders was a plant.   He as never allowed to win, and exploited his popularity for a bigger payout.

       I feel we should focus mainly on Soros, CF and pizzagate and build 
a sober and comprehensible summary (backed with links to facts), while at the same time not be condecending of the fact they have been completely brainwashed and duped.

       we can also focus on generating memes (or ideas for memes) that can focus our intent. We can show the pepe (the avatar of Kek) doing things we want to see in the world (positive things, hopefully).

       It would be really helpful for me, if there were an accurate database that could be searchable by the common man. Any time somebody has a hunch, he could look up something.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a restaurant would most likely have a health inspector come by. Is it possible that only a certain health inspector inspects the locations that are associated with Hillary? It's such a small connection, but if the location has secret passages, then they wouldn't want strangers snooping around.

       Maybe one's reaction depends on how long you've been looking into conspiracy theories and how far down the rabbit hole you've gone. Been in CT land since 99, and this comes as no shock at all. In fact, it's exhilerating to see so many take an interest in this very, very difficult subject matter! But, if I were newer to the CT world, I can see how it would be devastating. I remember how physically ill and helpless  I felt when I read about the elite pedo ring stuff for the first time. It's nothing short of life changing.

       2001 here. Combination of a friend sharing a nurses CE course on the lies of the lipid hypothesis and how we've been lied to for decades so they can sell more cheap grains and manufactured products and scare us from eating meat and dairy from our farmers.

       Then 9/11 happened and it made no sense.  I kept waiting on jets to mobilize and nothing... and then of course the demo style collapses. But it took some weeks. I was in shock.  It hurt so bad.  Like how maybe it felt for Neo in the Matrix movie suddenly awake and disconnected and in an alien world that's actually his real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I read The Unseen Hand conspiratorial history book.  Oh... so much that never made sense suddenly did.

       The international pedo ring stuff has been a known unknown for a long long time. I remember HST writing about it in Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 72. It will never fully be exposed but certain players in it will be.

       I started at that time as well and generally I'd read about satanic pedo sacrifice shit in tandem with reptillians.  At that time it seemed like some lovecraft-fag wanted to make a Marquis de Sade fan fic that was too farfetched, unreasonable, and gross to be taken seriously.  Behold a pale horse was even a stretch.  An interesting stretch and we considered it all but believed little of it wholeheartedly... but everytime another "pizzagate" happens I'm like... "Ya knooooow..."

        Start with The Dutroux affair on Wikileaks. (not the nsfw site explaining it but the legal document) Here is a link to the translation:

        </a>
        This is a LEGAL document that ties into Franklin and explains the situation now. There is a reason it is not translated into English, only on there in French, and reason that the Belgians are sueing wikileaks to remove the doc.
Maybe the reason European aristocracy. Maybe it's military. Maybe it's deeper. KEEP LOOKING. PLEASE.
Here is a long explanation the covers almost everything and is well researched:

        It does not have NFSW images like other sites on this topic. PLEASE, KEEP RESEARCHING. THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. DO NOT GIVE UP.

       The protesters would be better served to direct their anger and destruction towards the media that lied and built this race war from the ground up. I grew sick of the fear porn years ago but anytime I saw what agenda was being pushed I was able to see right through it. Turn the tv of for 6 months and you will be surprised at how fake and obvious it is when you see it again. I think they may also run a subliminal subtext alongside the fear narrative and time away from the signal helps separate it and differentiate from your own thoughts.

       Television is a relatively new invention. The last couple generations have been glued to their screens, watching commercials and talking heads. We've been conditioned to want money, trophy wives, coca-cola. It's all bullshit, to keep us distracted from what's really going on. (Like Pizzagate!)

       The news media has created a panic and started a riot. They will not be held accountable. Best just keep your powder dry. The media will keep this going and try to cause division because people want answers to the questions proposed in the emails. Is our government run by Satanic pedophiles? How compromised is our national security after HRC's international pay for play scheme? I expect a huge false flag event to restore credibility to the media and make everyone afraid to ask questions.

       It's ignorant not to watch msm occasionally, I watch Fox and CNN. It gives you a much better idea of what they're pushing on people. Watching news doesn't mean you're agreeing with it, you just need to learn from it. So much can be inferred by comparing what we find online vs what is on cable news.

       Regarding PizzaGate...

      <p>
       They aren't just pedophiles...I'm sure some are, but its more about satanic ritual murder. Also, they most definitely are eating infants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a police interview with a child who escaped one of these satanic churches :

      </p>
      <p>
       They are chopping the heads off these children, draining and drinking their blood and cooking and eating them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if they were making the pizza sauce out of the blood and perhaps meat sauce.

       Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. This is reality. Unfortunately. Now we have to do something about it.

       This explains the connection between child syndicates and ritual murder.

       Also look up the Finders if you haven't seen that already - Ritual murder and sexual abuse are not separate entities - "spirit cooking" was a basically sanitized version of reality.

      </p>
      <p>
       When we watch the spirit cooking videos &amp; anything in that vein we are voluntarily participating in their rituals - as far as they are concerned. Gives them spiritual energy in their mind.

       Sadly, the children were in fact abused but if the findings of the courts are to be believed, the father and alleged cultmembers were not responsible.

       The bubble created by SJWs and cultural Marxists on "political correctness" has just popped.
      </p>
      <p>
       The brainwashed sheep are like broken machines who cannot logically process that their liberal Queen Hillary lost the election and that a "misogynistic, racist, xenophobic, bigot" won. I live in LA as well and the liberal idiots out here in my age group literally believe that Trump is going to put blacks, muslims, gays and women in concentration camps. The idiocy is at an all time high. I had a black girl I'm dating call me in TEARS on election night on "how could this happen.... why couldn't people just vote for Hillary?" it's so fucking goddamn pathetic.

       It's infuriating, really.  I kept my mouth shut on social media about my real opinions because I was pretty sure Clinton was going to run away with the whole thing.  But now that people actually decided they weren't going to tolerate her bullshit anymore, those who supported her (or more frequently, only supported her because of her gender OR because she was a better alternative to Trump) are fucking freaking out.  Believing everything they see in the media.  Turning a blind eye to the fact that the
       <em>
        media fucking profits off of every goddamned riot they report on
       </em>
       .  They don't make money reporting on cute kittens and puppies.  They make money off of blood, violence, instigating fear.  It started before the election and now it's just getting out of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       People I thought were fully rational before all this are completely turning their backs on any rational discussion of what's really going on out there, why people really voted for Trump and didn't support Clinton, why some facets of the country are frustrated and irritated with the status quo.  People won't listen.  "Oh, you didn't vote for Clinton?  That makes you a racist/fascist/bigot/misogynist/pedophile and I'm therefore going to disregard everything you say from now on."
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know when people are going to wake up, but the more the media stokes these flames, the worse it's gonna get.  MSM instigates something, everyone posts it to FB, and everyone who uses FB for their news freaks out.

       Yup, I completely understand! It feels like every conspiracy out there, particularly the really sinister ones are coming true. And I agree, we have to keep digging! I'm wondering at this point, what else they've lied to us about - because there's not much I'd put past an evil satanic cult.

       Soros is funding the protesters. Donald Trump is appointing a cabinet of snakes and going back on campaign promises. The elite want civil unrest and who better to implement a harsher police state than Trump. The candidate who pushes un-constitutional stop and frisk and wants to boost an already over fed military for more adventures in foreign land. Sure, Hillary was easily the most corrupt option but the American people had to choose between two new world order shills. You think Donald Trump has the peoples best interest in mind? Lets wait to see especially with the economy set to tank again.

       I have a small theory but I don't know where to put it, I don't want to create a post on its own so here it goes, I'm not a master at conspiracies so this is all I have:
      </p>
      <p>
       What if Russia is the puppet master behind everything going downhill these days? The brexit, the presidential election, just look at the polls for both events, the opposite happened, I'm not saying they have been both rigged but I'm.just thinking there could be a chance that they have been rigged by Russia in order to create chaos and division among the world; the UK is out of the EU and the american people are divided. Plus the entire world is focused on ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why would Russia do this? My answer is brief and simple, to reunite the Soviet Union without the rest of the world being able to do anything against them, it makes sense IMO, ever since they realized they couldn't have annexed crimea without triggering everyone from the United States to NATO and Europe.

       I disagree. Russia absolutely despises Soros to the point of having like, an international arrest warrant on him. If anything, I would believe Russia is feeding Trump information and when he takes office in January, they're going to crack down on the Clintons and every corrupt fuck surrounding them -- or at least try to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know Hillary has had some health problems as of late, but I mean, where has she been since the election? Besides the staged hiking photo, she's been MIA. Some are going as far as to speculate she's trying to skip town because she knows she's fucked.

       I hated Trump before this election, but seeing him change some of his policies while still seeming to be in cahoots with Putin is comfortably unnerving. You know?

       The world is not divided over the US election. That division as petty as it is, is not something that in and of itself is going to cause any freaky shit more than the already freaky shit you should be paying attention to, which is in America.

       You've got to realize that your local narrative from you wherever you are born on the other side of the planet is the same fear, the same ambition, and the same mistrust. That is what you must get a grips of. Your friends and enemies are everywhere on each side.

       You are talking about division. That division is obvious, it's on the news in protests, however you are also talking about the world, and the world's division after November 7th is less than the world's division before President Trump set foot into the Oval Office as President Elect. Seriously.

       I think both sides are being played. This is some Palatine level shit. Create a bunch of Mind controlled SJW, Get the system corruption out in the open. Then get a candidate who is seen as a xenophobe, and has a bad history with women. But who would appear to be against corruption. Then get him elected and have protest erupt. It gets out of hand national emergency declared. Then what happens next. It reads like a WWE script.

       Yes! This has been my fear since the summer when I knew a Trump presidency was eminent. I know someone was pulling the strings behind the scenes to ensure his success because the entire establishment was against him. When was the last time anything like this has ever happened? NEVER! So I started becoming suspicious about the shadowy figures that have created the situation we now find ourselves in. They've even used other smaller conspiracies (DNC leaks, pizzagate, FBI emails) to throw us all off the trail and make us think we're close to something. It's the classic long game approach! Allow your pawns to die so that the king and queen may live. The ones facing the public are just that, the pawns. I think we've all been distracted and duped! Everyone has become so riled up by Trump and Clinton and what they represent instead of who's pulling the strings. How did we let this happen? I'm scared that we maybe at the precipice of something far darker than any of us could image.

       Know how you feel, even here in little old NZ we are exactly the same our prime minister is a trichophilliac (hair fetishist) and was caught on several occasions pulling young girls ponytails and even systematically harassing a waitress yet nothing was done about it. He was sexually assaulting children on camera and no one made a peep, this shit is fucked.

       As for this election,  I still  consider it to have been a slow moving coup a fine production well coordinated by the perps, and their hand maidens that "(not)liberal." MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that some of the primary dirty tricks that were blamed on Hillary to have been produced by the conservative dirty tricks group not by the Hillary Campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe the big money behind Clinton knew the fix for the election was in and it was not money thrown away it only helped make this look like a legitimate election and so money invested that did pay off big.

       Your thoughts are valid. Although, to me it seems like it's just speculation. Whether or not you are right, the point is that it's all manipulated, regardless of whoever has the upper hand. And there is hard evidence to back it up this time. We're not crazy.

       Start with The Dutroux affair on Wikileaks. (not the nsfw site explaining it but the legal document) Here is a link to the translation:

      </p>
      <p>
       This is a LEGAL document that ties into Franklin and explains the situation now. There is a reason it is not translated into English, only on there in French, and reason that the Belgians are sueing wikileaks to remove the doc.

       Maybe the reason European aristocracy. Maybe it's military. Maybe it's deeper. KEEP LOOKING. PLEASE.

       Here is a long explanation the covers almost everything and is well researched:

       What's happening is that the current PTB are old as in Soros is in his 80s. New guys are coming to power which is why everyone is learning about Soros now.

       I actually think it's more that the user interactivity of the Internet screws them. Whenever you try to brainwash a room full of people there are probably always 2 or 3 of them that will see right through your bullcrap. In most existing media formats that 2 or 3 can't say anything, and so the masses are successfully brainwashed. On the Internet those 2 or 3 will just post the real facts, and it destroys the narrative.

       Yeah, but if they had started earlier they could have had the internet sewn up tight through regulation &amp; design... Everything could be a Walled Garden... they could have kept billions from getting together to team up to destroy the narrative.

       If you want the Red-Pill, then the truth is that the average human perception of reality is extremely misguided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consciousness is the driving force of the universe, and it is also one of the most powerful, if not THE most powerful element of human life.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said it very well with:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We need to do something. Read, write, contribute, dig deeper, we can't be afraid anymore.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But we also need to understand, and add - manifest. We have to envision the world changing for the better, and then we need to cultivate the faith that this will come true. The "shadow governments" that have so deftly guided humanity for all these years are well versed in these esoteric concepts. Their lies and brainwashing techniques were deliberate, and intelligently implemented. Unfortunately for them, as we continue to wake up and take control of our lives they will find themselves more and more outmatched.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are sick of feeling like you don't matter? Good. Stop it. You DO matter. We ALL matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never before in the history of this planet have we come this close to realizing, and meeting our true potential. Get excited. Be positive. Have compassion. Don't be afraid.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will succeed. As many of us have observed it has already begun. Each push forward creates more and more momentum. It is only a matter of time.

       We need to stop letting them dictate the rules of the game.  They 'suggest' to the masses that "he who has the gold makes the rules".  And the masses accept this suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's put the value on something other than gold.  How about knowledge and truth?  At least these are lasting values that don't shift second to second depending on the whims of whoever stumbled across some shiny rocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people hoarding the gold say "Well, I'm doing it to secure resources for my future generations because shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in 3 generations". And then They wonder why their empire crumbles when it's built on farcical values like "gold". Your empire is not meant to endure longer than that
       <em>
        because gold is not important
       </em>
       . And I'm sure this could be proven scientifically if someone could pull themselves out of the hypnotic trance of shiny objects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as a surface examination, has this 'strategy' worked for
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       <em>
        anywhere
       </em>
       in the history of the world?  These people are trying to start a fire with 300 can openers (gold) and it doesn't work so they reason to themselves "well, if I had only had 600 can openers (more gold) the fire would have started?" What?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe, this is what Trump represents.  Why, he hid his tax returns.  He doesn't
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       have any gold, but he convinced everyone he did.  Maybe, this
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       our big shift away from physical (gold) to mental (all you need now is just the
       <em>
        idea
       </em>
       of having gold). People may be saying they're ready to have their world defined by ideas and thoughts instead of materialism.

       What if the election
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       slightly rigged... but in favour of Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       It has often been said that whomever won the 2016 election would almost certainly be a one termer, because both DJT and HRC were terrible candidates.  Perhaps the endgame is to allow Trump to be so controversial, create so much social division, and mess so many things up that a handpicked Establishment-approved Democrat candidate would be brought in to save the day and wipe the floors and windows with him in 2020.

       More than likely, the GOP elites are going to try and impeach him. Pence and Ryan are their golden boys. Trump is going to try and be way more progressive than Democrats anticipated, but the GOP knew it was brewing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, in the first debate he said he wouldn't support the Republican nominee
       <em>
        if it wasn't him
       </em>
       , and wouldn't rule out running 3rd party. On the left, you had the outsider Bernie who was 3rd party his whole life who then switched to Democrat. The biggest populist rallying cries were based around "anti-establishment" candidates, and the neoliberals totally ignored it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is saying his cabinet is going to propose: mental health checks/criminal background checks for right to carry; a student loan debt relief plan; a reform of Obamacare rather than a total overhaul; and is clarifying his comments on immigration, suggesting we only deport exactly the people he talked about: criminals and rapists. It's funny, he appoints all these pro-government Republicans that liberals are terrified of, then says they're going to do exactly some of the things liberals could agree on. This may ruffle some feathers with the GOP establishment, as well as the global elite who use the "divide and conquer" narrative to keep us distracted from the real issues. There is terror brewing at the GOP, in spite of the stock market, Russia, and the collapse of the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll see how much of Trump's cabinet actually gets approved by Congress, and what stuff actually starts getting churned out after his first year in office. The neoliberals (Hillary, the MSM, Zionists, and all her pals) refuse to admit that Jacksonian American still exists, and had to learn the hard way that insulting peoples' intelligence is not going to work for their global empire. I can't tell whether Trump is anti-semite and pro-zionist, or pro-semite and anti-zionist, or what. I think he's going for the best of both worlds to appeal to a lot of people, but I don't know if the rest of the world will let him have his cake and eat it, too.

       Don't give them so much credit.
       <br/>
       They deliberately lose this election now to win the next one.
       <br/>
       Thats just stupid especially as this loss reinforces Brexit and weakens the eu, with more elections in europe coming up.
       <br/>
       I have never seen the msm so obviously biased since the Brexit referendum. 
Doesn't mean Trump is going to be great but they did not throw this for Trump.

       Yeah I agree. People have had this stupid theory the establishment wanted Trump all along. It was dumb months ago, and it's incredibly dumb now. The elites are incredibly hell bent on mass immigration. It's like issue number 1 for them. That alone is why they waged war on Trump's campaign. The fact he also helped kill their corporate take over trade deals TPP, and TTIP is more proof they didn't count on him.

       I am convinced the immigration thing is to build up enough resentment and tension to trigger a full on genocide.

       This would tie in with population reduction and a totallitarian one world govt. which would be the end goal.

       What's happened is...we spent so much time talking about conspiracies that we walked through the looking glass...and we live there now, man.

       Honestly, I kind of want to go back to where we knew about it before it was mainstream and there was very little outward confirmation of conspiracies all around us. Or consuming our daily life. Because wtf, this is tough shit to deal with.

       Check this out.  I am very sensitive to being lied to.  I pick up on inconsistencies and stories that just don't make sense.  The last month has been driving me bat shit crazy, because nothing makes sense to me, and I KNOW that there is more to be discovered when that happens.  This is my latest find.  I am not saying that it is the final answer, nor that it will be the last word.  But for today, it answers my questions...

       You know how we recently learned the agencies were running multiple CP sites as some sort of sting operation? What if they have been investigating this whole damn thing and were just waiting for the right time to pull the trigger on the global child trafficking thing. I mean....someone in the govt knows about this shit and hopefully they are on the right side of history. But not until now could they start bringing this out without getting "persuaded" not to. We kind of know there was strong anti-hillary type sentiment at the FBI...in the rank and file anyway.

       Friend, I can offer only my observations of both deciding sides of what this election became; I'm calling alot of BS, obviously. It's dripping from everyone's faces right now. Suppose the conspiracy in actual operation is that many of the world's strongest nations -- sick of dealing with the third world's problems, worried to hell about national identity due to multiculturalism, immigration, liberal fairy tales, true or perceived weakness, faithlessness being opposed by religious zealotry -- want to turn the focus back on themselves, getting along for economic prosperity, mutual benefit. The already strong must keep getting stronger, otherwise we stagnate, correct? Wiping out incompatible ideologies, faiths, cultures, usually far "weaker" but nonetheless dangerous, (and of course non-white races) is one way to get there. In the superworld to come, fascism of states will thrive in theory, creating an international trade alliance and promise to band together in defeating alternatives whenever they again arise. This will be a beautiful world for the ones who buy into it...the rest, not so much. Bullies, in other words, ganging together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm progressively seeing Trump's victory as the American stage for this phenomena. Who knows if the Russians and Assange had major hands in this (although if anyone could cook it up and pull it off, it's probably ex-KGB), and the opposition out here splintered between a pretty light let's be honest democratic socialism and the neoliberal establishment, with disastrous results for the party. Traditional republicans gave way to the popularity contest hydra of the Tea Party, the skill and charisma of the alt-right, a billionaire who simply exudes godlike success of a very grim but pragmatic kind, the long-suffering christian right, and a nation largely composed of people sick of being told their ways of life were not nationally up to par, that they were less evolved. The media said things were just fine, but THEIR media and candidate warned of the pending end of days, and presto.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC should be ashamed, but no one should or will go to prison. The Clinton's have been involved in some shady things, for sure, and are a dubious political dynasty. How this all turned into the great overarching ONE BIG NARRATIVE TO ENCOMPASS THEM ALL is fucking beyond me, honestly. It was either very carefully crafted and ramped up internationally and within, or is in fact the only conspiracy that has ever mattered, so, quick, let's bring in the strong and capitalist non-sickos to bring the biggest lie ever to justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say is that populist right wing movements worldwide have followed Brexit like a goddamn schematic, and the pieces will continue to line up. It is pragmatism in the face of threat and stagnation, even decline. However, recall, you can never predict when a rogue state will emerge, feeling left out of something they feel they deserve, more than the lot they've got at the moment. Then we'll just have to watch, and watch the fuck out.

       No. This kind of stuff is cyclic. Some pet theory becomes insanely popular for a while and then nothing comes out of it until the next one.

       It's the whole point in my opinion, these elections are just theatre. "If voting really mattered, they wouldn't let us do it". Everyone thought the fix was in for Hilary and this sub has been nothing but Hilary this Hilary that but look now and its pizzagate which makes me think that's another distraction.

       Something is brewing but unfortunately I can't see an uprising, only more bullshit to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.

       Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. This is reality. Unfortunately. Now we have to do something about it.

       This explains the connection between child syndicates and ritual murder.

       Also look up the Finders if you haven't seen that already - Ritual murder and sexual abuse are not separate entities - "spirit cooking" was a basically sanitized version of reality.

      </p>
      <p>
       When we watch the spirit cooking videos &amp; anything in that vein we are voluntarily participating in their rituals - as far as they are concerned. Gives them spiritual energy in their mind.

       Except, as revealed by the Podesta emails, Sanders was a plant.   He as never allowed to win, and exploited his popularity for a bigger payout.
