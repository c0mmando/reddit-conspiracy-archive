        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing some research in the past 24 or 48 hours just trying to figure some things out, and I came across a lot of interesting theories and information.</p>

<p>My biggest question right now which lead me down this path is: Why is Fox outing George Soros? </p>

<p>Fox is obviously mainstream media to some extent with rich backers.  Bush, a republican backed by Fox, most likely was related in some way to 9/11.  A video below from 2001 where Trump himself gives reasoning on why it was an inside job: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSSwXvsEX_c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSSwXvsEX_c</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that republicans are just as funded, corrupt, and bought as democrats.  So why would Fox out George Soros if they are with George Soros?  My theory is, Fox is not with George Soros, but they are a different group with separate interests.  I feel George Soros definitely is who he is, he is a bad guy that needs to go.  However, there is not much attention being paid to other billionaires or people involved.  Example e-mails below showing Rothchild involvement in Clintons campaign, getting almost no traction:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/1570">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/1570</a></p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8597">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8597</a></p>

<p>Now, onto the weird stuff.  We&#39;ve scratched the surface, we know some of the conspiracy theories are true.  But how deep does it go?  What about the hand signs, the illuminati, etc. how are they involved?</p>

<p>Actual illuminati website(ran tv ads)
<a href="https://illuminati.am/">https://illuminati.am/</a></p>

<p>(ad)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTRY2BEhXz8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTRY2BEhXz8</a></p>

<p>So Trump started to expose 9/11 in 2001, he just won presidency, but there is still a lot left unanswered.  Is Trump illuminati?  Is he anti establishment?  What is he?</p>

<p>Mano Cornuto hand sign:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLet-XWyHxc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLet-XWyHxc</a></p>

<p>This is something extremely uncomfortable to actually do with your hand.  If you try it, it will feel annoying.  For politicians to actually stand up in front of a crowd and make this hand sign, it&#39;s extremely weird just due to how uncomfortable it is to make the sign with your fingers.  It&#39;s not something naturally done while speaking.  Basically ALL politicians make this hand sign at some point, though I haven&#39;t researched it thoroughly enough to say who did or didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s where it gets strange: Trump does not use this hand sign, at all.  I looked but was unable to find anything where Trump is making this weird devil horn sign.  There is a picture of him with a rocker where he does it, but I can&#39;t find any time while he is talking naturally and just does it.  BUT, Trump uses the okay sign, A LOT.  </p>

<p>Example(just for the purpose of showing the hand symbols, don&#39;t really agree with the theories):
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kazaHYu5ET4&amp;t=410s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kazaHYu5ET4&amp;t=410s</a></p>

<p>Now, an explanation of the meaning:
<a href="http://www.conspirazzi.com/the-666-hand-sign/">http://www.conspirazzi.com/the-666-hand-sign/</a></p>

<p>The reason I linked this second site is because DIFFERENT RELIGIONS HAVE DIFFERENT MEANINGS FOR IT!  It&#39;s not a universal symbol of Satanism, rather it has some sort of greater occult, spiritual, or unknown meaning.  I have no clue since that&#39;s not my background.  But my opinion right now is that Trump is using this symbol for some purpose, it does have a meaning but it&#39;s unclear what.</p>

<p>Alex Jones using symbol(more examples but was too lazy to find a better video):
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv2INDHA76E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv2INDHA76E</a></p>

<p>Malik Obama(heavy Trump supporter - look at his profile pic!)
<a href="https://twitter.com/obamamalik">https://twitter.com/obamamalik</a></p>

<p>Okay, so we&#39;ve gotten to here.  What does this mean?  Watch this Alex Jones video, and start around 10 minutes 30 seconds(he uses the hand sign a lot in this video here as well but not main point).  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/trump-is-not-going-back-on-his-promises-media-lies-again/">http://www.infowars.com/trump-is-not-going-back-on-his-promises-media-lies-again/</a></p>

<p>The last 5 minutes is EXTREMELY weird.  The way Alex talks is creepy, sounds strange, like he is delivering a hidden message.  When he talks about pulling Excalibur, it sounds extremely cryptic, like they are personally fighting some battle against some group he knows really well.</p>

<p>Lastly, I will leave with a few more links to close that are really creepy but tie some things to together.  Here&#39;s the first one:</p>

<p><a href="https://pepethefrogfaith.wordpress.com/">https://pepethefrogfaith.wordpress.com/</a></p>

<p>Now, after reading that, look at this(the only god found on a card in this game, strange coincidence isn&#39;t it):
<a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=illuminati+frog+card&amp;view=detailv2&amp;&amp;id=B35535E5DC16A558FB0326411D906EADF6511533&amp;selectedIndex=0&amp;ccid=wO94B6JH&amp;simid=607986285937885820&amp;thid=OIP.Mc0ef7807a247c38cac3e8388f499355bH0&amp;ajaxhist=0">http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=illuminati+frog+card&amp;view=detailv2&amp;&amp;id=B35535E5DC16A558FB0326411D906EADF6511533&amp;selectedIndex=0&amp;ccid=wO94B6JH&amp;simid=607986285937885820&amp;thid=OIP.Mc0ef7807a247c38cac3e8388f499355bH0&amp;ajaxhist=0</a></p>

<p>This strongly hints that there is some ancient god behind Trump(notice that Hillary wanted it banned).  So what does this mean?  Who the fuck knows tbh.  However, I have a feeling that something is going to change, and that this is not just another election.  I just wanted to share what I found and see what people think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  I also wanted to add something that I forgot to mention in my original post: that card game is from the early 90s and had a card depicting the world trade centers falling, the pentagon, and some other things.  I didn&#39;t mention it because I kind of assumed those to be known knowledge.  </p>

<p>However, why is a card game from the early 90&#39;s referencing the Egyptian frog god to be THAT important, the ONLY god mentioned in the illuminati card game at all?  And now, 20 years later, people by &quot;coincidence&quot; start in jest say they are worshiping kek the frog god.  That image was posted around 4chan so people know the theory and still do it because they aren&#39;t taking it seriously... but why would a card be referencing it 20 years before in the illuminati card game?  it&#39;s just creepy.</p>

<p>edit: I got years wrong, actually was 20 years before</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right.</p>

<p>I see trump flash the freemason symbolism, but he also flashes the 666 ( watch any of his speeches ).</p>

<p>He also during his speeches makes an L shape with his fingers. L=3 in pathagoryean numerology. 33.</p>

<p>Either they are part of the same cult OR they are warring factions of different cults.</p>

<p>The question is, does his sect eat infants, drink baby blood and rape infants like Hillary&#39;s pizza community does?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My gut is that fox is in the same boat at CNN abc NBC and info wars is owned by fox. Alex Jones tells the truth under the pretense that no one will take him seriously because of how he says it. Trump, Assange, James OKeefe, Trey Gowdy and others are clean and doing everything for the people. </p>

<p>Fox is outing Soros because the evil Ppl are not all one tight organization. If the media sees that hillary will lose, they are fine having public opinion be that hillary is going to lose. Same with Soros. Hes not able to get away with his usual bs because of social media and the general awakedness right now so the media will tell you Hillary&#39;s backer is who he is. But what they didn&#39;t say is that there&#39;s a global network of these crooks and they own the media and every other industry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With regards to Fox, Murdoch is his own beast and a very powerful one at that. If anything he is sticking to his agenda because he knows there is market share for it and he has a very devoted &amp; obvious customer base. Thus, he is getting a piece of the pie from the other networks, one that perhaps he is &quot;allowed&quot; to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right but we needa not rule out the possibilty that those are the good guys. Only time will tell. All i know for sure is i cant pin shit on them and the ppl that have had their foot on our neck all these years, I hate the fuck out of em. So maybe this is just one of those times where the enemy of my enemy is our friends. Cant be scared to atleast give this a go. Lets route out all the evil we know of and reset back to real freedom. And then deal/stop/oppose the things, with new and reset ppl on better ground than we were 2 weeks ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a feeling that they are still the good guys.  It&#39;s hard to explain, but I think the world is not so cut and dry.  I feel like the goal is to get rid of the current establishment just for the purpose of making things more fair again.  I do however, think there are multiple people in power with different goals.  So for example, you take down Soros, you still have Saudi princes.  You take them down, you still have Rothschild and Rockefeller.  Maybe even if they got taken down, Rupert Murdoch might still be in on this.  Etc.</p>

<p>I think trump could be part of something, but I think whatever he is part of is still doing this because they want to get rid of the problems going on.</p>

<p>Btw this was a good link that I just recently found after posting that supports my view:</p>

<p><a href="http://benjaminfulford.net/2016/11/07/the-cabal-will-be-defeated-no-matter-who-wins-the-us-presidential-farce/">http://benjaminfulford.net/2016/11/07/the-cabal-will-be-defeated-no-matter-who-wins-the-us-presidential-farce/</a></p>

<p>His theory seems to be that Trump is part of an illuminati group trying to get rid of the bloodlines controlling the country, and want a system where people get in power based on merit.  That sounds good to me tbh.</p>

<p>Edit: Also want to add I&#39;m not well researched or even an expert, I&#39;m just using google and looking around online and seeing what&#39;s out there.  My goal is to find some sort of world view that makes sense and doesn&#39;t have holes in it.</p>

<p>double edit: Also wanted to add that I think there&#39;s no way to say for sure what is 100% true.  Here are some other possibilities:</p>

<p>1) Alex Jones could be establishment and Trump/Assange are not.</p>

<p>2) It doesn&#39;t go that deep and we should take it at face value(Trump, Alex Jones, and Assange are not establishment, control doesn&#39;t run that deep)</p>

<p>3)The absolute worst scenario, which means we&#39;ve already lost - Trump, Assange, and Alex Jones are all establishment.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s scenario 3 it&#39;s already over, because in that case you can say it&#39;s controlled so heavily that there is no possibility of us even overcoming it. If they planned for Trump to get elected, it&#39;s probably for a really, really bad scenario.  My personal feeling though is that Trump is actually disliked and they didn&#39;t want him to win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing:  I&#39;m just connecting the dots.  You can take your own conclusions from it.  I&#39;m not claiming to have any actual knowledge or insight.  I just felt it was WEIRD that there was a frog god card in the game, seemingly random.  10 years ago someone would have seen that and think it seems so out of place and goofy.  Without the context we have today, why would anyone include that in a card game from 95?  It doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>
