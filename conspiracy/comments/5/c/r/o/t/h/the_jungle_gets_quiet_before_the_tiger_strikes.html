<p>This was tried in 2012, they didn&#39;t have enough removed, this year they had a list with 50 million names, called Cross Check to use to remove voters from registration lists. </p>

<p>What does that even mean?</p>

<p>The only one hacking computers was team Clinton.</p>

<p>Regardless, the reason people don&#39;t care to even think about it is because of the 1984 levels of propaganda from the left and msm. How there are people who voted while believing Wikileaks was fake or just simply ignoring it, is beyond me.  That should be a metric right there: if you voted without reading through some wikileaks, you&#39;re barred from ever voting again, you twat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you and agree that is why when a state had a narrow vote the vote count is slowed and adjustments are made and making smallish adjustments at several precincts versus big changes at one or to it is less likely to raise questions.   I think the Clinton primary elections were used for practicing this in each state with a close vote, Michigan an Missouri during the Primaries for example the final count was delayed and they tipped to HC.</p>

<p>A race that I want to look at is Issa&#39;s California Congressional District 49. </p>
