       I want to know why of all the conspiracy theory web sites I visit exactly 0 have come up with the idea Trump hacked computers in a few key districts to remove votes and exit polls in those directs are strangely off point compared to other exit pollsðŸ¤”

       If you've seen the "Why aren't I ahead by 50 points?" video, you'd know that, if this was a long con, she wasn't in on it.

       Maybe it was rigged for Trump, but no way Clinton knew the last laugh was on her, at least until the last 24-36 hours or so.

       If Hillary didn't know and I lean that direction, some of her campaign staff did. But how could Hillary herself have missed the stupendous number of voters removed from registration lists this year? (*removed)
      </p>
      <p>
       This was tried in 2012, they didn't have enough removed, this year they had a list with 50 million names, called Cross Check to use to remove voters from registration lists.

       Since this was a very dirty election maybe she was a mole for the conservatives or a third way darling?  I find nearly everything questionable about this year's Presidential selection, not election very questionable.

       Regardless, the reason people don't care to even think about it is because of the 1984 levels of propaganda from the left and msm. How there are people who voted while believing Wikileaks was fake or just simply ignoring it, is beyond me.  That should be a metric right there: if you voted without reading through some wikileaks, you're barred from ever voting again, you twat.

       I believe you and agree that is why when a state had a narrow vote the vote count is slowed and adjustments are made and making smallish adjustments at several precincts versus big changes at one or to it is less likely to raise questions.   I think the Clinton primary elections were used for practicing this in each state with a close vote, Michigan an Missouri during the Primaries for example the final count was delayed and they tipped to HC.

       A race that I want to look at is Issa's California Congressional District 49.

       You are correct I looked at a page that had not been updated.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were some that were close then the count was delayed, and then they went Hillary, Missouri was one, I have to go look again for the others.

       I don't think we get a redo on national elections.  It is now in the hands of the electoral college if they create a tie then it is the House who chooses.
