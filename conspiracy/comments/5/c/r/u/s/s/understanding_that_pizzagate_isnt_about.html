<p>They aren&#39;t just pedophiles...I&#39;m sure some are, but its more about religious ritual. </p>

<p>Also, they most definitely are eating infants.</p>

<p>They are chopping the heads off these children, draining and drinking their blood, cooking and eating them, then collecting and wearing the skulls and bones.</p>

<p>Followed by ritual dance and most likely singing hymns to the god ISIS.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they were making the pizza sauce out of the blood and perhaps meat sauce.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t you yanks suppose to have religious freedom anyway?</p>

<p>Here is a police interview with a child who escaped one of these satanic churches :</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Evidence concerning Moloch worship in ancient Israel is found in the legal, as well as in the historical and prophetic literature of the Bible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Other biblical texts refer to the sacrifice of children. Psalms 106:37–38 speaks of child sacrifice to the unnamed idols of Canaan. In prophetic sources, Jeremiah 7:31 and Ezekiel 20:25–6 speak disapprovingly of sacrificing children to Yahweh (for the &quot;bad statutes&quot; referred to by Ezekiel, see Ex. 22:28–29; but see Friebel); Jeremiah 19:5 speaks of sacrificing children to Baal; Ezekiel 16:21, 20:31, 23:37, 39 of sacrificing children to unnamed divinities; as does Isaiah 57:5. In none of these is there a mention of Moloch. <strong>Only in Jeremiah 32:35 is Moloch mentioned by name and there he is associated with Baal.</strong>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but i read they praise moloch. It&#39;s mentioned in wikileaks. It&#39;s on the pizza owners instagram. I see MM everywhere. So I don&#39;t understand how why your comment would convince otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was not aiming to convince you of any narrative, my friend. Just posted a quote that you are free to do what you would like to with.</p>

<p>I feel like there are a lot of names for the same false deities these people are paying homage to/worshipping. Even the Celtic &quot;deity&quot; <em>Crom</em> Cruach has apparently been associated with child sacrifice and Moloch.</p>

<p>But I totally get you on the <strong>MM</strong> thing. <strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong> seems to be the first or most significant &quot;Presidential&quot;-level MK-ultra &quot;sex slave&quot;. <strong>Marilyn Manson</strong> deliberately used her first name and Charles Manson&#39;s surname to create a dualistic name with two Ms. <strong>Lady Gaga</strong> has referred to herself as &quot;<strong>Mother Monster</strong>&quot;. &quot;<strong>M</strong>&quot; is the <strong>13th</strong> letter of the alphabet. &quot;<strong>MM</strong>&quot; was on one side of the cube found at the <strong>Georgia Guidestones</strong>.</p>

<p>Unless we&#39;re trying to get initiated, it seems the specific details will always be question marks for us. </p>

<p>The rabbit hole goes so deep, one could waste their entire life trying to discover all the little side tunnels, for no ultimate gain! That&#39;s the deceptive part of it. It goes on and on, but none of it is any true &quot;knowledge&quot; or &quot;<em>enlightenment</em>&quot;. Those who <em>are</em> initiated ultimately realize that too, but they unfortunately they do not realize it until they know too much to walk away from it. They&#39;ve been had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those kids are telling the truth</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is in the article as I haven&#39;t got the time to read it all right now. I did look into this a few weeks ago. Alisa and Gabriel later claimed that the whole story was made up and they were coached to lie by their step father. This doesn&#39;t add up to me, because it was supposedly the mother and stepfather trying to get the biological father locked up, but if that were the case, why involve all the teachers of the school in the story with details that could easily be proven untrue (secret basement in Mr. Hollings house for example)? Medical reports show that both Alisa and Gabriel had injuries consistent with their story. So either the step dad was raping them, or their story is true but they were somehow convinced to tell the detectives it was all made up. When Gabriel was called out by the detective that he was lying, Gabriel didn&#39;t say the whole thing was a lie, he just said he exaggerated how often they killed babies, whereas Alisa admitted the whole story was made up. I believe the mother and step father fled the country and the children are now in foster care. Alisa says she has nightmares every night about her father killing them. The full interviews are online but they often get taken down so it&#39;s hard to find them. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi61QZPNzN0">Here&#39;s a good starting point</a> for anyone interested in digging into this. Warning, if this is true, it&#39;s extremely sickening. This little girl is talking about beheading and eating babies and she isn&#39;t even fazed by any of it. Really horrible to watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in these rituals, and I believe they have a purpose, but I don&#39;t think the more intelligent of these elites believe in some supernatural existence of some pagan god. </p>

<p>Rituals are symbolic and they demonstrate power. They instill power in the minds of leaders and they can instill both power and fear in lower ranking members.</p>

<p>And as said, if some lower ranking, or more inept members choose to believe that there is some god they owe some sacrifice too (like perhaps Alistaire Crowley might have 120 years ago), then that&#39;s probably good for everyone... But the leaders, the smart ones, know that the ritual is all part of affecting the mind, not to pay tribute to some magic being with a Ram&#39;s head, who breathes fire and knows Dumbledore. </p>

<p>Further, the one eye symbols or the many others you see celebs give on TV, if they are symbols, are again, not necessarily to pay tribute to a pagan God imagined by a bunch of stone and bronze age humans, but it&#39;s more of a &quot;I&#39;m in this club and respect it&quot; thing. More like a &quot;Hail Hydra&quot;.</p>
