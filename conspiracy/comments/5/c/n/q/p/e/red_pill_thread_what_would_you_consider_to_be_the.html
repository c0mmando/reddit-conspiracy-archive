<p>Let this be an information EXPLOSION thread.  </p>

<p>From all you&#39;ve learned thus far, what would you consider to be the ABSOLUTE MOST important information for all humans to know ?  </p>

<p>EDIT: My Turn:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Thought causes Emotion.<br/></li>
<li>Humans are more electrical than material.<br/></li>
<li>Humans are magnetic and as they decide to do something - that experience is drawn in specific directions according to that human&#39;s dominant emotional output with regard to that topic and in general.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>There are no accidents.<br/>
Experience is dictated by vibrational matches.<br/>
Emotions exist to inform us what our vibration is on a given topic and therefore what our experience will be with it.  </p>

<p>Form a perspective that causes positive emotion regarding all things. You can control your experience by controlling your emotional output.  </p>

<p>Good day, human.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Heads up; tried to post this earlier and it got removed nice first encounter with this sub posting something).
..............................................................</p>

<p>I think he has a point about Russia. I&#39;m a longtime lurker of /conspiracy. Yet now I feel the need to post a (my first) response. </p>

<p><strong>On the fact that /conspiracy got played.</strong>
Trump won the presidency and this whole sub turned dead for a while. No-one posted anything. </p>

<p>Before that it had started an &quot;alliance&quot; with /the_donald and had podesta mails &quot;breaking!&quot; every time you checked this page. I mean trump couldn&#39;t ask for better. Yet now, no podesta and it seems, anything posted by someone from conspiracy to the /the_donald is being <a href="https://redd.it/5cor19">blocked</a>. <em>Meaning your job has been fulfilled</em>.
Watch this KGB defector <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XA">Yuri Bezmenov</a> explain. </p>

<p>This sub is following anything that Clinton did, yet forgets Trump might also have some skeletons in his closet. Putin is much happier with Trump in office then Clinton. Not that I like Clinton, yet seeing that Clinton (+/-30 years) probably knows how Putin operates. Trump probably has no idea. Putin is rooting for Trump seeing him as the weak guy, easy to manipulate. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5b2p5g/why_vladimir_putins_russia_is_backing_trump/d9lnah7/">Read this important sum up</a>.</p>

<p><em>The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia by Alexander Dugin</em>. Is I could say the opposite of <strong>The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy And Its Geostrategic Imperatives by Zbigniew Brzezi≈Ñski</strong>. </p>

<p>Now i&#39;m not against Geostrategic thinking i&#39;m only opposing the fact that one should dominate the other one. The consequences are bad. It&#39;s a Hegels dialect ad infinitum I know. </p>

<p>I think forces should stop each other from making morally bad decisions till an equilibrium exist. That benefits this planet and everyone inhabiting in it. As for this sub conspiracy should all be about freethinking. And Freethinkers like myself should be using a range of tools like skepticism and logical thinking. Plus be aware of not becoming biased.  See this list on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">congnitve_biases</a> </p>

<p>I think this sub is becoming trapped in one mode of thinking. And that means its becoming a drone. A puppet in the hands of others. People like David Icke, Alex Jones and others might be taking advantage of that. They need to make a living and how better than telling you exactly what you want to hear. I mean just look at how sophisticated Alex Jones has become. </p>

<p>We humans seem to be walking, looking up at the stars and not being able to see the hole in front of us. The information is sometimes right there! For example the propaganda with Mark Wahlberg in Deep Horizon about the BP oil spill. I mean is that the &quot;true&quot; story that kids are going to believe in a decade from now?</p>

<p>Besided all the negative, the <strong>positive</strong> thing about this sub is, it has <strong>power</strong>. It looks at governments, institutions and companies with scrutiny and tries to openly discuss this with people. How insane it might seem, yet telling people 1000 years ago that I could communicate through a screen with other people on other continents, would have made the same impression. This sub let&#39;s people think. Maybe not all of it is true, maybe just a little part of it or not at all. That&#39;s the beauty of it. It&#39;s like being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">scientist</a>.</p>

<p>I get to think of that picture that circulates on here, about sheep voting for the lion or the wolf. It couldn&#39;t be more true, yet some people need a lion or a wolf for a leader. To defend the sheep from the other lions and wolfs out there. Much better would be a border collie for a leader. And even better would be if the sheep turned into shepherds. I guess this sub can be that shepherd. Keeping an eye on the wolfs and lions.</p>

<p>Dont trust anything, even from me. Be your own Guru.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an advanced global antediluvian culture, the survivors of which have been struggling against the forces that caused the various cataclysmic events that shattered their strongholds around the globe. This wasn&#39;t one large global flooding event but many smaller events that would seem just as devastating if you were in the midst of one. This all happened very recently within the last 1000 years and the cultures that have held onto the teachings of the survivors for the longest are to this day being persecuted. If you want to find the remnants of the survivors best to look at those countries who have had the most oppressive dictators. It takes absolute power to erase the memory of an entire global empire. Also follow the symbols the global symbols of the cross the crescent the swastika the 6 pointed star and the double headed eagle to name a few. Also follow the  architecture, there is no such thing as neoclassical architecture only survivors style which can be found on every single continent along with polygonal masonry. The reason we don&#39;t recognize the use of high technology from this culture is because their tech took on a much more environmentally friendly form taking special care fusing nature with man made construction.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The concept of a &quot;missing link&quot; between humans and apes arose in the 19th century, when the fossil record was largely incomplete. Large gaps separated species, casting doubt on the theory of evolution. But in the last 130 years, a plethora of fossils have been discovered, greatly narrowing the gaps between species. The Australopithecus afarensis fossil known as &quot;Lucy&quot; is considered to be a key fossil bridging the gap between humans and primitive hominids.</p>

<p>Just because you apparently aren&#39;t capable of remembering your own posts, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve provided nothing.</p>

<p>You believe Trump to be anti-establishment - this is nonsensical intentional ignorance.</p>

<p>You &quot;believed&quot; that the Earth could be concave - this is an intentionally ignorant anti-scientific belief.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t believe in evolution - this requires ignoring things that are literally taking place in front of us in order to perpetuate a nonsensical anti-scientific belief bordering on fanaticism.</p>

<p>It really isn&#39;t my fault that you simultaneously post nonsensical ignorance while forgetting it at the same time, but what it does do, is plainly put your motives on display.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evidence for evolution? Do a damn Google search. The most cited one is the pepper moths. They were white moths and after industrialization, the moths turned black because that was their environment anymore. Their white camouflage they had to blend in to trees didn&#39;t work anymore because of the black smoke. So those moths who were black got selected for while the white moths got selected against and in 20 years, 90 percent of this population was black moths. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t be assed to type up very basic things about evolution that are simple for you to search. If you can search for things to deny evolution, you can search for the actual facts about and and how we see how it occurs. </p>

<p>Read Darwin, read Dawkins. After that, if you still have any questions we can talk but you have to give up your willing ignorance on this subject. </p>

Presidents (all) are controlled by power brokers and we are kept safe and some what shielded from one person gaining too much power by a shadow government. The secret service (always two feet away) is as much to protect the president as it is to protect us from the president. Presidents have a realm of actions even before checks and balances they are allowed. I&#39;d guess they have a heart stopper/pace-maker placed and if they act out of line, heart attack, end of the road. </p>

But there&#39;s hope for the future since the good guys will return and restore the earth and humans to perfection. What we&#39;ve basically had the past  6000 years is an experiment in if Satan and humans can rule themselves successfully, of course it&#39;s failing miserably but it proves that God was right in his original order of things. Read the bible folks, they brainwash you to think it&#39;s a myth and joke but it has the answers.
