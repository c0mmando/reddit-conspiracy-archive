We can downvote and argue and post, but we can&#39;t fight something bigger than we are. The Clinton apparatus was much bigger than those of us who supported Sanders and even as we watched the robbery take place, even as we read the emails that confirmed how it took place, we did nothing and I don&#39;t anticipate that changing.

<p>um: &quot;Yes We Can&quot; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqALdkTArqs">&lt;thank you satan&gt;</a>)</p>

<p>We <em>did</em> fight something larger than we are, and we <em>did</em> win.  Sorry you don&#39;t see it that way but we just forced the illuminati to go with their backup choice instead of installing a mass murderer into the white house.  &quot;But he&#39;s a Nazi who will kill all us gay people&quot;.  Um No he&#39;s not.  There&#39;s no evidence.  &quot;But he&#39;s xenophobic&quot;.  No he&#39;s not, but a vast majority of people in america do not want a flood of syrians to come into america because of all the raping they&#39;ve been doing in germany.  Sorry but you&#39;re arguments are invalid you low information ppl.  But here I&#39;ll help you guys out anyway: </p>

<p>There was coup-d&#39;etat that happend on 9/11 with the neocons because of starting the COG; it&#39;s been continued by Obama as an illegal shadow government: Hillary and BIll are a part of it and always were.  Trump is not a part of it: yet.  Right now they are grooming him...we know this because of the constant surrounding by Jesuits.  </p>

DNC stole the election form Bernie,Some blue states went red, Congress is red, Executive is red and now the judicial  looks like it could be red to. Most people I have talked to that protested where puppets of people. They didn&#39;t know who Donna Brazile is or why Debbie Wasserman steped down. I feel pity for those poor people protesting in ignorance and have tried to red pill them, but it is always Russia hackers this, Trump once farted in a chruch that.</p>

Expose how politically misinformed they are yet they still take to the streets as if they are politically righteous and understand the breadth of the situation.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard all manner of excuses for Trump&#39;s win. My absolute favorite is when I brought up black voter turnout... &quot;Why is it that less blacks went out to vote, and why did more of them vote for Republicans and third parties this election cycle?&quot; They don&#39;t want to admit that their candidate failed to engage people. I got all sorts of excuses... voter ID laws, gerrymandering(how does that affect turnout?), minorities are scared to vote(?) etc... It&#39;s of course the racist whites&#39; fault that Trump got in. For fuck&#39;s sake, racist white people? I was literally just told that you shouldn&#39;t expect black people to express their agency, you can&#39;t expect them to go out and vote; in other words, they&#39;re just <em>black people</em> and you should know better than to think they should be responsible for anything. But the Trump voters are the racist ones.</p>

<p>Oh, my fucking sides.</p>

<p>We all told them in the spring... Bernie wins against Trump. Hillary doesn&#39;t. Every poll showed it and every rally echoed the sentiment. And what the fuck do they do about it? They steal the nomination from him, overlooking democratic principles to get her in. DNC email leaks show it in great detail. The emails are indefensible and even if they weren&#39;t, the organization&#39;s actions prove the shady dealings around Clinton. The DNC head at the time stepped down. The one before her, who recommended her for the position, was Clinton&#39;s running mate. The one after her was caught leaking debate and town-hall questions to Clinton and got her ass fired from CNN. But they ignored it all and voted for the dirty cunt anyway.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, yes, that is the discussion we should be having. I would have voted for Bernie instead of Trump, myself. But we&#39;re not going to have that discussion - the regressive cultists that fervently supported Hillary have done too much to apologize for, and they know it. Despite knowing they were wrong, they have to keep pressing forward because it&#39;s too hard to turn around and mend all the things they broke. It&#39;s so much easier to double down and blame everyone else instead of pointing the finger in a mirror.</p>
