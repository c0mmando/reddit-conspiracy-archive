    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the whole thing was a total set up to ferment a civil war.  Clinton and Trump both in on the act, all of her being openly corrupt, rubbing your nose in it.  Then you get Trump who was bought off years ago.  Next they&#39;ll throw some people under the bus and Trump will claim Washington is cleaner than ever.  The only problem being, the people they threw under the bus were the last clean people remaining.  Then Trump will turn the screws of complete tyranny until civil war breaks out.  Let everyone murder each other for a few weeks and finally br8ng in the military to hose down whoever is remaining.  8nstant population reduction.  Just what they want.</p>

<p>Take his strongest policies and the wall is not going to happen even if does it doesn&#39;t really do anything except to its citizens.</p>

<p>Obamacare a package that was fought tooth and nail to achieve. Then they simply exploited its loopholes turning that on its head by driving up the price that should have had a clause, but it wouldn&#39;t have passed with a clause. Using it for any later agenda, because hey it was a good plan.</p>

<p>Infrastructure improvements should have been done regardless, except it provides the illusion that some low paid workers will be employed for the duration of term. Although this adds to the already inflating deficit giving the banks more spend power through any government bonds, that they will have to print money, or sell to get a return. Causing what effect on the currency?</p>

<p>The rest are skeptical, because he hasn&#39;t gotten in yet and I don&#39;t want to go through them without giving them a chance.</p>

<p>Trade squeeze China picking and choosing partners from overseas, will only hike inflation and cause those markets to destabilise costing whom.</p>
