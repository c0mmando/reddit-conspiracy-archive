       They have apparently had a plan to use Trump as a puppet to get grass roots support. His cult of personality was co-oped by big business interests to appeal to those they left behind. It's an amazing turn of events. Drain the swamp? Looks like we just unleashed the swamp.

       There is no such thing as the alt right.  A mass of autistic internet know-how's, who are only in it for the laughs does not constitute a political ideology.  They supported trump because they knew it would piss people off.

       I'll check our those documentaries tonight, but at first glance they look just as crazy as people on the other side who call global warming a hoax.

       Meet the new boss.  Same as the old bosses.   But don't worry, when the economic underpinnings of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness are in shambles, we can look down and feel really good about all the proper and deserving rage-targets that the new guard painted for us - and all the heads on pikes that line the streets.

       Maybe the whole thing was a total set up to ferment a civil war.  Clinton and Trump both in on the act, all of her being openly corrupt, rubbing your nose in it.  Then you get Trump who was bought off years ago.  Next they'll throw some people under the bus and Trump will claim Washington is cleaner than ever.  The only problem being, the people they threw under the bus were the last clean people remaining.  Then Trump will turn the screws of complete tyranny until civil war breaks out.  Let everyone murder each other for a few weeks and finally br8ng in the military to hose down whoever is remaining.  8nstant population reduction.  Just what they want.

       Obamacare a package that was fought tooth and nail to achieve. Then they simply exploited its loopholes turning that on its head by driving up the price that should have had a clause, but it wouldn't have passed with a clause. Using it for any later agenda, because hey it was a good plan.

       Infrastructure improvements should have been done regardless, except it provides the illusion that some low paid workers will be employed for the duration of term. Although this adds to the already inflating deficit giving the banks more spend power through any government bonds, that they will have to print money, or sell to get a return. Causing what effect on the currency?

       The media helped Trump by giving him the image of being persecuted while at the same time putting his face and message on TV 24/7 without regard for good journalism. They pushed him for ratings that's all, now he's proving that he was not at all genuine in changing curruption in Washington. Not that Hillary would have obviously, but she didn't make that promise every single day. I'm extremely disappointed in him.

       Because he knows them and they will follow his orders. Stop being so damn needy and feel-y and crying in 10 seconds. Who cares what his team is like? We'll see what he does, starting January 22th. Until then he has the time to figure out what to do.

       funny how people that were against him were crying that he didn't have the experience, and now he brings in people that know how the system works, and they cry about that too.

       I'm just voicing healthy skepticism and hoped for the accountability that he promised to everyone. His kids are deciding the people getting appointed before they leave to run his businesses. People that voted for him need to hold him to his core promise.
