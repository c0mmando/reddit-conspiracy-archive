I mean, I&#39;ve known about this shit for years, but now it&#39;s hitting the mainstream and going viral on the internet, which is unprecedented. It is literally right up in our faces. </p>

<p>Now, the elite are <em>illuminated</em> into knowledge, they know exactly what they&#39;re doing, and they seem to wholeheartedly believe in it all. I highly doubt that the elite would be &#39;sacrificing chickens to Moloch&#39; for no fucking reason.... </p>

<p>So, here I sit, contemplating the implications of the elite&#39;s religious beliefs being true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, yes absolutely. I&#39;ve always been opened minded, but the darkness surrounding this election has pushed me closer to God. It has never been more prevalent to me that we are in a battle of Good Vs Evil. I see God as love; and the devil as evil energy preying on the weak until we are all completely Godless.</p>

<p>What helped me in my path was researching The Bible and gematria. That, mixed with some other nontraditional ways to read into religious text, opened my eyes to a completely new way of viewing The Bible and religion in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same reason that I can not believe in God, is the same reason I do. My problem with God in the most simplest form is I can not believe in something that has always been. That also goes for sciences explanation, I do not buy the Big Bang theory. I can not imagine a time when nothing existed either. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a stupid person, but the complete disconnect I have with what science says happened makes me feel like maybe I am? Sorry I could have explained what I meant a lot better if I still did mdma.</p>

<p>Edit, I dont believe in anything but the positive messages in Christianity, none of the fire and brimstone stuff, that all just seems like a convenient way to control people. What better way to control people than to have a all knowing being that will torture you forever if you don&#39;t listen.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>just for the record, the big bang theory is a list of evidence that the universe is expanding out from a singularity. </p>

<p>none of the equations which help us predict tons of shit make any sense when they are applied to the conditions that existed moments after the big bang. </p>

<p>i believe it is generally accepted that any information about what was around before the big bang would have been destroyed in the big bang.... but i could be wrong about that part. </p>

<p>it really doesn&#39;t have anything to say about &quot;this is what created the universe.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is possible to enlist acorporeal intelligences, (which, in terms you may be comfortable with, can be described as individual points of intelligence or consciousness which exist natively within the quantum field, in a manner analogous to fish in an ocean, and which have a certain level of indirect ability to influence physical reality) to assist one in the completion of certain objectives; and yes, the organised religions are broadly correct in identifying two different groups of said intelligences, which ethically conflict with each other.  Said groups or polarities have been referred to as Service to Others, (good, in simple or colloquial terms) or Service to Self.  (Evil)</p>

<p>It is not so much Satanism per se that is accurate, as it is simply a case that individuals, whether they have physical bodies or exist within our own dimension or not, have a known tendency to collaborate with others of like mind.  This is true in the case of those who are well-intentioned, and it is equally true in the case of those whose intentions are harmful.  Birds of a feather, flock together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t pretend to know everything about ouija boards but hearing that story, it doesn&#39;t shock me. If you look deeper into it there&#39;s a lot of rules, dos and don&#39;ts, etc. There are a lot of other experiences I had with the board between the two I wrote about here that were equally as weird.</p>

<p>Played with it at a different graveyard once, a private one with maybe 5 tombstones in it. It was gated off and we had to jump fences to get in. A &#39;lady&#39; we spoke to via the board had described in detail how her husband murdered her with an axe after keeping her in a closet. We googled her name and death records and found her description matched the name and records exactly.</p>

<p>Played with it another time on the playground of an elementary school. We talked to a kid who had passed away in the playground/recess area. I asked the kid if god was real. He said yes. I asked him if Hell was a real place. He said yes. I then asked where he would be sitting if we were able to see him and he spelled out </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s amusing that your path to faith is the example of the Satanists.</p>

<p>There is truth in religion, all major established religions. Their truth is why they exist. But it&#39;s more immediate than that.</p>

<p>Human society needs religion to function in a healthy manner. To society, religion is like one of its vital organs. Cut out religion, and a society will sicken (as ours has sickened) and will eventually die. This need for religion in any society, including the modern West, explains why Islam is making such huge inroads. As Christianity is reviled and defamed by Jews and other detractors, Islam slips in to take its place, and fulfill the vital, necessary function that Christianity was fulfilling when it was still healthy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many of you reading this are able to comprehend what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m not just saying that religion is a nice thing to have around, I&#39;m saying that it is a vital necessity, and without it society dies. But Western society will not die -- it will become Islamic.</p>

<p>If you turn your back on the Christian churches (with all their faults), you turn your back on your own history and culture as a people, and you betray your heritage. You are in effect giving the West to Islam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is any truth in religion it is that you are your own god. An individual having the power to create, love, destroy, hate, sacrifice, heal, kill and live in being whatever you have decided knowing that this was through your own choices and that whatever you decide could affect any others in existence. </p>

<p>In other words nothing that we didn&#39;t already know upon being genetically programmed as a species, but by sculpting us into something else is as wrong as any other hypocritical pretext.</p>

<p>When in fact religion has only been the bane of our species, it hasn&#39;t educated because it has controlled, and it has often only provided further grounds for segregation and hate, and from what little good it does, it has only added far more pain and loss to its others when they have often lived without finding reason. </p>

<p>We couldn&#39;t have been more misinformed. Like everything else this always leads to the fundamental questions of how and why we got here and in so doing draws its conclusions and reasoning, trying too provide merit for our time spent in existence, although often completely lacking in the value of our existence which was simply to be our own gods of our  lives.</p>

<p>The Big Bang Theory is ludicrous</p>
</blockquote>

<p>just for the record, the big bang theory is a list of evidence that the universe is expanding out from a singularity. </p>

<p>none of the equations which help us predict tons of shit make any sense when they are applied to the conditions that existed moments after the big bang. </p>

<p>i believe it is generally accepted that any information about what was around before the big bang would have been destroyed in the big bang.... but i could be wrong about that part. </p>

<p>it really doesn&#39;t have anything to say about &quot;this is what created the universe.&quot;</p>
