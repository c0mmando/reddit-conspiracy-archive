Zuck: Just ask
Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS
[Redacted Friend&#39;s Name]: What? How&#39;d you manage that one?
Zuck: People just submitted it.
Zuck: I don&#39;t know why.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt that you were censored by facebook. I have also been censored by facebook within the last 24 hours on a different topic. In my case, there was no message or notification; my post just disappeared from my wall.</p>

<p>So, I copied your <a href="http://imgur.com/a/BfFOB">post</a> word for word including the link, and posted it myself and received no such message. It remained on my wall for about 10 minutes until I deleted it.</p>

<p>Since facebook is actively censoring controversial posts, I am curious what kind of patterns we can see to figure out the exact agenda. That&#39;s why I attempted to reproduce the results you got. In the past several years, I have posted what would be considered controversial stuff and haven&#39;t ever been censored. Very curious if fb is picking up the censorship pace.</p>
