       Thing is, While CTR was unearthed and proved to be a huge hit to Clinton's online reputation, there still hasn't been a complete uncovering of a Trump/Anti-Clinton based CTR that actually happened to be talked about in Social Media before being silenced if not redacted.

       I swear that there was information on it in a Trump KYM entry just two days ago yet now I cannot find it at all. I expect someone to respond saying such an entry was false or never existed. I'd feel like 1984 is coming.

       This sub is 100% anti-war, and that's one of the main reasons (apart from her media-facilitated corruption) that Clinton got so much hate on this sub. She stated several times that her first priority in office would be to "take out Assad". For anyone with a brain larger than a walnut, that means a war against Russia. Trump, for all his faults, has repeatedly made comments promoting a de-escalation of tensions with Russia.

       But that doesnt mean we wont be fighting wars somewhere in a year or 2. 
Trump ran very similar to dubya, and he won the same way. 
They prob told hillary they are doing her a favor by not picking her because shit is going to get wild very soon.

       Only time will tell. Hillary promised war, and based on her past record, she would have delivered it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Trump could turn out to be much more hawkish than we thought, but there's cause for optimism. He is a populist, and he knows the majority of the US are fed up with pointless and costly foreign wars.

       Notice how the republican wanted less war, and the Democrat wanted more war? Think about it...
She was apealling to the neocons to look like a good war time president, but trump already was in with neocons thru pence. So he appealled to the anti establishment and the low middle class blue collars.

       Yeah...and a Muslim woman said she got her hijab ripped off by white Trump supporters, and that was a lie.  Stop acting like this is a white vs races issue.

      <p>
       Also, there are dozens upon dozens of videos online showing refugee rioting in Europe.  If those aren't Soros paid for riots, then it's proof that they are a big fucking problem there.

       The allowing of propaganda or incorrect information being pushed on purpose for people to read, see and believe allows it to be a cornerstone of the actual internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the word conspiracy theorist began appearing in a large magnitude all over the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       User goes to google what conspiracy theorist means and ends up jumping into the conspiracy realm.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is at this point that the user is initiated into whatever conspiracy is going on and being mass produced from shadow corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is no real correction made, the user is forced to believe whatever they are told, most of the time only regurgitating what they have heard rather than what they have researched.

       But that doesnt mean we wont be fighting wars somewhere in a year or 2. 
Trump ran very similar to dubya, and he won the same way. 
They prob told hillary they are doing her a favor by not picking her because shit is going to get wild very soon.

       And theyre prob antiwar people here, but not if everybody is buying into this faux election with 2 puppets.

       How is this sub 100% anti war? America just voted in a president that seeks to undue everything that the other half of a America fought for...

       When two conflicting ideas meet, the only outcome is in fact war.

        That's a poorly made assumption. There's plenty of well known conspiracies listed in the wiki for this subreddit people can research on their own that have been verified as true.

       Thing is, While CTR was unearthed and proved to be a huge hit to Clinton's online reputation, there still hasn't been a complete uncovering of a Trump/Anti-Clinton based CTR that actually happened to be talked about in Social Media before being silenced if not redacted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I swear that there was information on it in a Trump KYM entry just two days ago yet now I cannot find it at all. I expect someone to respond saying such an entry was false or never existed. I'd feel like 1984 is coming.
