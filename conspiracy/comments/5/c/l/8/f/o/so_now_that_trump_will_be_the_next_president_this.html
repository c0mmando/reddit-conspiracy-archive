<p>I swear that there was information on it in a Trump KYM entry just two days ago yet now I cannot find it at all. I expect someone to respond saying such an entry was false or never existed. I&#39;d feel like 1984 is coming.</p>

<p>This sub is 100% anti-war, and that&#39;s one of the main reasons (apart from her media-facilitated corruption) that Clinton got so much hate on this sub. She stated several times that her first priority in office would be to &quot;take out Assad&quot;. For anyone with a brain larger than a walnut, that means a war against Russia. Trump, for all his faults, has repeatedly made comments promoting a de-escalation of tensions with Russia. </p>

She was apealling to the neocons to look like a good war time president, but trump already was in with neocons thru pence. So he appealled to the anti establishment and the low middle class blue collars.</p>

Trump ran very similar to dubya, and he won the same way. 
They prob told hillary they are doing her a favor by not picking her because shit is going to get wild very soon.</p>

<p>And theyre prob antiwar people here, but not if everybody is buying into this faux election with 2 puppets.</p>

<p>Who decides what is just propaganda and what is real? It sounds like you want someone else to decide for you what you should be ingesting.</p>

<p>The user does, if he only has one side that he listens to, he&#39;s going to be brainwashed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That term has been around in abundance prior to the birth of the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In today&#39;s world is a pop culture, long ago, you were truly weird for even talking about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s a poorly made assumption. There&#39;s plenty of well known conspiracies listed in the wiki for this subreddit people can research on their own that have been verified as true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are not the conspiracies of today taking place. They are old and documented so that they can be applied to the events of today, not just to take up brain space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, who is making these corrections?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again the user decides.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And &quot;researched&quot; is the key word here. This is not Facebook. We expect everyone in this sub to use reasoning and critical thought to come to their own conclusions about information being shared here.</p>

<p>Yes but content proves other wise.</p>

<p>This community is about keeping an open mind but it&#39;s also about using your faculties in order to find the underlying truth in what you ingest. NO ONE is expected to just immediately believe everything that is posted here as fact. Everything should be scrutinized by the individual.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not when they aren&#39;t presented with the other side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We don&#39;t need a nanny to tell us what is propaganda and what is truth. That&#39;s exactly what you are suggesting and is counter intuitive to open information sharing.</p>

<p>You want to suppress what you deem to be incorrect information.</p>

<p>Yes okay but that doesn&#39;t deter from the fact that it&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>I swear that there was information on it in a Trump KYM entry just two days ago yet now I cannot find it at all. I expect someone to respond saying such an entry was false or never existed. I&#39;d feel like 1984 is coming.</p>
