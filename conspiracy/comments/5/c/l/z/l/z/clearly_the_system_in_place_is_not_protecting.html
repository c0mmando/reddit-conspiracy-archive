        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For anyone in the know about pedophilia, including intra familial to international pedophile rings, one thing is clear: they aren&#39;t doing anything to protect children. I could link a bazillion articles/proof of this, but you shouldn&#39;t need it. The point is, CPS and PD are represented by DA/AG. They are absolutely ineffective at investigation/prosecution of child rape. I see this has become pandemic all over the world,namely U.S. Other than changing the dialogue, and protecting children in other ways, what can be done? Also, perhaps the biggest hurdle would be that people don&#39;t understand the danger that exists. Anyone have thoughts on how we could more effectively protect children in lieu of complacent, possibly complicit prosecution? Thanks for your serious consideration of this issue.
Edit:Tl/dr children are not only unprotected, they are prey. Prosecutors have turned a blind eye from FBI to local PD. We need another plan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are already starting it.  Exposure, awareness. For too long society turned an eye to it. As long as a few stings catch some pedos here and there everyone thinks it&#39;s being worked on.</p>

<p>But this is a generational thing. Just catching some perps doesn&#39;t solve the problem. Kids would be better protected if their parents were aware, and also if there was a more acceptable treatment for victims of this type of abuse so that it&#39;s not continued and propagated. This may take a few generations to undo for there to be any noticeable difference. These are very complex perversions in our world, it won&#39;t be easy to eradicate the behavior but public awareness and not ignoring it are key.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your thoughtful comment. I have researched this extensively, and the barrier is cognitive dissonance. How can we give people the eyes to see? I can complile at least 50 cases where perp was given unfettered access to the victim and the protective parent was forcefully eliminated from the child&#39;s life. Perhaps that would be a step in the right direction as far as awareness. However, it doesn&#39;t help if people consider that it&#39;s only happening to other people. Herein lies the problem. I also developed a globally applicable child safety program, but haven&#39;t put it into action. First I need to rescue my child. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your thoughtful comment. I have researched this extensively, and the barrier is cognitive dissonance. How can we give people the eyes to see? I can complile at least 50 cases where perp was given unfettered access to the victim and the protective parent was forcefully eliminated from the child&#39;s life. Perhaps that would be a step in the right direction as far as awareness. However, it doesn&#39;t help if people consider that it&#39;s only happening to other people. Herein lies the problem. I also developed a globally applicable child safety program, but haven&#39;t put it into action. First I need to rescue my child. </p>
