        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This morning, a fairly <strong>short</strong> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-sweden-assange-idUSKBN13910T">article from Reuters was published</a> about today&#39;s &quot;interview&quot; with Assange regarding the charges from Sweden. A redditor in another thread pointed out how it was not clear whether the investigators were questioning Assange directly by citing the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isgren and a police investigator will be able to ask questions through the Ecuadorian prosecutor, who will later report the findings to Sweden, prosecutors have said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>So I decided to go read the article which was within the first 20 minutes of its stated time of publication. I found this quote in the 2nd paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Swedish Chief Prosecutor Ingrid Isgren arrived at the embassy to <strong>pose questions to Assange through an Ecuadorian prosecutor</strong> over the allegations</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>To me, this quote makes it clear that the Swedish investigators <strong>are not</strong> speaking with Assange  but rather speaking to a 3rd party who will relay the questions and answers. I SMELL CONSPIRACY.</p>

<p>The redditor that initially pointed this out replied to my comment sometime later stating he could not find my quote. So I went back to the article and what do I find....a longer article that has been edited and subsequently does not include <em>BOTH</em> quotes! The first quote seems to have been edited. The second quote was removed. <del>Sadly I did not screen shot the article. Fuck me.</del> <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114105936/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-sweden-assange-idUSKBN13910T">The missing quote is in the second paragraph.</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The quote now reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Swedish Chief Prosecutor Ingrid Isgren spent around four hours in the embassy, where she posed questions through an Ecuadorian prosecutor, before leaving without making comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should also be noted that even Assange&#39;s own Lawyer was not allowed to attend the &quot;interview&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Samuelson, Assange&#39;s Swedish lawyer, said he had been barred from the meeting. &quot;Ecuador refuses to let me in and insists that the questioning will continue without my presence, against my client&#39;s wishes to have me there,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>More conspiracy smells.</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>TL;DR<br/>
1. Reuters report investigators were allowed to pose questions to Assange through a third party. (no direct contact)<br/>
2. Assange&#39;s lawyer was not allowed to attend this meeting.<br/>
3. Reuters article is later edited to insert ambiguity.<br/>
<strong>4. Not one news outlet mentions that the public has not physically seen or heard from Assange since around 15 Oct. 2016</strong></p>
