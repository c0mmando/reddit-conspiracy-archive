    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       This morning, a fairly
       <strong>
        short
       </strong>
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-sweden-assange-idUSKBN13910T">
        article from Reuters was published
       </a>
       about today's "interview" with Assange regarding the charges from Sweden. A redditor in another thread pointed out how it was not clear whether the investigators were questioning Assange directly by citing the following quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Isgren and a police investigator will be able to ask questions through the Ecuadorian prosecutor, who will later report the findings to Sweden, prosecutors have said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       So I decided to go read the article which was within the first 20 minutes of its stated time of publication. I found this quote in the 2nd paragraph:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Swedish Chief Prosecutor Ingrid Isgren arrived at the embassy to
        <strong>
         pose questions to Assange through an Ecuadorian prosecutor
        </strong>
        over the allegations
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, this quote makes it clear that the Swedish investigators
       <strong>
        are not
       </strong>
       speaking with Assange  but rather speaking to a 3rd party who will relay the questions and answers. I SMELL CONSPIRACY.
      </p>
      <p>
       The redditor that initially pointed this out replied to my comment sometime later stating he could not find my quote. So I went back to the article and what do I find....a longer article that has been edited and subsequently does not include
       <em>
        BOTH
       </em>
       quotes! The first quote seems to have been edited. The second quote was removed.
       <del>
        Sadly I did not screen shot the article. Fuck me.
       </del>
       <strong>
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114105936/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-sweden-assange-idUSKBN13910T">
         The missing quote is in the second paragraph.
        </a>
        .
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The quote now reads:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Swedish Chief Prosecutor Ingrid Isgren spent around four hours in the embassy, where she posed questions through an Ecuadorian prosecutor, before leaving without making comment.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It should also be noted that even Assange's own Lawyer was not allowed to attend the "interview'.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Samuelson, Assange's Swedish lawyer, said he had been barred from the meeting. "Ecuador refuses to let me in and insists that the questioning will continue without my presence, against my client's wishes to have me there," he told Reuters.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        More conspiracy smells.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR
       <br/>
       1. Reuters report investigators were allowed to pose questions to Assange through a third party. (no direct contact)
       <br/>
       2. Assange's lawyer was not allowed to attend this meeting.
       <br/>
       3. Reuters article is later edited to insert ambiguity.
       <br/>
       <strong>
        4. Not one news outlet mentions that the public has not physically seen or heard from Assange since around 15 Oct. 2016
       </strong>

       Strange. you gotta wonder why he doesn't use cellular hotspot to connect for even a bit to tweet something.
