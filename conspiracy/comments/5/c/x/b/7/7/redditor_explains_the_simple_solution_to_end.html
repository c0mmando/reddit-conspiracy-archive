       I happen to see it when it was on front page this morning, opened it in a tab, didn't look at it again for some hours, after which it had been [removed].
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasoning given for locking it is reasonable. No reason was given for total removal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty weird.

       Edit: for clarity, you can see the comment that Im pointing out,
       <em>

       via this link now. Since the original main post was removed, the whole thread no longer shows up in reddit via normal searches like through the sub via sorting or searching or any other way.

       I worked, just shy of seven years, with a facility that allegedly
       <em>
        catered
       </em>
       to Treatment rather than Incarceration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth be told, it was a Spin-Cycle between Judges, Drug/Mental Health Court, Parole and Shady Drug Testing Facilities, all in concert with disturbing Re-Hab Houses set up right smack dab in the middle of
       <em>
        healthy neighborhoods

       there were quite a lot of anecdotes. Lots of 'ex' homeless people sharing their sob stories about how great state welfare saved their lives, and lots of angry tax payers explaining why homeless people are a drain on society.

       Agreed. But it's for a good cause. Gives them something build off of.  You never know what put them on the street on the first place but give them something to build off of as well. It's not like a full blown house, it's like the "tiny home" stuff that you see.

       I will admit it's not the worst solution for the chronically homeless. I'm still leery of how it might incentivize people at the margins though.

       I agree.  Penn &amp; Teller with their Bullshit! series were genuinely interested in exposing the truth.  Adam Ruins Everything is only interested in having many topics along a common theme for his series.

       Disagree completely, bullshit! did everything it could to ask the wrong questions and focus on the comical/stupidity of the people it disagreed with. Penn Gillette is also a walking libertarian stereotype and never fails to spew koch funded propaganda.

       It seems to be back, at least for me.  For those who can't read it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Finally something I can respond to! I work in homelessness assistance, specifically in an organization that is trying to put the systems in place to end homelessness. I'm sorry, this is going to be long. In response to your first question, there are a lot of factors that can contribute to a person's homelessness. It can be helpful to think of homelessness not as a problem itself, but as the common symptom of many different problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vast majority of homeless people are homeless due to a catastrophe or economic event, like the loss of a job. I'm sure you know someone who has lost a job and lost a place to live. The vast majority of the time people will have a safety net (family, friends) that prevents them from ever becoming homeless, but some people don't. Typically these people fall into homelessness briefly, receive some assistance or stay in a shelter until they get another paycheck or place to live.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is another set of people who have been released by jails, mental institutions, or hospitals without a place to go. And there are also people who have been homeless for a very long time, or are experiencing homelessness several times a year, people experiencing chronic homelessness. Again, most people have friends or family they can stay with sometimes, but it puts a lot of financial and personal stress on a family and sometimes people get kicked out.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are usually enough services available that someone experiencing homelessness can get most of their basic needs met (though obviously not always).
       </p>
       <p>
        To your second question, homeless is DEFINITELY solvable. We are doing it. If you want to know more Google Houston, TX, they have been a perfect example. It takes a lot of resources, but it can be done. There is a model called Housing First, which essentially means the first thing you need to do for a person is get them into permanent housing, and then you can focus on treatment. This is in contrast to the old treatment first models, which meant that a person had to stay sober/stable to maintain housing, and if they didn't they weren't considered "ready" to be housed and they were usually kicked out onto the street. As you can imagine, these programs didn't work too well.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are essentially 2 Housing First interventions, permanent supportive housing and rapid re-housing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Permanent supportive housing is designed for people with the highest needs, the most barriers to housing, and who have been on the street for a long time. This program essentially gives someone a permanent voucher for housing, and then gives them access to healthcare and therapy, and a host of other services. The idea here is that some people who have been on the street for years and have mental and physical health issues may never be able to live without assistance, and it actually saves the public money because the tenants are no longer using ERs and jails.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rapid re-housing is for people who are experiencing crisis or episodic homelessness. It provides a small amount of assistance, a few months rental assistance, prevention services, first and last months rent, relocation money, etc. It comes with case management services to help a family budget, find childcare, healthcare, and deal with any other barriers.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we say ending homelessness, we don't mean that people are never going to become homeless again, we mean that we want a system that has enough resources available that as soon as someone becomes homeless, we can address it and get them housed. This isn't the case now, as people sit in shelters forever waiting for limited resources. Several cities have ended homelessness among veterans and are on their way to ending chronic homelessness as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tl;dr: homelessness is caused by several factors, usually a catastrophic life event. It can be solved by strategic use of resources and a focus on getting people housed and keeping them housed, as opposed to getting people sober. Also, stop saying "the homeless," it's like saying "the blacks."
       </p>
       <p>
        Edit: holy crap! Thanks for the gold stranger!
       </p>
       <p>
        Edit 2: More gold?? Thank you! Also, I don't live in Houston, I realize that there are still people in Houston who are experiencing homelessness.
