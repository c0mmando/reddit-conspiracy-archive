       So I recently found out they've been inducing lot of needle/cramp feelings remotely between my sleep and awake state (and synthetic headaches, very painful feelings while I meditate) so I don't astral travel or OBE. I did the stupid thing of posting my experiences online and this is the consequence, so all I can do is let you know there's something fascinating to spiritual practices and an advanced AI (probably) controls lot of things now even many people to a degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: must realize I took meditation very seriously and I was floating and seeing other worlds or times after much effort. Just wanted to let you know weird shit really does happen after a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit2: Not only so I can't astral travel or OBE, I can't find the link but natural telepathy is real and can affect others with our emotions also I'm gangstalked and harassed with electronic weapons in iran so when I say fuck the nwo I'm not being metaphorical .

       Why you? i dont have cramps. Drink water avoid MSG and see if those headaches go away (Dietary advice not medical, no medicine involved mods).

       Exactly, kill the parasites with diatamaceous earth, remove the metals with calcium bentonite/herbal mixes, flush kidneys with cranberry juice, cleanse gall/liver stones with apples/oil/lemon. avoid heavy intake of folic acids/make yourself less acidic.

       yep the acidity needs to rise to allow for the bad elements (literal scientific elements) to be able to bind with other elements and be removed from body.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you cant stay acidic to long with high levels of folic acid or you will be feeding any possible cancer cells nothing but pure sugar.

       I eat a fuck ton of bacon, sausage, eggs and beans, lol. But i have a high metabolism so my bod needs extra protein (eat like that and only weigh 140).

       Its more of a dance though. If you notice that ball on the top of the right back side or your neck swell you have a deposit of metals- flush metals.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you notice your pee sinks to bottom of toilet-flush kidneys
      </p>
      <p>
       Poo, well you know your poo- Flush liver
      </p>
      <p>
       Feeling fatigued/irratable (nutrient not getting to you)- Flush parasites

       edit: they also induce pain when I'm studying or pain/itches while I'm drawing. I can tell the cramps/headaches/itches are fake because for example a bad headache will come and go for 3 seconds and do that again a few seconds after, it escalates when I do certain things, you have no idea how advanced TPTB's technology is

       Hearing voices from God is a "big thing" in Arab culture, according to Bitar. "We flash-blind them. And, while their eyes are shut, you could send a recorded message or deep guttural voice that echoes in the inside of their head."

       yes I know all about the claims, but the thing is you are not important enough to waste time with annoying you. The other, bigger problem is that the symptoms of schizophrenia and paranoid delusions just happen to be the same as what these "weapons" are claimed to do. If you really must go down this path to insanity the answer is very simple, construct a faraday cage and sit inside of that. If you are so well-versed in these technologies why don't you know that?

        ...As for trusting other people's "opinions" that I might not be feeling instigated physical torture that is spiked after certain internet posts or I wasn't controlled to speak for 15 mins or that I just imagined my heart being squeezed 20 times over a period of 2 days...no. I am sorry but I cannot, and I hope you understand why. (I

       call it trolling all you want but dehydration is a common cause of headaches, lol.

       I have an idea of how advanced TPTB weaponry is i just posted the links to their microwave mind control. Basically what you are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       But its probably only theoretical and even if it is real why would they target you? Do you know some big secret? I guess if they were targeting a certain type of the population that would make sense but right now only you are reporting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets get it out in the open to see if you are being targeted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you Muslim?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you support Hezbollah/Hamas?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think jews need to be killed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know secrets?
      </p>
      <p>
       You into pedo?
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If you answered yes to any of the above then you have a reason to be targeted, if not then they are not targeting you unless there is a reason.

       read my ELI5 post about organized stalking/electronic harassment to understand targeting better, I am not telling you why I think I am targeted.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Reasons for being targeted vary and some are targeted just cuz TPTB want to study them and advance their tech (a lot of people with high cognitive abilities or who could help humanity in big ways are targeted)

       I want people to understand there is nothing very special about many targets and more people are targeted than you'd think, to various degrees. Most of it is done for research purposes, the program is designed to make targets sound mentally ill and many targets have family issues, a history of mental illness or were veterans, they are chosen for various reasons and most are people with not many connections to get this info out or who the public will not believe.

       That is the whole reason this line of questioning has begun. Yet every time you refuse to answer and deflect saying read the trigger posts. That is a sign of a liar, hence you are saying you are a pedo/terrorist.
