       We're all pretty weirded out by the Berenstein Berenstain weirdness, I think it'll all come back to that. Not trying to prove or discuss anything really, just projecting random ideas. Looks like MKUltra and the Bearenstein Bears started around the same year. All of the Bearensteins stories are about having children behave and do what they're are told. They've been running this shit for years and probably decided to test out how successful they were on day. Maybe the small change is all part of a test to see if they can actually rewrite history and have us believe anything? We all know it was Bearenstein, but everything on the internet is Bearenstein, they're setting things up so they can rewrite history via the internet I'm guessing. It wouldn't be that hard (kind of hard but not with their resources) for a Google algorithm to go through all their pictures and change a letter. Thoughts? We know we're all part of a thought experiment with losers like Zuckerberg,
       <a href="/u/spez">
        /u/spez
       </a>
       , and Eric Scmidt, this would tie things together, try out the Bearenstein "dimension slip" and monitor the public response.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem the sole purpose of the change is to introduce the concept of the Mandela Effect. "The Mandela Effect is a theory, where large groups of people have similar alternative memories about past events, where advocates of the theory believe it is caused by people being switched out from one "parallel universe" to another, where memories from one did not match the actual events of the other".
It's so they can force their narrative without us questioning our own memories. It doesn't involve parallel universes, just another trick from their playbook.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are essentially trying to create their own devil's playground.

       I am willing to entertain the idea that someone is modifying history but what makes you think it's the CIA?
      </p>
      <p>
       let's assume that someone took deliberate action to alter history. Do you think they dilibetately changed the spelling of Berenstein, or do you think it was an after effect caused by something that they did deliberately alter?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a hard time believing that anyone would care to change that "e" to an "a."  I think there are more significant changes being made and we are only noticing the side effects.

       Not to sound too crazy, I've got my head on strong, just sifting through the rabbit hole. My theory is that MKUltra has been testing out their techniques on the public for the last 60 or so years. It's all to reach the elites final goal of being able to "read" and "write" thoughts so that they can control everything.

       This seems to be the most correct answer, no idea how they managed to pull it all off but I'm sure there are still a lot out there, I don't have access to any of them. Anyways this was all the holy grail of thought control, If they can have us accept their memories over the memories of ourselves and our peers, then they have essentially created the devil's playground.

       It could be perhaps that the books have remained the same this whole time, and that the memory itself has been implanted to install doubt among a control group. The other possibility would involve time travel.

       . The funny thing is that after heavy meditation, time-travel seems very possible, it's only my programmed thoughts that seem to suggest it's impossible. Anyways gonna keep digging and see if I can find an actual connection to Sid Bernstein and George Soros.

       Not sure, anyone have any physical copies to check? Seems like they could've just changed when "Mike Berenstain, who assumed partial authorship in 2002" took over after stopping production for a few years and letting most old copies rot. Once they can get us to question our own memories, they have complete control over us.

       The human anatomy is completely different. The geography is completely different. We're even in a different position in the galaxy. The CIA is not that good.

       We have always been on the sagittarius arm.  The maps and anatomical locations you were taught in school were wrong.  That is all

       We've always been on the Sagittarius arm? The outer reaches of our galaxy?  Really? Have you checked lately? Go ahead, Google earth's location. I'll wait.

       That link does not say we are on the Sagittarius arm. If it says that, paste it here. Earth is located on the Orion arm. Now. We were on the Sagittarius arm, but not anymore. Haven't you noticed the sun is a lot brighter?

       The Solar System, including the Earth, lies within the Orion Arm. It is also referred to by its full name, the Orion–Cygnus Arm, as well as Local Arm, Orion Bridge, and formerly, the Local Spur and Orion Spur...

      <p>
       The Orion Arm is located between the Carina–Sagittarius Arm (toward the Galactic Center) and the Perseus Arm (toward the outside Universe), the latter one of the two major arms of the Milky Way.

       I don't tend to stare at the sun.  I remain unconvinced; perhaps we should consult an astronomer.

       Lol, you should Google Neil Degrassi and Sagittarius arm. He remembers us being on the Sagittarius arm too. Like I do. Because we were. Plenty of residual evidence but all of the current record says we've always been on the Orion spur.
      </p>

       What about the link you posted?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, have you looked at the human anatomy lately? Where do you remember your stomach being? How about where your spinal column attached to the brain?

       Can you be more specific? The stomach is now under the left rib. If you have old textbooks showing the stomach in the abdomen, lower and right of where it is now, I'd love to see it. Just tell me the titles if you don't have pictures.
