        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We&#39;re all pretty weirded out by the Berenstein Berenstain weirdness, I think it&#39;ll all come back to that. Not trying to prove or discuss anything really, just projecting random ideas. Looks like MKUltra and the Bearenstein Bears started around the same year. All of the Bearensteins stories are about having children behave and do what they&#39;re are told. They&#39;ve been running this shit for years and probably decided to test out how successful they were on day. Maybe the small change is all part of a test to see if they can actually rewrite history and have us believe anything? We all know it was Bearenstein, but everything on the internet is Bearenstein, they&#39;re setting things up so they can rewrite history via the internet I&#39;m guessing. It wouldn&#39;t be that hard (kind of hard but not with their resources) for a Google algorithm to go through all their pictures and change a letter. Thoughts? We know we&#39;re all part of a thought experiment with losers like Zuckerberg, <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a>, and Eric Scmidt, this would tie things together, try out the Bearenstein &quot;dimension slip&quot; and monitor the public response.</p>

<p>It would seem the sole purpose of the change is to introduce the concept of the Mandela Effect. &quot;The Mandela Effect is a theory, where large groups of people have similar alternative memories about past events, where advocates of the theory believe it is caused by people being switched out from one &quot;parallel universe&quot; to another, where memories from one did not match the actual events of the other&quot;.
It&#39;s so they can force their narrative without us questioning our own memories. It doesn&#39;t involve parallel universes, just another trick from their playbook.</p>

<p>They are essentially trying to create their own devil&#39;s playground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am willing to entertain the idea that someone is modifying history but what makes you think it&#39;s the CIA? </p>

<p>let&#39;s assume that someone took deliberate action to alter history. Do you think they dilibetately changed the spelling of Berenstein, or do you think it was an after effect caused by something that they did deliberately alter?</p>

<p>I have a hard time believing that anyone would care to change that &quot;e&quot; to an &quot;a.&quot;  I think there are more significant changes being made and we are only noticing the side effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to sound too crazy, I&#39;ve got my head on strong, just sifting through the rabbit hole. My theory is that MKUltra has been testing out their techniques on the public for the last 60 or so years. It&#39;s all to reach the elites final goal of being able to &quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot; thoughts so that they can control everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems to be the most correct answer, no idea how they managed to pull it all off but I&#39;m sure there are still a lot out there, I don&#39;t have access to any of them. Anyways this was all the holy grail of thought control, If they can have us accept their memories over the memories of ourselves and our peers, then they have essentially created the devil&#39;s playground.</p>

Seems like they could&#39;ve just changed when &quot;Mike Berenstain, who assumed partial authorship in 2002&quot; took over after stopping production for a few years and letting most old copies rot.
