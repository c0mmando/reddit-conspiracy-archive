    <div class="md"><p>oh - my bad, i misread, (had a hectic day).  </p>

<p>i&#39;m sure there are organizations that are doing &#39;real&#39; good, helping those in need. but to actually name any that are opposed to the negative societies would be difficult, as i would think they would not want to be known. i&#39;m sure there are &#39;groups&#39;, or whatever you&#39;d want to call them that are &quot;fighting the good fight against evil&quot;. </p>

<p>it&#39;s my belief that the world has reached a climax where it has come to a &quot;war&quot; to save our planet/our species against &quot;evil&quot;. </p>

<p>people may say that they <em>believe</em> there is true evil in the world, however i doubt they truly realize it &amp; if they did it would stun them  to no end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not infiltrating them, but serious Christian churches call them out from time to time. Like 70% of methodist pastors in the u.s. are masons, and I imagine other denominations are comparable, but those outside this infiltration will call them an evil conspiracy. I dont have any data on hand, but I believe the orthodox church is fighting them. Catholics did historically fight them, but after the assassination of Jon Paul 1, they&#39;ve been towing the line. Anytime they get out of pocket, some preist rape case sufaces, burying some lead and further destroying their already tattered reputations. The cases are often true, but the timing of the busts are suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup,  Gnostic is what I meant.   double shift makes me a bit wonky at times.   There has been a lot of talk about the &quot;alliance&quot; lately.  Both the &quot;earth alliance&quot; and the &quot;secret space program alliance&quot; </p>

<p>My problem with most of these clubs is they let anyone in.   I imagine that there might be a vetting process as you move up.    Clearly there are a lot of bad groups out there that are cabal related like skull &amp; bones.    This question reminds me of a video I just recently watched about the ruling elite and their not so secret society, but I think its relative.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes there are benevolent secret societies, one cant go without the other or this universe would be a much much darker place ! Also you should consider that there are those that fall into &quot;gray line&quot; and they are unpredictable but balanced, they might actually be the ones that hold TRUE power.</p>

<p>There are internal conflicts on the planet for at least 5000 years and in today&#39;s world a smallest mistake could be fatal.</p>
