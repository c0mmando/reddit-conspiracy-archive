       <strong>
        testing the Pizza Pages
       </strong>
       - your list
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        As of today we are able to test the new credit card landing pages
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        (Pizza).
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have until the end of the week to find as many bugs / errors /
       <strong>
        weird
stuff before launching to real visitors.
       </strong>
       Below you'll find a list of
questions I've come up with that i need your help in thoroughly testing.
These questions are tailored specifically toward your department and we
are relying on you to find any problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you go through the different scenarios please take notes on
       <strong>
        anything
that seems weird
       </strong>
       or doesn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Additionally, If you just notice something that doesnt make sense
       </strong>
       (even if
it's not on on your question list), make a note.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reduce clutter, all feedback should be sent directly to me as soon as
possible. *
       <em>
        Do not open any new IT tickets. *
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Please use as many web browsers as you have available.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you end up in the "Original" Credit Card campaign version, in order to
see the new version you'll have to clear your stratfor cookies and refresh
the page.
       <strong>
        Once you have the Pizza version
       </strong>
       You should be able to view all
campaign pages in the new version, even if you close your browser and come
back later.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Your Questions - Service Dept
      </h2>
      <p>
       1) Are test pages (both A &amp;B versions) pushing the right data to iPay?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         refcode
        </p>

        <p>
         price
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         address
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         premium attached? Shipping? (only on newly created campaign pages)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Which version of the campaign page they came from (old or new)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       2)
       <strong>
        International Orders being processed properly?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         What about any common
         <strong>
          international order processing
         </strong>
         issues?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Does postal code box map to the right spot in ipay?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       3) Does the
       <em>
        Questions
       </em>
       tile work?
      </p>
      <p>
       4) does the page show as secure in all browsers (SSL?)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Any idea what this means? They are an intelligence firm are they not? Also have seen Pizza mentioned in emails from USAID and Stratfor. What gives? Even if it was pizza, who ships pizza internationally?
      </p>
      <p>
       ANYONE willing to help, please try and use this lead, I don't know where else to go with it but it could be something.

       Disturbingly, yes, it sounds like something like that. I'm a web developer, and their would be no reason for me to beta test international orders, unless that was a part of the business. Like OP said, who ships pizza internationally? No one. Unless they are an ingredients distributor. Which is why this lead needs to be followed, imo.

       This is likely related to their newsletters they send out which always tries to sell books , reports and subscriptions.

       Way worse, this is human trafficking, they ship children and adults however they can, they're essentially trying to streamline the process. Kiddie porn gets old for these people really quick, they need a constant supply of "humans" to keep getting off in sicker and sicker ways. The stuff is going to be so much more horrible than we could ever imagine, I have little doubt.

       These are very wealthy people. If they are in dubai and want a good pizza, you bet they get it shipped internationally. They just load up a supersonic jet and send it on over before it gets cold.

       Is this something you would truly want to be digging in tho putie? I mean I would love to see pedo scumbags go to jail as much as everyone else here, but this ain't no small time shit here. Stumbling upon something could very well cost you your life, the elite arent gonna play any games if their pedo shit is about to be discovered. I would love to see these bastards be brought to justice,iI'm just not sure if this is a rabbit hole I even wanna venture down though.

       I hear ya putie. That being said, this whole thing gives me the creeps. Like others have said I believe this goes all the way to the top, people with basically unlimited resources who desperately don't want this shit to get out. This whole thing can end bad in quite a few different ways.

       I agree. Do I want to die? No. Am I afraid, speaking out? Fuck yeah. Only cowards would say other way. I'm not a "badass". I have family, loved ones, and love life. But, it's not going to stop me. This shit is pure evil, and needs to stop. This goes all the way up. That's how they control people.. It make me ill, and I cannot just sit by...

       How much worse can it get? This is it. Thousands of children disappear every year already. Victims to human trafficking, rape, murder... If you are afraid for your own personal safety, understandable, but please don't try to talk anyone else out of being brave and doing the right thing. No one needs to go full vigilante, but if we make enough noise for long enough, then others will eventually have to pay attention. I would think that the FBI is already looking into this and gathering evidence that people on Reddit or 4Chan are helping to uncover.

       .  A prostitution ring was busted in Washington with a lot of ties to the white house.  It looks like credit cards played a large roll as that's how most payments were made and that is why the house got raided.

       The address to this house?

       Well if anyone paid attention to the FBI Anon thread on 4chan, credible or not. It seems the FBI is aware of the pedophelia but have no way of acting on it without exposing deeper much more treasonous actions that would bring harm to the country.

       Could just be a developer thinking up a name for a project: "Dur, I like pizza."

      <p>
       Stratfor, as a private intelligence service, should be sending paper docs or CD's. Is there any other indication of what they might be shipping besides the name?

       Certainly could be, but seeing the use of the word "pizza" within the podesta emails, seems like more than a coincidence.  But you're right, it could be a coincidence. I give it 10%coincidence; 90%fucky

       Nothing about this seems weird other than the pizza thing. However the web developer could have simply chosen fake products, in this case pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very likely fake products to make sure the data (the payment/shipping information) is sending the right data to an internal test server that gathers that data. Once everything is a go, they will change out the fake products for real ones and actually send the data to ipay.
      </p>

       There are plenty of tutorials for learning a language that involve ordinary things like pizza. In fact I think the last time I was trying to learn java, one of the lessons was a pizza ordering web page.

       Okay, so my friend and I were just talking about Agenda 21 and the Georgia Guidestones.  I'd forgotten about the Guidestones so I looked it up and I found this article.
      </p>
      <p>
       It mentions Stratfor and another company it's affiliated with, Deagle, a gun running/drug running/child sex trafficking organization that does marketing work for the CIA, among other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost 3am and I am way too tired to continue researching right now, but maybe you guys/girls can check this out.

       EDIT there are also supposed ties to Chris Stevens and Benghazi.

       Is there a market for moldy and stale pizza? I know eBay has some fetish markets surrounding used and unwashed socks. Maybe this is a thing somewhere?

       Thought the email address was strange so I searched Elkinsspace to see who they are. They don't show up on the first page of google. But when searching on duck duck go-
One hit at the top for elkinsspace.com. You have to login in to even access it. 
Anyone know what it is?

       I don't have the right term for it, but I call it Proxy Selling. It is a way to use legitimate channels to pay for illegal things. Once you learn about 1031 exchanges in the art world, you'll realize how art can be used to hide money or obfuscate the transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Channels for proxy payments include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         International Donations (Arabian prince says thanks for all the fresh victims, here's $1,000,000 to your foundation).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Payments for nothing of value (Thanks for infiltrating the alphabet agencies to cover up our cannibal pedo ring, here's $250,000 to your foundation for a speech)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Foundation Donations (That spirit cooking party last weekend was glorious, here's a 10000 donation for your shitty art gallery)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Art purchases (Hey I had my MKULTRA artist at the last pizza party and she saw everything. Her alters are painting some fucked up shit. Buy her dog shit art at the gallery for $50,000 and i'll let you in the back door to the pizza place for a 10 pm all ages party)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pizza (leave a large tip, receipt has serial number / tor / pgp / password to get access to the hidden files on our web page, they look like menus but it's a steganography thing )
        </p>
       </li>

       iPay is an ADP technology, but sure, anyone could be involved. I just doubt the auditors and lawyers at ADP would be excited about enabling such things.
