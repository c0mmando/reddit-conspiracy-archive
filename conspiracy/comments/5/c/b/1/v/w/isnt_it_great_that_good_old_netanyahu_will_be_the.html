       New settlements on the horizon and Trump's campaign has already said they'll be willing to throw even more money at Israel.

       After Obama shut him out, it's probably his first order of business. It throws out any hope of Trump being anti establishment. I really feel bad for the Palestinians, they now have no defender, even though Obama was poison for America, he did seem to limit the beating they took at the hands of Israel.

       Sorry, he didn't limit shit. An American Furkan DoÄŸan was murdered on the aid ship Mavi Mamara and Obama didn't say nor do a fucking thing. Then also Operation Cast Lead where Israeli snipers deliberately targetted civilians while the IDF used the internationally banned munition White Phosphorus on the same civilian population.

       Yeah after looking into it a bit more, you seem to be right. I guess I thought because Obama refused to see Netanyahu that he was somehow at odds with them. Turns out not so much.

       Yeah, Netanyahu and Obama like playing the street-theatre pseudo-animosity game publicly. Obama's yearly welfare to Israel in the billions also blatantly violates the Symington amendment. That's a specific law prohibiting the transfer of funds to any nation that has nuclear arms but is not a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and have submitted to inspections of their nuclear arms and facilities.

       Did everyone just ignore the fact that Trump and his father both were extremely good friends with the Jewish League, Netanyahu, et. al before this?  Why is anyone surprised by this?  My god you morons are ignorant while you're blinded by hatred for an equally vile Clinton.  There truly is no difference in policy between R &amp; D or Trump and Shillary in regards to Wall Street, Israel, and special interest money in the back pocket.  What was different in these candidates is that one is a slimy politician who belongs in jail and the other is a slimy businessman who belongs in jail.  Yay!

       Is Russia one of the last powers not under Zionist rule? I was kind of hoping Trump becomes bff with Putin who maybe gives him the rundown on things. We make piece with Syria and blah blah blah live happily ever after?

       One can dream. But Israel/Zionism is just that nerdy little loser kid in the classroom who is extremely manipulative and can pay bigger kids to take out the kids it sees as a threat. They don't have shit muscle wise besides the US being their bitch. Unfortunately they control the media, banking and can pretty much do anything with that control.

       You have to pick your battles.  Plus I genuinly believe Trump has his ideas of what's wrong ( immigration, trade, militarism) but I'm not sure he actually sees the bigger picture.  I don't think he really knows 9/11 was an inside job.  I don't think he sees the secret Jewish power behind the media that just tried to destroy him.  He's kind of only halfway home, like Brietbart or Drudge Report.
