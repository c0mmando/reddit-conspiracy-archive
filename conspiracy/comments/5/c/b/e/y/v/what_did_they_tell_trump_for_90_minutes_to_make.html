       The first person to talk to Clinton was Greenspan. He was almost certainly the functionary of that role. As a result of the meeting Clinton instantly reversed a major platform policy position for vastly increased funding and expansion of social and welfare programs to cutting nearly ALL government programs. He was in there for 10 minutes total.

       People are so blind to Trump,he's not a newcomer. He's been hanging out with these people for his entire life. He knows now just like he knew before how things work and what dirty tactics are used. i'm not buyin it.

       He had the perception of money but he's a failed businessman and has made so little money he hasn't payed taxes in decades. His business rating is poor and was reduced to reality TV and still wasn't making enough money to cover losses from his business failures.

       I think his businesses failed so bad and he lost so much money, he was able to write off so much losses, he hasn't made enough money to balance it out. He doesn't make enough money to cover his failures.

       Im not defending him, but when you own hundreds of companies, sometimes its in your best interest to bog a couple of them down with debt, have that company file for bankruptcy, and sell it off or shut it down. Its standard practice for large capitol firms. Its actually mit Romney's claim to fame. Trump knows the game too well not to play to win.

       I can say this 5 million times and it won't matter. No one likes her. No one is defending her. She is corrupt as they come. We wanted Sanders. She stole the primary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two things though. Half the shit said about her has already been disproven... Bhengazi, classified emails, pedo rings, late term non-medical abortions...
      </p>

       My efforts are the seeking of truth. And as much as I dislike Clinton, I HATE trump even more. I have no idea how you all don't see what he is. Just take one incident, he raped his ex wife. That right there is enough, but he also cheats on all his wives (divorced 3x which shows he's a bit of a bastard), doesn't pay taxes, rated 11/100 on business, takes advantage of the less fortunate and contractors, has the most vile mouth of any presidential candidate, connections to mob and pedo rings, ran casinos, enjoys the suffering of others, demonizes females regularly, bases worth on appearance, no knowledge of foreign policy, criticizes military leaders and POWs, deferred the draft 5 times, makes fun of disabled, accused of rape multiple times and by kids, very litigious person and uses lawyers to bully others, lies dozens of times per day... He ran on a anti-establishment platform and is already being consumed by it before even getting into office. Look at who he's appointing.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a horrible human. I don't get the support of him. My best guess is it grew out of 4chan as a joke, became a 4chan meme, 4chan spread it to reddit, Russian interests and bots fueled it, trump played on fear, hate, and populism, and hear we are.

       See, that's the thing. If threats like that were to be made, surely it's just a matter of saying so – "hey, they just told me that if I don't do x and y, they'll murder me and my family." How could it then fly?

       If I were evil as well as a genius, I'd instead create a torture device that sends electric pain straight into the center of a person's brain and can keep them alive indefinitely in that state. That's really the only thing that I'd truly be afraid of.

       It's not how it works up there. When you hear and read enough stories from whistleblowers, or anonymous insiders, it turns out it's more sinister than you could imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that level, information is power, and they are all blackmailing each other, politicking, bribing newcomers into inner circles etc. If you keep your mouth shut, you'll get $5 million dollars in this bank account with your name on it, ok? If you say no, they take it to the next step, like a frightening event where a would be thief goes a bit too far after telling you to stop digging into that person's past for ex.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if you say, ok I'll just take the $5 million and keep my mouth shut. Well they have you now, you accepted a illegal money. The powers that be will send your country's tax agency after you because your name is attached, and all your claims will go unheard, inadmissable in court or whatever excuse to bury you. You might even get on the news as a criminal in tax evasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have the moral fortitude and smarts to evade them this long, the next level is someone will threaten to take out your sibling, parent/s, girlfriend/boyfriend/partner? [beat up would be a message to show they are serious] If your reaction is "
       <em>
        sure great I wanted that person gone anyway
       </em>
       ", they will list another one until they see they struck a nerve. Your reaction alone will give them what they need, now they know the leverage they will hold over you.
      </p>
      <p>
       In theory it's easy to say, sure I'll just go tell someone, but this is the interlocking evil that is happening at the top of our governments around the world. And truth be told, we all, even researchers, need to be careful.

       Mm, you're right. It's not like I, personally, would be willing to risk the lives of loved ones over matters that it was my choice to consider important. That said, Trump has already imperilled them all, not just on account of becoming president, but because of the social divisions he played a part in fomenting through his participation in the race itself.

       alien presence (or maybe presidents aren't told about that unless they ask specifically, or unless they end up having a real need to know).
      </p>
      <p>
       for any of you familiar with the JFK debacle and a man named E. Howard Hunt, his best friend in DC was a lawyer named Douglas Caddy, who Hunt had recruited to represent/defend the burglars arrested in the Watergate burglary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Douglas Caddy, as an established lawyer in DC and Hunt's best friend (according to Caddy), has written a book and given interviews that include saying that Hunt told him JFK was killed "because he was going to give away our most sensitive secret to the Soviets" (in his quest for mutual cooperation and peace), and when Caddy pressed Hunt on "well, what was it?", he said "the alien presence", and that was right before Hunt went to prison. Didn't seem like a joke to him, and that's all he would say.
      </p>
      <p>
       this interview can be found on the Dark Journalist youtube page.

       Nah, he just realized that there's a lot more shit to being a world leader than he thought, that there's usually no "re-takes" on the political stage, and that this isn't a tv show anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       His demeanor the entire clip they showed of him with Obama?  He had a certain amount of fear in his eyes.  Not fear for his safety or his family's safety--that's nothing.  He could deal with that.  This was that he just realized this is BIG and it's not a game.  He doesn't want to go down as the worst president in US history, as a loser.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it just hit him.

       I too really have noticed a change in his attitude since he won.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Qsvy10D5rtc?t=402">
        The part about Clinton in the speech he gave on election night was really odd and completely contrary to EVERYTHING he's ever said
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the he's trying to push unity but honestly guys you can't say that wasn't deeply out of character? I mean "we owe her a debt?" Just hours earlier it was "Lock her up, lock her up' and calls for special prosecutors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure that concession call from her must have been responsible. Was he made an offer or did she angrily say something she shouldn't have  and let and slip spilling beans in the heat of the moment?
      </p>
      <p>
       Today he looked very unTrump too but in a different way. It was a mix of angry, worried and sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he says
       <a href="https://youtu.be/bAOIKFroshI?t=119">
        "could have been much longer"
       </a>
       I think you can read from that there was some conflict or disagreement that perhaps didn't work out for him or he wasn't finished with an issue.

       Shit has gone down imo.

       It's true. It's eerie, Trump just weeks ago was talking about how he was going to throw Hillary in a jail cell for the rest of her life, how he though Obama was the worst president ever and was anti American and everything. Now he suddenly want to work with both of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could say this is Trump trying to unify america after a rough election, but I think it might be something worse. With all the creepy shit coming out I wouldn't be surprised if they had threatened his family or something along those lines.

       Or he just played his supporters into voting for him. Dude has flip-flopped on his party alliance like 12 times over the years and said in 2008 that Hillary would be a great president.

       Now that he got your vote the true colors are coming out. It's back to business as usual.

       Same, but as someone above said, I hope he maybe takes one for the team and goes on camera and says what he was told, maybe release the names of the people that really run things.

       Me, too. He has a lot hope and change riding on him right now. Hope he can rise above whatever shit he's now finding out about. I wouldn't be surprised if they had some kind of blackmail on him that he wasn't expecting, or like one Redditor said, they threatened his family.

       I think that the biggest secret that is never fully explained is that it is absolutely impossible to get out of debt, that we owe an ever expanding, never repayable sum to private banks (like the banking houses which sit on the board of the Federal Reserve) and that through various steps taken after the civil war, the United States is a Corporation and its people are no longer sovereign...
      </p>
      <p>
       From a legal basis, "We the People" do not have a government that serves us, but rather our future work and toil and income serve to guarantee a debt that cannot be repaid. We, as well as our children, are slaves to debt and the banks can decide who will have success and who fails or has a job.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the most unusual thing about this is that we all like to think it was the Federal Reserve act that began us in this path, but it reality it started during the Civil War. Lincoln was killed to prevent the US from printing its own money and avoiding the bankers.

       It's really everything there is to know about corruption and the huge/global banks poised for a neow world order. And it's been sitting under our nose the whole time!

       Also, while somewhat unpolished,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=gAsnfcOsx0Q">
        this video
       </a>
       scratches the surface about the "big secret". The best part about this as a "conspiracy" is that it's all completely provable! You can check every fact in this video. They may sound unlikely or even crazy, but learn to research for the relevant legal document, and you will find it irrefutable.

       No one knows about Trump, but you can be damn sure that a great tactic would be to implicate him as an insider. -- People fall for that shit.... Or just give the impression that he's going to be too scared to act.

      <p>
       The enemy always tries to appear either stronger or weaker than they actually are. In this case, imho, they are shitting their pants, and there are about 20 "Plan B"s coming into play. Most of them have to do with their favorite tactic... trying to divide his support.

       That the economy is going to implode and 80% of us are going to die.  There is no way that it can be avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Trump will fall for it.  There are big changes coming, but the version favored by the people at the top won't happen.  They can't predict the weather a week from now, let alone the economy 20 years from now.  Its hubris.  Greenspan has been fantastically short sighted and wrong in the past, he's no Daniel.  I remember watching him while he was Fed chairman, he would spend hours saying nothing that could be interpreted a dozen different ways - it was a scam.

       Or maybe he's just waiting for his time to come. Might as well not even waste his time meeting with them or showing any emotion. He knows he's about to take them down so he's just reserved whiles he's in the demons lair

       People are so blind to Trump,he's not a newcomer. He's been hanging out with these people for his entire life. He knows now just like he knew before how things work and what dirty tactics are used. i'm not buyin it.

       Mm, you're right. It's not like I, personally, would be willing to risk the lives of loved ones over matters that it was my choice to consider important. That said, Trump has already imperilled them all, not just on account of becoming president, but because of the social divisions he played a part in fomenting through his participation in the race itself.

       I can say this 5 million times and it won't matter. No one likes her. No one is defending her. She is corrupt as they come. We wanted Sanders. She stole the primary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two things though. Half the shit said about her has already been disproven... Bhengazi, classified emails, pedo rings, late term non-medical abortions...
      </p>
      <p>
       My efforts are the seeking of truth. And as much as I dislike Clinton, I HATE trump even more. I have no idea how you all don't see what he is. Just take one incident, he raped his ex wife. That right there is enough, but he also cheats on all his wives (divorced 3x which shows he's a bit of a bastard), doesn't pay taxes, rated 11/100 on business, takes advantage of the less fortunate and contractors, has the most vile mouth of any presidential candidate, connections to mob and pedo rings, ran casinos, enjoys the suffering of others, demonizes females regularly, bases worth on appearance, no knowledge of foreign policy, criticizes military leaders and POWs, deferred the draft 5 times, makes fun of disabled, accused of rape multiple times and by kids, very litigious person and uses lawyers to bully others, lies dozens of times per day... He ran on a anti-establishment platform and is already being consumed by it before even getting into office. Look at who he's appointing.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a horrible human. I don't get the support of him. My best guess is it grew out of 4chan as a joke, became a 4chan meme, 4chan spread it to reddit, Russian interests and bots fueled it, trump played on fear, hate, and populism, and hear we are.
