    <div class="md"><p>I can say this 5 million times and it won&#39;t matter. No one likes her. No one is defending her. She is corrupt as they come. We wanted Sanders. She stole the primary. </p>

<p>Two things though. Half the shit said about her has already been disproven... Bhengazi, classified emails, pedo rings, late term non-medical abortions... </p>

<p>My efforts are the seeking of truth. And as much as I dislike Clinton, I HATE trump even more. I have no idea how you all don&#39;t see what he is. Just take one incident, he raped his ex wife. That right there is enough, but he also cheats on all his wives (divorced 3x which shows he&#39;s a bit of a bastard), doesn&#39;t pay taxes, rated 11/100 on business, takes advantage of the less fortunate and contractors, has the most vile mouth of any presidential candidate, connections to mob and pedo rings, ran casinos, enjoys the suffering of others, demonizes females regularly, bases worth on appearance, no knowledge of foreign policy, criticizes military leaders and POWs, deferred the draft 5 times, makes fun of disabled, accused of rape multiple times and by kids, very litigious person and uses lawyers to bully others, lies dozens of times per day... He ran on a anti-establishment platform and is already being consumed by it before even getting into office. Look at who he&#39;s appointing. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a horrible human. I don&#39;t get the support of him. My best guess is it grew out of 4chan as a joke, became a 4chan meme, 4chan spread it to reddit, Russian interests and bots fueled it, trump played on fear, hate, and populism, and hear we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>surely it&#39;s just a matter of saying so</p>

<p>It&#39;s not how it works up there. When you hear and read enough stories from whistleblowers, or anonymous insiders, it turns out it&#39;s more sinister than you could imagine.</p>

<p>At that level, information is power, and they are all blackmailing each other, politicking, bribing newcomers into inner circles etc. If you keep your mouth shut, you&#39;ll get $5 million dollars in this bank account with your name on it, ok? If you say no, they take it to the next step, like a frightening event where a would be thief goes a bit too far after telling you to stop digging into that person&#39;s past for ex.</p>

<p>What if you say, ok I&#39;ll just take the $5 million and keep my mouth shut. Well they have you now, you accepted a illegal money. The powers that be will send your country&#39;s tax agency after you because your name is attached, and all your claims will go unheard, inadmissable in court or whatever excuse to bury you. You might even get on the news as a criminal in tax evasion.</p>

<p>If you have the moral fortitude and smarts to evade them this long, the next level is someone will threaten to take out your sibling, parent/s, girlfriend/boyfriend/partner? [beat up would be a message to show they are serious] If your reaction is &quot;<em>sure great I wanted that person gone anyway</em>&quot;, they will list another one until they see they struck a nerve. Your reaction alone will give them what they need, now they know the leverage they will hold over you.</p>

<p>In theory it&#39;s easy to say, sure I&#39;ll just go tell someone, but this is the interlocking evil that is happening at the top of our governments around the world. And truth be told, we all, even researchers, need to be careful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>alien presence (or maybe presidents aren&#39;t told about that unless they ask specifically, or unless they end up having a real need to know).</p>

<p>for any of you familiar with the JFK debacle and a man named E. Howard Hunt, his best friend in DC was a lawyer named Douglas Caddy, who Hunt had recruited to represent/defend the burglars arrested in the Watergate burglary. </p>

<p>Douglas Caddy, as an established lawyer in DC and Hunt&#39;s best friend (according to Caddy), has written a book and given interviews that include saying that Hunt told him JFK was killed &quot;because he was going to give away our most sensitive secret to the Soviets&quot; (in his quest for mutual cooperation and peace), and when Caddy pressed Hunt on &quot;well, what was it?&quot;, he said &quot;the alien presence&quot;, and that was right before Hunt went to prison. Didn&#39;t seem like a joke to him, and that&#39;s all he would say.</p>

<p>this interview can be found on the Dark Journalist youtube page.</p>

<p>His demeanor the entire clip they showed of him with Obama?  He had a certain amount of fear in his eyes.  Not fear for his safety or his family&#39;s safety--that&#39;s nothing.  He could deal with that.  This was that he just realized this is BIG and it&#39;s not a game.  He doesn&#39;t want to go down as the worst president in US history, as a loser.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too really have noticed a change in his attitude since he won. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qsvy10D5rtc?t=402">The part about Clinton in the speech he gave on election night was really odd and completely contrary to EVERYTHING he&#39;s ever said</a></p>

<p>I understand the he&#39;s trying to push unity but honestly guys you can&#39;t say that wasn&#39;t deeply out of character? I mean &quot;we owe her a debt?&quot; Just hours earlier it was &quot;Lock her up, lock her up&#39; and calls for special prosecutors. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that concession call from her must have been responsible. Was he made an offer or did she angrily say something she shouldn&#39;t have  and let and slip spilling beans in the heat of the moment? </p>

<p>Today he looked very unTrump too but in a different way. It was a mix of angry, worried and sad.</p>

<p>When he says <a href="https://youtu.be/bAOIKFroshI?t=119">&quot;could have been much longer&quot;</a> I think you can read from that there was some conflict or disagreement that perhaps didn&#39;t work out for him or he wasn&#39;t finished with an issue.</p>

<p>Shit has gone down imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the biggest secret that is never fully explained is that it is absolutely impossible to get out of debt, that we owe an ever expanding, never repayable sum to private banks (like the banking houses which sit on the board of the Federal Reserve) and that through various steps taken after the civil war, the United States is a Corporation and its people are no longer sovereign... </p>

<p>From a legal basis, &quot;We the People&quot; do not have a government that serves us, but rather our future work and toil and income serve to guarantee a debt that cannot be repaid. We, as well as our children, are slaves to debt and the banks can decide who will have success and who fails or has a job. </p>

<p>And the most unusual thing about this is that we all like to think it was the Federal Reserve act that began us in this path, but it reality it started during the Civil War. Lincoln was killed to prevent the US from printing its own money and avoiding the bankers.</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://www.xat.org/xat/moneyhistory.html">this</a> and <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/jsmill/us_corporation.htm">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.teamlaw.org/control.htm">this</a>, and you will never look at American History as it had been taught to US again. The winners managed to scrub the entire 19th century by removing our resistance to the central banks, until if could no longer be done.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really everything there is to know about corruption and the huge/global banks poised for a neow world order. And it&#39;s been sitting under our nose the whole time!   </p>

<p>Also, while somewhat unpolished, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=gAsnfcOsx0Q">this video</a> scratches the surface about the &quot;big secret&quot;. The best part about this as a &quot;conspiracy&quot; is that it&#39;s all completely provable! You can check every fact in this video. They may sound unlikely or even crazy, but learn to research for the relevant legal document, and you will find it irrefutable.</p>

<p>If you think everyone&#39;s misunderstanding something, I am an attorney, and at least from my perspective, they&#39;ve got it right.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump will fall for it.  There are big changes coming, but the version favored by the people at the top won&#39;t happen.  They can&#39;t predict the weather a week from now, let alone the economy 20 years from now.  Its hubris.  Greenspan has been fantastically short sighted and wrong in the past, he&#39;s no Daniel.  I remember watching him while he was Fed chairman, he would spend hours saying nothing that could be interpreted a dozen different ways - it was a scam.</p>

<p>Two things though. Half the shit said about her has already been disproven... Bhengazi, classified emails, pedo rings, late term non-medical abortions... </p>

<p>My efforts are the seeking of truth. And as much as I dislike Clinton, I HATE trump even more. I have no idea how you all don&#39;t see what he is. Just take one incident, he raped his ex wife. That right there is enough, but he also cheats on all his wives (divorced 3x which shows he&#39;s a bit of a bastard), doesn&#39;t pay taxes, rated 11/100 on business, takes advantage of the less fortunate and contractors, has the most vile mouth of any presidential candidate, connections to mob and pedo rings, ran casinos, enjoys the suffering of others, demonizes females regularly, bases worth on appearance, no knowledge of foreign policy, criticizes military leaders and POWs, deferred the draft 5 times, makes fun of disabled, accused of rape multiple times and by kids, very litigious person and uses lawyers to bully others, lies dozens of times per day... He ran on a anti-establishment platform and is already being consumed by it before even getting into office. Look at who he&#39;s appointing. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a horrible human. I don&#39;t get the support of him. My best guess is it grew out of 4chan as a joke, became a 4chan meme, 4chan spread it to reddit, Russian interests and bots fueled it, trump played on fear, hate, and populism, and hear we are. </p>
