       Seems to me, that time and time again, the people who continue to go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole, that (many) come to the conclusion that we are in a massive, cosmic battle over souls between God and Satan.  It takes time to piece the puzzle together, but eventually you start seeing the puzzle is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't dare assume everybody comes to this conclusion, but it seems to happen more often than not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately, for me, the Bible has turned into something much more than a book, it almost feels like it has a spirit presence to it, and it is absolutely captivating.  And I certainly have never been a 'bible thumper', but my experiences lately have me questioning so much of my known reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, I wish somebody would have told me the redpill that I took last year was an EXTENDED RELEASE.  what a long, strange trip it has been; discovering reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I consider you guys all brothers/sisters here and most have been woke.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I hope this isn't offensive to anybody, and I ask this all respectfully, of course.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find myself starting over in many ways from these recent experiences we are all having, from the redpill.

       I was a devoted atheist for most of my life, but the further down the rabbit hole I went the harder and harder it became for me to ignore the evidence that there is more to our reality than can be explained away as a mere cosmic accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you choose to place your understanding within the framework of traditional religion, it seems impossible to learn more about the forces at play beneath the surface of our reality without beginning to come to the conclusion that there are real forces at play that you could conceptualize as either god and the devil, or as negative and positive extradimensional intelligences.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion our understanding of quantum mechanics, consciousness, and energy is quickly leading to a reconciliation of science and the teachings that all major religious traditions have been hinting for centuries if not millennia.

       I'm an atheist but was raised "I hope I get my driver's license before the world ends" and know the Bible well. In the past 6 months I have been on the stereotypical rush of the initial journey and have really been wrestling with ideas about the ability of humans to focus and tangibly redirect energy towards a specific outcome.

       I grew up conservative baptist. Went to church twice on Sunday and youth group on Wednesday nights.
      </p>
      <p>
       I almost always run into the good vs evil fight when going down rabbit holes. I believe that it does come down to that probably. However, I have a difficult time when it comes to the bible, myself. But that's my own conviction.

       Maybe, rather than having to create "extradimensional intelligences" in order for your worldview to make sense, you might try looking at alternative, non-conspiratorial explanations for the forces at play. Just a thought.

       I completely agree.  It really does seem that many things I look into lead to a spiritual level.  I think there is a lot that we don't know and it can be hard to understand what the truth of our reality may actually be, but I am becoming increasingly more certain God does exist.

       That's what I found, as well.  I also would say that the people who seem to be in power seem to also truly believe.  In my opinion, we live in a muggle world.

       I don't know if I believe in Satan....but 9/11 was definitely not what we were told...and I believe the perpetraitors are evil people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not really believe in God until I couldn't sleep for 3 days about 6 years ago and I prayed to God to let me sleep and in that moment I was knocked out completely -- the deepest sleep I have ever experienced....but a split second later I was wide awake again because it frightened me more than anything I've ever experienced...then a second later he did it again. and again I was frightened by the power and instantly woke up.

       DMT is a chemical naturally produced in the body that unlocks the 3rd eye (Pineal Gland). DMT is normally consumed every night when you dream but if you don't sleep the DMT will build up and cause a psychedelic vision trip. I have used the sleep deprivation method to do remote viewing and have out of body experiences. All humans have psychic powers but this knowledge is suppressed by FAKE science and lies. Joe Rogan's talk on DMT is a good place to start if you want to learn more.

       That is one of the episodes about DMT. He talks about it on a lot of different occasions. There are other people who talk about it as well if you don't like Joe Rogan. Graham Hancock did a now banned TED talk about the effects of DMT.

       I used to believe in God but over time after being Red-pilled I realized religion was created just to control people. There are no gods in heaven. The entities humans have been worshiping in religion are just a bunch of parasitic control freaks from outer space and other dimensions. Nobody should worship them as they don't deserve it and most of them are extremely evil. The Demiurge and the Archons from the gnostic texts are real. Humanity must get off its knees if we are ever to be freed from them.

       My rabbit hole led me from Christianity, to Atheism, and now to a sort of Gnosticism.

       The core concept remains the same; human consciousness is shifting in one way or another. Everyone is making their own grand epiphanies these days.

       I'm really far down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've hit bumps on the way down where I've entertained the thought of a good and evil, but it quickly gets scrapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am starkly against religion, however I do believe that it serves the great purpose of turning humans into sheep, and if they're sheep they're not wolves.
      </p>
      <p>
       So have I found out that the bible is truth? No, absolutely not. Even as someone that was forced to memorize the entire thing as a kid, it is nothing but a great control tool. I do think that people jump to the conclusion that organized religion is evil, when the reality is without religion some people would be much worse people than they are. Let the weak become mindless sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you go down further into the rabbit hole, you make a lot of realizations. A lot of people here are stuck at the "The Powers That Be control us all and are evil" part of the hole. As you move further down the hole, you realize that without a controlling force, humanity would not be civilized, and we would still be barbaric hunters and gatherers. Not saying that they are good people, it's just that the system MUST exist for humans to be civilized, of course that means that the "controllers" are often corrupted by the power and take it too far.

       I'm shocked that someone on the internet doesn't believe that drug hallucinations aren't them gaining the powers of Dr. Strange and traveling the universe.

       The only people irl I can confirm have done psychedelics (including myself) all take the stance that drugs that short wire synapses in your brain short wire synapses in your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on the internet, everyone seems to have the perception of psychedelics I had before I had actually ever done them. It always makes me wonder how many people are just....
