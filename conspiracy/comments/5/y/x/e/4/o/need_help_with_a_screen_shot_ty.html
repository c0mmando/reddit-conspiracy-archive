       Just working on the theory in the forentioned thread. Its apart of my recent theory on earthquake predictions. (view my past posts). Japan is having a seismic episode (literally now)-

       Just steady documentation. If we find a relevant link, then the size and duration of past events will help in terms of estimating future events per episode basis.

       Essentially I leave everything documented public, because I feel that this is being highly overlooked-

       By narrowing down the elements and using past data sets I hope to be able to truly dig into this phenomenon; Eventually leading humanity into having a working model for all (solar wind) caused / seismic events.

       Since this incident was rather sharp I simply wanted to get it recorded asap. 
In short the graphic is a rolling one...
Once its off I am unable to archive the specifics. (I dont speak russian) so using the sites archives is difficult for me. Its also helpful to do this all in order. Makes the last data easier to sort. Via timeline.

       Japan just had a 3 quake series, (following this event). Live feeds heart monitor (i.e deep ground pulse detector) is not beeping currently. So its certainly not looking good for japan at the moment.

       If its suspicious0bservers. I know of his work...
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres a relevantly large community of us. (i.e. dutchsince, the solar observer, bp earthwatch ect...). 
I've been involved in solar weather observations (maybe 7 years now)? 
Typically I was most interested in fission, but my passion for fusion grew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ben's likely the leader in resources and financial capital. Maybe even a spokesman? Yet these updates are my own- (no affiliations).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tragically I don't agree with alot of his work and I feel like hes something of a showboat / whom prides his efforts over others. Leaching most his work from the vast communities whom are researching these connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a healthy jealousy because I truly believe in these earthquakes being directly tied to solar events. But the one moment someone like ben embarrasses the community, it will effect the whole community.
      </p>
      <p>
       The science wasnt ready to produce an earthquake prediction ap by my opinion. 
So to me he really abused all our work for a profit and is now selling a only half ready? Device.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not ground breaking or highly accurate. Its essentially a work in progress-
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I am worried about that is because if its made out to be a 'scam' and the users feel cheated. That effects all of us...
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that but if he embarresses any researchers in the field. (making false conclusions), how willing will they be to reinvest their time into future projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there are little things that I feel are off about his models.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me this is about flux conveyoring of plasma tubes in their reaction to proton bombardment. To him its something related to storm systems and basic magnetosphere bombardment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean were all just theorists. I used to resoect ben much more in the past. Yet after he essentially ropped off the science to go public woth hos 'eq' app. 
I just lost resoect for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose its like someone taking credit for the entire classes homework. Then keeping the reward (that none of us have even earned yet) for himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't think what he did was fair to these communities is all. 
Quite insulting really because I feel like it makes all our work and research more vulnderable (to mistakes we haven't made ourselves). :/
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying I am perfect or even a better plotter. Thats not the argument....
The arguments that none of us are 100% on this yet. So to have made it seem like he was ready to build an app. That was an edison vs tesla move-

       This is an excellent reply. Thank you for taking the time. Keep doing what you're doing. I've only been vaguely interested in Schumann's Resonances, but over a period of time. I'm mainly into the brainwave angle. I use to work around punch presses in the aerospace industry and I've seen some heavy duty examples of entrainment. 
"Flux conveyoring of plasma tubes" I tend to lean towards smaller particle observation as a means to explain larger phenomenon. I think I vaguely remember reading about this? The phenomenon of super heated particles that tend to rise to the sun's surface faster? Not sure.
Anyways, don't worry about him damaging the science too much. Just put out a better product and people will pay attention.

       See that is my problem. It isnt a product to me.

      <p>
       In reference to flux tubes. I feel that the velocity of solar winds striking the earths flux tubes seed them causing them to conveyor at alternate speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       This converoring process super conducts the earths magma chambers leading to pocket expansion and seosmic evemts as the energy emits to the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also the exolainaton for why earthquake lightning occurs in my opinion. Essentially the planet is ejecting the deposited energy.

       Slightly? 
More so I view it as basic cosmic wind and particle bombardment. I do believe there are electrons neutrinos ect with an electric property. Yet to me its plasma on plasma. Essentially weve recently been anle to photograph the earths plasma flux tubes. (proving their existence).
To me when protons penetrate the earths magnetosphere, (I assess) that they carry within their properties either a weight ratio or energetic discharge which is either a. Slowing the conveyor, or b. Speeding it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The external seeding in the high atmosphere reduces or speeds up the conveyoring leading to suoer heating within the earths core.
