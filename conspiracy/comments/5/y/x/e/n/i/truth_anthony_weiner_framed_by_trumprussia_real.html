       Put aside your feelings for Trump for one second and just consider the evidence in this theory. You want TRUTH, it starts by considering evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a conspiracy theory that NEEDS more attention and is well researched and backed up. The allegations are mind blowing, and when viewing this whole Trump-Russia fiasco through the eyes of these theories it makes things a lot more clear. Anyone who has been following the Trump-Russia scandal and thinks MSM or Intelligence Community doesn't have any real dirt or connections needs to read what Louise Mencsh is digging up. Firstly some background on the Author, Louise Mensch:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Former British MP
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She works as an independent journalist for FOX News parent company News. Corp.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She is credited for breaking stories such as the FISA warrant on Trump Tower's server which is connected to Russian banks, BEFORE MSM even had a sniff of it here:
         <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/17/louise-mensch-trump-russia-ties-media-scoop">
          https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/17/louise-mensch-trump-russia-ties-media-scoop
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She also broke a story a couple weeks ago about Trump's plane and a Russian Oligarch's plane landing in the same airport and possibly having a secret meeting during the election that is ONLY now being reported by Rachel Maddow TONIGHT. Maddow's report confirming Mensch's own reporting is here:
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnfeSitSbRA">
          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnfeSitSbRA
         </a>
         Proof that Mensch knew about it before Maddow is here:
         <a href="https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/830903681927303168">
          https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/830903681927303168
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She also wrote a story last week about Jeff Session's connections to Russia BEFORE the knowledge of his meetings became public. You can read her breakdown of Session's Russian connections here DATED FEB 7:
         <a href="https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-suspect/">
          https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-suspect/
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She has been quoted saying “I’ve never been sued because I’ve never been wrong,” in the aforementioned Guardian article.
In short, she comes off as a conspiracy nut but her theories are being proven more and more true as MSM catches up with her and corroborates her claims.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Now on to the Carolina Conspiracy. You can read about it here and come to your own conclusions:
       <a href="https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/02/14/the-carolina-conspiracy-putin-catfished-weiner-louise-mensch/">
        https://patribotics.wordpress.com/2017/02/14/the-carolina-conspiracy-putin-catfished-weiner-louise-mensch/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my best attempt at summarizing her findings:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Overall theory: Russia working with Trump PLANTED Huma Abedin's now famous October Surprise emails on Anthony Weiner's computer so that the FBI could find it. They then forced Comey's hand to report it hurting HRC's chances in the election. In order to do this, they hacked Anthony Weiner's computer, then had Russian hackers SEXT with him on a confirmed hacked program, they then revealed through Putin related journos at the DailyMail that the girl was 15 to FORCE the FBI to have to investigate his laptop, therefore finding the Huma Abedin emails.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Russia has operatives within the NY FBI Field office and the NYPD (through Rudy Giuliani and General Flynn). 9/11 Mayor Rudy has known history of NYPD and corruption, see here:
         <a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/rudy-giuliani-legacy-racism-corruption/">
          https://www.liberationnews.org/rudy-giuliani-legacy-racism-corruption/
         </a>
         He's also publically boasted about his FBI ties here:
         <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/nyregion/as-trump-ally-rudy-giuliani-hints-at-ties-to-the-fbi.html">
          https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/nyregion/as-trump-ally-rudy-giuliani-hints-at-ties-to-the-fbi.html
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A Russian Hacker named Yvgeny Nikulin who has been confirmed to be indicted in the hacking of Dropbox, Linked-in and Formspring in 2012-2013 is involved in Trump's connections to Russia. Link:
         <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring">
          https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Anthony Weiner used Formspring to sext with "15 year old girl" which made him vulnerable to Nikulin's hacking.
The "15 year old girl" story was posted by pro-Trump DailyMail's Alana Goodman which lead the FBI to investigate Weiner's laptop
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Alana Goodman has been seen photographed @ Trump Tower partying with Russian State-Owned Media Sputnik reporter Cassandra Fairbanks. Fairbanks is known as a hacker fangirl and has also been photographed with Trump and the first lady. Source:
         <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CuvT9_CWcAAkp5e.jpg">
          https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CuvT9_CWcAAkp5e.jpg

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Weiner was not sexting with a 15 year old girl but actually being manipulated by Russian connected hacking group ‘Crackas With Attitude’ who have been caught previously hacking the head of the CIA, and a great many FBI agents, police officers, and other law enforcement officials. Read about Crackas with Attitude here:
         <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/fbi-arrests-two-alleged-members-of-group-that-hacked-the-cia-director">
          https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/fbi-arrests-two-alleged-members-of-group-that-hacked-the-cia-director
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         One of the Attorney General's charged with "prosecuting" Crackas with Attitude is Jeff Session's # 2 guy: Dana Boente. Hackers who coordinated the hack on Anthony Weiner's laptop planted Hilary Clinton's emails on that laptop for James Comey to find and then was forced to reveal his findings publically as we all know during the election.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Russia needed to invent an underage victim "the 15 year old girl" in order for the FBI to look at Weiner's laptop in the first place. Before this, all of Weiner's storied sexual deviancy had been with older women.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Weiner has NOT been indicted yet (which is weird) and has stated publicly that he has emails which prove that this sexting fiasco is a hoax. Which is probably why he hasn't been indicted yet. Analysis of the "15 year old girls" emails to Weiner include admission that "You Got Catfished by a Dude" and also contains 4 passages plagiarized from books that a 15 year old girl from North Carolina probably hadn't read. These passages were from the books: Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace. Fight Club, Chuck Palahniuk. Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters and Seymour an Introduction, both by J.D. Salinger. Tales of Ordinary Madness, “A Dollar and Twenty Cents” by Charles Bukowski. He was also supposed to have a hearing on Mar 7. This has since been postponed without reasons given. Probably because he was framed and it's for national security reasons:
         <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/federal-court-hearing-tuesday-march-7-clinton-email-case-judicial-watch-seeking-answers-abedinweiner-laptop-emails/">
          http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/federal-court-hearing-tuesday-march-7-clinton-email-case-judicial-watch-seeking-answers-abedinweiner-laptop-emails/
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The "15 year old girl" and her father who is an attorney HAVE NOT been cooperating or working with law enforcement individuals since the sexting scandal came to light. And they have NOT filed a police report on the incident.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lara Trump was in the hometown of the "15 year old girl" on October 21st and boasted about the Hilary Clinton email October Surprise even though she had no legal way of knowing they existed. She may have been instrumental in finding a "15 year old girl" to match with the story.

       I've entered the deep dark rabbit hole of conspiracy and cant get out. Can you atleast consider the evidence? Look, maybe you like Trump, maybe I don't. But both of us would rather know the truth than not. I look at the evidence and it makes sense. Put aside your politics, and just LOOK.

       I've got no political leaning. I understand the frustration of trying to squeeze quality conversation out of people though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats planned to push the Russian narrative on whomever won the Republican nomination, as revealed by wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weiner's evidence was only handed over to federal hands after finding and being backed up(allegedly), by the NYPD.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the current media empire, owned by roughly 6 conglomerates hates him.
       <em>
        Hates
       </em>
       him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like him, but the old-blood pedocrats and deep state are terrified of him. And that's enough for me at the moment.

       Right. The NYPD's role in this theory is laid out. As well as the FBI NY Field Office. Both of which have strong ties to Rudy Guiliani, and his partners. You don't become the mayor 9/11 mayor of NY without having connections to both those offices, I would assume.
Check out this link on his corruption and ties to NYPD:

       Talkin about Weiner? Of course. He's a sexual deviant that is being blamed by MSM for costing HRC the election. This has nothing to do with this theory, only to show that MSM hasn't caught wind of it yet, but whats new.

       We talking bout Trump right? I don't necessarily think they hate him. GOP and their corporate overlords seem to love him right now. Big Oil, Banks, Big Pharma, he's doing them all huge favors.

       Analysis of the "15 year old girls" emails to Weiner include admission that "You Got Catfished by a Dude" and also contains 4 passages plagiarized from books that a 15 year old girl from North Carolina probably hadn't read. These passages were from the books: Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace. Fight Club, Chuck Palahniuk. Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters and Seymour an Introduction, both by J.D. Salinger. Tales of Ordinary Madness, “A Dollar and Twenty Cents” by Charles Bukowski

       I would think that the kind of 15 year old who seduces a married, 40 yr old former senator, would be reading precisely these books:)

       It's been this way for a while now.   If you don't hate shillary and continue to beat a dead horse instead of actually look at what drumpf is doing, you'll get shouted down.  Sad, but it is what it is.

       Even if you still hate shillary but speak ill of drumpf, you'll still get called a shill.

I know you're getting downvotes in here, but don't be discouraged. This place is beyond political the last year or so. There are lots of lurkers though. Keep it up. Sooner or later this place will let go of this shit and start returning to normal and stuff like this will help.

       Thanks lol. Just surprised that a conspiracy forum is so heavily politicized right now. I thought that was the whole TPTB's plan to divide us, and yet it looks like we can't even consider theories because of that divide.

       Yes. I realize that about Maddow. From my understanding though, Mensch is credited her by her followers of first noting the connection and following the planes. I think those articles sprung from her research, but could be wrong. I assumed her hardcore followers wouldn't credit her for it and congratulate her everytime a MSM outlet or even alternative news outlet wrote an article about it.

       The first I saw about the planes were from people who worked at airports and were following them. I got the impression that people follow jets like they do trains.

       This is a well thought out draft and could make a compelling case  but when you put some thought behind all the pieces you call evidence - it falls apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       For 1 - the Russian business man who has a proven business relationship with Trump well before the election and has ties to Putin.  What does that mean to anything? Up top its a small world but I don't see it as "evidence" to your theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton and Lynch met on a tarmac to talk about grand kids during the time Clinton was being investigated.  That to me is not credible evidence but definitely suspect as hell because Lynch played a critical role as head of DOJ.  Very odd coincidence but again its not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This journalist was the first to drop the story about Trump servers being tied to Russian Banks.  From what I have read on both sides - it is not credible.  From my understanding his servers were not pinged directly by those banks but the marketing firm hired by Trump Towers which has a Russian clients was getting the ping.  It was directly to Trumps servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Soros and leaders from other foreign countries met with Clinton before and during the election.  I mean who starts a non-profit and gets stinking rich?  It is something you don't read about in Inc magazine.  This in my opinion is credible evidence to foreign influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it odd that this journalist who gets news ahead of anyone is leading us down the right path.  That journalist may have some factual truth that ties to behavior of a greater conspiracy everyone wants to be true.  There is a fine line in my opinion.  Its like thinking the NFL is rigged.  You can dig and find all kinds of typical behavior to support your theory but the more behavior you throw into the mix that are not that great - it waters down the impact.

       It wasn't intended to come off that way.  I re-read my post and don't find it bashing or in disagreement to the entire theory.  I said it was a good draft and well thought out but suggested to cut out the weak points or strengthen them through more research.

       Although theory that Weiner was deceived and/or hacked is possible, there is nothing here that absolves Weiner as long as he was taking part. There is nothing that suggests emails were planted or damaging until read. Kurt Eichenwald who you can look up quoting his own source said that the emails were duplicates of old stuff. Then there was Robert K. Boyce “What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to WikiLeaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.”

       The famous HRC emails that were "found" on Weiner's laptop by the NYPD and NY FBI FIELD OFFICE. To which Comey wrote a letter to congress, that leaked saying new emails were found and we will continue to investigate HRC's emails for wrong doing.
