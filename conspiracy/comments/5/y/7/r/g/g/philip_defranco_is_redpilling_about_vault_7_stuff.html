       As a security professional I'll say he did a good job. He got 'attribution' well covered and this has been my problem the entire time; the technical details aren't there to support Russia attribution.

       I'm sure if the Cia had equivalent dirt on russia they would release it in a heart beat. Not saying it doesn't exist but saying wikileaks is with Russia because they haven't leaked Russian shit is silly. Wikileaks also has not released anything about North Korea. Are they NK agents now too? What about Canada? No wikileaks implicating Canadians so let's blame canada!

       Honestly we need to stop worrying about where information comes from and start acting on the information we have.

       Nah its not weird. People are assuming wiki leaks has dirt on everyone.  What if they only have access to X or Y database? Then even if they wanted to release Russian or Canadian or NK stuff they wouldn't be able to by the fact they just don't have that data.
       <br/>
       I don't see any news organizations even posit that it might be the case that the amount of info wikileaks   has is actually limited or finite
       <br/>
       They just keep pushing the narrative that because they don't post stuff against other govts... they must be in cahoots...
       <br/>
       Silly logic

       r/conspiracy is not a therapy group, or at least it shouldn't be. If that's what you're looking for, I hope you find the help you need. In the meantime, this sub is to present the best evidences of manipulation and grift on large scales to see who's actually benefiting from deals that are bad for the rest of us. I don't give a shit if you want to defend the Russian dictatorial kleptocracy. If that's how you want to spend your time, so be it. However, don't tell me how I should feel about our leaders making power deals for their own good with the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       And please go home with what you think the "elite world government" would do--as if it's a unified thing. There are as many agendas as there are people. But to be clear, are you saying you don't give a shit if the current president made lucrative personal deals with Russian intelligence to line his own pockets?

       Or possibly another hacker group loyal to the Russians (or an arm of Russian intelligence) has released docs in an attempt to shift interest away from the brewing shitstorm of Trump-Russian collusion. Seems likely to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no way for anyone to check if these docs were released by Wikileaks or by "Wikileaks".

       It's more for the audience. Imagine normies watching a video more than 5 minutes where they aren't spoon fed. On the other hand it does make it a lot easier for the content creator to sound smart and efficient. I prefer you tubers who read off of a sheet or their computers and don't do cuts.

He insisted that the only other explanation for the Russian fingerprints was that the CIA had to have leaked the documents, which is just untrue. He's either very stupid or propaganda. Fuck sxephil.

       As I already said, he said the only explanation for the DNC hacks was that the CIA leaked them, which doesn't make any sense so it still had to be the Russians. He ignored all the other possibilities, which (as I said) makes him either very stupid or propaganda.

       I know what you said, and you're not hearing how your interpretation is clouded by your personal feelings. He never talks in absolutes and only offers up theories for both the Russians hacking and if the CIA made it look like they were hacking. He offers no absolutes and provides a thoughtful and unbiased starter discussion on the matter. I am not trying to put you down, only reach out and help you see a more neutral perspective. Peace ✌️

       He did, your fandom is clouding your judgement. He also didn't mention to other possibilities, which is why he's being intentionally stupid or just stupid.

       No, I didn't. He went into a spiel about how if the CIA leaked the DNC documents then it means the CIA had to be working for Trump and are now also doing the Russia narrative which is against Trump but that doesn't make any sense so it had to be the Russians.

       Dude, you realize you just linked to a part of the video where he is literally explaining two sides of the issue..you really aren't seeing how your decision making skills are clouded by a passion for what you believe in..it's fine to be passionate but your attacking someone who actually made a real effort to be unbiased, which is awesome. Unbiased news and our own abilities to rationally think are important..

       He said, "To me that doesn't make sense because.." and went in to explain his faulty logic. He is not being unbiased at all, even a little bit
 You're refusing to see wth because of your fandom so don't try and project your irrationality on me.

       Character? I would imagine that the CIA has already put Jason Bourne in play to shut Assange down and recovery any intel he can. They have  had a itchy trigger finger for Assange for years. Now I doubt they will even ask for permission from Bush Sr. if the they can kill him.

       I never saw it as a superiority thing but just a simple distinction based on the fact that there are certain conversations we have here every day that I wouldn't even dream about bringing up to a coworker because of how I assume they would perceive

        me

       Well, the problem is they do. Not a whole lot of people, but those who do use the term use it frequently to describe inconvenient truths. I think it's an immature term and its use further alienates the conversation away from substance and focuses too much on the word choice. It also immediately identifies the poster as a cliche to me, a caricature that uses edgy language to separate themselves from the group think they perceive in the "normies" as they call them.
