<p>Astroturfing: what is it and why does it matter? | Adam Bienkov ...
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com">https://www.theguardian.com</a> › Opinion › Internet</p>

<p>Feb 8, 2012 - Astroturfing is the attempt to create an impression of widespread grassroots support ( or in this case, <strong>opposition</strong> ) for a policy, individual, or product, where little such support exists. Multiple online identities and fake pressure groups are used to mislead the public into believing that the position of the astroturfer is the commonly held view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a good sticky on this up in this sub until recently about astroturfing in r/esist. It&#39;s like they aren&#39;t even trying to hide it. </p>

<p>It seems to me like it would make much more sense to consolidate all of your likeminded people into one sub to be able to get to the FP with just your userbase (a la TD), not into 25 different subs with the same agenda that clearly aren&#39;t getting to the FP by their own means. Often you can go to these subs and see they have one post from the day at 20k+ upvotes while everything else on their &quot;hot&quot; page sits around 50-200</p>

<p>In a way this makes sense. But it would be just as easy to have the same people subscribe to more than one sub. That&#39;s what I&#39;d do if I was the one running an astroturfing op.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set up 5 or 10 subs.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the same people (employees?) to sign up for each one.</p></li>
<li><p>Coordinate brigade upvoting for selected posts and push them to the front page.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>But this doesn&#39;t explain why the average &quot;hot&quot; post on resist gets upvoted by less than 1% of its subscribers and inexplicably gets 1 post per day on average to the frontpage</p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying what you&#39;re saying is surely a factor as well. I don&#39;t think all 46k of resist&#39;s subscribers are fake. I think it&#39;s a combination of both, with the vast majority likely being real subscribers. I think it is very likely that other subs are astroturfing in favor of Trump. I just happen to think it&#39;s more obvious when it comes to the anti Trump subs that there is something suspicious going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a Donald post where their was something like 800k up votes that as documented a few weeks ago. Every sub will have their bots/users looking to manipulate the narrative. It&#39;s what happens when your forum grows to the size of reddit </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I absolutely agree with what you&#39;re saying. My only argument is that it is much easier to find evidence of this at present in the anti Trump subs due to the fact that in TD and similar subs, the genuine users also fervently upvote everything pro Trump, making manipulation harder to see. whereas in places like resist the userbase doesn&#39;t seem to be as naturally active, which makes it easier to see.</p>

<p>Just been to T_D and no post has ever come close to  even a quarter of the amount of up votes you&#39;re claiming. Could you possibly find this post that was apparently documented a few weeks ago and post the link? I would really appreciate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right, it doesn&#39;t detract from the fact that there are many people who don&#39;t like him, but that&#39;s exactly the argument. If there are so many of them, why does one post hit 30k upvotes per day while the rest of the sub is sitting so low? Resist has 46k subscribers, how come nothing gets over 500 votes unless it&#39;s getting sent to the front-page, which only happens with around 1 post per day? If all the posts were sitting around 500-1000, with a couple big 10k+ posts, I wouldn&#39;t have any suspicions at all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did, and my personal experience of 2/3 places mentioned directly contradicts yours. Here&#39;s a tip: If the default position fed to people is baseless hatred you&#39;d be surprised how easy it is to appeal to common sense. If you attempt to defend Trump at all you won&#39;t see the headline-parrot reaction in people. Shocking! In fact you&#39;ll find centipedes keeping quiet out of shame and intimidation.</p>

<p>A lot of people will laugh along at the piss jokes because they haven&#39;t had to form their own opinion. I&#39;d suspect there&#39;s people you know that are growing weary of you, should you be the sort to constantly bring up Trump. They&#39;ll agree and grit their teeth. I know because I&#39;ve had to do it, as have my Trump supporting friends (in Ireland).</p>

<p>Rough numbers put pro-Trump at about 1/3 here, of those who participate in polling or other social media. That&#39;s without even touching on the older generation... but they&#39;re just old and backwards, right? Should die, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is so, so anti-Trump.</p>

<p>It&#39;s disgusting. It&#39;s biased. You can&#39;t post anything remotely pro-Trump without instantly being spam-downvoted by bots. I watched a post receive an inhuman amount of downvotes within 60 seconds of being posted today.</p>

<p>TL;DR Shit&#39;s crazy.</p>
