<blockquote>
<p>Bush was never corrupt really, just bad.</p>

<p>If you look beyond the time he spent as a president, he actually seems like a really awesome dude.. just not the kind of dude you would want running a country.</p>

<p>I think once people got over how unimpressive of a president he was, they realized he&#39;s just a goofy guy who was in way over his head.</p>

<p>Bush was never actually a bad guy, IMO, he just took advice from some shitty people.</p>

<p>He&#39;s very social and well-liked by people who meet him in person. Although some downturns in his presidency can be spotted, easily, he&#39;s one man that&#39;s very social and adaptive to almost any social situation, and coming out on top. If you ask me, that&#39;s someone you want in office as long they have sufficient political skills/intelligence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy how much I, basically a liberal, miss W these days. I mean I always thought he was a cool dude but now if give my left nut to have him back in office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was in one thread. I&#39;ve saw a lot like these past couple of days. Wtf is going on? </p>

<p>Did Reddit forget he is a war criminal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s what Trump supporters are missing here. They wanted anti-establishment and they got it.</p>

<p>Trump ran as a reform candidate briefly. He isn&#39;t a Republican and he is facing down BOTH parties... one just sees an opportunity to exploit him to ram through unpopular actions and then pin the blame to him before they throw him on the funeral pyre.</p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t going to &quot;win&quot; against the deep state. The Republicans are just squeezing the juice out of him before they ditch his husk.</p>

<p>Poppy is close to finally meeting his maker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Poppy passes away, he&#39;ll meet the demon that he has been serving while here on Earth - the one he pledged his loyalty to. It&#39;ll come as a shock. But he deserves it. </p>

<p>After suffering his torment for many years, unable to forget that he brought all of that suffering on himself, he is going to choose to rectify his mistakes by going at it for another round. This time, he&#39;ll preemptively punish himself by deliberately avoiding all the benefits he was born with in this incarnation. He&#39;ll suffer there, too.</p>

<p>Poppy is several lifetimes away from meeting the real maker. </p>

I think it&#39;s more important that people learn to dole out the consequences in this lifetime.  The reason these people, powerful families do what they do is because there are no consequences for what they do.  At least that&#39;s how I see it.</p>

<p>We already know these people pay no material/physical/emotional price on this plane.</p>

<p>But (in the words of Mordo) the bill comes due. We&#39;ve been paying in this world, which will lower the due in the next, but they&#39;ve been TAKING, constantly. They will have a MASSIVE bill to deal with when they have to give up their corporeal power/wealth/status. </p>

<p>And we all do eventually.</p>

<p>Why are you sticking up for a war criminal anyways? He is a horrible war criminal who is responsible for over a million innocent lives, and you are sticking up for him because of your dislike for Trump? I don&#39;t even know what this has to do with Trump. I just hate Bush and the sudden love for him on Reddit is fucking retarded. </p>
