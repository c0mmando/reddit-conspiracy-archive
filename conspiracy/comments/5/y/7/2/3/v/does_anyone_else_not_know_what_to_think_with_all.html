       It really just wows me. Pro-Bush posts, and then tons of comments like.. I'll just copy and paste what I'm reading
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Bush was never corrupt really, just bad.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you look beyond the time he spent as a president, he actually seems like a really awesome dude.. just not the kind of dude you would want running a country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think once people got over how unimpressive of a president he was, they realized he's just a goofy guy who was in way over his head.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bush was never actually a bad guy, IMO, he just took advice from some shitty people.
       </p>
       <p>
        He's very social and well-liked by people who meet him in person. Although some downturns in his presidency can be spotted, easily, he's one man that's very social and adaptive to almost any social situation, and coming out on top. If you ask me, that's someone you want in office as long they have sufficient political skills/intelligence.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's crazy how much I, basically a liberal, miss W these days. I mean I always thought he was a cool dude but now if give my left nut to have him back in office.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That was in one thread. I've saw a lot like these past couple of days. Wtf is going on?

       Liberals. Don't worry, they only come up for air for the briefest of moments.

       For what it's worth, Jimmy Carter got a few more years of attention under Obama.

       I think that's what Trump supporters are missing here. They wanted anti-establishment and they got it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump ran as a reform candidate briefly. He isn't a Republican and he is facing down BOTH parties... one just sees an opportunity to exploit him to ram through unpopular actions and then pin the blame to him before they throw him on the funeral pyre.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump isn't going to "win" against the deep state. The Republicans are just squeezing the juice out of him before they ditch his husk.

       When Poppy passes away, he'll meet the demon that he has been serving while here on Earth - the one he pledged his loyalty to. It'll come as a shock. But he deserves it.
      </p>
      <p>
       After suffering his torment for many years, unable to forget that he brought all of that suffering on himself, he is going to choose to rectify his mistakes by going at it for another round. This time, he'll preemptively punish himself by deliberately avoiding all the benefits he was born with in this incarnation. He'll suffer there, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poppy is several lifetimes away from meeting the real maker.

       I wish I could believe as you do, but instead I feel they pay no karmic price.  The thought makes us feel better though.  I think it's more important that people learn to dole out the consequences in this lifetime.  The reason these people, powerful families do what they do is because there are no consequences for what they do.  At least that's how I see it.

       We already know these people pay no material/physical/emotional price on this plane.

       But (in the words of Mordo) the bill comes due. We've been paying in this world, which will lower the due in the next, but they've been TAKING, constantly. They will have a MASSIVE bill to deal with when they have to give up their corporeal power/wealth/status.

       Bush has always been a terrible guy, and thought of as a terrible guy, way before anything to do with Trump. So what you said doesn't really make sense at all.

       No. I've remembered he is terrible every single day after the Iraq war. Has nothing at all to do with Trump. This post has literally 0 to do with Trump. Idc what he says about Trump. He could love Trump and I'm still going to say he is a terrible person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you sticking up for a war criminal anyways? He is a horrible war criminal who is responsible for over a million innocent lives, and you are sticking up for him because of your dislike for Trump? I don't even know what this has to do with Trump. I just hate Bush and the sudden love for him on Reddit is fucking retarded.

       No... The "funny" part is how he finished his term in disgrace as an all-but-convicted war-criminal. Blatantly corrupt crony of the wealthy. Murderer, racist, homophobe, terrorist, liar... And now we're supposed to listen to HIM talk about ethics and racism.

       Honestly these people would change their mind if Hitler shaved his mustache, went on a show, and told a few jokes. I don't understand how people go from disliking Bush for being a war criminal and for being involved in the deaths of over a million people, to "hehe fucking great painter".

       Something will probably be released about him soon. His daddy was CIA so it's quite possible he pulled some strings and had his dipshit son places in the presidency. Hopefully some Bush 9/11 shit comes out. I'd like to see that family answer for somethings before they all punch the clock.

       I never see ANY speculation that Trump or the GOP do the same exact thing. It's actually a pretty sad indictment of what's happening to

       What I see are a bunch of people saying things like "I never thought I'd see the day I wished Bush was back in office" because Trump is such s shit show.  He's bad enough to make Bush seem good by comparison.  I hated him as president, but respect the way he's handled himself since leaving office.
