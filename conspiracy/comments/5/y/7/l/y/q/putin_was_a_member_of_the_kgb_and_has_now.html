       To be fair, he may have done a Russian equivalent.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The 1999 Russian apartment bombings were a series of attacks carried out on four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow, and Volgodonsk in September 1999 that killed 293 people and injured more than 1000 and spread a wave of fear across the country. Together with the Dagestan War, the bombings led the country into the Second Chechen War.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The blasts hit Buynaksk on 4 September, Moscow on 9 and 13 September, and Volgodonsk on 16 September. An explosive device similar to those used in these bombings was found and defused in an apartment block in the Russian city of Ryazan on 22 September.[1] The next day, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan and ordered the air bombing of Grozny, which marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War.[2] According to the Moscow City Court, these were acts of terrorism organized and financed by the leaders of the illegal armed group Caucasus Islamic Institute.[3]
        <strong>
         Thirty-six hours later, three FSB agents who had planted this device were arrested by the local police.
        </strong>
        The incident was declared to have been a training exercise.
        <strong>
         There are allegations that the bombings were a "false flag" attack perpetrated by the FSB in order to legitimise the resumption of military activities in Chechnya and help Vladimir Putin attain the presidency.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
       Interestingly, those (possible) false flag attacks were carried out in September 1999.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the US' oligarchs take a page out of Putin's playbook? Or was Putin taking a page out of the US' playbook by copying the 1993 WTC bombing that could have been prevented by the FBI, but was allowed to continue?

       I'm sure it's vetted and it involves favors that extend beyond Putin, Bush, Clinton, Obama, Trump, whomever.  There is much bigger stuff going on behind the curtain.  These false idols are the mouthpieces for tptb.  You don't become a leader of a powerful country without giving in to tptb

       The truth sounds crazy to the ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's okay friend. We are all on different levels of awakening. No one's journey is the same. But you're here in this sub because you want the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're seeking the truth, you need to be willing to leave your comfort zone, if even but for a second.

       You seem to be stuck on the "politicians are big meanies who do bad stuff" phase. You need to realize it's not about identity politics. You can't just say Obama bad Trump good; for their strings are played by the same hand.

       Okay I see you completely missed the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is, you're still referring to countries by name, and leaders by name, as if
      </p>
      <p>
       It's that particular country's choice, or that particular leaders choice to commit such acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the goal of globalism? Right. One guy, one government, one currency, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in order to progress, we need to stop talking about Putin or Obama or Hillary, or Merkel, etc. It's not them. They are scapegoats.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are the puppets that the puppet master is controlling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck, Soros and the Rothschilds aren't even the top. The reason we even know their names is because they were the designated fall guys. The real leader,
       <em>
        if I were the real leader
       </em>
       of the NWO, I would make sure no one knew my name. I surely wouldn't be amassing a fortune in the public eye at the expense of other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that sheds a little light on the real issue at hand.

       Right.

      <p>
       If that were true, we'd be giving them the ol' Syria freedom ringing Libya liberating treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason Russia is doing as well as it is,
       <em>
        literally taking Crimea by force
       </em>
       without any real blowback.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its because Russia is being protected. Russia and the United states(as well as Israel), are all fighting to be the capital of the NWO. That's why those countries can be so involved in world affairs and controversial things, yet remain protected.

       I don't even understand your original statement.

       Putin doesn't live in the USA. Putin isn't president of the USA. If he controlled Russia for 117 years, isn't that the responsibility of the Russians?

       If you're a sub that has clear disdain for intelligence communities controlling government Putin should be the prime example of why that's bad. That is clearly not the agenda here in regards to him/Russia.

       This also isn't an American sub Reddit. It's not for Americans to fix Americans problems. It's supposedly for shinning the light on conspiracy theories.  The control of the world by corrupt powers being one.
