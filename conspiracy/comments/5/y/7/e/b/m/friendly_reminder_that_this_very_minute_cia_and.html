       The CIA has small elements which can and very much do destroy lives.  It's the smallest minority of the overall agency, but it's responsible for more destruction than you can imagine.

       It sounds like you, being in the helping profession, already know how important it is to evaluate suspected mental illness to discern a clinical diagnosis.  Clearly, we can't do that on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you're posting here, then you probably realize that true psychiatric illness is the most common -- but not only -- cause for such claims.  I believe there are many people who've been diagnosed with schizophrenia, paranoia, and many other conditions that manifest down to the letter of the DSM4/5, but with a spiritual root cause rather than physical.
      </p>
      <p>
       One condition misdiagnosed for decades was MPD / DID.  The medical community is finally starting to realize that this illness in particular
       <em>
        almost always
       </em>
       is a result of repetitive, extreme trauma, usually in childhood.  Many, including myself (not in that profession, but I take an interest in this topic) believe these are intentionally-created cases.  And one of many responsible parties has its home base at Langley.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be that as it may, the OP needs help one way or the other.  By the by, my post wasn't in contradiction to you in any way -- I suspect you share similar ideas.  I have a broader audience in mind.

       Also, forgot to mention this:
      </p>
      <p>
       I have this friend who is very much mentally healthy, and by no means would anyone accuse him of being a conspiracy theorist.  I've known the man since we were kids, and have never seen any indication of paranoia.  But he confided in me a similar story to the OP -- that he started dating a girl who he later found out worked for the NSA.  He claims that when he broke up with her, she went bat-s**t insane, and that for years afterwards, he felt targeted.
      </p>
      <p>
       His emails would be completely removed from his Gmail.  He'd be on the phone with someone and a third party would then say something and the line would drop.  He'd be walking down the street, and suddenly three or four guys would start following him literally everywhere for hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found it hard to believe, and when he first told me, I informed him that the NSA didn't have the purview to conduct unwarranted operations on a US citizen, and they certainly didn't have it
       <em>
        anywhere
       </em>
       in the organization to stalk / harass anyone.  At the time, I was working in the intel world and still hadn't realized all the deep stuff that was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he doesn't share it with anyone, he doesn't make crazy claims, and I've come to believe him.  I've also read of similar accounts from various people across the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, perhaps what OP is saying could have an element of truth, even if there's a concomitant mental issue at play.  What if many of these crazy-sounding claims could be taken at face value?

       No. Those people had their chance at life, and used it to bring additional pain and suffering to the world. I used a good portion of mine to bring in an unpaid non profit to help the homeless get out of their jams, how little it may of helped, but I tried. I also operated a business these monstrous cia nsa fucks destroyed, and my business was small, but honest, no fraud or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       They took their time, and used their fancy tech to destroy these things, drug me, perform psycological war on lil-ol' me, and do various other bad things. These are the nsa and cia.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, they had their time, and all arrests will do is allow them to continue waste our planet's resources. They must be expunged from existence, and not allowed further time to use our resources, or allowed the possibility to continue to bring pain to our species.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are fortunate enough to see such efforts taken place, there must be consideration taken so that innocent people are not hurt (anyone outside of these two organizations).

       I'm not sure what all triggered it, but I think it was because the cia / Obama Administration helped armed ISIS via the Iraqi Army base that weeks before was a US Army base, or so it's been told to me by kind informants.

       It just seems odd that out of all the things CIA is (probably) doing they would take the time to come after you. I suspect there is more to this story than you are letting on, but that's cool man, up to you.

       Think what you will, enough time on this post, my energy is better spent on others. Know that the new Nazi SS do act in strange ways.

       Let's just hope that a few bunker busters land on the cia and nsa HQ followed by enough firepower to turn their concrete and bones into magma, destroying all of their dna so that they couldn't even be cloned for any weird reason.

       A patriotic act like that would make a huge improvement for the country, and the world will breath a sigh of relief as the evil is removed from our planet.

       Just a real quicky that you'll probably only read:
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason why I'm so casual about my rhetoric is that I've met these people, face to face, man to man, man to woman. When they aren't hiding behind their computers and fancy tools, or cars, they're cowards through and through, just as we'd expect them to be. Sure, they probably have a few badasses, but when you see the tiny pinpricks their pupils turn to when they think they might be living in their last moments and they come to realize the evil that they are, and represent, they are complete disgusting cowards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, they can kill me at any time, hell maybe they can from space now, who knows, and I'm okay with this. I'm ready to die, and it's so freeing, but all I really want is my mother fucking passport and for my dog and I to begin a new life on another continent.

       I suspect there's far more you're not sharing here, and that it's far darker than your portrayal.  If so, and if you're actually referring to programming, I know some resources that can help you break free of that.  I personally know people who've suffered this, but they've found healing.

       Yes, they programmed me with click programming, and still try. They use magnetic devices and either have the house coiled or use the planet's magnosphere thingy (that's pretty far out there though, but who knows).

       I've seen demonstrations of similar technology. With advanced imaging and motion capture it's possible to parabolically direct stimulated emissions of audio and other sensory phenomena straight to your head, through walls, with very portable equipment.

       Kill them with kindness... Mercy is always the worst punishment for anyone, so let them rot in a prison cell somewhere. They'll know that after we took back our power, we were still the better people to not use it for violence in the name of "justice". Doing that would make us no better than they were.

       No, let us forget that lie, and let others, those with nothing left to lose, do what probably shlld have been done years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       We let it all go on too long, we let our nation turn into the New United States, turn into yet another Nazi Germany, but it's one of the digital age, with some 1984 added to the mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm so sorry everyone, I was one of the people, just like many of you who turned my head when I saw, or read about the horrible things these monsters would do, but there is still a sliver of a chance that we can turn it around, but we'll need those who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of the world, to make that change happen.

       I agree, but this really is nothing new. Fuck the NSA big time, but the CIA has always been a spy agency. I am not all too surprised to learn that they posses modern day spy tools.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are targeting everyday citizens, than this is a big problem. But if they are spying on enemies using these tools, its no different than the things they have always had. Its just a lot easier for them now..

       To everyone else: There are various ways to spot these accounts, this one here, do you see his commenting pattern? Skipping every few days'ish? It's a botted and purchased account, often used by nsa / cia scumbags, or marketing teams.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this isn't always the case, but it's pretty common. There are a few other patterns as well. Keep an eye out for the enemy of We the People, and call them out.

       Eh, planning things on reddit is not going to work. I don't know what would.

       It would take.. like those guys in the concentration camps who escaped, they made a movie about it with a badass jumping over a fence on a bike, that kind of careful planning to subvert and destroy these new Nazi SS guys.

       I can't put all of that together, so I just have to leave the US. It sucks, but that's where I am at, but I wish you guys the best trying to turn America away from evil.

       No, it's pretty much impossible to stop these new Nazis at this point.

       The best we can hope for, that I hope for, is that Mattis performs a coup with the Marines, and maybe another arm of the military joins, like the Navy or Air Force, and we take back our nation.

       Most of the employees are unaware of the agenda and what their work achieves. It's all compartmentalized.  And for most of them, it's a family thing. However, it's blatantly obvious to everyone how evil the CIA is and has been for some time, so there is no excuse of innocence.

       This is a bit a philisophical debate I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in the camp of wishing that all of them, all of those who comprise these horrible things are expelled from the planet. They knew, they may have not liked it, but they have known at least a little that they were and are a part of the new Nazi SS.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had time to leave, have time to leave, now!
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they are like me and cannot leave. Hell, I'm trying to leave the New United States but they keep blocking my passport, and if it doesn't get here quickly, it's going to end badly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe none of them, and many of us, are allowed to escape the New United States now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone else here actually tried to get their passports in the last few months? Is it possible? Are the rest of you a prisoner here like me? If so, maybe it's time for the prisoners to do what must be done to set things right again.

       OK, so if you check out my post history, you'll see I'm not a shill or disinfo agent.  But I do need to point out that the average employee -- both federal and contractor -- at the CIA and NSA is no different than you and I.  I know some of them actively post here in good faith, and you'd never know they worked for the IC.  Tens of thousands of employees across several agencies, and most of them are good, honest, decent people.  Let me give you some inside perspective:
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent several years as a federal civilian working for a joint IC / military-intel organization.  I routinely collaborated with agencies you know of -- CIA, NSA, NGA, DIA -- and those you don't.  There were regular conferences at various organizations, at which I met and maintained contact with many people across the entire swath of the IC.  And in all my years, I never personally encountered a single instance of an intentional violation of constitutional rights or court opinions related to privacy.  Clearly, we all know it does happen.  But you have to remember that the average analyst is following the law and his / her conscience as an American citizen while working a difficult job to provide for his / her family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every program and project is very compartmentalized.  The Manhattan Project employed over 129,000 people, but just a few dozen had the information on the whole scope of the project.  Think about it: only .018% of those involved understood the whole story.  A vast majority of people working it, including many who were fully cleared to the highest levels of classification -- research scientists, maintenance crews, construction workers, shipping and transportation, mining, parts and assembly -- knew only as much as was required to do their job.  And how much more time have we had to perfect the art of compartmentalization?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know we have cause for concern, and we should be very angry.  Our rights have indeed be violated over and over again.  But trust me when I tell you that most people working for these agencies have no clue how their work serves the bigger picture, and most are subject to the same cognitive bias as everyone else, which means that most of them will see the evidence and continue to deny it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, it brings up an issue of larger concern.  Whoever leaked this information still only has access to a very small part.  I cannot confirm nor deny the veracity of the recent leaks, but I can tell you with certainty that they are but a
       <em>
        fraction
       </em>
       of the truth.

       Eh, I've spent enough time on this post, my energy is best used on other ones. All I can do is fan the flames with what few abilities I have left, and juuuuuuuuust maybe it might make the smallest of differences to improve America before either I die, or leave the New United States forever.

       I've given plenty of warning. Do not fuck with me, those who are reading this (not necessarily you who I'm replying to :) ). I have nothing to lose, and the other things are in place as I've been cautious and clever. Let me leave the US with my dog and live a whole new life (thanks you fucking assholes), or shit gets messy.

       I might be, or it might not be. I'm not too sure what triggered all of this, but what is clear is that they attacked me, attempted to murder me, multiple times, stalk me, and bug my house, and hack my stuff.

       They're pricks.

       I just want out of the country at this point, and if they prevent me, well, do you/they honestly believe that I'm going to allow this to continue?

       Also I didn't know about the DIA or NGA. Like I've suggested, I always kind of stayed away from that stuff, or didn't even try. It wasn't my business, no need to get involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I'm full of so much fire is that they ruined my life, tried to murder me, tried to make me into a terrorist, tried to kill my dog even, the fuckers.
      </p>
      <p>
       They still have people stalk me, I don't really get why though. God damn this is so stupid, and if I don't get that mother fucking passport quickly, they cannot stop, and they know this, it's a work of art, sometimes caution can pay dividends.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... but hopefully I just get my passport and am able to leave to another nation with my dog, in peace.

      <p>
       Also, a good shill would be sure to change the narrative by introducing an unrelated, emotionally-charged topic in the context of the reply such that it sounds natural.  If you notice, my point was to remind people that the general, run-of-the-mill IC analyst is no different than anyone else, with no nefarious intent.

       The idea behind Fordism is that if you taught you worker how to build the entire car, they'd just leave your company and do it for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of teaching people to build entire cars, you teach them individually to build wheels, mirrors, seatbelts etc. so each person has a job they do, but they all contribute to the bigger task at hand without understanding the finished product.

       Just because they are too short-sighted to understand what is going on doesn't cleanse them of wrongdoing. Anyone can play stupid.

       Ah, I see your point about Fordism -- thanks for the clarification.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I believe there's a major distinction here in that in practice, the guy making steering wheels in the assembly line knows everything there is to know about steering wheels, including how it fits into the steering column, what components attach to them, and where it goes in the car.  He also knows its overall intended function within the context of the completed end product, and very likely quite a bit about many of the other individual components.  He may or may not know much about the specific details about other parts, or how the car actually functions on the mechanical level, but he gets the overall picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the intel community, the corresponding analogy would be of that same guy who knows everything there is to know about steering wheels, but his abstract contextual knowledge is limited to the fact that someone will eventually place their hands on it.  He doesn't know where the wheels go in a completed product, what its intended function will actually be, how its going to be specifically used, to what and where it will be attached, or exactly why he was asked to make steering wheels in the first place.  He is literally in a silo with respect to every aspect of his work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it IS difficult to draw that analogy in the case of the IC because truth be told, there are a lot of smart people there who do collaborate and interact with each other.  But the concept holds that the individual analyst really doesn't know who's reading his assessments, how his products will be used, what decisions are being made by whom based on his work, etc, etc.

       Perhaps because I've worked alongside many of them, and have been able to discern their humanity and general desire to do actual good, but I simply find your assessment far too broad and overly-critical.  The enemy is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       the guy working day to day in a cramped cubicle in a dark, windowless room so that he can feed his family.  The enemies are those who have hunger for power and control, complete disregard for the common good and constitutional freedoms, authority to guide intelligence directives, authority to make intelligence-based decisions, and a full grasp of the whole picture.

       I watched Jason Bourne last night, and a major part of the plot centers around the CIA trying to infiltrate a Facebook-esque social media platform to spy on everyone, all the time. Suffice the say, the CIA was not portrayed in a positive light in the film.

       im not even being facetious here, he worries me very much
      </p>
      <p>
       i work with people with paranoid schizophrenia and his writings read a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       like other writings ive seen from clients
      </p>
      <p>
       im being completely serious here. He sounds increasing delusional and paranoid and dangerous
      </p>
      <p>
       unless he's just a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       accomplished troll who is taking on the character of a stereotypical "crazy" conspiracy theorist...

       Eh, planning things on reddit is not going to work. I don't know what would.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would take.. like those guys in the concentration camps who escaped, they made a movie about it with a badass jumping over a fence on a bike, that kind of careful planning to subvert and destroy these new Nazi SS guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't put all of that together, so I just have to leave the US. It sucks, but that's where I am at, but I wish you guys the best trying to turn America away from evil.

       I'm not a huge fan of the way he handles certain things but baselessly attacking anyone who has hope he may still be a decent president is ridiculous.
