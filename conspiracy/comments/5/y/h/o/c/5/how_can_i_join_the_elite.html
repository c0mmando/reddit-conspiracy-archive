    <div class="md"><p>It was long ago... I had done a little inadvertent footwork for an ex-military guy that ran a newspaper... nothing too incredibly naughty... but certainly very sketchy in hindsight. After a year or so I got invited to a party... I think it was for a Summer Solstice... he said it was a costume party... but I didn&#39;t get dressed up for it... I just went... everyone there was either dressed up as military, or witches... not cartoon witches with brooms and green faces... just long flowing robes and other &quot;occult&quot; influences... I think a few of them said they were dressed as &quot;Pagans&quot;... there were no cowboys or super mario brothers... just normies like me, military and witches. Seemed to be an even 1/3 split between the 3 &quot;costumes&quot;. Lots of free booze and drugs going around... a ton of food all of it vegetarian aside from an entire roasted deer on display.... never seen someone roast a whole fuckin&#39; deer with the head still on it, usually people around here butcher it up into steaks. </p>

<p>Anyways... there was a big bonfire outside... and they were all waiting for some specific time to hit for something to happen... I dunno what time it was, but it was late at night and the focus of the whole evening... they asked me to come up by the bonfire to this podium and passed around a metal stein full of something... looked/smelled like beer, but the front row all took turns handing it around to spit in it then they put spider webs in it... I dunno if it was just cause this was fuckin&#39; gross or cause they always do this specific thing... it seemed kinda improvised. People were playing instruments and I was supposed to chug this whole in front of them... I refused and walked away from the podium... a few other people were called up and they all chugged the drinks they were given... they didn&#39;t try to push the issue aside from the music and the crowd chanting my name... and being put on the spot in front of a lot of people. I&#39;m not the kind of person to cave to peer pressure... so I chillaxed until everyone else was done their chugging... only 3 other people. I went back inside and ignored what was happening as whatever time approached... but it was certainly a lot of action around the campfire... chanting and dancing and music around the fire. </p>

<p>The chocolate cheesecake was excellent though... at the time I just thought they were plain old weirdos... but in hindsight I think this was a lot less innocent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting story.  Here&#39;s mine:  I once dated an ex investment banker, from a mafia family, who &quot;retired&quot; young.  He asked me to do something sketchy.  Can&#39;t remember the details, but involved delivering a sum of money in an envelope.  By itself I guess it would have been OK, but the context (which I now forget) could easily have gotten me arrested if there was any kind of misunderstanding.  I politely declined.  I can&#39;t remember how much longer the relationship lasted, but the whole thing lasted about a year.</p>

<p>No regrets...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally believe your story. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s mine:
I was walking home after dropping my daughter off at school. 
It&#39;s probably 9:15am and I ran into a group of girls who all looked underage (maybe 12) ... and very out of place as everyone should be at school and I know all the kids in the area so they were out of place.</p>

<p>For whatever reason one of the girls stepped out of the group to say hello. I responded with hello and kept walking the girl then tried to engage in a conversation &quot;where you going?&quot; I pointed straight ahead and kept walking.</p>

<p>Bill Gates? Exported millions of jobs to India and imported lots of H1-B cheap labor.  OMG if he were Jewish he&#39;d be gassed.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs? All iPhones are made in China.  If he were Jewish, he&#39;d be evil.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton?  Got paid by the Chinese to allow their currency manipulation to devastate US manufacturing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, if you&#39;re not part by birth of some bloodline, not much chance to get really high up the ladder.</p>

<p>You could join the military, become trustful and ruthless, help cover up the higher-ups mistakes and obey blindly, maybe you&#39;ll get some nice big fruit salad on your lapel and the perks that come with that, become privy to some big secrets and take part in the big, global plays.</p>

<p>Become a master financer, start elbowing with the fat cats, but beware, since you&#39;re not a true blue blood, you might end up paying for others&#39; mistakes, being helped to take a dive from your corner office window.</p>

<p>Join the media, parrot the lies from upstairs, execute the character assassinations via your professional teleprompter reading or timely late show comic satire; you might get invited to Bohemian Grove, get to help Kissinger pee.</p>

<p>Or, if you have the bent, get into the entertainment biz, start grooming the little stars, become a procurer for the lawmakers and politicians and heads of journalism, bury the bodies and pay the gag orders, train the kittens and the MKs, you might end up invited to lavish parties at luxurious castles and even the recipient of some Empire medal.</p>

<p>Or, should you be a really gifted individual, a true genius in some technical field, corporate life will help. Develop an advanced enough patent, find clever ways to make surveillance and remote wars simpler, cheaper and desirable, and you might get into the inner sanctums, NDA kingdom, write your own salary and enjoy your kinks in some protected arcology. Just don&#39;t ever develop a conscience and begin leaking info, that&#39;s a big no-no. </p>

<p>PM some of the celebrities and hook them up with some new pedophile satanic ritual abuse snuff footage, or some tasty human foreskins.

<p>Honestly, try to get up with one of the rappers (Snoop Dogg is a key player on here). They got in without the bloodline, and may help hook you up.</p>

<p>While we sadly tag the term &quot;elite&quot; to the people you aspire to be, the truth is a tapeworm has more business living on this planet. Never was a more loathsome, vile breed of animal ever walking earth as the creature that crawls around in the shadows, pulling the strings of society and profiting off of death. Your species (because you&#39;ve chosen them) couldn&#39;t win my envy with all the promises they&#39;ve ever promised to some sucker like yourself throughout the millennia they&#39;ve existed. I&#39;d live in a ditch and eat rats before i asked to trade places with one of that ilk. But the clean up is coming. Creatures like this can&#39;t live in a reality where judgement happens because the terror would eat them alive. Unfortunately for them, the matrix they so carefully constructed around society has swallowed them too.. and they&#39;ve forgotten that it&#39;s fake news. </p>

<p>&quot;Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.&quot; - Isa 14:9</p>
