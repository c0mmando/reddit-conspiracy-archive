       I think some really damning shit that we were funding ISIS (wait that's already public), the CIA was behind the false flag terrorists running over Europeans?? Clinton was selling access to classified info ( oh no wait that's public right?) things are so crazy I don't know what else we need to prosecute people.
       <br/>
       I would love to see some clear evidence of corruption between CIA, Wall St, and Dept. of State. Throw the pentagon in there too.
       <br/>
       How about evidence that all the gold is gone?

       I think Musk is a government agent/puppet. We have guys ranging from Lockheed employees to fighter pilots telling us we have anti gravity craft and the ability to go to the stars...yet here Musk is showing us how he can land a fucking rocket on a barge. And speaking of anti gravity craft, I think it is clear as well that we have alternate energy sources and probably have been working on these things dating back to Nikola Tesla. And now here Musk is, branding Tesla and charging us $100k for this half century old tech. We know we have DUMBs and plans for underground continental travel and again here is Musk to tell us he is going to work on developing things that we have. Musk is a salesman, here to usher in decades old government tech for profit. Do you really think tptb are going to let us transition away from coal and oil without making sure we pay them for free energy? It's all so calculated

       He could very well be genuine, a useful 'idoit' of sorts...but at the same time he's aligned himself with entities who have suppressed tech for decades. So to me there is an obvious disconnect somewhere in that relationship

       There's something off about Musk. I don't know what and don't have proof, but I've got a gut feeling that the man himself is a front.

       That's the official narrative, anyways.

       Personally, though, I've never seen a spherical bird that moves in the way that object did, so I'm not buying it.

       I mean its not like they were filming a couple miles away and it was simply much closer to the camera than we think . . . watch the whole video. Either there are a bunch of UFOs, or maybe it is the physics of of a camera and bugs and birds. Occam's razor

       Occam's Razor, confirmation bias, and memory confabulation are the default answers people use to shut down any conversation that goes outside of the narrative.

       sorry, but the narrative has been that they have damning info on the evil elite that are destroying the country to put them away for good. Imo if that were true they would release it asap and not pussy foot around and let them continue with the horrible shit they have been doing. We want justice dammit

       dude, did you watch the whole video of that explosion? So everything that flies by super fast isn't a UFO, except for the one that happens to fly by (looks like wings moving to me) right when it explodes is the UFO? I mean I didn't just say Occam's Razor, but go ahead and ignore everything else I said because you found one point to attack me on. I mean you basically just did the opposite because what I said didn't fit your narrative so . . .

       Glomar explorer type. Highly publisized Philanthropist billionair funds outrageous project to mine deep sea minerals! Turns out it was all a front for a millitary opperation... I could see musk being the same sorta frontman thing to advance solar energy, and electric vehichles among other state desired projects that cant be OPENLY funded by our government.

       I think its more likely that Musk was simply innovating on the rocket technology of the 60's working with the information he had. In a way Musk forced the hand of the deep state by getting them to admit they were overpaying ULA and Boeing for shit technology.

       Well the remaining 99% could be just as surprising as the current release, which is to say, not at all.  Alternatively, the remaining 99% could be exponentially more eye opening and I would love to know the location of the star gates.

       On one hand I'm afraid it'll be more stuff everyone already knew (besides CIA losing control of some of their arsenal).
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand... Assassinations used in conjuction with cyber warfare (Operation Olympic Games, multiple Iranian nuclear scientists assassinated leading up to the natanz incident). Maybe some false flag stuff, both electronic and physical. Maybe some stuff dealing with NitroZeus but that's more of an NSA thing AFAIK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe some stuff about hacking Congress and other related things. Possibly blackmail on politicians but I doubt that stuff like that would be in this release.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably also a lot of source files and other files that can take up a lot of data, so maybe pictures, charts, etc.

       You want the truth but you can't handle truth! There is a reason they call these things leaks and not pours.  Probably has something to do with most adults having the attention span of a toddler.  Look at all this sauce and you are already clambering for more not even 48 hours after release and before this information has been fully processed.  Connections are still being made over the podesta leaks so many months ago with more to come for sure.  A drop on the scope op talked of would be info overload and utter chaos.  These drips allow for discussion on how this information fits in with events  and what should take place in response.

       well i mean none of the shit released so far surprises me, so yeah I want more. I am pretty sure I can handle the truth. And they call them leaks because they aren't supposed to be there, like a leak in a pipe. . . This isn't sauce to me. It is a big fucking duh. Just like the NSA leaks. Real sauce would be shit that will put the deep state in prison for good. I honestly don't see that happening. Because if they did have that type of info, there would be no need to put this out there because the CIA would be dissolved immediately if they had been doing human trafficking and protecting pedos in the government, or if they did 9/11, or if they had secret tech they were keeping from the public that would transform humanity and destroy the elites power.
