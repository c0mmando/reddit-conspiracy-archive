        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">469</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-03-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/andywarhaul.html">andywarhaul</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit: Remember that there were hacks and there were leaks. The DNC hack is not how Podestas emails got out. Just because there was a hack doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s the source of the leak. In fact Wikileaks has said the exact opposite. </p>

<p>Today Wikileaks has released various CIA files pertaining to their cyber intelligence operations, but I think it&#39;s safe to call the content of these files weapons of cyber warfare. </p>

<p>A couple weeks ago I wrote this review of the official and private sector reports on Russia being behind the hacking of the DNC and Hillary Clinton and her associates </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5up4ax/analysis_of_the_russian_hacking_accusations_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5up4ax/analysis_of_the_russian_hacking_accusations_and/</a></p>

<p>The core of my conclusions was that we were being given an equation of a type of math we didn&#39;t understand, and the reports were claiming to have the answer to the equation without showing their work (how they got that answer). They didn&#39;t provide the evidence to support their claims. The original post has much more detail on this. </p>

<p>This quote from my original post </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything seems to boil down to originating domains and servers being in Russia. Isn&#39;t step one of Cyber espionage figuring out how to make it look like you&#39;re someone and somewhere you&#39;re not? ThreatConnect says things like &quot;Please note, the presence of these domains on the same name server as DCLeaks and servicetransfermail[.]com does not concretely indicate a tie to Russian activity. However, as repeated use of smaller name servers is a Russian TTP, these domains merit additional scrutiny.&quot; They also say that they traced back Guccifer 2.0 to a russian VPN service. but couldn&#39;t anyone buy a Russian VPN and wouldn&#39;t someone trying to not appear like they a Russian avoid using a Russian VPN? just questions I have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My main issue with their claims was that they were pointing to indicators that to me were the first things you would mask as an attacker. In today&#39;s Wikileaks release (part 1 of Vault 7) mine and many other people&#39;s suspicions were confirmed. The CIA does indeed take extensive measure to mask their attacks by copying the attributes and digital &quot;finger prints&quot; of other nations, including Russia. </p>

<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/wikileaks/status/839117937042735104/photo/1">https://mobile.twitter.com/wikileaks/status/839117937042735104/photo/1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_2621753.html">https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_2621753.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CIA&#39;s Remote Devices Branch&#39;s UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques &#39;stolen&#39; from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the &quot;fingerprints&quot; of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words all the &quot;evidence&quot; provided by the private sector and government reports falls under the scope of the UMBRAGE program meaning the &quot;evidence&quot; is no longer even slightly indicative of who the attackers are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many people in this subreddit have been saying, since day 1, that the Russian hacking story was complete bullshit. We could tell its bullshit since we were not provided with 1 piece of credible evidence. Its crazy to me how so many people in the U.S. just are blindly accepting the &quot;fact&quot; that Russia is behind the DNC leaks. Hopefully, the majority of people will actually be skeptical of that narrative now, and the truth will finally come out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am still being called a shill as of this week. Most people weren&#39;t afraid to call it b.s. last summer, but now the lie has been told so long and there have been small coincidences and admissions that people misconstrue as evidence, now they are believing it.</p>

<p>It hasalways been the establishments goal to make a big enemy out of Russia again. Since Trump came along they made tying them together part of it since that was convenient, but even without Trump they would be trying to sell evil Russia. I don&#39;t like Russia, but I don&#39;t hate them. They know war with them is inevitable to do what they want (end Assads regime and move on to Iran) so they figure better if a large part of the country hates Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They suspect Guccifer 2.0 or other hackers for the DNC voicemails and other things I believe. I think it might have been Rich (regarding at least the DNC stuff).</p>

<p>No one seems to really care. All focus is on damage control. I don&#39;t know why Dems in particular prefer to sweep it under the rug and try to maintain scraps of credibility rather than trying to fix their party.</p>

<p>The denial is mind blowing. There should be books written on it and the current media (by people smarter and more articulate in that language of sociology than me).</p>

You have to be a first class retard to not see that there&#39;s no way in hell any nation-sponsored hack would leave the sort of clues they found behind...

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the CIA is behind the attack.  I think the CIA was backing Hillary Clinton though.</p>

<p>A DNC insider released the emails, and to distract from the damning content within, the CIA used it&#39;s tools to stage an infiltration of their servers by Russian hackers, purposefully leaving behind stolen Russian State malware and editing time stamps and IP data to back up this claim.</p>

<p>There never was a &quot;hack&quot;.  All the evidence pointing to a hack was planted by the CIA under collusion with the Clintons, who are <em>known</em> associates in illegal CIA programs up to and including drug running and murder.</p>

Two seperate instances, I imagine the DNC hack wasn&#39;t even a real hack but the CIA planting markers.

<p>I think the real story is that these were both leaks made by patriots and decent human beings within the intelligence community since it is obvious they have complete impunity to get into any type of electronic device or service they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s quite the heavy amount of straw man arguments there. </p>

<p>The leaks and the hacks do not come together at all. The CIA proper did not want the information out. People inside the CIA may have disagreed with that but it also could have been someone inside the DNC who decided the info needed to get out. </p>

<p>The CIA &quot;does their job&quot; and gets any and all info they can get their hands on. This includes the DNC servers. The files were never intended to be released to the public. However the information leaked. Where from? The leaks could have come from someone in the DNC itself who had access to the info or someone in side the CIA who had access to the files the CIA stole, whistleblowers. I personally don&#39;t believe the CIA was behind the information getting out, I do believe that they are a likely culprit for the different hacks, and it&#39;s possible the leaks are from a CIA whistleblower. The information getting out was a wrench in the gears so how do you remedy it? You make it appear as though the information came from an outside influence with nefarious intentions in an attempt to discredit. Where in the hell did I say this was to bring Trump down? You&#39;re really pushing it with these straw mans. The bottom line is we have the beginning of the truth here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand what a straw man argument is. </p>

<p>The leaks and hacks do indeed come together and if you need proof of that all you need to do is take a look at the Wikileaks Twitter feed for the last 6 months. If you can&#39;t see that then I am afraid your bias might be so strong your incapable of seeing your blind spots. </p>

<p>Do you have any sources to support any of your claims in that last paragraph of gish gallop? I mean its a nice little theory but there is nothing to substantiate any of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly proxy wars like we have been in almost the entirety of the Cold War. Now the Syrian Civil War. I should say they may want to go to war with Russia, but take that skeptically. Some have suggested that we&#39;re in a second Cold War. We&#39;re pretty involved in Syria (excluding ISIS since they didn&#39;t escalate before 2014) with the rebels while Russia backs Assad. Some suggested we are trying to box in Russia because of some oil pipeline, but I don&#39;t know the exact details. </p>

<p>Aside from that, we know how well it goes when we back rebel groups like the Mujahideen in majority Islamic countries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two trajectories that are coming together. The first is the Neo-Conservative millieu coming out of PNAC.  They want another Cold War because ideologically they view that as the most prosperous time in the country. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXpIfZqg8zA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXpIfZqg8zA</a></p>

<p>The second trajectory is deep geo-political thinking about Central Asia, and what it will mean for American power when Europe, Central Asia and East Asia cement their networks of pipelines, roads, information infrastructure and currency.  One way to prohibit this from emerging is by driving a wedge, and Russia isolation seems like a realistic strategy for these folks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hacking Russian narrative was always bullshit, doesn&#39;t explain the incredible amount of secret ties Trump and his administration have though. And to the people saying they did nothing wrong, answer me this. Why did Flynn and Sessions lie multiple times if there was nothing wrong? Why did Flynn commit a felony by lying to the FBI if there was nothing wrong? Why did Flynn resign if there was nothing wrong?</p>

<p>And these are just the people who&#39;ve been exposed, imagine all the shit that we (the public) don&#39;t know when it comes to conflics of interest. Yes Hillary and Obama hid sketchy shit constantly, but that doesn&#39;t mean Trump and his administration should as well. We have the most transparent/corrupt administration since Nixon, and you guys are defending them on a conspiracy subreddit. </p>

<p>We should be skeptical of every aspect in our government, just because it isn&#39;t the Clintons doesn&#39;t mean we should give them a pass. The hacking narrative is obviously bullshit, but Trump and his administrations secret ties has barely even been scratched, and it&#39;s undeniable that they all have Russian connections that they tried to/continue keeping secret. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for a good relationship with Russia, but all these lies and secrets makes the whole thing look super sketchy. Combine that with the fact that Trump won&#39;t release his taxes and that Putin is literally a dictator and I see no reason to defend a 70 year old politician and his administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think it&#39;s strange though how much they&#39;re trying to hide and lie about it though? If it&#39;s nothing bad, why lie and resign? So far three of Trumps hires have resigned after being exposed, that&#39;s not sketchy? Flynn literally committed a felony by lying to the FBI and barely got away, and you think there&#39;s nothing sketchy going on?</p>

<p>What happened to conflicts of interest? I know Trump isn&#39;t Hillary but that doesn&#39;t mean we should give him a free pass. Also it doesn&#39;t help that Putin is literally a dictator who consistently murders people in his own country. And you guys are totally cool how him and Trump are BFF&#39;s? </p>

<p>Why are the people on a conspiracy subreddit completely fine with the fact that our government is consistently lying to us? I have the answer, and it&#39;s because people are emotionally tied down to a 70 year old politician and his cabinet because it&#39;s easy to be manipulated that way. </p>

<p>I believe here&#39;s where my disagreement comes from. If the evidence pointing to Russia&#39;s involvement isn&#39;t &quot;real&quot; (enough), then the evidence pointing to a leak from the CIA surely is even <em>less</em> &quot;real&quot;, no?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to get too deep into this argument, since I have other things to do, but when we combine the evidence we <em>do</em> have with Putin&#39;s and WL motives, I think it&#39;s much more likely that Russia is behind the leaks/hacks/whatever (either by source, or dissemination).</p>

<p>Even in a criminal case, for example, fingerprints are considered circumstantial evidence. Just because your prints are at a crime scene doesn&#39;t mean you committed the crime. But when those prints are found at the crime scene/weapon, you benefit from the crime, and you have motive/incentive to commit that crime, well the likelihood of guilt is much higher.</p>

<p>Putin/Russia had the means, motives and incentives. The &quot;fingerprints&quot; are IMO just a part of a larger body of evidence that points to their involvement.</p>

<p>Now you may not believe we&#39;ve reached that guilt threshold, but we&#39;ll have to agree to disagree about that.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ll repeat what I&#39;ve said before here: there is nothing to suggest that Russia did and there&#39;s to suggest they <em>didn&#39;t</em> do it. So from there what do we have to go on? You say motives. You say that Wikileaks and Russia had similar motives therefore must be from Russia. Wikileaks motives were to expose Hillary&#39;s deceptions and corruption. I&#39;ve seen it claimed that Russia&#39;s motives were to put Trump in the White House to &quot;weaken America&quot; but Hillary would have been  weakening America just as well except she would do so with an aggressive stance towards Russia on top of that, and her track record speaks to that.</p>

<p>In your opinion the Russian motives are the strong indicators that they did it. In my opinion the motives of good people within Americas institutions are the strong indicators that it was a leak. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how he always maintained that he never releases or reveals his sources:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/26/politics/julian-assange-dnc-email-leak-hack/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/26/politics/julian-assange-dnc-email-leak-hack/</a></p>

<p>Then his internet gets mysteriously cut, and suddenly, it was definitely not the Russians. I guess he never reveals his sources, except for this one time...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s that word: &quot;nothing&quot;. Is there <em>any</em> evidence you would accept? If so, please describe what it would be.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I claimed though. So why are you arguing that with me? Putin&#39;s motives are that Trump would ease sanctions on him. Putin&#39;s become a billionaire while in office, but can&#39;t take his fancy boats or buy mansions wherever he wants. Trump has said/shown time and time again that he is willing to go easy on Russia. It doesn&#39;t really matter if the US is &quot;weaker&quot; or not.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ok, but this ignores the actual evidence I posted above. Along with the complete lack of evidence pointing otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA clearly has the ability to &quot;spoof&quot; said &quot;fingerprints&quot;.  Russia almost undoubtedly does as well.  In fact, almost any computer savvy person could spoof similar fingerprints, and buy Russian malware through the darknet.  How in the world could you come to the conclusion that these so called fingerprints at the &quot;crime scene&quot; are legitimate?  </p>

<p>The CIA did not hack the DNC or Podestas emails.  An insider leaked them, however the CIA wanted Clinton to win.  Desperately.  So they went in <strong>after the fact</strong> and used these tools to create &quot;evidence&quot; of Russia being behind the hacks as a tool to not only discredit the information, but Wikileaks and by proxy Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. </p>

<p>Lets go with your comparison. </p>

<p>In your comprison, it is a break in. you ask around, and you see, okay, the computer was used to install russian malware, there was a russian truck parked outside the house, all my vodka is missing, Okh, and a lot of fingerprints. Loads of them. Wait a sec, they litterally touched everything. </p>

<p>Then, it comes to light that the Cartels have a fake russian evidence store, sell fake russian fingerprints for 5 $ / hand, and have a long history of making their shit look like they were the russians. </p>

<p>That is roughly the situation. </p>

<p>To drag it back to the reality, here is what happened: </p>

<p>&quot;OMG, the russians want to be superpowers too. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Too bad, because there can only be one. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... Isn&#39;t that a bit self serving? &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have better intelligence then we can show you. Trust us. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OMG, the wikileaks people have really been doing some revolutionary shit. America has been committing crimes of war. 
&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In totally unrelted news, remembver the vastly superior intelligence network? We just got a hint that Julien Assange has raped people, He is so guilty. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OMG, Hillary lost hard. ALL her intelligence was wrong. How the fuck could that have happened? &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Intelligence here. Her predictions were right, because.... we have the intelligence. Must have been a certain someone meddling with the vote. You know what we have found while looking for WMD&#39;s? Russian fingerprints all over the table. We can&#39;t precisely show you the evidence, but Russia has been most likely hacking you. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahem, ...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OMG, it&#39;s an other hack attack! &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know this stuff is really your metier, but lets talk about the 
quality of intelligence that you have been sharing. Weren&#39;t you the idiot who included fanfiction in a presidential briefing? &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;.... Look, this is all proof that the russians interferred with the election. I have it, here, but you can&#39;t see it, because the president is a russian puppet, thanks to my vast intelligence network, that I do not want to endanger. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;dude?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes? &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you have a desk drawer labelled with Fake russian evidence, and a book titled, how to make it look like the russians did it, in your desk? &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ZOMG, BREACH OF TRUST! YOU ARE A RUSSIAN AGENT!!!&quot;</p>

<p>We can discount this, since Russia was implicated as early as March 2015, loooong before Wikileaks released the emails.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/10/politics/state-department-hack-worst-ever/">http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/10/politics/state-department-hack-worst-ever/</a></p>

<p>Again, why? We can also say it could have been Mexico or Canada or Australia that carried out the cyberattacks. We could say that Clinton herself leaked the emails to Wikileaks. But the question would always be, Why? If you can&#39;t point to a reason, then all these wild speculative questions just seem like deflection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t claimed that they did, all I&#39;ve said is that there is no definitive evidence to suggest that anyone is responsible. In some comments I have given my opinion on what I think is going but I have clearly stated that it&#39;s opinion and I&#39;ve given material to support it.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In other words all the &quot;evidence&quot; provided by the private sector and government reports falls under the scope of the UMBRAGE program meaning the &quot;evidence&quot; is no longer even slightly indicative of who the attackers are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seemed to be the implication, here. Regardless, there&#39;s a bit more than &quot;fingerprint evidence&quot; alone that could implicate the Russians, but again, it&#39;s all still circumstantial. I personally still believe the Russians are behind it based on these posts (<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/07/russian_hack_of.html">1</a> and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/01/attributing_the_1.html">2</a>) from Bruce Schneier in addition to my own software development experience. The circumstantial evidence covered in the past is convincing enough to me, but the revelations about this alleged UMBRAGE group clearly raises more questions. From a motive and &quot;common sense&quot; perspective, though, it still makes the most sense that the Russian government was behind the DNC leaks.</p>

<p>Over the course of the day, I&#39;ve come up with three potential scenarios given the totality of the details thus far:</p>

<p>A. Somehow, the DNC knew about the occurrence of the leaks beforehand, and thus they were able to employ the CIA to plant a fake attack in their systems, such that they could cover up all of the logging systems so thoroughly as to trick a multitude of security groups.</p>

<p>B. The CIA conducted the attack clandestinely, after which one of two things happened: they either decided, for some reason, to release the leaks, thus leading to the substantial damage to Hillary&#39;s campaign, or an insider leaked the documents either out of professional dissatisfaction, ethical objection, or a combination thereof.</p>

<p>C. The Russian government was actually behind the leaks.</p>

<p>Anyway, I find scenario A to be the most unlikely, given that multiple private security groups were given full access to these systems. It&#39;s one thing to fake an attack, but it&#39;s another thing to fake an attack that took place in the past. On the other hand, if one were to claim that the DNC knew about the leaks far enough back in time to fake the attack without having to also alter all of the evidence pointing to the date of its occurrence, I would question how they came upon this information so far in advance of the actual leaks and how they were incapable of preventing the leak given so much time and their connections to the intelligence community.</p>

<p>Thus, I find scenarios B and C to be the far more likely candidates. If B were the case and an insider leaked the documents, I would wonder why they actually held onto the documents if their motivation was to frame the Russian government. Of course, this could be used as blackmail, and the deep state being what it is, they might find some use for such material in the future. On the other hand, they could have actually wanted to damage Hillary&#39;s campaign for unknown reasons. The CIA isn&#39;t known for its transparency or accountability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you mean that the CIA committed the attack prior to the leaks and then blamed the leaks on their previous attack only after the leaks took place? Well, to begin with, these attacks took place over a long period of time and the material presented thus far indicates that there were multiple intrusions over the course of this time. If the CIA wanted to stage a Russian attack, why would they pick the same style of intrusion that matches a long-term info-gathering campaign? This degree of foresight would indicate that they had prescient knowledge that the leaks were going to take place. There are plenty of ways of staging a Russian cyber attack that don&#39;t require a year-long commitment, and a longer operation period would pointlessly increase the risk of their false flag operation being discovered. That being said, that is another potential scenario that I will keep in mind.</p>

<p>On a side note, have any of the attack vectors specified in the WikiLeaks releases been matched with the methods described in the CrowdStrike report or other analysis on APT 28 and 29, such as <a href="https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/rpt-apt29-hammertoss.pdf">this report from FireEye</a>?</p>

The whole thing does really weaken the case against Russian hacking, but I&#39;m still not convinced it&#39;s total bullshit. There are too many other aspects like all the people who have resigned and refused themselves for lying about talking to Russians. </p>

<p>What I see in the UMBRAGE language is that they take in malware from external sources, and use pieces of that malware to create objective specific tools. Lots of room for interpretation there.

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that they did obtain the malware though. Would Russian intelligence services not try to hack key US politicians? </p>

<p>And like I said the only definitive point is that it&#39;s not clear who is responsible, there isn&#39;t evidence that definitively says Russia did it but there&#39;s also not evidence they <em>didn&#39;t</em> do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but there&#39;s nothing at all that points to that. Russia would also know if they were compromised and probably wouldn&#39;t be too happy if we were using their tools for a false flag. They&#39;d probably speak up if that were the case. </p>

<p>It seems to me that the accusations against Russia are far better supported than anything else, even Trump has said it was Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But even so, at this point, any evidence that is shown is going to be so easy to dismiss, whether its legit or not. Now that we know the CIA intentionally leaves behind &quot;fingerprints&quot; to make it look like someone else, any piece of evidence is suspect. Which is a shame, because if Trump really is doing something nefarious, it&#39;ll be that much harder to convince his supporters. </p>

<p>And nice try but it&#39;s the lies being spread that forced Wikileaks to not even give their source away but to say it wasn&#39;t a state party.</p>

<p>No sanctions have been lifted and the administration has said they won&#39;t be lifted until Crimea is returned.</p>

<p>Again you lack any evidence. If you actually read the first post I linked to which I told you to do already you would understand that. You&#39;re burying your head in the sand </p>

The government is fucked and I don&#39;t trust any politician because they lie to get into their positions. Trump wasn&#39;t trying to be a politician so at least he has that going for him.
