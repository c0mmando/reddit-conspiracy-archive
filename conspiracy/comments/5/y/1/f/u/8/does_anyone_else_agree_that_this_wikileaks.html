<p>It&#39;s definitive proof that the NSA isn&#39;t the only one looking at who&#39;s doing what.  It&#39;s definitive proof that the CIA is able to bypass ENCRYPTED CHAT TOOLS.  It&#39;s definitive proof that the CIA (and other actors) are able to LISTEN TO YOUR TV.  It&#39;s definitive proof that the CIA sees itself as something bigger and more powerful than the executive branch.  IT&#39;s definitive proof that the CIA does what it wants when it wants to whom it wants.</p>

<p>But I guess maybe that shit isn&#39;t important to you?</p>

<p>Seriously?</p>

<p>People aren&#39;t doing anything about it because most people are fighting too hard just to pay rent and buy food.  Most of them would likely sign away their freedoms entirely if it won them a steady job, home, and food.  People aren&#39;t brainwashed. They&#39;re desperate and impoverished.  Saying anyone that doesn&#39;t care as much as you is brainwashed just alienates people.</p>

<p>I was originally being facetious, but it&#39;s true.  So many people I know just don&#39;t care about anything more than finishing their shitty work day so they can get home and watch some good old TV.</p>

<p>You based a lot of judgment off of one simple line of text, and yet you tell me I&#39;m lacking empathy?</p>

<p>We ARE brainwashed.  All of us.  We&#39;re totally submissive to keeping our little corner of the world alive and working.</p>

<p>The problem is, we&#39;re routinely being used and exploited for others&#39; hedonistic gains.</p>

<p>And I never said that you said that.  Where are you making that up from?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was originally being facetious, but it&#39;s true. So many people I know just don&#39;t care about anything more than finishing their shitty work day so they can get home and watch some good old TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And? So what? You say that like it&#39;s necessarily a bad thing. Not everyone wants to fight a revolution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You based a lot of judgment off of one simple line of text, and yet you tell me I&#39;m lacking empathy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A single line of text can tell a lot, and it has nothing to do with having or lacking empathy. You&#39;re not spinning this around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We ARE brainwashed. All of us. We&#39;re totally submissive to keeping our little corner of the world alive and working.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not being aware and not caring are not the same thing. And not caring is not being brainwashed.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem is, we&#39;re routinely being used and exploited for others&#39; hedonistic gains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Just because that bothers you doesn&#39;t mean it bothers everyone else.  And the fact that they aren&#39;t bothered doesn&#39;t equate to them being brainwashed.  A person saying &quot;I have only one life to live, and I&#39;d rather not spend it on revolutionary causes&quot; is an entirely reasonable way of thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever man, I don&#39;t care what you think either way, but I&#39;m not looking to attract followers. If I was, I&#39;d use honey, not vinegar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re not looking to convince other people, then don&#39;t whine that they don&#39;t think like you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Also remember, this is just the initial Vault 7 release. There&#39;s more coming. This release is mainly laying the groundwork for subsequent leaks. Yesterday, if you told the average person that the CIA has tools to spy on you through your television, record your encrypted Iphone messages, drive your car off of an overpass, and leave fingerprints leading back to Putin, they&#39;d think you&#39;re insane. Today it all sounds plausible. </p>

They probably should&#39;ve already assumed this was happening, as most of us here already do, now they know it&#39;s happening, and you know what?  Nobody gives a fuck or will do anything to stop them.  This is about creating public apathy and therefore acceptance of this activity.  Yeah, they&#39;re probably owned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LoL at the demonizations of agencies who are doing what they are suppose to be doing, finding clever ways to get info and kill people, no different than the military or any other country in history. Get a medal if you can assassinate a hundred people and 5 civilians with a drone, get demonized and the world falls apart if you&#39;re a cia computer nerd competing with Russia and China to be the first ones to figure out how to hack a car when every other cyberwarfare equiped gov is doing the exact same thing.</p>

<p>This Wikileaks is designed to further break down American trust in government, the ultimate goal is Russia&#39;s unmolested territory expansion</p>
