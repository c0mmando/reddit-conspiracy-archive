       It's definitive proof that the NSA isn't the only one looking at who's doing what.  It's definitive proof that the CIA is able to bypass ENCRYPTED CHAT TOOLS.  It's definitive proof that the CIA (and other actors) are able to LISTEN TO YOUR TV.  It's definitive proof that the CIA sees itself as something bigger and more powerful than the executive branch.  IT's definitive proof that the CIA does what it wants when it wants to whom it wants.

       Not bypass encrypted chat tools, the tools work, it the hacked phones that are the problem. And the software isn't on every phone. Just that they have the capability to infect.

       Not just phones, but Windows machines, Apple machines, and the like.  It's bigger than just "hacked phones," because they can hack whatever device they want when they want.  The only barrier is a reason to do so.

       People aren't doing anything about it because most people are fighting too hard just to pay rent and buy food.  Most of them would likely sign away their freedoms entirely if it won them a steady job, home, and food.  People aren't brainwashed. They're desperate and impoverished.  Saying anyone that doesn't care as much as you is brainwashed just alienates people.

       I never said I was above brainwashing.  There are plenty of things that I willfully hide from.  There are plenty of things that are hidden from me (and the public at large).  I am just as much a zombie as anyone.  I have responsibilities that I put before other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was originally being facetious, but it's true.  So many people I know just don't care about anything more than finishing their shitty work day so they can get home and watch some good old TV.

       We ARE brainwashed.  All of us.  We're totally submissive to keeping our little corner of the world alive and working.

       The problem is, we're routinely being used and exploited for others' hedonistic gains.

      <p>
       A single line of text can tell a lot, and it has nothing to do with having or lacking empathy. You're not spinning this around.

      <p>
       Not being aware and not caring are not the same thing. And not caring is not being brainwashed.

      <p>
       So? Just because that bothers you doesn't mean it bothers everyone else.  And the fact that they aren't bothered doesn't equate to them being brainwashed.  A person saying "I have only one life to live, and I'd rather not spend it on revolutionary causes" is an entirely reasonable way of thinking.

       If you're not looking to convince other people, then don't whine that they don't think like you do.

       Agreed. Also remember, this is just the initial Vault 7 release. There's more coming. This release is mainly laying the groundwork for subsequent leaks. Yesterday, if you told the average person that the CIA has tools to spy on you through your television, record your encrypted Iphone messages, drive your car off of an overpass, and leave fingerprints leading back to Putin, they'd think you're insane. Today it all sounds plausible.

       This is definitely bigger than the shadowbroker leak. And also possibly bigger than the Snoden TAO leaks, technically. (not politically).

       wikileaks is sitting not only on the full CIA confluence knowledge base, but also on the full source code. And apparently this stuff had already made the rounds.

       The only thing this release does it make the general public aware of, and therefore more comfortable with, the fact that they can spy on us.   They probably should've already assumed this was happening, as most of us here already do, now they know it's happening, and you know what?  Nobody gives a fuck or will do anything to stop them.  This is about creating public apathy and therefore acceptance of this activity.  Yeah, they're probably owned.

       they have been doing... but what we know now is
       <em>
        how

       they are doing it... the ample amounts of documentation are gonna wreck a decade of CIA coding work overnight... all their work just got trashed... these exploits will be patched and the CIA will have to start all over again... Year Zero.

       LoL at the demonizations of agencies who are doing what they are suppose to be doing, finding clever ways to get info and kill people, no different than the military or any other country in history. Get a medal if you can assassinate a hundred people and 5 civilians with a drone, get demonized and the world falls apart if you're a cia computer nerd competing with Russia and China to be the first ones to figure out how to hack a car when every other cyberwarfare equiped gov is doing the exact same thing.
