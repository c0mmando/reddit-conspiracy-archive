       So let's get this straight:
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a partisan website operated by a rapist who works for the Russian state-sponsored "news" network.
      </p>
      <p>
       This website and man are shockingly never critical of Putin, Russian interests, or Russian assets(such as Donald Trump).
      </p>
      <p>
       This website and man are TERRIFIED of anything that might slow the progress of Putin, such as Clinton, McCain, the intelligence community, REAL conspiracy theorists, and those who don't politically align with fascism/authoritarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       This website tampers with the US election in a way clearly meant to favor a Russian asset(Trump), something which Bannon later confirms was done at the behest of the campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no actual evidence contained in anything this website has released.
      </p>
      <p>
       And none of this stinks to you guys? Just gonna eat it up hook, line, and sinker?
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay. I'll stay over here in the actual middle.
      </p>
      <p>
       (P.S. - Before the mods remove this post because it isn't in lockstep, is anyone aware of a conspiracy sub or forum which isn't compromised by TrumpTrolls and Russian shills?)

       Pretty much this all over.  I'm still hoping there's secret Illuminati mantle-deep maglevs for rushing their operatives around the globe.  That'd be great.  If infrastructure like that exists, it's only a matter of time before they realize they can make more money nixing this crime shit and going legit.

       Funny I had a similar theory that I chose not to post because I know it would be a waste of time. EVERYTHING that was in this "drop" I and others have known for YEARS. I guess it's new to others, at least they are actually discussing it now. But youre right it's not groundbreaking.

       It strikes me as odd that one of the big arguments is "No, see, Russia is good because America does the same stuff they do, which is bad!"

       Strange logic. I'm not here to defend the fucking CIA, but are we really going to vilify them with this nothingburger while gleefully ignoring the antics of an old KGB operative toying with elections around the globe? Can we not, I don't know, examine and vilify BOTH?

       As much shit as you talk clashlight, I'm kinda surprised that you are willing to go online knowing how easy it is to dox someone's personal info. You showed how easily it is to just create a fake account so you don't have to deal with negative karma from pissed of T_D subscribers. How easy it would be to create a throw away account to dox a (redacted) y/o living in (redacted) being paid (redacted) yet still trying to live and act like a boss despite how shitty your life really is.

       The CIA is definitely paying me to change the narrative by throwing cold water on a circlejerk on some subreddit, yes.

       Companies are paid by the CIA and the employees are paid by their company. I doubt there are solo contractors out there directly paid by the CIA for astroturfing.

       You don't seem competent enough to be a solo paid contractor. You probably would be some entry level prole at a government contracting  firm, if at all.

       I know it seems really funny to you. Imagine how the rest of us feel that you've decided to talk to us. Most "normies" come here because they think we are easy targets to bully. What it really comes down to is their low self esteem and desire to feel superior to something besides single cell organisms.

       Wikileaks has a perfect record. The leaks were interesting and confirm a lot of conspiracies. But its stupid to try and make this a whole CIA evil thing. Every top agency in the world uses these tactics. Are they supposed to just sit back while China and Russia are also leaving exploits in product software to control the masses? People cannot be stupid enough to actually think that the US is the only guilty party in this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like we had a bioterrorism cold war, a nuclear cold war, so to will we have a cyberwar. It's inevitable and trying to moralize the position of the CIA is beyond idiotic. They'd be stupid not to compete.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main question with these leaks is why release this now. The timing is super suspect. What are we being distracted from.

       That's why I said they were concerned; I don't think the EU is particularly troublesome to anyone but the EU right now. I won't discount them pulling a 180, but for the time being they're off the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Russia has proved and is proving that their psyops are extremely effective. Should they get hungry for Finland, I doubt it would start with a column of tanks. There'd be a false flag or two, some wikileaks stuff, and a massive amount of deflection and distraction smokescreening it. They'd probably try to destabilize them from within for a while first(maybe they already are?) too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think they'll try for that, at least not for some time - but I bet there are some plans drawn up somewhere. Their efficacy at playing most of the globe is, objectively, really impressive and may have even surprised them. Who knows where that will push them.

       I agree and perhaps I could have phrased it better. What is the first milestone that will indicate to you that you're really on the right path? Is there any particular thing that might turn you off the Trump=Russia path?
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly welcome any new evidence/leaks on Trump+Russia. The well has been dry, and for a lot of us, it looks pretty desperate. I'm looking at it through the same lens as any injustice that involves humans fucking over other humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that sources can't name 'unnamed' and all compiled with authors that display various levels of mental illness due to perceived injustices but not a whole lot of facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a whole lot of evidence for internal destabilization though.

       Weakening of western democracies or a trend in them toward isolationism/nationalism. That already seems to be underway, no? I think the smattering of dead Russian dignitaries is worth looking into, too. There's been a lot of smoke there for a long time - so while I'm not particularly taken by the recent flurry of media/political attention to it, I think there's blood in the water from SOMETHING.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I saw Trump do something that either directly or indirectly stymied Russian interests, I'd certainly take note. If wikileaks published something harmful to that side, I'd take note(but wouldn't believe it instantly any more than I believe this Vault7 stuff instantly). My point isn't "no, no, the CIA and pals are really good guys and it's the OTHER guys who are bad", it's "they're all bad and even if there may be a factional struggle happening, they're all still enemies of free people".

       It's a limited hangout. Assange would obviously never be allowed to feature in the media, if he were not totally controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, RussiaToday is indeed part of the mainstream media...
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for being willing to debunk the 'Assange is genuine opposition' narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your comments about Putin, the rabbit hole goes deeper. The original Putin was a resister, but he was
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/xyiID">
        killed and replaced in 2010.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks are leading us like cattle to the slaughterhouse. Ales Jones is a shill (as shown by his association with Trump) but at least he acknowledges the global genocide agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange would have you believe that the only purpose of the elite is to simply control elections and spy on people. Why would they even need to spy on us? It's not as if we pose any threat...

       There should be no bigger warning bell than when some person or group targets "the left" or "the right" as a whole yet never targets the other side. This is pure textbook control, and it kills me to see the conspiracy theorist community fall for it so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, Hillary and the CIA and friends are a real big problem up to no end of spooky stuff. But how in the world can anyone believe that, label themselves a 'truther', and then straight-faced defend people like Assange or Trump?

       I don't really see any distinction between 'truthers' and 'normal people'. Normal people follow the mainstream media and truthers follow the alternative media. Both controlled by the illuminati.

       Matt Marriott has over 100 articles, dating back to 1999. He covers all the usual topics, including a general overview of who the Illuminati actually are, and why they do what they do.

       Young-Kyoon, a user here and follower of his, has compiled an
       <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/illumipedia/introduction">

       The conspiracy movement is smaller than most are willing to admit. Video games are a niche hobby, yet the online gaming community is easily 100 times larger than the so-called truthers...

       Yes. Their best tool to achieve this is to stifle independent theories by saying 'this idea discredits the truth movement' and to give the impression that their are hundreds of shills commenting/voting in forums like this.

       It's just a natural aspect of human nature, we find safety in the crowd. It's the reason why the elitists force us into cities and group events, so that we can be trained to associate conformity with harmony.
