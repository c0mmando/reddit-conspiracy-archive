        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So let&#39;s get this straight:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a partisan website operated by a rapist who works for the Russian state-sponsored &quot;news&quot; network.</p>

<p>This website and man are shockingly never critical of Putin, Russian interests, or Russian assets(such as Donald Trump).</p>

<p>This website and man are TERRIFIED of anything that might slow the progress of Putin, such as Clinton, McCain, the intelligence community, REAL conspiracy theorists, and those who don&#39;t politically align with fascism/authoritarianism.</p>

<p>This website tampers with the US election in a way clearly meant to favor a Russian asset(Trump), something which Bannon later confirms was done at the behest of the campaign.</p>

<p>There is no actual evidence contained in anything this website has released.</p>

<p>And none of this stinks to you guys? Just gonna eat it up hook, line, and sinker? </p>

<p>Okay. I&#39;ll stay over here in the actual middle.</p>

<p>(P.S. - Before the mods remove this post because it isn&#39;t in lockstep, is anyone aware of a conspiracy sub or forum which isn&#39;t compromised by TrumpTrolls and Russian shills?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks has a perfect record. The leaks were interesting and confirm a lot of conspiracies. But its stupid to try and make this a whole CIA evil thing. Every top agency in the world uses these tactics. Are they supposed to just sit back while China and Russia are also leaving exploits in product software to control the masses? People cannot be stupid enough to actually think that the US is the only guilty party in this.</p>

<p>Just like we had a bioterrorism cold war, a nuclear cold war, so to will we have a cyberwar. It&#39;s inevitable and trying to moralize the position of the CIA is beyond idiotic. They&#39;d be stupid not to compete. </p>

<p>My main question with these leaks is why release this now. The timing is super suspect. What are we being distracted from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I said they were concerned; I don&#39;t think the EU is particularly troublesome to anyone but the EU right now. I won&#39;t discount them pulling a 180, but for the time being they&#39;re off the board.</p>

<p>I think Russia has proved and is proving that their psyops are extremely effective. Should they get hungry for Finland, I doubt it would start with a column of tanks. There&#39;d be a false flag or two, some wikileaks stuff, and a massive amount of deflection and distraction smokescreening it. They&#39;d probably try to destabilize them from within for a while first(maybe they already are?) too.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll try for that, at least not for some time - but I bet there are some plans drawn up somewhere. Their efficacy at playing most of the globe is, objectively, really impressive and may have even surprised them. Who knows where that will push them.</p>

<p>I agree and perhaps I could have phrased it better. What is the first milestone that will indicate to you that you&#39;re really on the right path? Is there any particular thing that might turn you off the Trump=Russia path? </p>

<p>I certainly welcome any new evidence/leaks on Trump+Russia. The well has been dry, and for a lot of us, it looks pretty desperate. I&#39;m looking at it through the same lens as any injustice that involves humans fucking over other humans. </p>

<p>This means that sources can&#39;t name &#39;unnamed&#39; and all compiled with authors that display various levels of mental illness due to perceived injustices but not a whole lot of facts. </p>

<p>There is a whole lot of evidence for internal destabilization though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weakening of western democracies or a trend in them toward isolationism/nationalism. That already seems to be underway, no? I think the smattering of dead Russian dignitaries is worth looking into, too.

<p>If I saw Trump do something that either directly or indirectly stymied Russian interests, I&#39;d certainly take note. If wikileaks published something harmful to that side, I&#39;d take note(but wouldn&#39;t believe it instantly any more than I believe this Vault7 stuff instantly). My point isn&#39;t &quot;no, no, the CIA and pals are really good guys and it&#39;s the OTHER guys who are bad&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;they&#39;re all bad and even if there may be a factional struggle happening, they&#39;re all still enemies of free people&quot;.</p>

<p>As for your comments about Putin, the rabbit hole goes deeper. The original Putin was a resister, but he was <a href="http://imgur.com/a/xyiID">killed and replaced in 2010.</a></p>

<p>Wikileaks are leading us like cattle to the slaughterhouse. Ales Jones is a shill (as shown by his association with Trump) but at least he acknowledges the global genocide agenda.</p>

<p>Assange would have you believe that the only purpose of the elite is to simply control elections and spy on people. Why would they even need to spy on us? It&#39;s not as if we pose any threat...</p>

<p>There should be no bigger warning bell than when some person or group targets &quot;the left&quot; or &quot;the right&quot; as a whole yet never targets the other side. This is pure textbook control, and it kills me to see the conspiracy theorist community fall for it so easily.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a natural aspect of human nature, we find safety in the crowd. It&#39;s the reason why the elitists force us into cities and group events, so that we can be trained to associate conformity with harmony.</p>
