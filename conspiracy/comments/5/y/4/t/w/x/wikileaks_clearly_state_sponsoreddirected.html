<p>until Wikileaks release something about FSB or Putin, I&#39;ll think of them as anti-west propaganda. They already decided not to release GOP/Trump emails a while ago, they have little to no credibility left with me at least.

    <div class="md"><p>I will try to limit my judgments to the evidence which is the following:</p>

<p>Here is Forbes interview from November 2010:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2010/11/29/an-interview-with-wikileaks-julian-assange/3/#12032402d66b">https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2010/11/29/an-interview-with-wikileaks-julian-assange/3/#12032402d66b</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Russian press has reported that you plan to target Russian companies and politicians. I&#39;ve heard from other WikiLeaks sources that this was blown out of proportion.</p>

<p>It was blown out of proportion when the FSB reportedly said not to worry, that they could take us down. But yes, we have material on many business and governments, including in Russia. It&#39;s not right to say there&#39;s going to be a particular focus on Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of this starts with this article in the CS Monitor:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/1026/WikiLeaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-Russia.-But-will-Russians-get-to-read-about-it">http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/1026/WikiLeaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-Russia.-But-will-Russians-get-to-read-about-it</a></p>

<p>Where two quotes are attributed to Wikileaks from the Russian press.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We have [compromising materials] about Russia, about your government and businessmen,&quot; Mr. Assange told the pro-government daily Izvestia. &quot;But not as much as we&#39;d like... We will publish these materials soon.&quot;</p>

<p>He then dropped a hint that&#39;s likely to be nervously parsed in Russia&#39;s corridors of power: &quot;We are helped by the Americans, who pass on a lot of material about Russia,&quot; to WikiLeaks, he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Assange and another WikiLeaks spokesperson, Kristinn Hrafnsson, who talked to the daily Kommersant Tuesday, refused to provide details. &quot;Russians are going to find out a lot of interesting facts about their country,&quot; Mr. Hrafnsson told Kommersant, adding that WikiLeaks would soon be targeting &quot;despotic regimes in China, Russia, and Central Asia&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the Russian version of Kommersant:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1528874">http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1528874</a></p>

<p>We find the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even when you run WikiLeaks Julian Assange wrote in a letter to potential investors that &quot;the main target of the project will be despotic regimes in Russia, China and Central Asia.&quot; Now the Russian section of the site does not contain any important documents. &quot;We have a lot of time spent on the work of the Afghan and Iraqi papers, but as soon as we deal with them, will be able to resume work on other regions, - he promised to&quot; Kommersant &quot;Christine Hrafnson.- I think that Russian readers will learn a lot about their country&quot; . WikiLeaks spokesman hoped that the resource will attract the attention of the holders of classified information from Russia. &quot;China has already reacted,&quot; - happily said &quot;Kommersant&quot; Kristin Hrafnsson. Yesterday it was reported that Chinese dissidents have announced their intention to launch a resource with information about exposing human rights violations by the Chinese authorities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The important point being the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WikiLeaks spokesman hoped that the resource will attract the attention of the holders of classified information from Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to imply that they don&#39;t have info to release, rather wish to concentrate on Eurasia, and hope that people will leak info.</p>

<p>The Izvestia article is not available.</p>

<p>Of course there are numerous cables about Russia and Putin available that inform us about real geopolitics for example:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08MOSCOW3125_a.html">https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08MOSCOW3125_a.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>C) Gazprom announced on October 22 that it may have trouble refinancing some of its debts and obtaining needed new loans. The announcement was the latest in a recent string of news indicating Russia&#39;s oil and gas sector may be seriously affected by deteriorating conditions in financial markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06MOSCOW9482_a.html">https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06MOSCOW9482_a.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>C) Summary: As is often the case in Russia&#39;s relations with its neighbors and former Soviet comrades, Moscow&#39;s decision to shut-off crude deliveries to Lithuania&#39;s Mazeikiu Nafta (MN) refinery in the wake of a July 29 oil spill along the Druzhba pipeline (Ref C) appears driven by a mix of geopolitical revenge and common-place commercial considerations. The good news may be that there is little more the Russians can do to worsen the situation (like cut off shipments from Primorsk to Butinge) and the refinery is unlikely to fold. The bad news is that refinery profits are likely to suffer until there is another shift in the oil delivery paradigm facing MN. End Summary</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06MINSK364_a.html">https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06MINSK364_a.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition to this total, the GOB demands that any company supplying crude oil to the two Belarusian refineries must sell a set portion of the refined product to Belarusian enterprises, many of whom are state owned, at discounted prices. End summary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07MOSCOW4583_a.html">https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07MOSCOW4583_a.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>(C) Describing his experiences working in a small ConocoPhillips(CP)-Lukoil joint venture, a CP employee said his Russian counterparts cling to inefficient central planning approaches to business operations. He also noted problems of favoritism, corruption, and a disregard for principles of worker and environmental health and safety. He said that CP intervenes when it can, but that changing the working culture in Russia is an uphill battle. End Summary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the claim was that they will provide information about Russia and they did.   There is no evidence that they are sitting on Trump/Gop data other than statements that they have received documents that are already in the public domain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so first off i dont buy the Russian boogeyman thing. Even if i did i would consider them more so heroes than an enemy. Why do some folks deny legit information when considering who or where it came from. Who cares if the Russians exposed it all...It is being exposed. What does this mean? Does it mean there are 2 enemies? America for the content of the leaks AND Russia for stealing those leaks in order to expose them? That doesnt sound right to me. How is what wikileaks is doing different from Edward Snowden? Is Edward Snowden a Russian agent too? What about Chelsea Manning? Russian Agent? How far do we have to go before we see the big picture that America is the bad guy and has been for centuries?</p>

<p>Democracy is dead. It should be undeniable at this point. All these wikileaks are pointing at American politics being a facade. We knew it was true, now we are seeing evidence confirming our beliefs. A criminal cabal is in control profiteering endlessly so long as they get away with it. </p>

<p>There is a connection between Russia and Clinton that everybody ignores, but there is no connection between Russia and Trump; and to top it off, the CIA is capable of making any web based attack look as though it comes from Russia (a country that is basically on Mexico&#39;s level in terms of cyber-capability). It&#39;s therefore irrational to accuse Trump of Russian collaboration when most of the Democratic establishment is still in control, definitively connected to Russia, and controlling the media to make it look like Trump is doing exactly what they are doing.</p>
