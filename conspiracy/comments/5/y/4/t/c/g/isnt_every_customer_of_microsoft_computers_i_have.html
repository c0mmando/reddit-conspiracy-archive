       One issue is that these corporations purposely and intentionally created backdoors that the government can use, but they did not disclose it to us, the consumers.  It is at least fraud.

       My understanding with TOR is that the initial team were making a great effort to keep it secure, but then it went downhill from there.  I recall reading that one of them was accused of inappropriate behavior with a minor, and was ousted.  That is a typical smear campaign to me.  In fact, it sounds like what Assange is going through.  LOL.  I wonder who could be behind it?

       With Linux, I imagine they have people on the inside to create weaknesses.  I think the code is peer reviewed, but there is probably a way around this.

       Tails is reletively secure. I think if your a hardcore target they wont care what OS or Mac address your using they'll get in. But for the everyday folk I think tails should be okay to stay under the radar.

       Just in case you really don't know, the bill of rights is only for the government.  Private institutions can do whatever they want.  The only ground for a suit is if this is against their own terms of service (it's not), or if it was illegal (it's not).
      </p>
      <p>
       For example you're allowed to say whatever you want without fear from the government but your job can still fire you.  Or how you can't walk into a McDonald's with a gun strapped to your back.

       Good luck taking them on. Even if people come together to successfully sue M$, they'll just pay money (and be reimbursed by the US government) and change nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like it or not, this Vault 7 thing proves that US software and hardware, as well as giant corporations are untrustworthy.

       "Open source it", may be the knee jerk reaction of some. But no one actually reads open source code. Once again, as I have said many times, "open source" is code for "somebody else will read it". Only competitors, criminals and intelligence agencies do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue here is integrity of an organisation. The US, and its collaborators, have proven that they have none.

       One advantage of a lawsuit is publicity and pushback.  It is important that we pushback on this, otherwise they will keep doing it and do even more.

       Not true. There are geeks out there reading it. Not many. But all it takes is one guy to bring it to everyone else's attention with a blog post and it's out there. The danger I see is the day when we know it's corrupted and simply continue to use it.

       MS is going to have a harder time selling its products to the rest of the world now.  Win 10 keylogs you and sends everything you type back to MS, let alone the CIA, NSA and the gang.  I've been telling my friends that their smart TV's are listening to them, and none of them cared.  You'll notice none of the big tech companies rushed out with fixes for this today.

       Only those with measurable damages would be eligible for remuneration. Plus, a suit at that scale wouldn't do anything to the CIA or even the tech companies (for having the weaknesses in their systems) it would be passed to the taxpayer/consumer depending on which one is gone after.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chances are you wouldn't actually qualify and, if the CIA is sued, your taxes would go up so you could pay for those who do qualify.
