       im looking into it as it has me curious too. So far i find that the car was going 190 kmph through a narrow tunnel and collided with a post of some sort. 190 is fucking FAST. The car was a rental from the hotel she was staying in. I'll try and find more about this car. It is a Mercedes s280

        A Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer. It is a message-based protocol, designed originally for multiplex electrical wiring within automobiles, but is also used in many other contexts.

       i am also reading that the onboard computer chip in the mercedes was missing after the crash. Also i am reading that the rental vehicle was stolen 2 days before Diana rented it. Whether this is true or not i am not sure i am trying to find some legit sources, but wow this definitely looks suspect so far!

       If it turns out Princess Diana was murdered there WILL be blood in the streets. The emotional reaction to her death at the time was like nothing else. Possibly just as strong an impact as if the truth about 9/11 comes out.

       Nikola Tesla created a remote control boat in 1898. If that was possible then, I'd say the remote controlling of a car in the 90's is possible.

       The plane crash was in 2010 when he was completely irrelevant. Small aircraft crash caused by a banner getting caught in the tail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The car crash was a wheel coming off after nuts came loose, that may have been someone trying to do him in. But this post came about because of car computers not that, and there would be a long, long list of candidates before the CIA. Plus killing Farage would've had next to no political impact. He wasn't helping his own cause.

       This is gonna sound like a joke, but has anyone ever looked into Paul Walker's accident? I vaguely recall reading that he was wise to the whole vaccine thing and was close to throwing some big pharma companies under the bus.

       There was a very suspiciously long list of people on the Clinton Body Count of people who died in plane crashes--WAAAAYY past the average (I don't know anyone--do you?). We need to start a list of people who have died in plane crashes as well, such as JFK Jr.
