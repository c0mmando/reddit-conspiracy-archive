<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIyN4QS6NQ8">Most accurate video from head-on collision in Moscow from two cameras. you can see exactly how the accident occurred.</a></p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs ‚Äúfavorite chauffeur‚Äù was reportedly kiled in a head-on collision in Moscow on September 6th, 2016</p>

<p>Video shows a black Mercedes CLS swerving into oncoming traffic and colliding with a Federation Council registered BMW 7-Series in Moscow. The President‚Äôs chauffeur was alone in the car and paramedics declared him deaed at the scene. The Mercedes driver was taken to the hospital in unknown condition.</p>

<p>edit: If anyone can find the name of this driver i will be very grateful! Ive spent the past hour trying to find but am drawing blanks, which makes it a bit odd. I cant even find the name of the other victim!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t see shit on neither of those videos. Second, the VIP car was probably the one that used the special (middle) lane. That was the one that lost control and hit the one in leftmost lane. In text, it states that the other car lost control and hit the VIP car. Doesn&#39;t make sense.

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think you understand how it works lol. Cars have had remote computers since the late 80&#39;s and the late 90&#39;s pretty much every car has it. These remote computers are capable of controlling steering, speed, air conditioning, engine heat, brakes and something like 65 more functions. If you think one of the highest intelligence agencies in the world is unable to tap into those while also implying Tesla is the first, you are truly a lost soul and more than likely a shill.</p>

The second one must be physically accessed first and hacked, mustn&#39;t it ? Or is it done via FM radio in the car ?</p>

<p>A device must have capabilities to be remotely controlled. Were you talking about some things that are possible , or that 
ALL CARS CAN BE REMOTELY CONTROLLED ??  &#39;Cause 99% of the cars on the streets of the world CAN NOT. </p>

<p>.. and Tesla (the real one , not the car manufacturer) demonstrated remote control in 1898, so what&#39;s your point ? Every car has it factory installed ?</p>

<p>There was also something about the cars chip missing after the crash and the car being a rental and going missing before the crash too. Honestly, I&#39;ve never cared for the royal family so I haven&#39;t looked into her death much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone else looked up the model Mercedes in another thread. Basically the deal is that model that was crashed was one the first to have a CAN(?) system which could be hacked. So it might have been possible?</p>

<p>There was also something about the cars chip missing after the crash and the car being a rental and going missing before the crash too. Honestly, I&#39;ve never cared for the royal family so I haven&#39;t looked into her death much.</p>
