       I always assumed it, but now we have actual proof. And not just 9/11, what about those other planes that went down recently and were never found. There was probably somebody on board that needed killing and this is how it's done. The evidence is submerged in saltwater, miles deep and all the bad guys have (had?) plausible deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you're old enough, don't forget Ross Perot, who was beating George Bush Sr. as a third party candidate back in 92. Perot quit the race, claiming that Bush and the CIA had fake pics of his daughter and were going to smear her reputation. At the time, everybody thought Perot was crazy and Bush ridiculed him mercilessly. But knowing what we know now, I'm sure that was Photoshop before Photoshop was a thing. Perot wasn't crazy, Bush was lying.

       Operation Northwoods I believe? And I think that if now people cannot wrap their heads around the idea of 9/11 being an inside job, and instead choose to believe that a group of people with little flying experience managed to successfully and simultaneously hijack commercial airliners without being stopped and fly them with such precision and timing into several major sites, then there is no convincing people. I mean seriously, what more do we need to get people to understand that there is no way this was not an inside job.

       You know, honestly I can see how ignorance is bliss. Aside from going out and living in the mountains off the grid for the rest of my life, it seems like now I am destined to live a life of depressing futility knowing how fucked the world really is and knowing at the same time that there is nothing I can do to stop it.

       Yeah, I get it, I'm just not that way. I need truth no matter how bad it is. And I am not one that can just ignore things that seem false or off. And I'm ok with that, at first I wasn't ok with it. I guess age does that to ya.

       I don't generally talk to people about stuff unless they ask my opinion. But when they have questions about things they always ask me cause they know I spend most of my time reading about crazy subjects. It's my hobby I guess; to learn new things.

       The thing that gets me about the pentagon is 1.) the missing few clips of footage with the plane in view, and 2.) the line of travel the plane supposedly took to get in line with the building. They said it was so low it would have clipped phone poles and trees. and 3.) It hit directly in the location of the office involved with the investigation of the missing funds. Sure the whole flying perpendicular into the twin towers could be feasible, but for a building like the pentagon? I mean I could understand a nose dive type maneuver, but a flight directly into the side....that concerns me.

       Don't forget the missing plane, and the unexplainably small hole for a 767, 757, 747. And the perfect circle hole that got blown out on the other side of office. Hint: it was a fucking missile or a rocket.

       Yeah there was. I love when people try to say the government isn't smart enough to carry that out and I'm like you're right but they did it anyways. Lol. Well, calling it an inside job is a little more complicated than most think but I won't get into that here.

       Agreed the pentagon was likely just a bomb man. No plane wreckage found. They took out the frames in the surveillance camera that captured it (and confiscated the rest of course). Prolly just a simple little bomb. No questions asked.

       It's a huge leap to assume that because the very latest cars can be remotely controlled to some extent that airplanes can be remotely piloted from the ground.

       Drones are designed for that purpose and have the right hardware built in. I don't think airliners are, especially since some are 20 or more years old. Also, the risk is huge, should some control respond to a random or malicious radio signal.

       Let's agree on a few points first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any computer connected to a network could be vulnerable to hacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Planes built 20 years ago have computer systems that help control flight. (20 years isn't that long ago)
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Michael Hastings, he was not driving a autonomous car.  So it was either hacked or he just crashed it.  It's quite suspicious that he was scared to drive his own car, then it crashed and killed him, like he said it would.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA works with tech companies to install backdoor access points in software.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can agree on those 4 points, surely you can make the logical assumption that it might be possible to hack an airplane.

       Because only the newest cars have that capability and it's not clear how much can be controlled. Those remote controls would have to be built into the airplanes, many of which are 20 or more years old. To have remote takeover possible in an airliner is a huge risk and not likely.

       It was but the pilots would need to be prevented from using the controls to make it work.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Remote Control Scenario
       </p>
       <p>
        Here is how remote control could have been carried out.
The plane taxis from its parking position to the start of the runway, meanwhile observed by an agent. On the very moment that the pilot gives full throttle the agent pushes a button. Via a transmitter a timer within the plane is activated. After 20 minutes or so the countdown is completed and a valve is opened of a capsule that was hidden within the air conditioner duct near the cockpit and Kolokol-1, an incapacitating agent is released which makes the pilot unconscious within 1-3 seconds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kolokol-1 (Russian: Колокол, eng. bell) is an opiate-derived, incapacitating agent. Although the exact nature of the active chemical has not been revealed, it is a derivative of the drug fentanyl, possibly the extraordinarily potent carfentanil or 3-Methylfentanyl. It takes effect very quickly, within one to three seconds, reportedly rendering its victims unconscious for two to six hours. Little else is known about this agent.
       </p>
       <p>
        A few minutes later a signal from the ground is send to the aircraft containing an updated flight path.
       </p>
       <p>
        The modern FMS was introduced on the Boeing 767 (both twin towers planes were B767’s).
       </p>
       <p>
        The flight plan is generally determined on the ground, before departure either by the pilot for smaller aircraft or a professional dispatcher for airliners. It is entered into the FMS either by typing it in, selecting it from a saved library of common routes or (Company Routes) or via a datalink with the airline dispatch center.

        This was enough so send the planes on course to New York.
       </p>
       <p>
        Who could have send the updated flight paths to the doomed airplanes? A possible candidate is the flight controller Pete Zalewski. He ‘handled’ not only both flight 11 &amp; 175, but also Egypt Air 990, that had crashed into the Atlantic in 1999. Some see this event as a ‘dress rehearsel’ for 9/11. His behaviour was peculiar in that he did not follow procedures but spent too much time in trying to contact the airplanes after the transponders had been switched off. Instead he should have warned his superiors that something was wrong. He could have used this time to send an updated flight path to the planes.

       I remember when I first started hearing about self-driving cars, I told people they seemed pretty vulnerable to hacking, but all I got back was "why would anyone do that and what could they possibly do?" turns out they don't even need to be that advanced to be vulnerable, and now I have an answer.
