        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit: Bad Title- I should have known what that would summon around here. 
Revised Title: There is no title for this topic that won&#39;t trigger someone</p>

<p>This sub, and possibly even other parts of the conspiracy community as a whole, seems to have lost it&#39;s way when it comes to actually discussing and organizing the discussion of conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>I understand that there is rampant vote manipulation and shills fuck shit up on the daily, those things definitely are meant to sabotage any real and honest discussion, but we ourselves seem to have lost our way when it comes to approaching open discussion. It feels like many people have forgotten what the point of creating a forum, or any similar resource, to discuss these topics is meant to achieve. </p>

<p>I think we can all agree that things are not what they seem. There is a spectrum that we all fall on, but for the most part, in simple terms, we all think fucked shit is happening. So we are all gathered here for a common reason: &quot;I think some shady shit is happening, and I&#39;d like to get to the bottom of it.&quot; That mentality of noticing things just not being quite right coupled with independent research (hopefully) has lead us to seek others that are feeling the way we are in hopes that we can help each other find truth. We might not all agree on &quot;truth&quot; sometimes, but we need to remember that we are here on account of good intentions, or at least we should be. Just because someone has accepted a theory as true that you don&#39;t personally believe doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t be a valuable addition to the meta discussion of &quot;are bad people doing bad things and how do we stop them?&quot;</p>

<p>The point of addressing this issue is because I&#39;ve noticed there is a division within the community. There are some that are very open and can effectively entertain ideas without accepting them for the sake of discussion. Then there are others that immediately resort to ad hominem or typical internet behavior the moment someone makes a claim they personally think is stupid. Of course anyone should always request sources and evidence, but in the world of conspiracy theories, evidence isn&#39;t always abundant or empirical. Much theorizing is built around having only a limited number of puzzle pieces and having to put them together and guess the final image the best you can. So I think we can agree that yes, the source of information and claims should be included, but there is no need for shaming or attacking someone simply because you don&#39;t feel that they have enough puzzle pieces to make the claim. That&#39;s why we are all here. To try to, as a group, find all the puzzle pieces and create a clearer image. </p>

<p>Any theorist should be happy to admit they were wrong when evidence clearly shows their claim or idea as false. But just because you personally believe something is unlikely to be true doesn&#39;t mean the person making the claim is stupid nor does it mean that the theory proposed is false. Remembering that when discussing conspiracy topics is key to maintaining level headed discussion and building a community that actually works together to discover the truth. </p>

<p>Short of obviously disprovable shit, no ones input should be disregarded or ridiculed. Cultivating well rounded opinions as a group by sending our most sourced and backed theories to the forefront while still respecting and working on the lesser founded theories should be a main goal. We all want the truth; there is no need for hostility between those of us that are willing to question. Be ready to admit you&#39;re wrong, but don&#39;t take pride in being right. None of what we uncover is something to be proud of. </p>

<p>I know there will always be trolls and childish people that simply cannot participate responsibly, but maybe there is a rule reform that could take place or a &quot;mission statement&quot; that could be enacted to help keep discussion in line with the actual values that made us all want to get involved in seeing behind the curtain. We shouldn&#39;t just be here to &quot;shoot the shit&quot; with each other about these topics if we take them as seriously as we say we do. </p>

<p>TL;DR
I know the deck is stacked against us, but we really need to put in some group effort on trying to reform the way we allow things to be discussed on this sub. This should be a place for collaboration and mutual respect. If we really think we are working for the good of humanity in attempting to piece together the reality we live in as it really is and not as it is presented to us, let&#39;s stop the edgy troll parade and start realizing why we are doing what we are doing and why it&#39;s important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every day. And I&#39;m totally aware that posts like this are and have been abundant for some time now. I edited to say it&#39;s a bad title. It is. I brain farted when I typed that not realizing how it&#39;d come across like so many others. My apologies. But I think I make a fair point about how to truly sift through data and form sound conclusions is through proper discourse and discussion. And I see so many posts and discussions get sabotaged by people who truly aren&#39;t trying to have a discussion. I&#39;m making the case for open discussion and mutual respect furthering the efficacy of the prime purpose of a conspiracy theory community. I understand how nearly impossible that probably is, but I don&#39;t see the harm in the effort. I think I&#39;m addressing a meta issue that is at least worthy of considering. I&#39;m not just rambling that &quot;This sub is too political&quot; or &quot;This sub isn&#39;t what it used to be&quot; blah blah. Like yes, I said this sub has lost it&#39;s way, but more accurately I should&#39;ve better noted that I was saying the mindset of this particular conspiracy community, and possibly the community on the whole, seems to be counterproductive and less effective than it could be and we should try to reign it in. Nothing more. </p>

<p>No offense, but you going immediately to &quot;If you hung out in...&quot; and acting as if your understanding of things is undoubtedly superior to mine is the problem I&#39;m pointing out. That is what is unhelpful. Like I&#39;m just a dude on the internet that you know nothing about or what theories I believe or what research I&#39;ve done and you&#39;re lumping me in with anyone else who has made a similar post? I&#39;m simply calling for a little more mutual respect when it comes to discussing things that none of us can even actually prove. There is no reason for any of us to be assholes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you see that&#39;s exactly my point, the kind of stuff you claim to be informing us how to do <em>is</em> and <em>does</em> happen here. There are like half a million users who come and go and there&#39;s often thousands of people at a time. There&#39;s always going to be shit disturbers and shills but you make it seem like what you describe doesn&#39;t go on here already. I say &quot;if you hung out in r/new&quot; because I see the kind of discussion you&#39;re asking for there everyday. There is real and proper discussion/sharing of ideas going on. You can&#39;t hope to combat it all, and you can&#39;t pretend like people don&#39;t know and already do what you&#39;re talking about. I&#39;m &quot;lumping you in&quot; with them because you&#39;re saying the same things they do, you just gave it more detail and didn&#39;t come across as out right rude. But You&#39;re Still making the same arguments. </p>

<p>The mindset of the core conspiracy community hasn&#39;t changed. There&#39;s a massive influx of users, legitimate and otherwise and that&#39;s the root of the issue. Shills gonna shill. I&#39;m not trying to come off as superior at all, I said that because I see the discussion you claim doesn&#39;t exist in <a href="/r/new">/r/new</a> and you&#39;re either ignoring it or not looking hard enough because if you actually spent time there you would see it. </p>

<p>I agree with you&#39;re premise that there should be reasonable discussion involving facts going on but making a holier than thou post like this isn&#39;t going to reach anyone. Go into the individual threads and do what you can to influence the conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said it doesn&#39;t exist in <a href="/r/new">/r/new</a>. I know it exists. But I see even long time posters here who aren&#39;t shit posters still act like complete assholes to others over difference in opinion. It&#39;s due to how closely I&#39;ve watched things that I feel I see frequent posters on /conspiracy still having really hostile discussions. </p>

<p>You are right about the influx of users. That alone disrupts a lot. And honestly, I see your point very well and actually probably have been swayed on my view of it. But I still think there is elitism even in the conspiracy community. People being condescending because they think they are more &quot;woke&quot; or some shit. </p>

<p>Great point about actively going into individual threads.</p>

<p>I really had good intentions for this post and I still think my point is valid and would benefit things, but you are right that it&#39;s basically an unattainable goal on the whole. The internet, I guess. </p>

It just gets tiring to see this sub shit on and tried to be labeled one way or another day after day and I guess I&#39;m getting a little testy about it. I don&#39;t want to discourage efforts to improve the conversation I just truly think that it needs to be done on a ground floor basis, more (not covertly) but less heavy handed I guess? I&#39;m not articulating that very well but regardless my point is that we could all benefit to take a few points from you but I think people just have to see it in action to understand.

    <div class="md"><p>Who considers it an enemy?</p>

<p>Let me guess... You believe global warming is caused by human CO2 emissions? Or that &quot;fossil fuel&quot; is made by dead dinosaurs?</p>

<p>You know Titan–a moon of Saturn–is covered in a sea of petroleum?</p>

<p>When you say enemy of science, do you mean to say &quot;seeker of truth?&quot;</p>

<p>Any link post should include an additional statement outlining the relevance to conspiracies and why anyone should care. This might help prevent the spamming of articles from the media.</p>

<p>An additional rule which bans comments like &#39;this stuff makes the truth movement look bad&#39; would be helpful. We need to encourage original thought.</p>
