       ODNI/DHS assessments were all bullshit on the subject but they were based on flawed 3rd party assessments.
      </p>
      <p>
       ThreatConnect made mistakes and incorrect assumptions had them cling to a false-positive 'indicator'. (Seems I was the only person who actually bothered to reach out and communicate with EliteVPN!)
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM misreported various aspects early on ... if they admit the truth now what little scraps of credibility they have left - may disappear completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       He WAS a false flag and this IS verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       For any that doubt it... the first step is identifying intent (and that much comes from
       <a href="https://medium.com/@nyetnyetnyet/russia-and-wikileaks-the-case-of-the-gilded-guccifer-f2288521cdee">
        tvor_22's discovery
       </a>
       , so
       <em>
        FULL
       </em>
       credit to him - it's subtle, very subtle, but it's quite possibly the most important piece of evidence that exists in relation to figuring out who Guccifer2.0 is because it tells exactly WHAT he is by exposing his purpose/intent.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be done using an RTF format specification, understanding how RSIDs work and looking for "styrsid11758497" in 1.doc, 2.doc and 3.doc - and considering the implications. (Basically, the docs were built on the sane blank Russian-language-'tainted' template)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The documents were tainted even before the body content was added!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       These were then opened 30+ minutes later using an account with a Russian name and 1.doc, 2.doc, 3.doc and 5.doc were all opened, had content from original documents copied into them and were then saved in sequence over the course of a couple of minutes (writing the Russian name to the metadata in the process).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Now you have the EVIDENCE of INTENT for a false flag operation
       </strong>
       <em>
        (2 sweeps of intentional 'tainting'!)
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be posting an article in the next 48 hours (hopefully!) that will attempt to walk people through the process of finding and verifying the discovery for themselves (just by being told the documents to inspect, an RSID number to investigate (which is in this article above) - and let them figure out what it means from there)
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the MSM is concerned... this is all you need, on it's own, to discredit their 9 month long fake news festival of bullshit on this particular subject.
       <em>
        (and it's important to do this on it's own as a separate article without mixing in theories, hypotheses, etc that will ultimately just diminish the raw evidence)
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       With intent demonstrated... there are a few questions left... but... it's not difficult to figure out the rest... and yes, I will divulge more.. but for now...
       <strong>
        forget the attribution, focus on raw, isolated and irrefutable evidence that Guccifer2.0 absolutely was an effort to have leaks discredited through attribution to Russian hackers
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time the MSM insist that Guccifer2.0 is a GRU agent, they're fucking lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they cite the assessments without qualifying that by explaining that the ODNI/DHS theory is discredited - they're fucking lying through omission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only when this first, isolated piece of evidence defeats the propaganda - will people be ready for the next stage.

       Np... it's time to get this out... doing it in a small abstract step like this is critical though otherwise we get gas-lighting, diversions, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the actual walk-through to checking and verifying will be it's own separate article - and I will be hammering the media with it to let them know... it's time to retire the Guccifer2.0 bullshit or at least inform the pubic of the truth.

       I've insisted we stay away from distractions.  The RSID and RTF datastream proving the Russians aren't behind Guccifer2.0 is all that matters. - It shows the actual, literal, absolute truth without the need to put quotes about it in a disparaging manner.

       Haha man dont waste your time. Just another account who writes 50 comments a day ranging from defending Hilary, Podesta, Colbert, denying 9/11 and pizzagate conspiracies, pushes the Russian narrative, etc etc. Its amusing as they still dont bother to dot in organic comments on other topics besides defending liberal or 'deep state' policy.

       Yes, they will all RESIST this for fucking sure.  It breaks the narrative they have clung so hard to for so long... but... not my fault... what I and others have found is just what we have found... and not an effort to seek affirmation of a preconceived notion driven by partisan biases.

       He didn't release anything of any significant impact against Clinton.
      </p>

       His first act was helping Clinton by trying to have the reputation of leaks destroyed and giving Dems an excuse to claim "they're probably doctored" whenever questioned about leaks.

Okay, sorry if I seemed blunt - with me being neck-deep in the research on this for months I tend to forget how a lot of what happened 9 months ago is likely to have faded over time for many.

       It's the volume man. I've read 10s of thousands of pages since then. And guccifers provenance want really interesting to me. The material was. We get sidetracked so hard on who or what leaked this or that, it shits all over the content.

       That's the thing with Guccifer2 - The content he released was worthless, his behavior was all over the place and the MSM seemed obsessed with promoting his statements and claims from the moment he appeared... but never investigated him thoroughly.

       I think that report title says it all. What was the purpose? To fabricate a 21st century rendition of Watergate, implicating Hillary's opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
       ThreatConnect; was that the (still only) firm which "confirmed" it was Russian hackers?

       To be honest, while I can totally understand why you suspect it may have been preemptive
       <em>
        (considering what has happened over the last year and the ties some of these cybersecurity fiirms have to the Atlantic Council, etc)
       </em>
       - I'm not sure they'd even thought that far ahead at that time and am confident that the main motivating factor was preventing the leaks Assange had only just announced were coming - from making her lose the primary. - THAT incident got the Clinton campaign in a panic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe even the choice of Russian identity wasn't aimed at warmongering at that point but was based on the recent discovery of malware apparently with Russian origins (would automatically serve to affirm a Russian-hacker narrative) and in the months leading up to this, as we see from leaked emails, the DNC were already hatching plans to associate Trump with Russia. - So Russia was the natural choice just from those two factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said... it is possible they may have been thinking ahead for wars... but I don't think it was the thing that really instigated it... I believe it was desperation to mitigate whatever Wikileaks had on them that motivated it so strongly at that time... nobody else would have had any reason to screw with the public's perception of leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please note though - that these hypotheses, etc. are secondary to the RTF/RSID evidence.  Until the foundation of everyone's bullshit beliefs (for those who believe they know the truth but don't) is smashed by the demonstration of intent through that simple example... it'll be impossible to have them even consider the motive &amp; means.

       Guccifer is a liar. DNC wouldn't let the FBI look at the server. Wikileaks says the leaks didn't come from Russia.

       Clinton Campaign had Warren Flood (Former whitehouse IT manager) cook up the Russian-tainted documents.  Guccifer2.0 was an effort to discredit the upcoming leaks that Assange had only just announced were coming.
