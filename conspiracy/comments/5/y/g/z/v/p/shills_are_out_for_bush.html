        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We know after Hillary Clinton&#39;s presidential run that politicians pay PR firms to drive the online narrative about them, particularly on Reddit. There has been a very sudden upswing in the amount of positive posts about George Bush in the last few weeks that seems targeted and it completely contradicts the prevailing social and political views of the young, left-leaning demographic of Reddit. </p>

<p>I believe (my conspiracy) is that this is a targeted PR campaign run by the Republican establishment who oppose Trump. They want to create an image of the old Republicans as people that may have a slightly different view for the economy than you, but are generally nice guys with your best interests are heart. Together with constantly undermining the Trump presidency, they want to make the Republican establishment more attractive to the general public, so that we&#39;re all begging for the good old days. </p>

There&#39;s tons of evidence America told Saddam they were fine with his actions and that it would make no response, only later using Kuwait as a pretext to justify invasion when it became politically expedient.  At the time it was known as &quot;giving the fake OK.&quot;  </p>
