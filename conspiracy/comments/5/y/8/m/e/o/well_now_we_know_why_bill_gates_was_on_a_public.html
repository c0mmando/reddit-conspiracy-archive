       it's not a "random thing" to never be sure if your computer is recording and transmitting your data in ways that could later be used against you.  i'm interested in the mind set of a person who says that's ok.  is that ok with you?
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as eating insects, watch the movie "citizen kane".  the eccentricities of billionaires don't age very well.  they later seem like hollow men.  now add to that, the fact that THIS multi-billionaire is suggesting the rest of us drink shit, and eat bugs.......  well, it provokes a smile, that i would even have to explain it to you.

       Ok I'm assuming you're talking about water treated by reverse osmosis (don't see anything wrong), and eating farmed insects (will take some getting used to, but also don't see anything wrong). The other stuff about Bill Gates I don't know, but these are good solutions to keeping people alive in the coming years.

       If we assume that human emissions are contributing to rapid climate change, and that part of those emissions are down to the abundance of cattle, then we can also assume that as the shit starts to actually hit the fan, we'll be forced to realise that we can't continue as we are, and that we might need other sources of protein that aren't contributing to our destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       ELI5: There are lots of insects, they are great sources of protein, they have short lifecycles which makes them cheaper and quicker to farm, and they don't burp hurricane juice.

       As a species we're slowly skull-fucking the planet. We either radically change the way we do things, or we reduce the population. People don't like change and do like fucking, so wars are started for culling purposes. it's a lot easier to just holocaust a few countries when you've got the media broadcasting what you tell them, than it is to actually make the world a better place.
