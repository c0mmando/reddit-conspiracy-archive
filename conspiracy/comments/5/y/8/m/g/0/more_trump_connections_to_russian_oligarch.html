        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>About a month ago, I made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5osrxy/trump_had_a_secret_meeting_with_russian_oligarch/">post</a> about Trump possibly meeting with a Russian oligarch before the election.</p>

<p>Now, a month later, it appears the MSM has picked up this same story, and has uncovered further ties to this oligarch <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article136940273.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Most interestingly is the revelation that Trump sold a beach side mansion to this oligarch for over double the assessed value, and then turned around and bulldozed the mansion and is just selling the property. This is a classic money laundering scheme.</p>

<p>So despite a lack of hard evidence, the circumstantial evidence continues to pile up that Trump has unethical business dealings with high level Russia elites, and may use his powers as POTUS to further these relationships.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;insider&quot; narrative is that Flynn resignation and Sessions&#39; recusal were work of either Pence or Priebus (who are supposedly pro-Deep State elements within the administration).</p>

<p>Whether the Bushes, Clintons, and Obama enriched themselves through &quot;pay to play&quot; or shifting American interests in favor of their own isn&#39;t even a question. Under their administrations, the US wealth gap has grown to record proportions. Further, real economic indicators have been consistently rigged to fit the narrative of the &quot;Great Recovery.&quot;</p>

<p>The bottom line is that the US government has grown, its power has increased, and <em>most</em> Americans are worse off for it. If you don&#39;t understand why your countrymen don&#39;t care about the Russian scare, perhaps it indicates your favored status. If, by some chance, you <em>didn&#39;t</em> profit from the looting of the American middle class, then it begs the question of why you are so concerned with Russia.</p>

<p>We are all in this together, whether you believe it or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would Pence be in on it?  Is there any evidence of this at all?</p>

<p>There is actual evidence that there were contacts, perhaps inappropriate, between the Trump campaign and Russia.  This is ignored.  Really step back and look at it - you are making a claim with no proof, solely because it fits with your narrative.</p>

<p>I do believe that we are all in this together, that is why I&#39;m baffled by the hero worship of Trump.  He&#39;s out for himself like any other politician for all I&#39;ve seen. </p>

<p>Trump worship is just the reincarnation of &quot;Hope and change&quot; from 2008. You really don&#39;t get it, do you? I&#39;m not saying that that is what he represents IRL, but (at present, even with your attempted Russia smear) the folks in r/conspiracy still hope that he destroys the Deep State, which has destroyed American democracy (and done the same countless other countries as well). Hindsight might be much different for r/conspiracy, but that is what you are up against. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, I forgot to ask - If Russia is so dangerous and bad, why did Obama administration green light Frank Giustra to sell them so much Uranium?</p>

<p>I get that you want Trump to represent some huge change, but that doesn&#39;t make it true.  Russia can be good or bad, my point is Trump is using the presidency for his own personal and financial gain, and if that involves Russia (good or bad) Trump is fine with it.  Pay to Play killed the Clintons, Trump is open about it and somehow that makes him the savior of the common man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[eye roll] you are still insisting that Flynn&#39;s resignation is indicative of guilt. Going back to my first comment, I said it was the work of Pence or Priebus. I don&#39;t claim to know who it is. I just gave you one example of why Pence would be considered a liability (love of Bush is a scary fucking thing to people with half of a working brain).</p>

<p>Flynn could have also resigned as a part of a strategy to incriminate the leakers within intelligence agencies and corporate media. It could be a setup for a big purge.</p>

<p>Clinton/Bush alliance is very old (back to Iran/Contra). Ken Starr is a member of the Clinton legal team - did you know that? His role in the impeachment hearings in the 90&#39;s was to keep the conversation on the rdiculous Lewinski affair, and out of Clinton&#39;s obvious corruption. Comey&#39;s role as FBI director has been to quash ongoing investigations of Clinton/Bush political allies. His junior, Andrew McCabe was responsible for the Portland Christmas Tree &quot;terror bust&quot; that was an obvious frame-up (to keep alive the Muslim Terror narrative) educate yourself about this.Their appointees within the federal government constitute the &quot;Deep State&quot;. Their function has been to make sure that cronies go unpunished, and to crack down on dissent. Sibel Edmonds reported that the appointees of the Reagan/Bush/Clinton administrations were the ones with the <em>most</em> skeletons dug up by FBI. The Clintons (or their handlers) wanted judges and bureaucrats that could be controlled (through blackmail). This way, corruption in the US grows exponentially, in lockstep with Federal Debt and Wealth gap and death throes of Middle Class. Where have you been for the last 30+ years? </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;d say the juiciest part was that Rybolovlev bought a mansion from Trump for nearly 4 timse what Trump paid for it, right in the midst of the housing collapse. This is evidence of classic money laundering. Oh, he also bulldozed the house and is now selling the property at a loss. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rybolovlev famously purchased Trumpâ€™s Palm Beach mansion for almost $95 million in 2008. The transaction made headlines because he paid almost $60 million more than Trump had, and Rybolovlev bought it amid the U.S. financial crisis, which imperiled real estate values.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, I remain very skeptical of Trump.  I do not share the idea that he is some kind of savior that some of the users here have.  Its certainly possible he has sympathies for Russia&#39;s elite.</p>

<p>Its similar to how Obama grew up Muslim. How could he not be sympathetic to muslims and the religion of Islam you know?</p>

<p>All presidents are bad people.  They desire power and control over other humans and I think its just a huge mistake to trust any of them.</p>

<p>However, Trump has done one positive thing so far that I like: He defeated the Cunt.  So there is that, wouldnt you agree?</p>

<p>100% agree.  I hope the users here will do the same. Its very dangerous to give any politicians, especially the ones we tend to agree with, a pass.</p>

<p>Thats how we got into this mess: by not holding our elected officials accountable when they lie, break promises and do evil things.  What I mean by that is, democrats do not hold democrats accountable and neither do republicans. They circle the wagons when someone in their group fucks up and that hurts us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because conspiracy theory - for a lot of people - isn&#39;t about reason or evidence; it&#39;s just a re-framing of a backwards worldview.</p>

<p>A few decades ago these people would have been invoking the bible to justify their voting for morons like Trump, but since God pretty much died they use crappy &#39;muh&#39;lluminati&#39; narratives to justify it instead.</p>

<p>Bear in mind I&#39;m not impugning conservatives or Republicans here. Just morons.</p>

<p>But this business dealing here definitely looks like money laundering to me. But a business man involved in illegal or shady business practices I don&#39;t think is surprising here. Its disgusting behavior. </p>

<p>I think I would be more alarmed about Russian control over him if he had literally 0 ties to Russia that were visible, because a mover and shaker such as himself would have ties in Russia like he would the rest of the developed world.</p>

<p>Trump worship is just the reincarnation of &quot;Hope and change&quot; from 2008. You really don&#39;t get it, do you? I&#39;m not saying that that is what he represents IRL, but (at present, even with your attempted Russia smear) the folks in r/conspiracy still hope that he destroys the Deep State, which has destroyed American democracy (and done the same countless other countries as well). Hindsight might be much different for r/conspiracy, but that is what you are up against. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, I forgot to ask - If Russia is so dangerous and bad, why did Obama administration green light Frank Giustra to sell them so much Uranium?</p>
