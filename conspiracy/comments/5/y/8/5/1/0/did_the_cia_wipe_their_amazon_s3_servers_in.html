        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">136</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-03-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/o_O_0_O_o_O_0_O_o.html">o_O_0_O_o_O_0_O_o</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As some of you may remember there was a large internet outage a week ago caused by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> (<em>Simple Storage Service</em>) going down. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5wqnrn/amazon_web_services_northern_virginia_servers/"><em>Previous thread detailing the outage.</em></a></p>

<p>Most news sites reported on this explaining which companies and websites were affected by the outage. I haven&#39;t found any that mentioned how the outage impacted the CIA and other federal departments that use the Northern Virginia Amazon S3 servers for their storage. Here&#39;s an interesting article from The Atlantic called <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/amazon-web-services-data-center/423147/?">&quot;Why Amazon&#39;s Data Centers Are Hidden in Spy Country&quot;</a> that is definitely worth a brief read before you continue researching.</p>

<p>Now that WikiLeaks has released <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/">Vault 7</a> detailing the CIA&#39;s global covert hacking program this Amazon outage starts to look like a bit more than a mistake made by a highly trained &quot;authorized S3 team member&quot; as Amazon explains in their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/">&#39;Summary of the Amazon S3 Service Disruption in the Northern Virginia (US-EAST-1) Region&#39;</a> - <a href="http://archive.is/Fp4Qo"><em>archive</em></a></p>

<p>Here is some of that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/">report</a> (<em>emphasis mine</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Weâ€™d like to give you some additional information about the service disruption that occurred in the <strong>Northern Virginia</strong> (US-EAST-1) Region on the morning of February 28th. The Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) team was debugging an issue... At 9:37AM PST, <strong>an authorized S3 team member</strong> using an <strong>established playbook</strong> executed a command which was intended to remove a small number of servers for one of the S3 subsystems... Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was <strong>entered incorrectly</strong> and a <strong>larger set of servers</strong> was removed than intended. The servers that were inadvertently removed supported two other S3 subsystems.  One of these subsystems, <strong>the index subsystem</strong>, manages the <strong>metadata</strong> and <strong>location information</strong> of <strong>all S3 objects in the region</strong>. This subsystem is necessary to serve all GET, LIST, PUT, and <strong>DELETE requests</strong>. The second subsystem, the placement subsystem, manages allocation of new storage and requires the index subsystem to be functioning properly to correctly operate. The placement subsystem is used during PUT requests to allocate storage for new objects. Removing a significant portion of the capacity caused each of these systems to <strong>require a full restart</strong>. While these subsystems were being restarted, S3 was <strong>unable to service requests</strong>. Other AWS services in the US-EAST-1 Region that rely on S3 for storage, including the S3 console, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) new instance launches, Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes (when data was needed from a S3 snapshot), and AWS Lambda were also impacted while the S3 APIs were unavailable.  </p>

<p>S3 subsystems are designed to support the <strong>removal or failure</strong> of <strong>significant capacity</strong> with <strong>little or no</strong> customer impact. We build our systems with the assumption that things will occasionally fail, and we rely on the ability to remove and replace capacity as one of our core operational processes. While this is an operation that we have relied on to maintain our systems <strong>since the launch of S3</strong>, we have not completely restarted the index subsystem or the placement subsystem in our larger regions for <strong>many years</strong>... By 12:26PM PST, the index subsystem had activated enough capacity to begin servicing S3 GET, LIST, and DELETE requests. By 1:18PM PST, the index subsystem was fully recovered and GET, LIST, and DELETE APIs were functioning normally.  The S3 PUT API also required the placement subsystem. The placement subsystem began recovery when the index subsystem was functional and finished recovery at 1:54PM PST. At this point, S3 was operating normally. Other AWS services that were impacted by this event began recovering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what <em>really</em> happened from 10:00AM to 2:00PM?</p>

<p>Did the CIA or other players know the contents of the pending <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/">WikiLeaks publication</a> and decide to cover their tracks in fear of a future investigation?</p>

<p>Or is it a coincidence that this system failed for the first time in years just 7 days before WikiLeaks released these documents?</p>

<p>What do you think about this outage or Amazon&#39;s ties to the CIA? Post any information you find below.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh shit, they found out the IP list was in the open and had to wipe the network logs for anything getting routed in. If anyone investigated, they would be able to trace those IPs directly to S3 servers. That IP list was the most important part that Wikileaks should have released, <em>guaranteed</em> that is why S3 in Virginia was shitting their pants. These &quot;listening posts&quot; being hosted by Amazon would be a MASSIVE scandal. </p>
