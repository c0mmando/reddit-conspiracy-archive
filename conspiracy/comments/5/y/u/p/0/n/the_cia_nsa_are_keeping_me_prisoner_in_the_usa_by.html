       Just delay after delay and excuses like warrants that didn't even exist.

       I am broke, now, used to be a success, kinda, but they've got my by the "death by a thousand cuts". They are so sick and twisted that it's even the password on my router, this is comedy to them, for some reason. I tried to kill one of them last week, since then, they've backed off a great deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know WTF their problem is with me. I'm no spy. I'm just me. It's real though, and I must get off this continent, but I must take my dog with me cause... well, that's the rule I'm making. It doesn't help that he's 120lb fella. ;-)

       I have no idea what they want.

       Two years, man. Two mother fucking years of death attempts, car chases, (from each side), and so much more. Why wouldn't they just have a guy say, "Hey, asshole, we want X, Y, and Z!". Weird, eh?

       BTW they keep wanting me to watch the Jason Borne Identity movies but I've never seen them. I started to watch the first one, but... wasn't feeling it.

       Next time they have a car chase you just stop, ask them "what the hell you want?!" I'm sure it's just a case of mistaken identity. Or something from Bourne movies.

       He doesn't remember that he's a super spy, then he remembers and kills people. I haven't seen all the Borne movies, but that's my guess as to why they would want you to watch it. Maybe you're a secret super spy and you don't remember. It sounds crazy, but this whole thread sounds pretty crazy so who knows.

       Jason Borne would have said that he's not a super spy at the beginning of the movie... He didn't know he was a super spy.

       You're probably not a super spy. You're probably just a very unlucky target, or there's something you aren't telling us.

       I recently made a thread asking about U.S. Theorists because anytime I do something related to government correspondence, I get delays. My sister was on a do not fly list for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just today they tried to reject my REAL ID paperwork because they claimed their system was slow, so I waited, even past the 12pm(central) closing time until I got the paperwork approved. Last time they did it was when I went to buy some guns legally.
      </p>

       Never an explination, always delays and bullshit till I push the issue in public and get friends to call.

       It's really not. It's a shit hole politics wise, but the stuff you keep saying about Mexico makes me realize you aren't serious about leaving the US and don't have a brain outaide of what the MSM is feeding you.

       4) Apply for a passport at the US embassy in Santiago. They can't deny it forever; say you need it because you want to go back home; if they ask how you got to Chile, say you drove there and nobody happened to ask for ID.

       The serious part is that you have a much higher chance of obtaining a US passport quickly if you ask for it outside of the US. Because it's
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_return">
        against international law
       </a>
       to deny you entry into your home country (which denying you a passport while you're abroad amounts to). US embassies are used to quickly issuing passports, typically to tourists who loose them or get them stolen; plus the IRS has got no power over you in Chile (they won't extradite you for mere fiscal matters afaik).
      </p>
      <p>
       The other serious part is that you can get high-quality passports on the darknet, with varying nationalities. Just don't fall for a scam, be careful, know legitimate sellers are there. You can get one that will get you to Chile for 5k I'd say. Depending on the type of paper, country of origin, etc. the price can go as high as 20-30k. There exists different types of fake passports:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         100% forgeries, more or less well done
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         fake/real passports (someone sold their passport, didn't report them stolen, and the picture is changed to put yours in)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         real passport blanks (typically smuggled out of consulates) that are custom-printed (using a serial number / name that is real or not).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You need to know whether your fake passport is rated to pass only a visual/manual inspection, or if you can sustain an electronic scanning; in the latter case the serial number would have to match the name on the document (possible -but more expensive- with all 3 alternatives of fake documents); beware at airports the computers show the other photos/faces of the person having crossed before, if your document is stealing someone else's identity (necessary if you want to go through electronic scans). Better to avoid biometric terminals altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case when you travel, do so by road only, in the middle of the afternoon ideally under heavy rain/storm, avoid major border crossings to minimize the probability of electronic scanning of your passport; disguise yourself as a

        Flanders-like

       tourist (your dog plays a perfect role). Have a plausible, deniable, and benign cover story for your trip. Intensely think of the border guard naked if one ever talks to you.
