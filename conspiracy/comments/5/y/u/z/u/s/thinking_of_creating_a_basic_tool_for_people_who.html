        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So the basic concept is to take a very rugged SSD, turn it into a persistant bootable linux device that can run on anything from a windows 95 era computer and up, and load it up with data like a full copy of the text version of wikipedia, high-resolution maps of the world as well as GIS software to find routes that can be optimized for areas which you decide are unable for access, quick access for morse corse, semaphore, and other communication methods as well as a rudimentary universal translator along the lines of the best bet of what an open source version of Google Translate can do for a majority of the worlds languages, and other important data and software for a situation where the internet might be compromised and you&#39;d need access to information that you&#39;d otherwise take for granted such as how long long it takes for bread to spoil in the case of a snow-in or prolonged blackout, to situations where it might be necessary to re-learn how to make bread if you find yourself compromised if you only have flour and other staples and no internet access, to long-term survavlist situations where there is no possibility of the internet coming back and you need to know how everything from how to grow wheat to having bread as a finished product.</p>

<p>The library on the device would be non-copyright (creative commons, open source, out-of-copyright, etc) works that would contain the information above that wikipedia doesn&#39;t have detail on, mostly DIY guides with easy access to things regarding electronics repair and creating generators obviously in order to keep the information on the device accessable, to things like creating a forging workship in the case of a lif-term situation where  civilization would have to be re-built for the most part. After all this, there would be at least 32GB of free space on it to keep as storage, since it will be a persistent environment rather than just a live-cd type that resets every boot.</p>

<p>It would come on a SSD that is military-grade waterproof and shockproof, come with a CD (or maybe mini-CD, still working out the pros/cons of this) to help older computers that are USB ports but aren&#39;t able to boot from them accessible. I&#39;m planning on the cost being $50-$100 more than what the SSD costs, and I think having a bootleable device with the entire text content of Wikipedia lone is worth this. Right now I usually use my computer through a SSD this way, so  Iknow the technology works.</p>

<p>Someone suggested it, but if I made a bunch of these, would anyone be interestd in buying one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>idea is ok but your concept of realising it lacks on several aspects. 
how would you index the drive? 
you would have to program an app that is easily searchable, for example &quot;dyi generator&quot; and files relating to this would show up, wiki articles, guides and so on. 
using a Linux native search function is not marketable you would need to create a software for this for you to be able to market it or anyone could do this themselves for free. </p>

<p>also a ssd alone is again, not really marketable. connect it to a raspberry pie, build a shockproof and more, shell for it. </p>

<p>so a completely self contained survival unit with your own software to easily and quickly navigate and search the contents. just would need a mouse and a display. 
even with this I&#39;d think you&#39;d have problems marketing it but I&#39;m sure some people would buy it if it&#39;s done this way. </p>

<p>again, just a hardrive full of files would be pretty hard to sell. </p>

<p>reading the comments here makes me wonder wtf is wrong with people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent a couple years doing information retrieval as career, so I&#39;m pretty sure I know what I&#39;m doing, and the idea is you plug in the SSD and it boots from it as a USB-drive, like Kali or Backtrack, except instead of being laid out with hacking or pentesting tools, it&#39;ll be set up a mediawiki server and have the search bar query that as well... You make it sound like its hard to do, but when I was in boarding highschool they shut off outside internet 11PM in the dorms, but I even in my teens I was able to set up a mediawiki server on the LAN (as well as other chat apps and such) and set up a data dump of wikipedia on it so it was just like going to en.wiki/xyz , but without the pictures, and in the case it&#39;d just be connecting to localhost:80/wiki/en/xyz for whatever. Of course, the end-user would just click the &quot;wiki&quot; icon or search for something in the search bar, and it would come up and render it, without them having to know whats going on in the back end.</p>

<p>I&#39;m obviously not going to give you everything I have done already in case you go out and try do steal it from me, but it seems like enough people are interested in a bootable USB-device that contains a brief summmery of human knowledge and survival guides. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who you think I am, but I&#39;ve been doing IR-related things for a majority of my tech career and trust me I I&#39;ve dealt with the ins and outs of copyright when it comes to scraping from ext sources for clients. </p>
