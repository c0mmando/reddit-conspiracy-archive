<p>Looking at the map, I see NK is in an interesting position, near China, SK, Russia...</p>

<p>So why would the US want the gen pop to believe NK is so dangerous?  Why would the US send over a missle defense system to the region?  Why is China not happy about that?</p>

<p>Is NK really a crazy state, like EVERYONE says, so easily, or is there a strategic propaganda play at hand?  It just feels forced to me, like we&#39;re being conditioned to believe NK is a danger to the world/US.</p>

<p>Sure it&#39;s easy to have more economic activity than North Korea.</p>

<p>THAAD isn&#39;t to protect S. Korea, it&#39;s to protect US interests and project a display of force in the Pacific. With any negotiation there are implied physical threats, it helps strengthen your position in getting what you want.  Having the missile system on China&#39;s doorstep pisses them off because it gives, at minimum the appearance, that their capabilities and strategic position aren&#39;t as strong as they were prior to THAAD being there.  It&#39;s the reason you get arms races- everyone wants the big-swinging dick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One time I looked into why anyone would be mad over a THAAD system being deployed. What I read is that China was upset because the system continuously tracked any air activity, or something to that effect. I would look into it more if you&#39;re interested, but basically it was viewed as a &quot;surveillance&quot; of Chinese air activity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Most people underestimate how incredibly difficult it is to shoot one missile down with another- all currently known systems have abysmal success rates and are of little real threat. Makes sense THAAD would be more of surveillance asset. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and the definition of THAAD - Terminal High Altitude Air Defense - is to shoot down missiles in transit, hence &quot;Terminal High Altitude&quot;</p>

<p>What are the US interests in that region?  Seems everyone there is trying to establish claim on ocean routes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, for sure more directed at China.  NK isn&#39;t a major player in any game, but they do make for a good boogeyman- i.e. excuse to put a weapons system near China.  </p>

<p>NK is losing a war of attrition and they know it.  They walk up to the line drawn in the sand hoping for the US to blink- that&#39;s their only shot to win back any concessions.  If the NK regime steps over that line they know it&#39;s over for them- very quickly; that said, it&#39;s over for them if they don&#39;t.  Question is do they collapse before doing something epically stupid?  </p>

<p>I think those in US military/intelligence actually want Kim Jong-Un to lose his shit- it just legitimizes what they want to do in the region.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the real question.  I&#39;d suspect most of it is indeed propaganda.  There&#39;s very little independently verifiable info outside of NK that points to exactly how that government is run, who is in charge, how strategic decisions are made, etc.  </p>

<p>Do I think he&#39;s an insane megalomaniac? No.  But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the dude Dennis Rodman says he is either.  In the end, what he is is the perfect political stooge for both Beijing and Washington.</p>
