    <div class="md"><p>I just posted this....</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s some scary shit...</p>

<p>according to that report the CIA have been able to remotely operate (some) cars for assassination since early 2010.</p>

<p>Michael Hastings the journalist who claimed he had a &#39;big story&#39; to break and was being surveilled by government, his friends and family were questioned by the FBI.</p>

<p>&quot; On the 17th, Hastings e-mailed colleagues at BuzzFeed to warn them that “the Feds are interviewing my ‘close friends and associates’ ”; he was “onto a big story” and needed to go “off the rada[r] for a bit … hope to see you all soon.”&quot;</p>

<p>“He was deeply agitated,” says The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur. Since Hastings didn’t want to say anything more over e-mail or the phone, Farwell, who lived in Virginia, set up a lunch for him the following Thursday with a trusted friend of Farwell’s, also in L.A., so that she could pass along whatever Hastings had to tell him on her forthcoming trip East.</p>

<p>&quot;The lunch never happened. At 4:20 a.m. on Tuesday, June 18, Hastings’s silver Mercedes C250 coupe, speeding south on Highland Avenue, crossed Melrose, jumped the median, hit a palm tree, and exploded. The charred body of the driver was identified by the Los Angeles coroner as John Doe 117 until fingerprints confirmed that the deceased was Michael Hastings.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say that this backs-up and further legitimizes Trump&#39;s accusations and contentions that he and his administration are being illegally eavesdropped on by or on behalf of his political enemies both before and even now long after the election with that information being just as illegally leaked to the NYT, WaPo, CNN, etc. as well as calling into serious question the whole  Clinton, Podesta and DNC&#39;s contentions that they or anyone else has any way to know with any real certainty if they were hacked by Russia or someone else altogether or not bearing in mind that anyone politically motivated within the CIA could do that just as easily to them as they could to Trump. </p>

<p>If the CIA can literally hack anyone and make it look like the Russians or anyone else is responsible then who&#39;s to say how legitimate any of the US government&#39;s previous claims and sabre rattling over the Chinese, Russian, or North Korean governments&#39; supposed cyber attacks against the US or any of its major corporations really were in order to give it far more leeway to respond to those countries as if they actually were responsible with the public thinking it was fully justified or that even more spending to defend against them also was necessary as a result. Essentially cyber false flags with very clear benefits for those who actually perpetrated them. </p>
