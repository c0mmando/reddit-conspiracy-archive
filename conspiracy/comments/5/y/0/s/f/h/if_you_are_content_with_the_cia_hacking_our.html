    <div class="md"><p>But this argument is not even valid. You don&#39;t want privacy only because you want to do bad things. The &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; idea suggests that the only possible scenario i would not the government spying on me was if i was up to something criminal, which is not the case, at all!!!</p>

<p>I want privacy because we live under a society and i have to refrain myself from certain behaviors while surrounded by other people to whom i share some sort of &quot;invisible social contract&quot;. 
What this basically means is that i want my own time and space to fart since i&#39;m not supposed to do it at the elevator. </p>

<p>Then, there&#39;s my info out there being (potentially) used by another person without my consent in ways i don&#39;t even dream of. </p>

<p>I mean, OK, they&#39;re the fucking government but hell they&#39;re people right? They&#39;re people just like ME. Who the fuck allowed these bastards to gather information about my shit? </p>

<p>They&#39;re just people man... And these people have access to everything other people do. </p>

<p>People have been so brainwashed that they&#39;ve turned so numb to their enviroment that once they hear &quot;CIA&quot; they just go blind and can&#39;t hear anything beyond those letters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have recently done some research on an effective response to the &quot;nothing to hide&quot; trope.  Here are my 4 main takeaways:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The rules can change in the future.</strong>  You may have &#39;nothing to hide&#39; right now, but what if things change and suddenly those critical comments you made about the government or a large multinational company become a punishable offense?  You may laugh at this possibility, but there are several precedents for exactly this type of behavior littered throughout history.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>The data could be wrong.</strong>  Imagine you visit your sick grandmother every day in a bad part of town.  An algorithm notices your behavior and labels you as a potential criminal or drug addict.  You begin to get hassled by the police who find some cannabis residue inside your car ashtray during a traffic stop.  You cool with this type of profiling, because it happens every single day.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data collection could become much more invasive.</strong>  If nobody bats an eye when all of their appliances are spying on them because &#39;they have nothing to hide&#39; would they be ok if companies started collecting data on their innermost thoughts and feelings?  This technology is rapidly coming to market, and we will cross this bridge at some point.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy is a deep psychological need like food, water, air and love.</strong>  When you use the restroom, you don&#39;t lock the door because you are up to some kind of criminal activity or &#39;have something to hide&#39; but because it&#39;s your natural right to experience private moments without someone constantly peering over your shoulder. Creative exploits, intimate moments between lovers, singing in the shower - it is your right to enjoy all of these pleasures without some device continually spying on you and saving all of this information for perpetuity.  </p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest reason to shun that narrative is the CIA is acting 100% as a Secret Government.  This secret government answer to no one and their prime purpose is money and power.</p>

<p>The CIA can affectively shut down and squash any and all social movements they think challenge their power, authority or affect their revenues.</p>

<p>Almost every American has that feeling things are rigged or know something isnt right and on the up and up.  The citizens right now are 100% powerless to challenge the government and 100% powerless to fight for social change.  As it stands now the only major changes must be approved by this secret government that wasnt elected.</p>

<p>There are plenty of times when people don&#39;t want to type out their actual feelings or opinion about something because they don&#39;t want to end up on &quot;a list&quot;. </p>

<p>Or they&#39;re worried about googling certain keywords because it&#39;d look bad, even though their intention is purely to learn. Or not wanting to click on any links that could seem suspicious if someone was observing their behavior.</p>

<p>The Chinese government is taking the first steps in an evolving plan to employ big data to establish a nationwide system of mass surveillance of the entire population. This “social-credit system” would mobilize technology to collect information on all citizens and use that information to rate their behavior, including financial creditworthiness and personal conduct. The local experiments have provoked mixed reactions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first full part of the series, &quot;Year Zero&quot;, comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA&#39;s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.</p>

<p>Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized &quot;zero day&quot; exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.</p>

<p>&quot;Year Zero&quot; introduces the scope and direction of the CIA&#39;s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of &quot;zero day&quot; weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple&#39;s iPhone, Google&#39;s Android and Microsoft&#39;s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Everywhere</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody who has entered Walmart has their face in a database with all of their information, emails, social networking and audio/phone recordings. Even reclusive drug dealers, if they have been in a Walmart, have their faces and all of their information stored in the super-computers at Walmart&#39;s security center in Jane, MO. Everybody (with the exception of women&#39;s miscarriages), is in the government&#39;s database. </p>

<p>While everybody believes this has been done to blackmail politicians, the biggest reason is that citizens of the U.S. (by means of their birth certificates) have been &quot;pledged&quot; to the Federal Reserve System by FDR (in 1933) to be used for forced labor when the federal government can no longer service the national debt, which is now at $20 trillion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congressman James Traficant opened the &quot;can of worms&quot; on this issue in an address he gave to Congress in 1993:</p>

<p>&quot;The Federal Reserve System is a sovereign power structure separate and distinct from the federal United States government. The Federal Reserve is a maritime lender, and/or maritime insurance underwriter to the federal United States operating exclusively under Admiralty/Maritime law. The lender or underwriter bears the risks, and the Maritime law compelling specific performance in paying the interest, or premiums are the same.</p>

<p><strong>Assets of the debtor can also be hypothecated (to pledge something as a security without taking possession of it.) as security by the lender or underwriter.</strong> The Federal Reserve Act stipulated that the interest on the debt was to be paid in gold. There was no stipulation in the Federal Reserve Act for ever paying the principle.</p>

<p>Prior to 1913, most Americans owned clear, allodial title to property, free and clear of any liens or mortgages until the Federal Reserve Act (1913) &quot;Hypothecated&quot; all property within the federal United States to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, in which the Trustees (stockholders) held legal title. The U.S. citizen (tenant, franchisee) was registered as a &quot;beneficiary&quot; of the trust <strong>via his/her birth certificate. In 1933, the federal United States hypothecated all of the present and future properties, assets and labor of their &quot;subjects,&quot;</strong> the 14th Amendment U.S. citizen, to the Federal Reserve System.</p>

<p>In return, the Federal Reserve System agreed to extend the federal United States corporation all the credit &quot;money substitute&quot; it needed. Like any other debtor, the federal United States government had to assign collateral and security to their creditors as a condition of the loan. <strong>Since the federal United States didn’t have any assets, they assigned the private property of their &quot;economic slaves&quot;, the U.S. citizens as collateral against the unpayable federal debt. They also pledged the unincorporated federal territories, national parks forests, birth certificates, and nonprofit organizations, as collateral against the federal debt. All has already been transferred as payment to the international bankers.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rest is from somebody else (and is utter bullshit).</p>

<p>I wonder who this was copied from? McFadden? Mullins?</p>

<p>I also found this, which supports your claim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That Traficant statement has also been debunked ...</p>

<p>The &#39;bankruptcy of the United States&quot; as alleged by &quot;congressman&quot; Traficant.
I have heard people discuss statements by &quot;congressman&quot; &gt;Traficant allegedly made back in 1993 where he stated in the &gt;Congressional Record that the US was bankrupt and this bankruptcy happened back in 1933. This statement has been used to support UCC arguments about the bankruptcy of the United States.</p>

<p>Frank F. checked the accuracy of this alleged Traficant statement and found it to be utterly false. Here is what he said in a recent e-mail:</p>

<p>This is 99% bogus.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that it claims to be from the Congressional Record of March 17, 1993, page H-1303, and a speech from Rep. James Traficant (D-Oh). It starts with a double quote mark and it ends much later with another double quote mark.</p>

<p>Except for the first paragraph (the first 66 words), it is a fake.
Traficant&#39;s own words run from &quot;Mr. Speaker ....&quot; to &quot; ... our demise&quot; and that&#39;s the only portion from him or from the Congressional Record. Trafficant was arguing against deficit spending, and everything else in the article (starting from the words &quot;It is an established fact ...&quot;) is fake. Traficant never said them.</p>

<p>In fact, if Traficant thought that the Banking Emergency Act of 1933 was Public Law 89-719, we&#39;d all have reason to doubt his soundness of mind, because the Public Law number is clearly decades after 1933 -- in fact it is the number of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966. Ditto for the pretended title and description of HJR 192 (of 1933). All of that, including the references to canon law and maritime insurance, is fakery, falsely attributed to Traficant. The actual page from the Congressional Record is here. Please excuse the copy quality of this PDF file as it was obtained from microfiche. This page proves that those who allege that Traficant made this statement are not telling the truth.</p>

<p>Please also notice that the fake Traficant statement makes certain allegations:</p>

<ol>
<li>&quot;The United States Federal Government has been dissolved by the Emergency banking Act, March 9, 1933&quot;;</li>
<li>That HJR 192 was a part of the bankruptcy;</li>
<li>That the 1913 Federal Reserve Act was effective back to 1870, many years before that act was adopted.</li>
</ol>

<p>These congressional acts have been posted on my site. The Emergency Banking Act and HJR 192 are posted, as is the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. Please read these acts to deteremine whether these allegations are true. Reading them discloses that the allegations are false. The password for the Emergency Banking Act and Federal Reserve Act is &quot;Becraft&quot; (with a capital &quot;B&quot;).</p>

<p>Seriously? Why don&#39;t you just call Walmart and ask them directly?</p>

<p>That&#39;s your right. But what I shared about Walmart is not some bullshit I read on the net. It&#39;s a fact, even if you don&#39;t believe it.</p>

<p>So, if what you are saying is that &quot;past and current&quot; employees would have come forward by now, then why hasn&#39;t  &quot;past or current&quot; employees come forward and said who was behind 9-11? Or, who was behind the murder of JFK? At the time Walmart was doing this, I was led to believe that it was because of 9-11. Walmart was doing its &quot;patriotic duty&quot; to prevent another attack. Maybe Walmart wasn&#39;t/isn&#39;t being malicious in helping the government. Maybe that&#39;s why there is no need for someone who knows about it to be a &quot;whistle-blower&quot;. As far as proving it, why don&#39;t you call Walmart and ask them? </p>

<p>So wait ... you are the one that came here and wrote that they were doing it (without any proof at all, like I&#39;m suppose to believe you #believeme) and now if I want to confirm what you say I need to call them ? And by doing a call they are going to confirm it ?? Does that mean that EVERYONE that works at wallmart knows about it ?</p>

<p>Also, what does 9-11 or JFK have to do with this ? It feels that I need to take your username seriously ... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what the drones are for. The federal government currently has millions of drones warehoused that were manufactured in the U.S. and in Israel. The government is not going to have the military pull up to your place to detain you (which was in the original plan of the Treasury Department; written in 1979). Instead, you will be visited by a drone that circles above your residence; calling you on your cell phone, and also announcing on a loud speaker for you to come out and to lie on the ground. Once you are &quot;secured&quot;, a vehicle will come to take you away. This will be done to prevent unnecessary deaths of the military.</p>

<p>When things are really bad, will there even be &quot;neighborhoods&quot;?</p>

<p>In any case, I agree with you. Americans need to hold on to their gun rights because once they take the guns it will be a &quot;replay&quot; of what Stalin and his henchmen did to the Christian farmers when Stalin took away everybody&#39;s guns in the Soviet Union. </p>

<p>We knew the tech was available and we guessed it was used for surveillance but many &quot;normies&quot; refuse to believe it&#39;s even a possibility.

<p>First, the obvious glaring problem here is that if you can&#39;t recognize your own faults or gaps in knowledge then you are arrogant and small minded.

<p>I&#39;ll rephrase that to &quot;First, the obvious glaring problem here is that if one cannot recognize their own faults or gaps in knowledge then they are arrogant and small minded.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because I claim that something that has been news for years has been news for years? Why don&#39;t you go look for yourself. All the info you think was released today was available prior to 3/7/2017.
Not my fault if you wait for wikileaks to spoonfeed you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK. So we knew(by knew I mean proof and not conjecture) that the CIA could remotely control car computers, had malware on iOS, android, routers, and could download, upload, and remotely execute any program they want? Or perhaps we had proof that they &quot;stole&quot; russian malware to misdirect attribution of cyber attacks? Like I said we have a good idea they could do many of these things but no actual proof other than coincidences for many things. One of the few things that went mainstream before this was the samsung smart TV&#39;s and windows OS basically spying on you.</p>

<p>Many things have happened that point towards foul play, such as convenient car crashes that occur to those who look to deep, or &quot;russian malware&quot; used to shutdown power to a town.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this doesn&#39;t apply to me and fuck of with it.</p>

<p>You conveniently ignored where I said:</p>

<p>It&#39;s revealed. <em>They say that we already knew this.</em> Both answers are just change stoppers.</p>

<p>Some people, who when written or spoken to, give off the vibe that I&#39;m talking to a brick wall and that there&#39;s no point arguing with them. Have a nice day.</p>

<p>Um. Yeah dude. First of all, there is malware such as keyloggers that jilted lovers can install onto your smartphone. If the average person has access to this, then yes, it&#39;s obvious the hacking community of the intelligence agency has access to this. </p>

<p>As for remotely seizing control of smartphone features?</p>

<p>Um. Have you never watched a spy movie in your life? The idea that one spy agency would steal technology from another spy agency? Or perhaps that they would, idk... commit a false flag? Yeah, we had no proof that the CIA committed false flags before, amirite?</p>

We knew the government monitored the fuck out of us. Snowden specifically leaked that the US IC monitors citizens through all the means leaked by Wikileaks. For example, we knew they could and would listen on phones they can access cameras on laptops and cell phones and pretty much listen in on anything with a mic or camera. </p>

<p>While I&#39;m not saying we should dismiss it, it&#39;s nice to have a refresher, I don&#39;t understand why everyone is acting like this is new news or something and they never heard in the slightest bit that the government is big on citizen surveillance. Like it&#39;s just weird that people&#39;s jaws are dropping and their head is spinning over shit we already knew. </p>

<p>Now anything else, such as specific programs and missions are different I guess, but the overall agenda of them wanting to maintain a surveillance state has been out there for a while now. It&#39;s fucked up and seems unconstitutional, but it&#39;s not new like people are making it seem just because WikiLeaks released more info.</p>

<p>So no, I won&#39;t normalize this, and I&#39;m confused at the amount of people on a conspiracy sub who are dismissive of information which opens itself up to providing proof for past and present conspiracies.</p>

<p>providing proof for past and present conspiracies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Point well taken. I guess for people like me, I wholeheartedly believed that the government was partaking in mass surveillance, and I thought the bulk of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> did too, so this kinda feels like a &quot;duh&quot; thing to me. But I guess I didn&#39;t take into consideration that it adds proof for some people who would have otherwise denied it. </p>

<p>Like I guess for me it just feels like old news and it just reinforces how I thought the government functions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I&#39;m really not trying to just normalize. I don&#39;t know how else to explain it, I just meant that exploits exist for essentially all devices. Exploits will always exist. If a user is savvy enough, they can control your computer, phone, wifi, tv, etc. This is very much the reality of the world we live in. </p>

<p>So in my mind I just don&#39;t understand why wouldn&#39;t they have these tools? All our enemies have them. All our allies have them. Joe Schmo down the street could have them if he&#39;s smart enough. </p>

<p>I will clarify though, if they are being used against the American people. Well obviously that needs to be checked. So sorry I hope that clarifies a little better what I was trying to say! </p>

Forced would be another thing - but i&#39;m not certain what forced kind of scenario we&#39;d be talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, true. Ultimately, they made a choice which was unethical. That&#39;s why your forgiveness is yours to either withhold or to give. I, for one, am not in any hurry to forgive!</p>

<p>That being said, there is still culpability on the part of the one doing the tempting. Seduction is still a thing, you know. And sometimes, weak people can be seduced into doing things that they don&#39;t really want to do. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why sex with children is illegal, and one has to be above a certain age, or else it&#39;s statutory rape. We all agree that children don&#39;t have the experience and wisdom to resist. Not only that, but in cases of statutory rape, the child is considered innocent, while the adult who seduces him/her is considered guilty of a crime. </p>

<p>This type of Omerta networks are driven from the top-down - not the bottom-up. There&#39;s a method behind the madness, which has been utilized for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.</p>

<p>I agree, those doing the entrapping deserve their blame for that - not meaning the poor slave that had to do the deed -  but those that forced such a situation.</p>

<p>I tend to see institutions like the CIA like a meth house. That place is too contaminated to go on. Just burn it down.</p>

I&#39;m still somewhat hopeful of finding a good, non-violent, way to help the people fighting, but so far all we can do is talk together on the internet (dependent on technology, and they have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5y13px/the_shills_are_in_full_force_on_4chan/">people</a> even trying to fuck that up) and hope that someone with power will do something to help the privacy of Americans and everyone else.

<p>The &quot;I&#39;m not bothered by it because I&#39;ve nothing to hide&quot; routine is premature.  As time passes and more things are discovered civil unrest will increase. That may translate into more restrictions on things and additional laws.<br/>
Something you do now may be illegal as time passes.  But by then its too late because you wanted to stay subserviant or maybe your &quot;so close to being able to afford that 2nd home&quot; that speaking out may compromise your goal.

<p>Except do you understand that there is a sizeable number of people who use &quot;national security&quot; and government to justify immoral acts that enrich themselves and their friends?  </p>

<p>I think we would all agree that if our &quot;national security apparatus&quot; were run by saints, then there would be no issue.  The problem is with that kind of power, there comes people who are willing to corrupt that power.</p>

<p>So knowing that, what kind of power do you allow your government to have?  That is the bigger question that this is all about.</p>

<p>So you are ok with intelligence agencies determining who is allowed to be elected into our government?  </p>

<p>What about them being able to manipulate the supreme court?  </p>

<p>What about if &quot;Mr Smith&quot; wants to go to Washington and do good for his country by exposing corruption, but intelligence can reveal all his darkest secrets?</p>

<p>These are all possible.</p>

<p>The point is that our government should neither be nor have the capability of spying on every individual wholesale.  If you think that it is a reasonable capability, then there really isn&#39;t any point in even having a discussion.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate Trump, but I do think he&#39;s a fucking moron. My line of business would&#39;ve benefited from either Clinton or Trump. I would&#39;ve preferred the former as I&#39;m not really into using the social safety net as a jizz rag, isolationism, and retarded fiscal policy. But, at the end of the day, it&#39;s a wash for me. </p>

<p>Well, why would they, if you have nothing to hide? If you&#39;re not a threat to national security, or whatever it is the CIA is trying to protect, what would be the point of the CIS accessing your phone, posting on your twitter, or taking control of your car?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Operation Northwoods was a proposed false flag operation against the Cuban government, that originated within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the United States government in 1962. The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or other U.S. government operatives to commit acts of terrorism against American civilians and military targets, blaming it on the Cuban government, and using it to justify a war against Cuba. The plans detailed in the document included the possible assassination of Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, hijacking planes, blowing up a U.S. ship, and orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities.[2] The proposals were rejected by the Kennedy administration.[3]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this. </p>

<p>I thought I was the only one massively confused as to why there is an overwhelming amount of people on r/conspiracy right now trying to act like this isn&#39;t the biggest leak of a violation of our civil rights in history. </p>

<p>Have they read the third paragraph of the press release?:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized &quot;zero day&quot; exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>They LOST CONTROL of their HACKING ARSENAL!!</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>This is like finding out that we lost a bunch of nukes. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>These are powerful cyber weapons, capable of not just creating a covert surveillance network and crashing cars and planes, but of shutting down power grids and sending us all back to the Stone Age in one instant.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>These weapons are currently in the hands of hackers around the world, black and white hat, and probably a few governments as well. And the CIA sat on it, instead of letting the device manufactures know to fix these vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>THIS IS A MAJOR FUCKING EMERGENCY!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find this sentiment interesting, because when Black people were saying that the CIA (and the FBI) were terrorizing them by various means (shoveling crack cocaine into their communities is up there among the worst CIA offences against them), people called <em>them</em> un-American and dismissed it all as whining and scapegoating. But now that the CIA has been shown to target everyone to some degree, <em>now</em> everyone is ready to revolt. </p>

<p>Can&#39;t wait for the leaks that show that Police officers are mostly gangbangers in uniform out to guarantee an arrest and conviction at any cost, even if it violates the 4th, 6th, and 13th amendments. Black people won&#39;t get credit for being the ones to point it out, but at least something might be done about it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a false narrative just because <em>you</em> weren&#39;t part of the group who was saying those things. Everything is not about you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it had less to do with race and more to do with people not believing the CIA/government would do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here you go dismissing everything as &quot;identity politics&quot; if it has anything to do with the color of someone&#39;s skin. The disbelief was a combination of race and how the media was constantly hammering negative imagery of Black people and convincing everyone that the reason the CIA/FBI were terrorizing them was because they deserved it <em>and</em> because people didn&#39;t want to believe that government agencies would come after them some day as long as they were better than those Blacks who were getting arrested everyday on tv.</p>

<p>As LBJ famously said,&quot;If you can convince the lowest white man he&#39;s better than the best colored man, he won&#39;t notice you&#39;re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he&#39;ll empty his pockets for you.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s just as true then as it was before he said that and as it is now. Don&#39;t you dare try to dismiss the obvious racial motives that were at play here. You&#39;re part of the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My life is pretty boring, and I have nothing to hide, but it&#39;s bothersome nonetheless that I no longer have a reasonable expectation of privacy (what constitution?).  I am also offended that I need to have my nutsack jiggled before I can fly to my parents house, that I have to show an ID for almost every transaction, and that my economic and on-line activities are tracked and data based.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily worry about that faceless entity we call &quot;the government&quot;, I am more concerned with the people who have access to the data.  We all know that people are horrible, and it&#39;s the thought that lots of cubicle-dwelling weirdos will have instant access to my life.</p>

<p>Your assessment is accurate, and terrifying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that this is a massive break of privacy if these tools were being used.</p>

<p>However in the spirit of discussion. How would you feel if they developed these capabilites but did not use them(lol). That they were developed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To use in times of actual all out cyber war between us and a rival super power (china/Russia).</p></li>
<li><p>In order to develop countermeasures.</p></li>
<li><p>To see what the practical limits of these types of attacks would be.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The United States has nuclear weapons but doesn&#39;t use them on its citizens, if this was developed with the same outcome in mind, but only used in a similar situation would you find that acceptable? Obviously it is difficult to tell if these were used as opposed to a nuke, but at least in theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I get it, the privacy of our citizens is important, NONE of us law-abiding citizens should be monitored by the government. I&#39;d go so far as to saying even criminals shouldn&#39;t be monitored unless a warrant is obtained. That is why I am glad that DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE IS ILLEGAL in our country. And I hope we never have a President like Bush again who will overstep legal boundaries to have the NSA spy on us like he did in 2005.</p>

<p>But if you are going to rally against the CIA and try to get rid of it, understand this. You have no idea how many American lives the CIA has saved with it&#39;s intelligence gather techniques. Has it killed with it too? I don&#39;t doubt it, but i&#39;d be willing to bet that the amount of American lives saved vs. the amount of Americans lives taken by the CIA would be somewhere in the 100:1 ratio.</p>

<p>And here&#39;s the other thing, if you don&#39;t think our enemies are using methods way more nefarious and intrusive against the US you know nothing about how this world works. Russia, China, Middle-Eastern Dictator countries have all done worse. And they would LOVE to get their hands on CIA methods, luckily for them Assange has allowed this to happen.</p>

<p>For the CIA haters I ask a simple question: What exactly do you want to happen to the CIA? For them to be disbanded and for us to have no Intelligence gathering abilities? Or maybe you want the CIA replaced with one that&#39;s all gumdrops and lollipops, that don&#39;t have such vast intelligence gathering methods. Maybe their techniques could be to just ask REALLY REALLY nicely, &quot;hey can you give us some intel on what your country is planning against us?&quot;</p>

<p>Understand this, today&#39;s wars are fought with information. The CIA&#39;s DUTY to the American People is to keep pace in this war and considering the strength, wealth, and intelligence of our nation I would expect them to be the BEST country in the world at intelligence gathering. Why would we expect any less of our country, who&#39;s responsibility it is to protect us. </p>

<p>Point well taken. I guess for people like me, I wholeheartedly believed that the government was partaking in mass surveillance, and I thought the bulk of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> did too, so this kinda feels like a &quot;duh&quot; thing to me.
