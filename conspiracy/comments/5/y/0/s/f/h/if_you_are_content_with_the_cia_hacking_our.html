       But this argument is not even valid. You don't want privacy only because you want to do bad things. The "I have nothing to hide" idea suggests that the only possible scenario i would not the government spying on me was if i was up to something criminal, which is not the case, at all!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       I want privacy because we live under a society and i have to refrain myself from certain behaviors while surrounded by other people to whom i share some sort of "invisible social contract". 
What this basically means is that i want my own time and space to fart since i'm not supposed to do it at the elevator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, there's my info out there being (potentially) used by another person without my consent in ways i don't even dream of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, OK, they're the fucking government but hell they're people right? They're people just like ME. Who the fuck allowed these bastards to gather information about my shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       They're just people man... And these people have access to everything other people do.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been so brainwashed that they've turned so numb to their enviroment that once they hear "CIA" they just go blind and can't hear anything beyond those letters.

       I have recently done some research on an effective response to the "nothing to hide" trope.  Here are my 4 main takeaways:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          The rules can change in the future.
         </strong>
         You may have 'nothing to hide' right now, but what if things change and suddenly those critical comments you made about the government or a large multinational company become a punishable offense?  You may laugh at this possibility, but there are several precedents for exactly this type of behavior littered throughout history.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          The data could be wrong.
         </strong>
         Imagine you visit your sick grandmother every day in a bad part of town.  An algorithm notices your behavior and labels you as a potential criminal or drug addict.  You begin to get hassled by the police who find some cannabis residue inside your car ashtray during a traffic stop.  You cool with this type of profiling, because it happens every single day.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Data collection could become much more invasive.
         </strong>
         If nobody bats an eye when all of their appliances are spying on them because 'they have nothing to hide' would they be ok if companies started collecting data on their innermost thoughts and feelings?  This technology is rapidly coming to market, and we will cross this bridge at some point.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Privacy is a deep psychological need like food, water, air and love.
         </strong>
         When you use the restroom, you don't lock the door because you are up to some kind of criminal activity or 'have something to hide' but because it's your natural right to experience private moments without someone constantly peering over your shoulder. Creative exploits, intimate moments between lovers, singing in the shower - it is your right to enjoy all of these pleasures without some device continually spying on you and saving all of this information for perpetuity.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       Absolutely. Anyone that disagrees, challenge them to always shit with the door wide open. I mean obviously nobody wants to watch them shit, but if they have nothing to hide then there isn't any reason to shit with the door closed, right?

       I try to take as many steps as possible: VPN on clearnet, tor on tails with bridges and no social media. I am aware that they still get a piece of me though. My gf, my friends, and family think i am paranoid. However, I just value my privacy.

       Not bad, but I'd axe #3 if I were you. Speculating about technology that captures "inner thoughts and feelings" will sound a bit woo woo to many folks, and besides, three points total is a compelling number.

       He's not talking about tech that can litteraly read your mind by scanning your brain or whatever.  He's saying that when you have a private conversation in your home and share your inner thoughts and feelings with your SO or your brother or whoever you share inner thoughts and feelings with your internet connected applices or your cell phone will record that conversation along with everything else you say.  All that data gets sent to the NSA to be filed nd analyzed.

       On point number 1, I find it a nice anecdote that some people added to the Hollywood blacklist of the 1940s and 1950s were added because they were anti-Nazi/Hitler before the U.S. intervened (i.e. some were blacklisted because they held a then-popular belief before it was approved)

        Privacy is a deep psychological need like food, water, air and love. When you use the restroom, you don't lock the door because you are up to some kind of criminal activity or 'have something to hide' but because it's your natural right to experience private moments without someone constantly peering over your shoulder. Creative exploits, intimate moments between lovers, singing in the shower - it is your right to enjoy all of these pleasures without some device continually spying on you and saving all of this information for perpetuity.

       The biggest reason to shun that narrative is the CIA is acting 100% as a Secret Government.  This secret government answer to no one and their prime purpose is money and power.

      <p>
       The CIA can affectively shut down and squash any and all social movements they think challenge their power, authority or affect their revenues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every American has that feeling things are rigged or know something isnt right and on the up and up.  The citizens right now are 100% powerless to challenge the government and 100% powerless to fight for social change.  As it stands now the only major changes must be approved by this secret government that wasnt elected.

       This! Just think of a tele-conference call and how you say one thing when the other party is listening &amp; then once the call is over suddenly everyone has a completely unrestricted discussion. Imagine life where you feel 'on call' 24/7!

       You can witness that kind of thing on Reddit sometimes as well and I always feel a little sad when I see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of times when people don't want to type out their actual feelings or opinion about something because they don't want to end up on "a list".
      </p>
      <p>
       Or they're worried about googling certain keywords because it'd look bad, even though their intention is purely to learn. Or not wanting to click on any links that could seem suspicious if someone was observing their behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that quite a few people say this kind of thing as a joke, but the only reason it's even a joke in the first place is because it's a real thing.

       I'm saving this. As soon as I heard about these leaks being released, I knew they'd be a very good subject to bring up I'm my Poli Sci class. Some people might have some small conjectures that I'd be able to explain and refute in my mind but not so much in words. Number 4 especially is one that puts the right if privacy into a very applicable context. Thank you very much for your writing.

        The data could be wrong. Imagine you visit your sick grandmother every day in a bad part of town. An algorithm notices your behavior and labels you as a potential criminal or drug addict. You begin to get hassled by the police, and suddenly it's impossible to get a mortgage to buy a house in upscale areas. You cool with this type of profiling? Because it happens every single day.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wait... So algorithms misidentify innocent people as criminals and cause them to be harassed by police and not able to get mortgage loans? We need to spread awareness of this...

        The Chinese government is taking the first steps in an evolving plan to employ big data to establish a nationwide system of mass surveillance of the entire population. This “social-credit system” would mobilize technology to collect information on all citizens and use that information to rate their behavior, including financial creditworthiness and personal conduct. The local experiments have provoked mixed reactions.

       Number 1. The Netherlands kept tabs on your religion when there was religious freedoms. In came the Germans, where being Jewish was verboten, and simply used the Crown's archives. Saved them a lot of trouble.

       I was talking to my friend on the way to the bus stop after college today and we were discussing this latest WL publication. One of them is on the way to being red pilled but not quite there yet as I have been getting him into these conspiracies. My other friend who had not heard about V7 until I told him about it today said those exact two phrases. It worries me. Stockholm syndrome is rampant these days.

       Everyone has something to hide even if it's nothing. If you close doors, password protect your phone, lock doors, whisper etc. you have something to hide. Privacy is more for personal peace of mind so who are they to discard that?

       I don't think the problem is with waking people up. Many people are fully aware that our government is totally corrupt. The problem is, what do we do about it? The whole "write your congressman" or "attend a city council meeting" advice is b/s. We need to actually DO SOMETHING. And then comes the problem of getting your fellow countrymen of lazy, complacent idiots to get off their ass and support the cause. Most Americans can be chin deep in shit before they'll admit to even smelling it.

       It would take hundreds of thousands of people. Storm the House and Senate with the goal of all new seat holders, every person in every major city protesting outside their city hall. I don't really know due to the fact that I'm just a dumb construction worker. But if someone has an awesome idea, for fucks sake throw it out there! I will follow with guns blazing

       There's a difference between what we assume to be true on the inside and what we can prove to people on the outside.  I know that some buildings were demolished on 9/11 but it would still be a big deal to me if someone published proof of some kind.

       The first full part of the series, "Year Zero", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Year Zero" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of "zero day" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.

       Are they deploying these tools within the US is my question.

       I'm sure every Samsung TV in Qatar is at risk but I'd be interested to see if they used this in the states as that would be an NSA issue I believe.

       Well we've already got the NSA spying on us. The CIA has no checks and balances, so it's safe to assume there are countless Americans being spied on by the NSA. Also I would recommend that you look into Michael Hashting's death.

      <p>
       If they have lost control of the arsenal and they are being circulated by non-government agents at this point, isn't it safe to assume that somebody is probably using them within the US at this point?

       Probably by everyone who has gotten their hands on it. The CIA is going to use the tools they've developed for themselves - to think they wouldn't is asinine.

       Why wouldn't the CIA use this on our own citizens as well as foreigners? Why would they even create such a tool if they didn't mean to use it for their benefit?

       Your question, "Are they deploying these tools within the us" is a little strange.  The tools are deployed. Period. It's everywhere, ESPECIALLY in the US.  And, this is done with no regard for any other intelligence agency no matter the level of redundancy.

       We're civilized. We've tried to do it through the electoral system several times, and they murder people, steal the election (Ron Paul primaries in 2012, Bernie 2016). We've tried protests (Iraq War protests under Bush, Tea Party, Occupy), and they subvert those.

       Isn't it amazing that we haven't just starting murdering these psychopaths? It says a lot about the character of the American people that we've constantly tried to do this in a civil, ethical manner.

       How can you revolt against people you never see or know who they are? The people in Congress aren't the same as the ones doing all this. They
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       pass a bill to revoke the agency's existence, but that wouldn't do anything except make them go completely dark. They would still exist and still have money (via drugs) to so what they please.

       If we revolted against Congress, with the clear aim of revolting against the CIA, Congress would take the job of splintering the CIA much more seriously.  It would only take a few deaths for them to become more afraid of
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       taking down the crime family.

       Yeah ive said this. CIA doesnt even need tax dollars anymore. They probably used it to get a foothold but now they own the entire worlds Heroine and Cocaine trade. They are no longer reliant on tax dollars for funding. Defunding them will just push them into much deeper levels of secrecy.

       Everybody who has entered Walmart has their face in a database with all of their information, emails, social networking and audio/phone recordings. Even reclusive drug dealers, if they have been in a Walmart, have their faces and all of their information stored in the super-computers at Walmart's security center in Jane, MO. Everybody (with the exception of women's miscarriages), is in the government's database.
      </p>
      <p>
       While everybody believes this has been done to blackmail politicians, the biggest reason is that citizens of the U.S. (by means of their birth certificates) have been "pledged" to the Federal Reserve System by FDR (in 1933) to be used for forced labor when the federal government can no longer service the national debt, which is now at $20 trillion.

       Yes. And, now doctors offices are required to get photo's of every patient. My doctor recently told me "there is no more 'doctor/patient' confidentiality. Nothing is private; everything is open to the government".

       Of course it does. That way they can spy in us and pass the information to our agencies. With the US agencies not actually sifting through the data they can keep the illusion they aren't breaking the law. Thank you Israel and American patriot agencies.

       Congressman James Traficant opened the "can of worms" on this issue in an address he gave to Congress in 1993:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Federal Reserve System is a sovereign power structure separate and distinct from the federal United States government. The Federal Reserve is a maritime lender, and/or maritime insurance underwriter to the federal United States operating exclusively under Admiralty/Maritime law. The lender or underwriter bears the risks, and the Maritime law compelling specific performance in paying the interest, or premiums are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Assets of the debtor can also be hypothecated (to pledge something as a security without taking possession of it.) as security by the lender or underwriter.
       </strong>
       The Federal Reserve Act stipulated that the interest on the debt was to be paid in gold. There was no stipulation in the Federal Reserve Act for ever paying the principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to 1913, most Americans owned clear, allodial title to property, free and clear of any liens or mortgages until the Federal Reserve Act (1913) "Hypothecated" all property within the federal United States to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, in which the Trustees (stockholders) held legal title. The U.S. citizen (tenant, franchisee) was registered as a "beneficiary" of the trust
       <strong>
        via his/her birth certificate. In 1933, the federal United States hypothecated all of the present and future properties, assets and labor of their "subjects,"
       </strong>
       the 14th Amendment U.S. citizen, to the Federal Reserve System.
      </p>
      <p>
       In return, the Federal Reserve System agreed to extend the federal United States corporation all the credit "money substitute" it needed. Like any other debtor, the federal United States government had to assign collateral and security to their creditors as a condition of the loan.
       <strong>
        Since the federal United States didn’t have any assets, they assigned the private property of their "economic slaves", the U.S. citizens as collateral against the unpayable federal debt. They also pledged the unincorporated federal territories, national parks forests, birth certificates, and nonprofit organizations, as collateral against the federal debt. All has already been transferred as payment to the international bankers.
       </strong>

       I was curious and tried looking into this a few years ago but couldn't find anything, is there a source for an official government document stating emphatically that the operation of the Federal Reserve System is subject to  admiralty/maritime law?

       Thanks for the link, I read through 73-1 and couldn't find any reference to admiralty/maritime law, I also checked 73-10 which seems to be heavily referenced on the internet and couldn't find any reference therein. I'm not a lawyer or jurist so it's probably something I'm missing.

       A redditor just opened my eyes that the Traficant speech is a fraud. It's all bullshit. I got this speech from Ron Paul supporters, and I am quite puzzled right now because they usually are pretty straight forward people. I am sorry I have wasted everybody's time. I need to stick to gardening.

       I had never heard of this and am not American so the Constitution and law parts weren't familiar to me. But "the US govt had no assets" is so obviously wrong that I had to question the whole thing. I mean, a single building, for example the white house, is an asset.

       I wonder who this was copied from? McFadden? Mullins?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also found this, which supports your claim:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That Traficant statement has also been debunked ...
       </p>
       <p>
        The 'bankruptcy of the United States" as alleged by "congressman" Traficant.
I have heard people discuss statements by "congressman" &gt;Traficant allegedly made back in 1993 where he stated in the &gt;Congressional Record that the US was bankrupt and this bankruptcy happened back in 1933. This statement has been used to support UCC arguments about the bankruptcy of the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        Frank F. checked the accuracy of this alleged Traficant statement and found it to be utterly false. Here is what he said in a recent e-mail:
       </p>
       <p>
        This is 99% bogus.
       </p>
       <p>
        You'll notice that it claims to be from the Congressional Record of March 17, 1993, page H-1303, and a speech from Rep. James Traficant (D-Oh). It starts with a double quote mark and it ends much later with another double quote mark.
       </p>
       <p>
        Except for the first paragraph (the first 66 words), it is a fake.
Traficant's own words run from "Mr. Speaker ...." to " ... our demise" and that's the only portion from him or from the Congressional Record. Trafficant was arguing against deficit spending, and everything else in the article (starting from the words "It is an established fact ...") is fake. Traficant never said them.
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, if Traficant thought that the Banking Emergency Act of 1933 was Public Law 89-719, we'd all have reason to doubt his soundness of mind, because the Public Law number is clearly decades after 1933 -- in fact it is the number of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966. Ditto for the pretended title and description of HJR 192 (of 1933). All of that, including the references to canon law and maritime insurance, is fakery, falsely attributed to Traficant. The actual page from the Congressional Record is here. Please excuse the copy quality of this PDF file as it was obtained from microfiche. This page proves that those who allege that Traficant made this statement are not telling the truth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Please also notice that the fake Traficant statement makes certain allegations:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         "The United States Federal Government has been dissolved by the Emergency banking Act, March 9, 1933";
        </li>
        <li>
         That HJR 192 was a part of the bankruptcy;
        </li>
        <li>
         That the 1913 Federal Reserve Act was effective back to 1870, many years before that act was adopted.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        These congressional acts have been posted on my site. The Emergency Banking Act and HJR 192 are posted, as is the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. Please read these acts to deteremine whether these allegations are true. Reading them discloses that the allegations are false. The password for the Emergency Banking Act and Federal Reserve Act is "Becraft" (with a capital "B").

       If it's a fact, prove it. Walmart is a big company with lots of past and current employees, shouldn't be too hard. Show other sources instead of what you've heard someone say.
Or you can start by explaining how they do it. Who does the facial recognition ? How do they match the face with name and address ? What if I don't go to Walmart, does it mean I'm good ?

      <p>
       So, if what you are saying is that "past and current" employees would have come forward by now, then why hasn't  "past or current" employees come forward and said who was behind 9-11? Or, who was behind the murder of JFK? At the time Walmart was doing this, I was led to believe that it was because of 9-11. Walmart was doing its "patriotic duty" to prevent another attack. Maybe Walmart wasn't/isn't being malicious in helping the government. Maybe that's why there is no need for someone who knows about it to be a "whistle-blower". As far as proving it, why don't you call Walmart and ask them?

       You said it's a fact and it's not because you can't prove it. So it's just a "someone told me" which is useless and most likely false specially when you can't answer basic questions about it.

       It's a fact to me because it was substantiated by another person who worked at Walmart, and my wife is a witness. So, it's what I think that matters. As far as I'm concerned, unless I hear it first hand, or see it first hand, it is all either a lie or a speculation. If you don't believe me that's fine, but you don't have to be such a mouthy prick.

       That's what the drones are for. The federal government currently has millions of drones warehoused that were manufactured in the U.S. and in Israel. The government is not going to have the military pull up to your place to detain you (which was in the original plan of the Treasury Department; written in 1979). Instead, you will be visited by a drone that circles above your residence; calling you on your cell phone, and also announcing on a loud speaker for you to come out and to lie on the ground. Once you are "secured", a vehicle will come to take you away. This will be done to prevent unnecessary deaths of the military.

       When things are really bad, will there even be "neighborhoods"?

       In any case, I agree with you. Americans need to hold on to their gun rights because once they take the guns it will be a "replay" of what Stalin and his henchmen did to the Christian farmers when Stalin took away everybody's guns in the Soviet Union.

       You don't have proof now. You have a source that you trust and you count that as proof. But for all you know, all the documents could be fake. I'm not saying they are- but my point is, this is only "proof" because you consider wikileaks reputable.

       We knew the tech was available and we guessed it was used for surveillance but many "normies" refuse to believe it's even a possibility. Most people who already "knew" frequent conspiracy forums. Wikileaks is far more widely known about and many have at least heard of them. It's not some random conspiracy forum with regular people spouting conjecture.

       You're trying to argue that everyone "knew" the CIA could cause car crashes on specific people if they so wished. Many people on this sub do know that, but many of your average Joe's wouldn't even consider the possibility.

       But yes, my agenda. My agenda is to point out that the function of this release looks exactly how a limited hangout would look.

      <p>
       But sure, focus on my account age. Because we all know that's more important than the content of what I'm saying.

       First, the obvious glaring problem here is that if you can't recognize your own faults or gaps in knowledge then you are arrogant and small minded. People don't grow without working on their flaws. The second glaring problem is that plenty of people guessed they were doing this but they didn't have proof. Here's the proof in vault 7. It's being downplayed. If people are getting paid to downplay this, they need to realize that this affects the entire world and the planet could very well turn into one of the worse dystopian novels within their lifetimes. We're already headed there.

       OK. So we knew(by knew I mean proof and not conjecture) that the CIA could remotely control car computers, had malware on iOS, android, routers, and could download, upload, and remotely execute any program they want? Or perhaps we had proof that they "stole" russian malware to misdirect attribution of cyber attacks? Like I said we have a good idea they could do many of these things but no actual proof other than coincidences for many things. One of the few things that went mainstream before this was the samsung smart TV's and windows OS basically spying on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many things have happened that point towards foul play, such as convenient car crashes that occur to those who look to deep, or "russian malware" used to shutdown power to a town.

      </p>
      <p>
       I then found it entirely reasonable to conclude that the groups with the highest technology available estimated to be 10+ years ahead of what is publicly known.

       I then listened to many different sources including whistleblowers claiming said tech was being deployed.

       I personally don't think anything will come out of this at a societal level or anything. Everyone is going to keep buying these devices while the government keeps listening and we will eventually get to a place where you can get placed on a watchlist for private conversations in your own home under the guise of national security.

       Exactly.   We had no sources so when statements like "you know your TV/ALEXA/iPhone/android/car is spying on you, right?" It was just an educated guess with some circumstantial evidence that garnered a "nice tinfoil hat ya got there"

       I'm not saying "so what" I think it's fucked up to the highest degree. But all of this was out there already. We knew the government monitored the fuck out of us. Snowden specifically leaked that the US IC monitors citizens through all the means leaked by Wikileaks. For example, we knew they could and would listen on phones they can access cameras on laptops and cell phones and pretty much listen in on anything with a mic or camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm not saying we should dismiss it, it's nice to have a refresher, I don't understand why everyone is acting like this is new news or something and they never heard in the slightest bit that the government is big on citizen surveillance. Like it's just weird that people's jaws are dropping and their head is spinning over shit we already knew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now anything else, such as specific programs and missions are different I guess, but the overall agenda of them wanting to maintain a surveillance state has been out there for a while now. It's fucked up and seems unconstitutional, but it's not new like people are making it seem just because WikiLeaks released more info.

       Well I suppose the point is that we now know the specifics - so yes instead of one overarching "The Government is Watching Us." claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can now say things like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/r7a2bXo.png">
         "Encryption" of certain apps is bullshit
        </a>

        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/exEpsg8.png">
         Hastings was most certainly "beta testing"
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/23A4Ooa.png">
         The CIA has lost control of these powers "we all knew about."

      </ul>
      <p>
       That last point is probably them most interesting and one that would disturb a great number of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, I won't normalize this, and I'm confused at the amount of people on a conspiracy sub who are dismissive of information which opens itself up to providing proof for past and present conspiracies.

       Point well taken. I guess for people like me, I wholeheartedly believed that the government was partaking in mass surveillance, and I thought the bulk of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       did too, so this kinda feels like a "duh" thing to me. But I guess I didn't take into consideration that it adds proof for some people who would have otherwise denied it.

       Like I guess for me it just feels like old news and it just reinforces how I thought the government functions.

       When the cops finally find DNA evidence years later on the perp they suspected all along do they just say, "Big deal we

       he did it." and just walk away?

       Well, in some cases DNA has overturned convictions and you've had cops who won't admit they were wrong and on some cases will even say that they believed that person was dangerous and it's okay that they were off the streets, even if it wasn't for that crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some cases, individuals are just so set in their ways that they'd never admit they were wrong. Doesn't matter if their actions fucked up a bunch of lives for years.

       You've somehow turned an analogy effectively saying, "When one is presented evidence of wrongdoing, should one ignore said wrongdoing because of previously held suspicions?" into a defense of the current of state of affairs concerning the leaks because cops fuck things up.

       Just pointing out that in your analogy, many times it's a judge who makes a decision based on DNA and many police officers don't agree with it when asked years later.

       Sorry, I'm really not trying to just normalize. I don't know how else to explain it, I just meant that exploits exist for essentially all devices. Exploits will always exist. If a user is savvy enough, they can control your computer, phone, wifi, tv, etc. This is very much the reality of the world we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in my mind I just don't understand why wouldn't they have these tools? All our enemies have them. All our allies have them. Joe Schmo down the street could have them if he's smart enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will clarify though, if they are being used against the American people. Well obviously that needs to be checked. So sorry I hope that clarifies a little better what I was trying to say!

       I cant stand that phrase, it happens all the time, for years you tell these people about something, and the deny it.  Then it's revealed, and they act high and mighty, furthermore, it then leaves them in the position of 'no change necessary' - no, because if the people saying it was happening had started a fucking rebellion, they'd slander and castrate us.  Now that we have the evidence to back it up, they won't support the rebellion because 'so what, we already knew that'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something needs be done, but no matter how right we are, the masses are fucking cowards, and will ultimately leave us to die for protecting their rights, because they are afraid.   It's a lose-lose.  Do nothing, it continues - do something, and everyone except the few will hate you while you rot in jail or are dead.  There is literally nothing you can do.  Nothing.

       Revolutions have happened before, so don't be so pessimistic. You're starting to sound like one of those despair shills. The ones they undoubtedlly employ to instill a sens of hopelessness into conversations about this. And inb4 revolutions are pointless because they get power back every time... At least you clear out a lot of deadwood and put them back decades in terms of their influence.

       It's just that this was hyped up so much that this reveal wasn't that big. I think most people were expecting some earth shattering reveal. Something that would get people to a near revolution. Something that would make Jake tapper blow his brains out on live TV. Something that would make the country stop and reflect about things in such a way that massive change would take place at the highest levels. This will be barely in the news for two days and forgotten about. I'm done with WikiLeaks. The hype never matches the follow through.

       I was reading about the Federalist papers and the Bill of Rights this morning. I see now the American experiment has failed. The Republic is off to the way of the Greeks and the Romans.

       Look around the world.  We
       <em>
        got
       </em>
       a huge badass traditional empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       It ended where it usually does.  When people get it in their heads that
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are the true king, the one who was all along deserving of empire... people suffer, because emperors are a stupid idea born of madness.

       This is taking things to a whole new level. The CIA is not the NSA, and the CIA is by law forbidden to operate within the USA (unless as a detachment to a domestic Federal LE agency). Kiss that goodbye.

       Remember too that most of them were probably lured into compromising situations which are used to extort loyalty from them. I don't doubt that many on the inside are "loyal" because of fear, nor that they resent it.

       I know that many in the system are held in check by "insurance files", but as for the scenarios in which they are lured i am struggling to imagine one in which they didn't ultimately make a choice that was unethical, baited or not. Forced would be another thing - but i'm not certain what forced kind of scenario we'd be talking about.

       Okay, true. Ultimately, they made a choice which was unethical. That's why your forgiveness is yours to either withhold or to give. I, for one, am not in any hurry to forgive!
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there is still culpability on the part of the one doing the tempting. Seduction is still a thing, you know. And sometimes, weak people can be seduced into doing things that they don't really want to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why sex with children is illegal, and one has to be above a certain age, or else it's statutory rape. We all agree that children don't have the experience and wisdom to resist. Not only that, but in cases of statutory rape, the child is considered innocent, while the adult who seduces him/her is considered guilty of a crime.

       This type of Omerta networks are driven from the top-down - not the bottom-up. There's a method behind the madness, which has been utilized for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

       I agree, those doing the entrapping deserve their blame for that - not meaning the poor slave that had to do the deed -  but those that forced such a situation.

       The government is just a front for the establishment. They will never make a change for the good if it conflicts against the powers that bes' wishes. Why do you think lobbying is legal. It's just legal bribery. If they can't bribe them the data collection allows them to blackmail. Everyone has stuff they don't want public.

       i think shills are trying to create the illusion that the majority doesn't care. really, i think people care but the problem feels too big to solve so there's probably some amount of cognitive dissonance going on.

They can use it on anyone.

       My thoughts, "Holy shit, fuck this. But what can I do about it? Stop using technology?" My life, like many others', has a great deal of dependence on technology and these leaks make me feel like I've been drug under 30 feet of water and chained to the ground. I'm still somewhat hopeful of finding a good, non-violent, way to help the people fighting, but so far all we can do is talk together on the internet (dependent on technology, and they have
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5y13px/the_shills_are_in_full_force_on_4chan/">
        people
       </a>
       even trying to fuck that up) and hope that someone with power will do something to help the privacy of Americans and everyone else. Hands are tied is the general feeling of everyone I talked to that is legitimately upset by this.

       Its an invasion of privacy. The excuse of it being for the better good has a lot to do with the same people doing very bad things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "I'm not bothered by it because I've nothing to hide" routine is premature.  As time passes and more things are discovered civil unrest will increase. That may translate into more restrictions on things and additional laws.
       <br/>
       Something you do now may be illegal as time passes.  But by then its too late because you wanted to stay subserviant or maybe your "so close to being able to afford that 2nd home" that speaking out may compromise your goal.  Conditioning takes time and as time passes we become more like prisoners to our circumstance. 
 We are at the time where we recognize somthing is wrong. I urge you to look at the path we are on and all of the hidden shadowy corrupt things that have gotten us to this point.

       I wouldn't say it was "known", but i'm not surprised. The CIA has conducted a lot of known unethical human experimentation in the past. Certainly there isn't much else it could do worse than that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, if the CIA hasn't been dismantled because it intentionally injected african americans with syphillis, why the fuck would it be dismantled for this?

       Neither the CIA nor NSA can collect intelligence on U.S. citizens without a FISA warrant. As of 2015, the NSA can't even do bulk collection. I am 100% okay with our intelligence agencies using any means possible to collect on foreign targets. I am 100% not okay with folks like y'all getting your pom-poms out for leaks that benefit foreign targets of collection.

       The point is that our government should neither be nor have the capability of spying on every individual wholesale.  If you think that it is a reasonable capability, then there really isn't any point in even having a discussion.

       I don't hate Trump, but I do think he's a fucking moron. My line of business would've benefited from either Clinton or Trump. I would've preferred the former as I'm not really into using the social safety net as a jizz rag, isolationism, and retarded fiscal policy. But, at the end of the day, it's a wash for me.

       They won't waste their time watching you unless you're an attractive young woman. Instead they'll be indexing your preferences to use against you at a later date if possible, and any private companies who collect the data will be selling it to advertisers who will invest a lot of money into figuring out how they can use it to manipulate you down the line.

       CIA is rogue, always has been.

       My question to you, un-American hero, how do you stop a deep seated rogue entity that controls everything from behind the shadows?
      </p>
      <p>
       Rise up? Revolt? That'd take too much coordination, the average person isn't about to potentially lose their house/career over a small chance at stopping this entity they may not believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, help with solutions to the problem like organizing people or get fucked and stop pandering.

       Well, why would they, if you have nothing to hide? If you're not a threat to national security, or whatever it is the CIA is trying to protect, what would be the point of the CIS accessing your phone, posting on your twitter, or taking control of your car?

       You are assuming that all the CIA does is legal. If someone (Michael Hastings, etc) find out what they were doing is not legal then the CIA would have a reason. The people deserve to know if the government is trying to gain absolute power over the people.

       Operation Northwoods was a proposed false flag operation against the Cuban government, that originated within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the United States government in 1962. The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or other U.S. government operatives to commit acts of terrorism against American civilians and military targets, blaming it on the Cuban government, and using it to justify a war against Cuba. The plans detailed in the document included the possible assassination of Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, hijacking planes, blowing up a U.S. ship, and orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities.[2] The proposals were rejected by the Kennedy administration.[3]

       Thank you for posting this.

       I thought I was the only one massively confused as to why there is an overwhelming amount of people on r/conspiracy right now trying to act like this isn't the biggest leak of a violation of our civil rights in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have they read the third paragraph of the press release?:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       They LOST CONTROL of their HACKING ARSENAL!!
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like finding out that we lost a bunch of nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       These are powerful cyber weapons, capable of not just creating a covert surveillance network and crashing cars and planes, but of shutting down power grids and sending us all back to the Stone Age in one instant.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       These weapons are currently in the hands of hackers around the world, black and white hat, and probably a few governments as well. And the CIA sat on it, instead of letting the device manufactures know to fix these vulnerabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;

      <p>

       I find this sentiment interesting, because when Black people were saying that the CIA (and the FBI) were terrorizing them by various means (shoveling crack cocaine into their communities is up there among the worst CIA offences against them), people called
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       un-American and dismissed it all as whining and scapegoating. But now that the CIA has been shown to target everyone to some degree,
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       everyone is ready to revolt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't wait for the leaks that show that Police officers are mostly gangbangers in uniform out to guarantee an arrest and conviction at any cost, even if it violates the 4th, 6th, and 13th amendments. Black people won't get credit for being the ones to point it out, but at least something might be done about it.

       I never said anything like that about black people. In fact when I found out what was going on I was as disgusted as I am now, if not more so. Seems like a false narrative. I think it had less to do with race and more to do with people not believing the CIA/government would do this.

       It's not a false narrative just because
       <em>

       weren't part of the group who was saying those things. Everything is not about you.

      <p>
       Here you go dismissing everything as "identity politics" if it has anything to do with the color of someone's skin. The disbelief was a combination of race and how the media was constantly hammering negative imagery of Black people and convincing everyone that the reason the CIA/FBI were terrorizing them was because they deserved it
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       because people didn't want to believe that government agencies would come after them some day as long as they were better than those Blacks who were getting arrested everyday on tv.
      </p>
      <p>
       As LBJ famously said,"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just as true then as it was before he said that and as it is now. Don't you dare try to dismiss the obvious racial motives that were at play here. You're part of the problem.

       Wah wah wah. Don't I dare? Lmao. Maybe the media played the race card but let's be honest, it had way more to do with people just not believing the CIA would do this. You want to get all butt hurt and indignant and scream "race" go ahead, but I'm not interested in your faux outrage.

       Actually its the other way around. A citizen is is a fictional character in the governments role of rulership. The correct definition is "One of the people" Not American, and not citizen unless you want to exchange benefits and villages for rights and freedoms. Something you do when you become a citizen of a state. People are sovereign, not subject to any state or insitution.

        A similar unit targets Google's Android which is used to run the majority of the world's smart phones (~85%) including Samsung, HTC and Sony. 1.15 billion Android powered phones were sold last year. "Year Zero" shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24 "weaponized" Android "zero days" which it has developed itself and obtained from GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors.These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the "smart" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied.

       Hey govt, stop using OUR taxdollars to fucking spy on us. I'm not sure if that would work. I get the premise of the site you linked, but we're not dealing with a fast food restaurant here. We're dealing with a corrupt govt.

       This is one of those things that people dont want to accept no matter how its put to them. The fact of the matter is everything that is being done, is our fault. we allow it to continue by our consent. If you really want this to stop you will stop assuming the role of a tax payer, you will stop paying money to government for any service it provides, and you will stop spreading their talking points. Divestment works. It's working with Israel, and it will work for government just as well.
This country (U.S) operates by consent of the governed. Stop consenting.

       correction - Zionist Jews had JFK killed when he tried to audit the Federal Reserve and inspect the nuclear site in Dimona. Zionist Jews run the media and world finance and through that control opinion and buy all parts of our government. It's been a plan in the making for hundreds of years but their complete control is post WW2, please don't confuse this.

       Except, this is dishonest outrage.  I'd love for conservatives to hate authoritarian privacy invasion.  Where is your outrage at the Patriot Act?  Are you okay with the NSA doing it?  All of the spying was authorized after 9/11 on the GOP's watch.  (Yes Obama ramped it up too).  But you have to admit, it's hysterical that it's just the CIA.  So intellectually dishonest.  You guys are so funny.  Why does the GOP hate the agency responsible for investigating Trump's Russia connections?  Gee, I wonder....

       Everything being done in Washington is to score bullshit political points or line their pockets.  The new "awakening" is really a bunch of zombies driven by the latest fad in Washington.  I do not see anyone making an honest criticism of the entire spectrum of the hacking that is taking place, only playing partisan politics.

       There are laws in America.  They went beyond the law. If you are in trouble because of this, then lawyer up. I don't think the CIA thought this through and I'm glad they are being exposed.The CIA looks pretty dumb at this point.

       If they are actively using against American citizens - my reaction would be a 180. If this is proof they have the equivalent of cyber-WMDs in their arsenal and use/don't use them responsibly - then my reaction is more measured. Is that hard to understand?

       My life is pretty boring, and I have nothing to hide, but it's bothersome nonetheless that I no longer have a reasonable expectation of privacy (what constitution?).  I am also offended that I need to have my nutsack jiggled before I can fly to my parents house, that I have to show an ID for almost every transaction, and that my economic and on-line activities are tracked and data based.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't necessarily worry about that faceless entity we call "the government", I am more concerned with the people who have access to the data.  We all know that people are horrible, and it's the thought that lots of cubicle-dwelling weirdos will have instant access to my life.

       I'm not concerned about the information that was leaked. I know I should be though. I just have so much going on I can't worry about it. Besides that, I don't know what I can do to stop it. I mean, even if we manage to get the CIA to say they won't do it, what's stopping them? So friends, help me be concerned and active and tell me what can I do.

       The United States has nuclear weapons but doesn't use them on its citizens, if this was developed with the same outcome in mind, but only used in a similar situation would you find that acceptable? Obviously it is difficult to tell if these were used as opposed to a nuke, but at least in theory.

       I don't disagree with this post at all, however; we still buy smart phones and smart tvs.  This isn't a new concept.  There's been a piece of ductape on my laptop's webcam since 2011.  Bitch about it all you want, but until you're truely ready to dump technology, it means absolutely nothing to complain about it.  Read the fine print.  They disclose all of this to us.

       Well I mean the solution is get rid of all your electronics and new cars. Weird to call someone un-american if they can't do that. Not trying to troll you but was looking for legit answers from such a strongly worded title to a post.

       The solution is not to get rid of electronics and new cars. If the CIA wasn't a bunch of psychopathic fucks we wouldn't have this problem. We have to rise up and tell them we're not playing their game. Which will be extremely difficult. Surrendering is not the answer. The government can't just violate our 4th amendment. That's like if the CIA said they were going to search your house without a warrant, YOUR solution would be to let them in your house? I have a feeling if you own guns you'd be the first to give them up.

       I predict this will be used for much more sinister purposes in the future. I truly think we're heading toward an Orwellian state. I think this mass surveillance will be used to target those that are against the govt. I'm sure many of us here are already on a list. There is absolutely no need for a mass surveillance state, especially when I believe that the war on terror is a hoax.

       The good thing is that so far it doesn't look like tech companies are willingly give out the info.

       The bad thing is that the government has more resources than most tech companies and can walk past security implementations with out setting off any red flags.

       Everyone's against spying ... until Wikileaks publishes leaks on HRC etc., I mean isn't the word on the street saying that it was the FBI/NSA/ABCDEFG agency that was fed up with all her corruption that they weren't supposed to know. So for the first time I thought, thank goodness they were spying.

       Look, I get it, the privacy of our citizens is important, NONE of us law-abiding citizens should be monitored by the government. I'd go so far as to saying even criminals shouldn't be monitored unless a warrant is obtained. That is why I am glad that DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE IS ILLEGAL in our country. And I hope we never have a President like Bush again who will overstep legal boundaries to have the NSA spy on us like he did in 2005.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you are going to rally against the CIA and try to get rid of it, understand this. You have no idea how many American lives the CIA has saved with it's intelligence gather techniques. Has it killed with it too? I don't doubt it, but i'd be willing to bet that the amount of American lives saved vs. the amount of Americans lives taken by the CIA would be somewhere in the 100:1 ratio.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here's the other thing, if you don't think our enemies are using methods way more nefarious and intrusive against the US you know nothing about how this world works. Russia, China, Middle-Eastern Dictator countries have all done worse. And they would LOVE to get their hands on CIA methods, luckily for them Assange has allowed this to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the CIA haters I ask a simple question: What exactly do you want to happen to the CIA? For them to be disbanded and for us to have no Intelligence gathering abilities? Or maybe you want the CIA replaced with one that's all gumdrops and lollipops, that don't have such vast intelligence gathering methods. Maybe their techniques could be to just ask REALLY REALLY nicely, "hey can you give us some intel on what your country is planning against us?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand this, today's wars are fought with information. The CIA's DUTY to the American People is to keep pace in this war and considering the strength, wealth, and intelligence of our nation I would expect them to be the BEST country in the world at intelligence gathering. Why would we expect any less of our country, who's responsibility it is to protect us.

       Point well taken. I guess for people like me, I wholeheartedly believed that the government was partaking in mass surveillance, and I thought the bulk of

       Well, in some cases DNA has overturned convictions and you've had cops who won't admit they were wrong and on some cases will even say that they believed that person was dangerous and it's okay that they were off the streets, even if it wasn't for that crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some cases, individuals are just so set in their ways that they'd never admit they were wrong. Doesn't matter if their actions fucked up a bunch of lives for years.

       I predict this will be used for much more sinister purposes in the future. I truly think we're heading toward an Orwellian state. I think this mass surveillance will be used to target those that are against the govt. I'm sure many of us here are already on a list. There is absolutely no need for a mass surveillance state, especially when I believe that the war on terror is a hoax.

       True. Today they would call him a terrorist for clearing out the temple and saying things like it is harder for a rich man to enter heaven then for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle.
