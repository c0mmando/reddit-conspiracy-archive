       I would gamble there are a lot more decent people than 10% working for the government, BUT because of the way things are compartmentalized they have no idea what damage their work is actually doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very nature of how the government and military works is by dividing up all the information to a point where only a couple people can see the big picture.

       Yes sir, this 1000x. I watch a ton of testimonials from government employees, fighter pilots, lockheed staff, etc etc and the most consistent theme is how compartmentalized everything is in their world. No one knows what the other is doing.

       But if you've ever been a part of a big organization, this is not a bad thing. Shit, you can make this metaphor all kinds of simple...
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a computer, but every part of your computer could also perform independent computing functions. Yeah, that thing would compute like a motherfucker, but is it more efficient than a dedicated system? Does it make doing your taxes easier?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every government organization
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       communicate better. But this comes with a set of increasingly unreachable expectations. Not only does the amount of email in your inbox go up a few exponents, but now you have to put standards in place for using information. Then you need liability for when someone misses a communication and manufactures a plane that crashes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you get geniuses who, if you tell them enough, will start to think they know better. 100% of upper managers are like this.

       US Government and Military structure is very much inspired by Freemasonry's structure with the all-seeing-eye at the top of the pyramid. Only the top can see, the rest is just there to prop it up.

       Depends on what you mean by "government". I'd say most of the lower-level government workers like civil engineers are probably decent people. It's the upper levels that are full of scum.

       9/11 and other false flags showed that even the FBI,  Secret Service,  anyone,  from inside the US or from outside,  was capable of being used to operate a plan.   I am saying that the place from which 9/11 was operated would be very hard to phantom.    I suspect Cheney knew parts,  but not all.    I suspect Giuliani knew parts but not all.   Who knew all?   Probably no one!

       Listening to former CIA or former FBI people,  its obvious how brainwashed they have been into particular elements that are distractions.

       Or military.    For example,  the amount of time they have spent getting familiar with the details of sectarian factions in Iraq,  Syria,  Iran,  Turkey, Libya etc. even reading the Koran and being expert on "Islamic Fundamentalism"  as if that explained the false flags,  or that explained the fall of regimes in Iraq,  Libya,  or the war in Syria!!!!!    Or explained Ukraine.    Follow the money,  and follow other major clues of people who see high level orders:   Wesley Clark on 9/20/2001

       The second part of that is a really great and underlooked point. As someone who experienced the tiniest bit of life for soldiers over there in 05 and 06, the whole endeavour had this aura of "we will never understand this" that seemed like organizational incompetence, but could have been manufactured distraction from the real initiatives.

       We have to help this tribe hold their poppy fields, because their ancestral claim to this land is upheld by a plurality of Sunnis in the area and the Shia militiamen we've been getting shelled by are trying to burn the fields and financially cripple...

       You spending your waking minutes trying to desperately keep your fellow soldiers from dying. Watching the road for that out of place rock or trashbag that'll send you back home in pieces. Killing other humans. How do you keep up with that story day in and day out? What do you as a private do to find out what happens to that poppy? Do you even care?

       "Need to know" keeps organization incompetence intentionally in place.   Those unfortunate enough to spend time in toxic institutions/organizations still have people at the very top who are not in the know,  following orders.

       When it comes to private prisons,  the drug war,  pharmaceutical corporations,   the deciders are not to be found in government posts,  in my opinion.    Or 9/11,  it was dreamed up by a think tank

       And I'm genuinely curious not mocking, but even if what you said was true, how would you even know? Why would the "deep state", whatever that means, be competent enough to run every intelligence agency that's relevant, while at the same time be incompetent enough to allow enough information to get out for you to know and discuss this on one of the most popular sites in the world?

       The deep state consists of unelected intelligence officials, heads of multinational corporations, private security firms, and powerful current/former politicians(neocons/neolibs). The existence of the deep state isn't even really that much of secret. Read about the CFR, Trilateral commission, and Project for A New American Century. There are plenty of other think tanks and secret societies that these "elites" participate in. It is really all public knowledge. Hidden in plain sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many possible reasons that this leak got out. A common theory is that there is a civil war going on in the intelligence community. The NSA and CIA are at odds. There are agents/officials in the FBI, CIA, and NSA that want to disrupt the status quo and are fighting for the common good. This may be one of those agents/officials leaking this.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could also be a planned leak by the CIA to scare any possible revolutionaries. They are threatening us. We are always being surveiled by the secret police. If we  act out of line, we could be killed in a plane or car crash and no one would notice any foul play. This will just become the new normal.

       'Unintentionally' is the big word you're missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a conspiracy sub, so the big deal is whether or not they intend to terrorize. A bold claim to even suggest CIA has any such intentions. Saying that the government itself intends to terrorize, that's too absurd. I'm sure most people here would agree.

       That shadow government is evil, possibly beyond comprehension, is one of the tenets of "conspiracy theories."  In fact I think hardly anyone here would agree with either one of those statements.

       As an outsider who has studied and lived in the US for 3 years, I love American people. I've made friends and generally everyone was helpful but and there's a big BUT I absolutely hate American government. It is corrupt and they terrorise the whole world. Mind you there corrupt government everywhere but nobody as powerful as US and if they terrorise its local.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, I can acknowledge that there maybe good people in the government but they do not have power to do anything. The terrorists own US government - Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, most of Southern America, the poor island in the Pacific (forgot the name) which was a nuclear test site for almost 20 years! 20 years of Hiroshima bombs - imagine what the people went through. Do you still think CIA has good intentions? They've probably killed billions by now.

       Yeah, but they need to stop portraying the bad guy as a "villain" because then people can't relate even when the villain gains some humanity. People rarely identify with the villain. They need to make a relatable character who thinks he or she id doing good, but then gains perspective that reveals their values/ actions as harmful instead.

       The government is the reason US is hated around the world. That's right, it's gluttonous public has had nothing to do with it. After all it wasn't their endless need to consume that has driven the environment to the brink of destruction. The government has only acted to preserve the interests of its people. Typical American to point the blame on anyone but themselves.

       But yeah,  it does seem that a huge portion of the government money is used against the people,  here,  and abroad.    Totalitarian dictatorship of a secret/deep state and its pawns,  the two parties,  democratic and republican,  and these days,  the corporations and media are also tied into this machine of power.

       They're just an unusually violent organized crime group.  No more, no less.  We've given them color of law, and they've used it treasonously against their country.  They've undermined our interests at home and abroad.  This is what

       I think that US defense companies that make billions of war and bomb making and all this stuff.. for some reason think the US is invincible.  It has to do with the two oceans that protect the US on either side.  So they think that no one can touch the US homeland.  And the US has this global military and right on the doorstep of all countries of the world. Just today NATO is holding more military exercises on Russia's border.

       Yep, until the automate all of industry we are still useful as slaves. But I think they envision a system more akin to a feudal lord and serf relationship. We will eventually turn to become self sufficient and grow our own food/hunt and find ways to power our own neighborhoods. We will create our own infrastructure they will eventually co-opt. Thats the cia's MO. Co-opt any good meaning cause and pervert it to their purposes.

       They run drugs, they run guns, they've long associated with the mafia, the Mexican cartels, and the Colombian cartels.

       All that's needed is to show them something they stand for being seriously violated via webcam control. Like say, a private discussion being dissected and sold to third parties or being cropped and edited to be used in an agenda. If someone can take every word you say and morph it into something that fucks you over for life or even causes you or a loved one to burn in a car crash, would you not be at least a little concerned? Having that much power should bother anyone.

       It's really evident now though. As odd as it sounds this leak isn't going to make it any better. No one knows what to do to change, and since we aren't united... we'll never be able to use the process to fix anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wonder what we are going to do? I have the cynical feeling this will just blow over and not shit will come of it like the Snowden leaks. People will be mad for a bit, then... nothing. Nothing will end up happening because we are so divided now that it is nearly impossible to find common ground between a lot of Americans.

       One would hope. Remember the xbox Kinetic, and the Sony Vizio TV that also did this though? Or the highschool in PA that remotely activated students school laptops or snowden? Nothing happened, so I'm kinda cynical. I don't think the majority  of the populace cares in the long run.

       Yeah. I mean I am not worried about them using it on me so much as I believe there should be oversight to  make sure the CIA isnt' doing this stuff on our soil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think it would be very naive to assume that if the CIA has this stuff then obviously Mossad, FSB, EIS, etc all probably have similar stuff.

       I mean it indicates they were getting them from 0day "dealers" too, so they are also probably out in the wild.

       I really don't want you to be right but this is just way too involved for the majority of the vagina-hat people and most people who have been marching around with a vague cause. I'm all for protesting if it's warranted but for the past few years I've given up hope in most of them. This just isn't as interesting as "fighting for a cause" because this is very real and scary so people will probably just shut down and go back to yelling.

       Additionally, nothing will happen until it is more important to the average person than his day-to-day. It's going to take a large group of America to finally be fed up with this that they say "you know what, fuck it, I'm not going to work today I'm going to start a revolution."

       I think that's a good point. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't going to threaten to take food out of anyone's mouth. Until that happens, you're probably right. It's going to have to be so damning AND threaten even the most common person on the street.

       At the federal level. Add in the debt at the state, county, and local levels and it's much higher.

       Alex Jones doesn't know what he's talking about regarding Sandy Hook and I have barely even listened to enough of what he says to know this. If you think that was a real shooting you have your head firmly ensconced where the sun doesn't shine. Feel free to proffer any evidence that it was.

       Okay then. 3 questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Why was there 28 reported deaths, and not a single name released? also, why were the families not aloud to see the childrens bodies?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Where is the footage of Adam Lanza breaking the window, walking around the halls, or shooting anyone? The school had brand new surveillance systems installed at the start of that year. Also, where is the footage of them bringing out victims?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Why were facebook pages and tweets commemorating the shooting made up to 1 month in advance?
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Why did reports say there was only 4 handguns found at the scene and that an AR was in Lanzas trunk, but the medical examiners said they were all shot with a bushmaster AR-15 and that he had many high capacity clips with him?
      </p>
      <p>
       5)Why was there well known crisis actors giving interviews as parents?
      </p>
      <p>
       6)Why was the crime scene destroyed?

       It was some kind of FEMA/DHS drill that went live but I'm implicating the CIA because of how the story was promoted on mainstream media by people like CIA asset Anderson Cooper, and how some of the documents like a birth certificate (or death certificate, I can't remember) for Noah Pozner, were faked.

       Probably the 85 people who upvoted this have done the cursory amount of research necessary to easily conclude that all events I mentioned were hoaxes manufactured by our own government. If you want more details about any of them I'd be glad to provide this. I implicate the CIA because of the widespread mainstream media complicity in controlling and propagating the official government accounts of all of these events.

       I would love to see facts and sources for many of your claims. Yes. And most people that come to this sub upvote anything someone writes that implicates governments in conspiracies. You're giving people too much credit. I recently stopped reading a conspiracy theory book because it lacked sources.

       You're right to be skeptical and demand proof. If you could be more specific about which one of those you want more info about I can link some stuff. If you see past one of them it's easier to see past others.

       Well shit, 9/11 is upper-tier conspiracy level stuff; if you have a good handle on that one I shouldn't think any of the others would be a problem. Sandy Hook was the most obvious, surpassed only maybe by the Boston Marathon Bombing which I didn't even mention.

       So is the UK government. Regina v. Gul, UK Supreme Court, judge accepted that UK government activities constitute terrorism as defined by the Prevention of Terror Act 2000.

       One of the implications of this is that it is illegal to pay income tax.

       I tought its a big stretch too but given the brilliance of that documentary, I didnt dismiss it. The documentary makes a big difference between elected governments and billionaires who control government assets like CIA, which were at odds at that time. Now they are the same thing.

       the us supported the nationalists, there was mr.song who was THE CIA operative in china at that time, his first daughter song ai-lin was a mistress for sun yat sen, the guy who did the xinhai rebellion overthrew the qing dynasty and started the republic of china, he married his second daughter song qin-lin to sun, who later on joined mao's side in the civil war and became the first woman vice president in the prc even tho she had no real power and was named as one of the founder of the country, and married his third daughter song mei-lin to chang kai shek, the leader of the nationalists party after sun died and managed to convert him to christianity, all of song's family and daughter are us citizens, the US supported chang during ww2 because he and his wife were valuable assets for the US. Im sure if he had a fourth daughter he'd probably pimp her to mao to gain even more power, he's like the rosthchild of china
      </p>
      <p>
       mao was an oppurtunists who hijicaked the soviet movement in china at that time, he started with like 10 foot soldiers and managed to seize power within the communist party and then ultimately beating chang's nationalists after ww2, pretty impressive tbh, but I dont think mao had anything to do with the CIA, his help came mainly from the KGB and the kremlin

       Theyre soo much worse. Basically combine the resources and capabilities of the CIA with people carrying out operations that literally view everyone else as subhuman "goyim"...think of how much further they are willing to go when they dont even view the people they are targeting as human.

       If only it was saving a few bucks. Overtime for the average shopper that adds up. And what's the alternative Walmart? Best Buy? Target? They hardly help new business get off the ground also. Newegg.com and Overstock.com are options I suppose. eBay.com and Craigslist.org for folks wanting to help new business get off the ground.

       Retailers do not try to compete with Amazon as much as you think they would. Yesterday, I had to pick up a roll of labels for my label printer on short notice, so I couldn't order it online (
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DYMO-Extra-Large-Shipping-LabelWriter-1744907/dp/B001U729QK">
        $17 on Amazon
       </a>
       ), So I went to Office Depot (Staples and Best Buy didn't carry the size I needed). Office Depot prices them at
       <a href="http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/356148/DYMO-White-LabelWriter-Shipping-Labels-4/">
        $33.49
       </a>
       online (was ~$37 in store). I tried to price match, but their policy doesn't allow Amazon marketplace items to be matched. I'm pretty sure those labels aren't a marketplace item, and I pointed that out to them, but the employee seemed pretty set on their decision.

       Paying double price for a roll of labels kind of sucks. If you sell books, that is different, you're not just another retailer, but you shouldn't expect me(or anyone else) to be happy going to a different faceless company that charges almost twice as much for the same product, rather than Amazon, just because they compete with small businesses in other areas.

       I don't have money to shop, haven't had shopping money in a long time and can't justify spending 20 dollars on phone cases when the same thing is listed for 8 on amazon and if I wanted to wait 6 months probably even cheaper on alibaba. The country sold out the future with citizen united and when the supreme court upheld that cash is free speech, this is independent of amazon. A hdmi cable on amazon is under 10 bucks at the store is 50-60... it's never really just a few bucks sometimes.

       You equate low prices with some sort of freedom. This is a lie we've been sold over and over. It's finally hitting critical mass. Amazon is selling those at prices that no one else could possibly afford. They sell them as loss leaders. They screw indie publishers into nonexistence. They do not respect or view literature or graphic novels as art.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe just buy less crap you don't really need and you can justify spending $15 on a phone case. Because that's what it is actually supposed to cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazon treats employees at every level like crap. Uses intimidation tactics and threats. They dodge taxes in every host country. They are twisted stateless globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you buy local the money stays in the community. When you shop at Amazon you give your money to an evil stateless organization, that will reinvest every penny into making you miserable without ever realizing the true cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       They spent millions on media manipulation, just so that you don't suspect the cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       It feels good to get cheap stuff 2 days later, but there is nothing good about it. They are making billions off the backs of hard working American
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy your cheap shit, but understand why I can never ever justify ever shopping on there again. Electronics should not be purchases so frequently that you can't afford to shop anywhere but Amazon.

       cases for phones not iPhone or Galaxy are not carried everywhere bro. It's about convenience more than anything. I spend plenty in the community... at restaurants and bars and fast food joints.  I just don't step inside a mall because everything is on amazon and then they donate to a water charity for a good cause. Dude idk man they pay 16$/hr working distribution warehouse in Ohio. FedEx paid me 13.50 overnight doing the same shit in NYC. OHH FEDEX IS BAD BOYCOT FEDEX? Sad!

       I've done some work with the folks at WalMart.com, and it's such a great place. I've never worked at Amazon, but I've heard plenty of horror stories about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: walmart.com is a viable alternative to amazon.com for people who don't want to support the CIA's favorite tech company.

       wal mart and walmart.com are completely separate companies, by design.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically walmart.com wants to compete with amazon.com, and they understand they need to nurture their talent to do that. It's a great place to work!

       It is sad. And saddest part is these losers are a bunch of Alex Jones like kids from their parents basement clinging on the hope that this celebrity "blows The White House" so to speak. Even worse is Trump fan boys cry anytime they see a anti Trump post on Reddit, claiming it's rigged and Refit plants anti Trump material. Trump, his fan boys, his cabinet, and The_donald sub are #whinylittlebitches

       You shouldn't just post a statement. There is extensive information to back up your claims on the crimes perpetrated by the CIA and other intelligence organizations. They are responsible for coup d'etat on countries that don't serve their interests, horrific human experimentation, torture, murder, terrorism, complicity with terrorism/terrorist orgs, funding of terrorism, domestic and foreign terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       People prefer to ignore and forget history, and should be remembered that a friendly face on the government doesn't and didn't fix the hidden and surreptitious ways some organizations do violating the human rights of nationals and foreigners. To be distracted by apparently progressive politics when the rotten core  perpetrates terrible crimes "to defend" that facade. I'm sure that they (as anyone involved in such activities) are not only enemies of americans but also enemies of anyone who believes in freedom, democracy, dignity and human rights.

       To The_donald, F off you propaganda spewing, hate filled, lie covering sheep. Your illustrious leader is using you fools to murky up the waters to cover his sess pool dealings and we can see your finger prints everywhere (conspiracy, Hillaryforprison etc) ps putting news in capitals will not detract away from Russia, collusion and treason. Here in Australia my mate and I log in to reddit in the morning driving along and always do the same thing 1. Read a post from The_Donald, scoff and laugh and remind ourselves "how f-stupid do these people think we are" then "nah it's "how stupid are these people" and remind ourselves you're a small slither of idiots in an otherwise lovable place. To borrow from Star Wars "who's more foolish? The fool or the foolS who follow him"

       Maybe you should re-read the post. I know it's not The Donald, I was banned by them early on. I thought it was pretty clear my lil rant was quite anti-trump. And as for "conflate with" if anything I was conflating against. On that note I don't it believe it to be a conflation nor a long stretch to conclude some, if not all of my statement to be fact. Unfortunately only time will provide the back up to my statement. But, I do encourage you to have another bowl bruv. Might help iron out the reading ;)

       Originally written in to the constitution to ensure you guys could defend your colony if the English returned or your own leadership decides to go rogue. But you have a lobby group making it impossible to even reduce how many rounds someone can spray from one clip by the smallest amount. That you want guns in schools. That children can own a gun but can't drink until your 21. That you can buy a gun from the back of a truck in a car park legally. That you don't wanna bother testing and back ground checking for potential nut bags buy a gun. Children finding guns and shooting their siblings. That your children aren't safe in school. That a man in florida shot another man in a theatre for throwing popcorn. that you have 30,000 gun deaths a year and that Chicargo felt the need to celebrate a week without a gun murder. That my american friend thinks it's great that no one 'messes' with each other in bars etc cause you presume everyone is carrying...just to point out that this is not normal to the reat of the world. 
We only restricted our guns. You can own them. We just dont allow full auto assault rifles cause 1.there is NO sport in throwing a hundred rounds down range at an animal. 2. If you need a hundred rounds to kill what you're trying to get then you shouldn't have a gun! In other words there is only one reason for em, to kill people. 
Trust me I would love for it to be easier for me but I don't want it easy for a nutjob. we have a few, you guys???? 
We banned heavy weapons, licenced and background checked gun owners since 1996. We haven't had a massarce since and suicides rates by gun are 74% down. 
No one I knows worries about being shot when they go out (generally only criminals get shot here. and rarely). 
If we get into arguments, no one is fearful they'll be shot over the parking spot etc. 
As for the government, ours works for us and couldn't fully turn on us. We all vote! they have to keep everyone generally happy and our soldiers and police would refuse any action that would be outrageous or contradictory to our core. I live in a place that has been voted the most livable city in the world multiple times and people flock to my country and enjoy it's freedoms and safety...not bad for a place that gave up it's guns hey ;)
Everytime I'm on Reddit, I not only see something about a shooting in the states but they're almost just for nutso reasons...I could link a few... 
So I ask, hows those guns working out for ya?
ps. they did pass a bill to be able to drone strike citizens at some point. just worth noting if you guys think you'll hold you leaders back.

       Several points -- hear me out:::
      </p>
      <h1>
       1. If CIA (and NSA) is in total control, is a terrorist organization, can manipulate cars blowing up, watch you from your Smart TV, where does that put your beloved President Trump for which all these "awake" Trump-fan boys adore? Is Trump anti CIA, NSA? The general he put up as NSA's head few weeks ago is a Trump loyalist seeded as head of NSA in order to destroy it from within? Is Trump part of the big plan and himself a terrorist?
      </h1>
      <h1>
       2. Assuming the answer is a big "NO" from point one above, how in the world did an anti CIA, anti NSA guy leak thru to become president??? If the CIA is as smart, powerful, convincing, and down right nefarious -- being able to control your camera, TV, blow up your stupid Honda Civic with a remote control, and steal your children in the middle of the night, wouldn't one think they can control the election and actually get a candidate planted to their liking despite the electoral college and voting and all that hogwash? After all, they can control the computers people vote on, duh!
      </h1>
      <h1>
       3. WikiLeaks: Lastly, it's quite funny how WikiLeaks -- a self proclaimed transparent institution that leaks files n secrets -- seems to ONLY focus on American leaks. It would be naive to think there aren't other corrupt countries and government spying. Have any of you ever lived in another country? Iran? Syria? Russia? Greece?I have lived in two of those four counties and if u think America is bad - go live in one of those countries and try to speak your mind. See if you last 6 months...
      </h1>
      <p>
       It's quite funny that only American affairs and relations are "leaked" and then you conspiracy rabbit hole theorists jump the gun and call CIA a terrorist and such. There are kleptocracies all over the world (Russia, Greece, Saudi Arabia), totalitarian and/or brutal theocracy governments (Iran, Uzbekistan, Syria, Belarus) all over the world with spying, collusion, terror, and pedophilia 1,000x WORSE than what u have in the free United States of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course CIA has power. Of course they can view you from your Smart TV. Of course they can tap into your precious Facebook account. Of course they can blow up your friend's car. This isn't news. CIA / NSA can do a lot of things. They prob sitting back laughing at these leaks cause u barely scrapped 10% of the surface. We've known what the CIA since its inception in 1947. And even then they existed years and years before! So none of this is news. What's scary is conspiracy theorist like Alex Jones (and Reddit) that post junk and Trump seemingly reads them and Tweets them as fact. But again... If y'all correct, then Trump is either "part of them" cause there's no way an anti CIA can leak thru to be President -- or he's simply got something bad coming and should watch his back.

       For your first point, isn't it just as likely that they saw Trump as a useful idiot and rather than actively helping him just didn't try to stop him because they knew they'd be able to control him? They're probably smart enough to realize they need a charismatic leader with a strong support base, especially in the red areas who are most likely to be willing to and capable of revolting.

       If the CIA are as smart as we are led to believe then they'd use both the Trump and Clinton campaigns as pawns in order to push the new Cold War and thus increased military industrial complex funding. I believe the CIA had Clinton's back all along and this Russian backstory was plan B. Throw Trump to the wolves and then establishment conservative "Yes Man" Pence is President.

       What always bothers me about the CIA is their recruitment. How the hell do they brainwash what would I be normal people to be so devious? If I worked for the CIA and someone told me that we are going to teach some guerrilla unit torture techniques I would immediately quit. I mean, who are they recruiting? Psychopaths?

       Yes, they test for it. They also 'train' people through sodomy rape. The CIA recruits from families where pedophilia is practiced. They start the 'training' when they are very young and include other kinds of torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why pizzagate is so explosive, it ties the pedophile child-raping rings to the CIA's other activities. That is also why they call the CIA a family, it is very incestuous with all of that child rape going on as "training."

       Yeah, but they need to stop portraying the bad guy as a "villain" because then people can't relate even when the villain gains some humanity. People rarely identify with the villain. They need to make a relatable character who thinks he or she id doing good, but then gains perspective that reveals their values/ actions as harmful instead.

       "Need to know" keeps organization incompetence intentionally in place.   Those unfortunate enough to spend time in toxic institutions/organizations still have people at the very top who are not in the know,  following orders.

       When it comes to private prisons,  the drug war,  pharmaceutical corporations,   the deciders are not to be found in government posts,  in my opinion.    Or 9/11,  it was dreamed up by a think tank

       and you can be sure that the same MIC that Eisenhower warned about,  corporations like Halliburton,  were the sponsors of that think tank.

       Yeah. I mean I am not worried about them using it on me so much as I believe there should be oversight to  make sure the CIA isnt' doing this stuff on our soil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think it would be very naive to assume that if the CIA has this stuff then obviously Mossad, FSB, EIS, etc all probably have similar stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean it indicates they were getting them from 0day "dealers" too, so they are also probably out in the wild.

       I would love to see facts and sources for many of your claims. Yes. And most people that come to this sub upvote anything someone writes that implicates governments in conspiracies. You're giving people too much credit. I recently stopped reading a conspiracy theory book because it lacked sources.

       I know for a fact that it was. And none of your bullshit is going to convince me to lump this in with all of the legitimate misuses of government. I am done wasting time talking to your ilk, eating up NRA propaganda like it's Project Mockingbird shit.
