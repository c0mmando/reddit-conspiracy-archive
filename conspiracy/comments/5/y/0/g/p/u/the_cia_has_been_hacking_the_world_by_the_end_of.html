      <pre><code>Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named "Vault 7" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.

The first full part of the series, "Year Zero", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.

Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.

"Year Zero" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of "zero day" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.

Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force — its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities.

By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other "weaponized" malware. Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its "own NSA" with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.

In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.

Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike.

Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that "There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of "Year Zero" goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective."

Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the "Year Zero" disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed, disarmed and published.

Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in "Year Zero" for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in "Vault 7" part one (“Year Zero”) already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks.

       The conversation my wife and I had at dinner...
      </p>
      <p>
       the 2 hours I spent with my son on the computer researching leamurs in Madagascar...
      </p>
      <p>
       driving to work and talking to my boss about 3 quarter earnings.... All of which were logged and stored in some massive facility....
      </p>
      <p>
       should I ever come under scrutiny for any reason my government can sift through those conversations to see if any of them had to do with  whatever their looking for..........
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so sad when you turn on CNN and they minimize this dump as "nothing to see here" and basically condone  their actions .... That's why the media is in a slow death roll....
      </p>
      <p>
       They see the writing on the wall as alt. Journalism is taking hold and people are getting their information from outlets which aren't connected to the cabal ... biased and slanted
 ... people are actually seeing the truth without the bias of the bullshit MSM... 
people like Anderson Cooper, Sean hanity, David Muir and Rachel Meddow are irrelevant and they know it.... It's actually something that scares me.....
Since these government stooges are being shuned and people are seeing the truth, were going to see censorship on a level we never imagined.....
      </p>
      <p>
       You see the powers that be can't have "the people" seeing the truth.... They are so use to the big 3 pushing their narrative and brain washing us  they just can't have us getting information from other sources.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine if 911, Sandy Hook, Boston bombing, CO theater shooting, East coast camera man and newscaster shooting before we had the internet?....
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, we use to take news at face value as the only news we ever got was from Dan Rather, Peter Jennings and Tom brokaw [here is a great write up on these fools](No, what makes us weaker is the understanding that our government treats everyone of us as terrorists.

       The conversation my wife and I had at dinner, the 2 hours I spent with my son on the computer researching leamurs in Madagascar, driving to work and talking to my boss about 3 quarter earnings.... All of which were logged and stored in some massive facility....
      </p>
      <p>
       should I ever come under scrutiny for any reason my government can sift through those conversations to see if any of them had to do with  whatever their looking for..........

       It's so sad when you turn on CNN and they minimize this dump as "nothing to see here" and basically condone  their actions .... That's why the media is in a slow death roll....

       They see the writing on the wall as alt. Journalism is taking hold and people are getting their information from outlets which aren't connected to the cabal. ... people are actually seeing the truth without the bias of the bullshit MSM... 
people like Anderson Cooper, Sean hanity, David Muir and Rachel Meddow are irrelevant and they know it.... It's actually something that scares me.....
Since these government stooges are being shuned and people are seeing the truth were going to see censorship on a level we never imagined.....
You see the powers that be can't have "the people" seeing the truth.... They are so use to the big 3 pushing their narrative and brain washing us  they just can't have us getting information from other sources.....

       Can you imagine if 911, Sandy Hook, Boston bombing, CO theater shooting, East coast camera man and newscaster shooting before we had the internet?.... You see, we use to take news at face value as the only news we ever got was from Dan Rather, Peter Jennings and Tom brokaw..
