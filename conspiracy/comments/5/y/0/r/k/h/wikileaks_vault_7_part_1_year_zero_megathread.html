<p>While the length is good, it&#39;s not hard to crack because:
1.  it&#39;s formulaic.   The first letter is always capitalized.
2.  No numbers
3.  No special characters
4.  It&#39;s using actual words.  </p>

<p>But, as they have posted it on reddit, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re worried about people cracking it.   :)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kinda bullshit for every day passwords. Every day passwords are all about making sure other people can&#39;t remember them, not having a computer brute force it.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more important for the user to remember their own password (lest they write it on a sticky and attach it to their monitor), and to rotate passwords often.  Yes, many login portals have a check that blocks attempts after a few tries, but what if the hash leaks?  What if that check is poorly implemented or the attacker finds some novel approach to bypassing the protection?

    <div class="md"><p>Consider this scenario.</p>

<p>Emails, Usernames, and password hashes leak from reddit.  Some malicious party puts in the effort and breaks the hash for your user.  This person thinks &quot;hmmm....The first couple of characters look like they could stand for Reddit...What happens if I test that theory against the email address attached?&quot; Emails make great jumping off points for further exploitation.  This is a fairly typical example.  </p>

<p>How many two-letter combos could stand for Google/Gmail/yahoo/AOL/whatever?  Not trying to be argumentative or malicious, just pointing out that   your method of password generation meets the definition of formulaic and it can be difficult or impossible to anticipate every vector of attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, this is real life, with real people, with real families and real consequences. Simply &quot;dropping the bomb&quot; in the current sociopolitical climate would be the most wreckless action ever taken in the history of humanity.</p>

<p>Were they to reveal verifiable documents that prove a CIA plot to kill JFK, just as an example, it would leave a deeper scar than the assassination itself. Were they to reveal with verifiable documents that 911 was an inside job, it would stop the clocks around the world. </p>

<p>Suddenly everyone would feel the way most of us here have felt at times before, with a deep sense of disillusionment, as though the floor was being pulled from underneath our feet. A necessary, yet painful learning process to be sure, but only if it happens gradually on your own terms. If it happens globally in a flash of revelations, the outcome could be catastrophic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree that the world needs to know all of it, but I don&#39;t think &quot;dropping the bomb&quot; is the way to do it if we want to build a better future once the truth is on the table.</p>

<p>In all honesty, we&#39;re already moving faster than a lot of people can handle. I know many folks who are not familiar with the shadow world of secret agendas, who are getting very nervous by their world-construct being increasingly called into question by factual revelations about how the world really works. How many times have you heard people exclaim how ridiculous and film-like the events of  2016 have been, and we had only begun to scratch the surface then. Imagine the madness the full truth would cause.</p>

<p>To my mind, Wikileaks has found a pretty reasonable balance between revealing information as fast as possible, but slowly enough so as to avoid a public panic attack. We&#39;re gonna get there, straw by straw until we finally stack the straw on top that breaks the camel&#39;s back.</p>

They can release &quot;fake news&quot; and condemn anyone all under the guise of an organization that&#39;s working for the people of the world.

    <div class="md"><p>I would say the CIA benefits more from having Wikileaks available as controlled opposition. So they release the &quot;bombshells&quot; of &quot;the CIA is spying on everyone&quot; and everyone believes that Wikileaks is still alive and well. Meanwhile they withhold the ACTUAL bombshells - things that would put Obama/Clinton/Trump  (whoever they work for) in jail. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t necessarily what I believe, I still have hope that Wikileaks is operating normally. I simply believe that we need to be aware of other possibilities. Telling someone to &quot;stop talking about that&quot; so vehemently isn&#39;t constructive. </p>

<p>It is also an angle to think of. And after he regains control if he were to say that wikileaks twitter was hacked it would forever tarnish the credibility regardless as people would always question him. It&#39;s kind of a win win move from the CIA if you look at it through that lens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CIA or any intelligence for that matter could simply feed WikiLeaks some limited hangouts wrapped in hysteria for the masses to consume. They might even do this when they know the info already got breached. Say the CIA gets breached by China and they log/detect it somehow. Or they catch wind of it through back channel spies. Now China has the info and can use it privately to their benefit or negotiation with other countries, that is until the CIA &quot;WikiLeaks&quot; it and shows China how to play 4D Chess.</p>

<p>On the surface, it once again seems like WikiLeaks continues to put out material that benefits the Trump administration. Will it benefit us though?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say my mind is made up.  It&#39;s possible all is well with Julian and leaks are back to normal. But as the other poster mentioned, skepticism doesn&#39;t hurt. There is a lot of video evidence of Assange and there is also video evidence of UFOs so you have to regard the source of each.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How the CIA dramatically increased proliferation risks
In what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of &quot;Vault 7&quot; — the CIA&#39;s weaponized malware (implants + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems — the agency has little legal recourse.</p>

<p><strong>The CIA made these systems unclassified.</strong></p>

<p>Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the &#39;battlefield&#39; of cyber &#39;war&#39;.</p>

<p>To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command &amp; Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber &#39;arms&#39; manufactures and computer hackers can freely &quot;pirate&quot; these &#39;weapons&#39; if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine.) What is the legal significance of this lack of classification going forward?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps more subtle of a point is that the CIA is engaged in an arms race of spy-tech with the NSA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force — its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency&#39;s hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA&#39;s hacking capacities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A big part of this that you may be missing is that it&#39;s the CIA doing it with no accountability, pulling shady shit across the world. They have been actively exploiting this capability against enemies of the deep state.</p>

<p>It also shows how disturbing and vast the reckless weaponization of cyberwar techniques and weaponry are in practice under the CIA. Not only is this terribly unethical in the first place but it also has incredible potential for catastrophic results across the world if lost to the wrong people (which is very possible).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, when I heard about what was in the release, I was surprised that was it, because I&#39;d known that for a while, actually even started deleting certain apps and what not (I&#39;m sure that really worked lol)</p>

<p>I was wondering why the release was so hyped, so theatrical. I pertly think it&#39;s just cause WikiLeaks wants to feel cool, why shouldn&#39;t they, but also I think when it&#39;s hyped like that, people want to get involved, like when people put together clues from like a mystery game. People are invested. Even though it&#39;s not necessarily new knowledge, now a ton more people are talking about it</p>

<p>zero-day exploit</p>

<p>A zero day vulnerability refers to a hole in software that is unknown to the vendor. This security hole is then exploited by hackers before the vendor becomes aware and hurries to fix it—this exploit is called a zero day attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in 2014 there was some crazyness where large portions of the source code changed abruptly, and some anonymous dev posted a warning on the Truecrypt homepage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“WARNING: Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues”</p>

<p>“This page exists only to help migrate existing data encrypted by TrueCrypt.”</p>

<p>“The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 after Microsoft terminated support of Windows XP. Windows 8/7/Vista and later offer integrated support for encrypted disks and virtual disk images. Such integrated support is also available on other platforms (click here for more information). You should migrate any data encrypted by TrueCrypt to encrypted disks or virtual disk images supported on your platform.”</p>

<p>Say you&#39;re working on an open source project and get a gag order saying you aren&#39;t allowed to remove some flaw.  What do you do?  I don&#39;t know about you, but me, I&#39;d do something like change the homepage to warn people without mentioning the flaw and raise enough red flags that security types get the message:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the &#39;battlefield&#39; of cyber &#39;war&#39;.</p>

<p>To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command &amp; Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet.

<p>Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the &#39;battlefield&#39; of cyber &#39;war&#39;.</p>

<p>To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command &amp; Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber &#39;arms&#39; manufactures and computer hackers can freely &quot;pirate&quot; these &#39;weapons&#39; if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Months ---&gt; years ---&gt; decades.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been on this without absolute proof for a long time.  As technology has advanced to the point that your TV has an Android OS, hell to the point where every TV available for new purchase has a similar OS it&#39;s become increasingly obviously that they will be exploitable.  And we all know if something is exploitable it&#39;s going to be exploited.  And if it&#39;s being exploited then every major state player in the world is going to have a hand in the bag.</p>

<p>What was always frustrating to me when people write off a conspiracy theory about technology being used as a backdoor to violate our rights, technology has always been used this way by government.</p>

<p>As soon as radios existed they were making bugs, as soon as magnetic storage existed they were recording us. As soon as video cameras existed they were filming us.  I can&#39;t think of a single advancement that hasn&#39;t been used against us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it&#39;s been at least 6 years as I refused ro buy a smart tv and had to search for a regular flat screen.

<p>Now he just gave up and sticks his head in video games and stupid joke reddit sections. I think he let the r/all community convince him we are idiots sometimes. He was all about Sanders and did not appreciate my prediction he would get the RNC Ron Paul treatment.</p>

<p>I miss our conspiracy chats. Now he gets snappy when I talk about moon landing being faked with our son but I give the kid both sides and let him decide and I tell him even id we disagree I am always proud as long as he examines an issue from various sides and thinks critically.</p>

<p>Anyway he pretty much told me I let Alex Jones make me paranoid and I don&#39;t really watch the guy much. It is just a philosophy of if it can be used against is of course both criminals and govt criminals aka employees will.</p>

<p>And he loves to talk about and use encryption. Like we use signal and red phone.</p>

<p>Meh... I told you so never came out of lips today but he just shrugged. So? And went back to his game room with his smart tv.</p>

<p>Speaking of I meed go recover my phone cameras. Can&#39;t even remove the battery anymore.... that&#39;s on purpose. Mic is always available to uncle sam now even when it&#39;s turned off.</p>

<p>It is hilarious. I used to post here and in the default subs with the same account. The response is always, this guy is a conspiracy nut. Then time after time we are proven true. And still they keep on believing what the MSM tells them to believe.</p>

<p>Who are the CIA and what do they do again?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Below is copied from another thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, we already know that the CIA does evil things. For example, the following are undisputed, public knowledge, and listed on Wikipedia:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">Operation Paperclip</a>: after World War 2, the government filled the intelligence services with thousands of top Nazis</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sunrise_(World_War_II">Operation Sunrise</a>: CIA Director Allen Dulles makes secret negotiations to help his Nazi friends at the end of WW2.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">Operation MK-ULTRA</a>: the CIA tortured, brainwashed, and secretly drug-dosed countless innocent victims. Some victims became permanently mute, paralyzed, or incapacitated. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ff24-xGrSI">Learn about the worst of MK-ULTRA here.</a> The CIA destroyed about 95% of the documents, and we only have the fraction that we do, because of a mistake in destroying the documents.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midnight_Climax">Operation Midnight Climax</a>: An operation with MK-Ultra involved secretly dosing victims with LSD and filming them with prostitutes in sex blackmail operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program">The Phoenix Program</a>: the CIA tortured and murdered countless innocent Vietnamese civilians and journalists in an attempt to undermine the North Vietnamese resistance.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">Operation Mockingbird</a>: the CIA infiltrated the media (starting with CBS) and distorted or biased the reporting in favor of the CIA&#39;s agenda. Today, Anderson Cooper is a known &quot;ex&quot; CIA employee. MSNBC&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_Brzezinski">Mika Brzezinski</a>&#39;s father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski">Zbigniew</a>, was the National Security Advisor who hand delivered weapons to Al Queda in the CIA&#39;s Operation Cyclone.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-contra">Iran-Contra</a>: the CIA violated Congress&#39;s Boland Amendment, which banned the CIA from funding the contras, by selling cocaine in the United States and by selling military arms to Iran.</li>
<li>The Dark Alliance investigation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb">Gary Webb</a>. Webb exposed much more information about the CIA selling cocaine in the Iran-Contra scandal. Webb was found in a &quot;suicide&quot; with two separate gunshots to his head.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/epXVDEn3gsQ">Mena Airport</a>: This is the famous airport in Arkansas where Barry Seal flow cocaine for the CIA. This is where Bill and Hillary Clinton got involved with the CIA, and were protected by the CIA. Notice that the CIA is really the only way to explain the giant trail of mysterious deaths and &quot;suicides&quot; in Clintons&#39; wake that never resulted in murder convictions (I encourage you to take the time to read through <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/DEAD/clinton-convenient-deaths21.jpg">the entire Clinton bodycount</a> - well over a hundred names).</li>
<li>Air America: The CIA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(airline">sold heroin out of Laos</a>#Allegations_of_drug_smuggling).</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee">Church Committee</a> also revealed other aspects of CIA corruption that are not necessarily included in the above list.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to these, I will add that the CIA is connected to other conspiracies:</p>

<ol>
<li>CIA assassin Ethan Hunt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFAZ8DmcQLg">confessed to killing JFK</a>. Oswald also had <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/oswald-the-cia-and-mexico-city/">connections to the CIA</a>. This video provides an overview for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NlJQJUUqR4">obvious CIA plot to kill JFK</a>. See also the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb7kyEBypF8">book by Jerome Corsi</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FVsS2sDkpE">book by Roger Stone</a>, the numerous books by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDaw35LPEvI">famous JFK researcher Mark Lane</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFK_(film">famous movie by Oliver Stone</a>).</li>
<li>Although 9/11 seems to be mostly a Mossad job, there must have been CIA and neoconservative complicity. For example, Osama bin Laden was our friend and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_CIA_assistance_to_Osama_bin_Laden">CIA/Mossad asset in the CIA Operation Cyclone war in Afganistan</a>. &quot;Al Queda&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda#Name">literally translates to &quot;the database&quot;</a> of CIA mujahideen in Afghanistan. Bin Laden&#39;s first reaction to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPn-IdeN85s">9/11 was to deny his involvement</a>.</li>
<li>A recent federal court decision <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700020756/Ruling-reveals-CIA-involvement-in-Oklahoma-City-bombing-investigation.html">confirms that the CIA was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing investigation</a>. Numerous conspiracy theories <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing_conspiracy_theories#US_federal_government_involvement">link the CIA to the bombing</a>.</li>
<li>George Webb has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/georgwebb">popular youtube series</a> outlining how the CIA, and its private sector cutout DynCorp, do nation topples, human trafficking, and organ harvesting around the world.</li>
</ol>

<p>The CIA was basically setup, after World War 2, and filled with Nazis, to perform black operations, under the cover of the law, to benefit U.S. corporate interests. Attempted reforms, like the Church Committee and the Boland Amendment, were effectively ignored. Because the CIA operates under secrecy without meaningful discipline, and because people are too scared about the destabalizing effect of exposing its corruption (after JFK, 9/11, etc.), the CIA&#39;s corruption just grows like a cancer.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem here is paranoia of the public to which seems to be the fuel for this sub. Most informed people don&#39;t care because they realize two things.</p>

<p>A. FISA and USSID 18 are there to protect US Persons and without a court order they can&#39;t surveil you. So unless you really are doing something shady why would you care about the capabilities of our government who are sworn to protect us just like the police, firemen, doctors, nurses, etc who could in fact do harm but for the most part do their jobs.</p>

<p>B. There is not enough manpower or resources to target joe shmoe on the couch in his underwear. It takes people to look through intel and monitor targets. If you really think anyone in the government cares about watching you while you watch Stranger Things on netflix you&#39;re wrong. It really is that simple. These hacks have been around since microphones and cameras were installed into computers. If you have any device with either of those components you are at risk from attack by anyone, your neighbor, a foreign entity, etc. </p>

<p>I would personally be more afraid, as a US Person, of who is leaking this information and the implications it has on our ability to stop attacks from happening to fellow citizens. The real questions we should be asking are: Who and why are they leaking classified documents putting the US, our service members,and allies at risk? </p>

<p>TLDR: Quit being paranoid big brother is watching you unless you&#39;re doing serious shady shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m not worried about the CIA watching everything I do, because I get lost in the noise. What I&#39;m more concerned about is the fact the <strong>tools</strong> have leaked. What Wikileaks are saying is they have access to all of the code behind the software. Is that not worrying? Billions of dollars worth of spying software has leaked out of the C.I.A and we don&#39;t know who has access to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way!! It was buried, not completely but if you didn&#39;t say anything I would not have known. Thanks for reminding me!! This is obviously a huge indication this is a controlled leak and the CIA is probably in control of Wikileaks and has either used Assange as an agent or murdered him to control these releases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are the odds? These Vault 7 leaks dropping the same exact fucking day that Weiner&#39;s laptop would be featured in court. Have been looking for any follow up to this story, so far haven&#39;t found anything yet. </p>

<p>The more I think about it, they likely made the disclosures on themselves and confirmed whatever that was paying attention was essentially already in the know of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. Which has also come up with this new round of chatter from the Michael Hastings situation. Like wouldn&#39;t have been easier to kill him in a botched robbery, (ala seth rich) or the old suicide story, or even a heart attack? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my line of thinking too. I&#39;m not 100% sold on the contents that we&#39;re finding. It is plausible, but it could also be partly fake to drive up fear and obedience. But if the government has the power to really do all of this, and so much more (terraforming, geo-engineering, and a load of other operations (see the great list above), then how is it that the U.S. government couldn&#39;t simply shut down the Wikileaks website? Why couldn&#39;t they &quot;remove&quot; these couple people that are leaking this to the world?</p>

<p>If they can overthrow government, silently kill hundreds of thousands or millions of people, and much more, how hard is it to a stop to this if it really is that damaging?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a mix of things, diversion and conditioning. We&#39;re getting conditioned to accept our fate that our rulers are putting us in. But I think it&#39;s also a great diversion that everyone is talking about to something far more grand. What that is? <em>shrug</em> We may never really know until it&#39;s too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This goes beyond &quot;intelligence gathering&quot; to complete manufacture and manipulation of everyone and anything.  This is the single greatest threat to every person on earth.</p>

<p>NSA employees spied on their exes but CIA spooks can manufacture an entire criminal dossier that seems 100% real and not be questioned on the authenticity by anyone in law enforcement or MSM.  Their word is somehow as good as gold despite all the lying they have admitted too.</p>

<p>And then there is Clapper who absolutely and intentionally committed perjury and lied to Congress still at his job, un-indicted and used by MSM as a reliable authority.</p>

<p>As much as I knew they were doing all this and part of me is happy with the vindication I am also now absolutely hopeless about our future.  A man elected president has no hope against this monster called the CIA. What chance do any of us peasants have to see our country put to rights?</p>

<p>They were talking about how a piece of code written 14 years ago ended up getting the NSA busted by Kaspersky and how they need to be thinking about 2029 to avoid these kinds of difficulties... so I think a huge chunk of their previous work being exposed to the general public and PSP companies could end up being a huge fucking setback for them... like scrap everytthing and begin again from scratch... oooooh... now I get the Year Zero reference... it makes sense now... </p>

<p>&quot;The idea behind Year Zero is that all culture and traditions within a society must be completely destroyed or discarded and a new revolutionary culture must replace it, starting from scratch.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing that they chose the quote by JFK claiming that he wanted to &quot;splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds.&quot; for a passphrase, your interpretations seems to miss the mark, albeit slightly.</p>

<p>The intent by Wikileaks was never to reset the CIA&#39;s capabilities, that would be cutting it short. They, as they say, need to be splintered into a thousand pieces and never allowed to recover. But you&#39;re right, that there needs to be, and likely will be a resetting of how we approach technology as a whole.</p>

<p>The main takeaway from yesterday&#39;s leaks is that every provider of technology deliberately or incompetently neglects to take serious measures to ensure the privacy and security of their customers. Thanks to the CIA&#39;s now widely dispursed hacking arsenal, every technological device has become vulnerable to attacks from pretty much anyone. </p>

<p>This is the meaning of Year Zero, to my mind. All technology is based on haphazardly thrown together code that barely does what it is supposed to more often than not, and is riddled with exploitable loopholes. This is a problem we will need to find a solution to, quickly. Open Everything, perhaps, I really don&#39;t know, but that&#39;s the discussion I think we&#39;ll need to have.</p>

<p>I suspect Trump will be the same way.  They will do nothing and continue to allow it happen.  If this is the case, then the deep state is alive and well.  The sweeping the 7th floor clean was just for show.</p>

<p>Conditioning.  People will get mad.  Companies will get mad.  But at the end of the day the CIA probably won&#39;t be dismantled.  It will just be accepted that all our technology is bugged and there is nothing we can do about it.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn&#39;t WikiLeaks worried that the CIA will act against its staff to stop the series?</p>

<p>No. That would be certainly counter-productive.&quot; </p>

<p>What does that mean? Taken at face value, it sounds like the CIA&#39;s &#39;progress&#39; is helped by the leaks. Perhaps it&#39;s their way of showing off: &quot;We can listen to you, hear you, and record you, from every device, all the time. We can intercept it before encryption, and so can Russia, which further justifies the whole Russia hacking bullshit we&#39;ve been pushing in the MSM.&quot; </p>

<p>I really want to believe Assange is alive and uncompromised, but this really hasn&#39;t lived up to the hype surrounding it. I&#39;ll wait until the rest of the leaks before I grieve the loss of Wikileaks as one of the last remaining vectors of truth in a society utterly inundated by lies.</p>

<p>It gives me hope that even though the &quot;Wikileaks is compromised and Assange is dead narrative&quot; was <em>forcefully pushed here</em> in order to discredit Wikileaks, that many users here still saw through that blatant manipulation and waited for this kind of bombshell.</p>

<p>Assange even addressed this himself in his, saying that the nonsense rumors were used to try to discredit him and Wikileaks through black PR operations.  He knew he had Vault 7 up his sleeve and wasn&#39;t going to let people try and discredit the information in advance, unfortunately many still fell for it.</p>

<p>Maybe going so obviously all-in is the only move they have left. We know they&#39;re owned, they know they&#39;re owned, they know we know they&#39;re owned, and they&#39;ll never come out and say it.

He answered the question as if a different question was asked and answered it very dismissively.  It&#39;s possible that he didn&#39;t hear the question but my take is that it was a question he very much did not want to answer.

<p>With all that &quot;global warming,&quot; maybe it is?</p>

<p>Invading Russia basically has three phases; winter, mud, and summer. Actually, it goes winter, mud, summer, mud, but whatever.</p>

<p>Basically, you get a short window in the summer to get stuff done; otherwise, you&#39;re bogged down in mud, or buried by snow. If you can manage to sustain combat operations during winter, you could actually conquer Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That <em>is</em> the most ridiculous drivel. The biggest threat to a corrupt government is <em>the innocent man</em>. Do they not know this?</p>

<p>We all know by now that the elites use pedophilia, and other horrible crimes, as blackmail material in order to knit their web of loyalists together. The <em>innocent</em> man is the one that they fear, because he&#39;s the one that they can&#39;t control.</p>

<p>Now, with all the surveillance going on, <em>plus</em> the ability to fabricate audio and video with the voice prints and visual image of the target, <em>anyone</em> who doesn&#39;t go along with the program can be framed for a crime that they did not commit - with visual and audio evidence to convict him with!</p>

<p>Now, that might not mean that the NPCs (Non Player Characters) that you&#39;re talking to need worry about being framed. But if government corruption is <em>ever</em> going to be cleared out, and the government taken to heel in order to start serving the American people again, then all of this nonsense has to be made public.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it&#39;s the end of the American experiment, and probably many of your lives.</p>

<p>Truly, the only thing that would stop all these is thousands of EMP devices being detonated in the air all across the globe, sending us back to the Stone Age.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just pointing this out until I get stopped, but here we have a <em>very</em> good reason to demand evidence that Russia &quot;hacked the election&quot; or hacked Clinton&#39;s server etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UMBRAGE</p>

<p>The CIA&#39;s hand crafted hacking techniques pose a problem for the agency. Each technique it has created forms a &quot;fingerprint&quot; that can be used by forensic investigators to attribute multiple different attacks to the same entity.</p>

<p>This is analogous to finding the same distinctive knife wound on multiple separate murder victims. The unique wounding style creates suspicion that a single murderer is responsible. As soon one murder in the set is solved then the other murders also find likely attribution.</p>

<p>The CIA&#39;s Remote Devices Branch&#39;s UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques &#39;stolen&#39; from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the &quot;fingerprints&quot; of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Supposedly Russian methods like FancyBear can have their &quot;fingerprints&quot; used by the CIA, making it look like Russians (or anyone else) committed a hack that was actually carried out by the CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say expert but pretty well versed. While in the Army I worked at the NSA doing SIGINT analyst, I sat in on hacking operations, and took courses provided by the NSA. I know a lot about our capabilities. </p>

<p>Since leaving the Army I have worked as a Intrusion Detection/Network Defense Analyst. When writing rules for Intrusion Detection Analysis tools like Snort, you can use markers that identify the exploits. There are also servers that exploits (usually a part of exploit kits) phone back to that are known to host certain types of exploits and are usually associated with specific countries of origin. </p>

<p>It would be very simple to just get a copy of an exploit that you have detected on a system, or develop an exploit and make it look like something from another country, or have it phone back to specific locations.</p>

<p>We never out right assume something comes from a country just based on specific markers like that because it is so easy to fake your origin online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it seems like they have released information that seems juicy, however when you really look at it, it&#39;s almost all stuff that has been released or suspected.  There was another leak that was supposed to bring down Hillary&#39;s campaign, and that&#39;s gone now with this in it&#39;s place.  If I were CIA this is what I would release to make it seem like everything at Wikileaks is normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point, but I interpret their recent events slightly differently. What has been revealed by WikiLeaks SHOULD have resulted in the prosecution of Clinton and anyone else involved in the illicit trading of state secrets, illegal political contributions and highly questionable weapons deals in the ME. The fact that nothing much came of it (yet) in terms of legal actions has more to do with the complexity of the situation as well as with an incredibly strong establishment opposition to such house-cleaning actions than with WikiLeaks not releasing enough damning information.</p>

<p>The same goes for this release, in my view. What was already revealed in this first part about the CIA (indeed much of which has long been suspected by careful observers) should be sufficient grounds to break up the agency many times over. The fact that it likely won&#39;t be taken down is again more testament to their power to control the narrative in the public&#39;s eye (those who do not think for themselves on these matters), rather than proof of WikiLeaks being compromised.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m still not entirely certain that Julian is alive and that their twitter account wasn&#39;t compromised at least at one point, but their publications in recent months have been ground-breaking evidence of real-life conspiracies we previously claimed were going on, but had trouble convincing the public of. It&#39;s still an uphill fight, but releases like these can be effective ammunition. I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to dismiss what they contain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah,  you&#39;re right that we shouldn&#39;t dismiss information that is helpful to the cause.  I have a feeling this leak is 100% true but not earth shattering.  I think next leak will be 80% true, then next 60% and so on until they are feeding us BS but most won&#39;t realize it.  If JA would just come to the balcony I wouldn&#39;t feel this way. I believe if he were there he would have by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Creeping corruption of trusted sources of information is certainly something to remain vigilant about, but I see no reason to suspect Wikileaks of going down that road at this point.</p>

<p>If you remember where MLK found his end, I can understand why Julian may want to stay away from balconies or open windows for the time being. For all we know he may not even be at the embassy anymore, the question then would be if he left on his own terms and is in hiding from authorities somewhere else, or if said authorities already got to him, in which case your suspicions would be very much warranted.</p>

<p>I see no reason to doubt the validity of their releases though at this point and going forward. My only concern is the degree to which they are curating their content, and what they may decide to keep hidden from the public. There may be legitimate reasons for doing this, but also dubious reasons in the sense of a limited hangout. </p>

<p>Trust but verify, I guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tried talking to my mother about this and she immediately just starts going off about Trump and how this is just a smear campaign against the CIA because Trump doesn&#39;t like them...</p>

<p>It&#39;s ridiculous how I can&#39;t talk about anything political without people foaming out the mouth over Trump here in SoCal. </p>

<p>Who cares that the CIA can turn off all your shit and use anything you say against you? Drumpf is dum dum cause the sophisticated CNN and NPR show hosts said so. Ignore how bad this is because Trump obviously worse! This is a partisan issue.</p>

<p>I get not liking the dude but fucking hell, can we talk about something not entirely related without deflecting? I understand it puts your perfect vision of Obama down the gutter, but the truth hurts and is quite frankly terrifying. I hate trying to discuss this with people close to me and they act so indifferent or just deflect. It&#39;s bizarre, whataboutism and identity politics need to take a break for the sake of the mental health of the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome.  I don&#39;t think I really did anything except voice the obvious.
Just thinking about it as I read my original statement and type this, I can go through the history of my car&#39;s GPS system and find out everywhere it&#39;s been.  When I bought it originally it had the old owners home address still logged as &quot;home&quot; and everywhere they had been.  When I didn&#39;t enter anything as &quot;home&quot; my wife asked me why, my response was &quot;Simply because if someone steals the car, they can press &quot;home&quot; and be brought, turn by turn to our house and rob us blind.  She hadn&#39;t ever thought of that.
We have Police vehicles that can see your license plate with an on board camera, automation is the destruction of our humanity, not necessarily Human Kind, but our humanity as people.
Growing up, I knew my neighbors, I knew their house was a safe place, I had memorized their phone numbers (everyone&#39;s really) and now what do we do? We look at a screen, we don&#39;t talk to each other anymore, we pass each other by, distracted by the shiny object in our hands and we NEVER ever question it anymore.... One thing a lot of people rarely ever do anymore is go outside and look upward.... Try it sometime you&#39;ll be amazed by what you see.   </p>

As for your statement &quot;they are not protecting us from terrorists&quot;, can you say that with 100% accuracy?  </p>

<p>Think about how many Android and iPhones there are around the World.  Think about now all the data they&#39;re collecting, it would be physically impossible to read all of that data, so you create a keyword flag and then review the filtered material.</p>

<p>Do I believe that this technology has been used also for nefarious purposes.. HELL YES I do. I believe the CIA has been keeping tabs on regular citizens since 9/11 and Bush went off the charts with his well publicized surveillance programs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not giving up my liberties for &quot;freedom&quot; or the illusion of such, I am well protected, I know what needs to be done to protect myself and my family and I am doing those things.  </p>

<p>You and I have the same beliefs that this is going to be used against the Citizens of our Country.  We are also of the same belief that it will only get worse from here. I agree... I&#39;m counting on it.<br/>
With that said though, this program, this technology directly effects a small number of people, it collects data from a large number but really only changes the lives of a small number of people. </p>

<p>I mean, knowing this today and not knowing it yesterday, how dramatically has your life changed? Can you tell me that?  </p>

<a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all">http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all</a></p>

<p>Some interesting notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We live in a connected world, and modern software has to navigate this world. So the building blocks for tomorrow&#39;s very largest solutions are connected and massively parallel. It&#39;s not enough for code to be &quot;strong and silent&quot; any more. Code has to talk to code. Code has to be chatty, sociable, well-connected. Code has to run like the human brain, trillions of individual neurons firing off messages to each other, a massively parallel network with no central control, no single point of failure, yet able to solve immensely difficult problems. And it&#39;s no accident that the future of code looks like the human brain, because the endpoints of every network are, at some level, human brains.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve done any work with threads, protocols, or networks, you&#39;ll realize this is pretty much impossible. It&#39;s a dream. Even connecting a few programs across a few sockets is plain nasty when you start to handle real life situations. Trillions? The cost would be unimaginable. Connecting computers is so difficult that software and services to do this is a multi-billion dollar business.</p>

<p>So we live in a world where the wiring is years ahead of our ability to use it. We had a software crisis in the 1980s, when leading software engineers like Fred Brooks believed there was no &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; to &quot;promise even one order of magnitude of improvement in productivity, reliability, or simplicity&quot;.</p>

<p>Brooks missed free and open source software, which solved that crisis, enabling us to share knowledge efficiently. Today we face another software crisis, but it&#39;s one we don&#39;t talk about much. Only the largest, richest firms can afford to create connected applications. There is a cloud, but it&#39;s proprietary. Our data and our knowledge is disappearing from our personal computers into clouds that we cannot access and with which we cannot compete. Who owns our social networks? It is like the mainframe-PC revolution in reverse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author is Pieter Hintjens, CEO of iMatix. Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While in his position as iMatix CEO, Hintjens founded the ZeroMQ software project together with Martin Sustrik. ZeroMQ is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library aimed at use in scalable distributed or concurrent applications.</p>

<p>In November 2013, Hintjens announced EdgeNet, a project building upon ZeroMQ for mesh networks. EdgeNet aims to build a secure, anonymous peer-to-peer alternative to the internet. Hintjens also authored several ZeroMQ projects, such as CZMQ, zproto, and Malamute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also found this blog post about EdgeNet:
<a href="https://taotetek.net/2013/11/04/the-edge-net-and-why-projects-like-this-matter/">https://taotetek.net/2013/11/04/the-edge-net-and-why-projects-like-this-matter/</a></p>

<p>Which includes this quote from Hintjens:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We built the Internet to be a space for freedom and opportunity. Instead it has become the greatest surveillance system ever. My name is Pieter Hintjens, CEO of iMatix, and I want you to help me fix that.</p>

<p>Without privacy and anonymity, we lose our freedom of speech. And without that, we become slaves to a narrative where the powerful run amok, without oversight or regulation. I truly believe we’re facing the extinction of our digital freedoms, and then our real world freedoms. By joining in this project and contributing, you help turn back the tide. – Pieter Hintjens</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EdgeNet aims to build a secure, anonymous peer-to-peer alternative to the internet. Did this alone make Hintjens a threat to the surveillance state? Did the CIA assassinate him? Cause of death was metastasized bile duct cancer that had spread to his lungs, and he chose voluntary euthanasia.  </p>

It&#39;s ALL there, all it takes is a reason (or an urge) and the proper job title to tap into that flow and be able to retrace any given smartphone using person&#39;s daily life including but not limited to: gps data, texts, phone conversations, &quot;secure&quot; chat apps, normal chat apps, internet history and emails.</p>

I haven&#39;t heard about this recently, but a couple of years ago a lot of people talked about how they would talk about something near their phone and computer, and then mysteriously ads will show up on their computer. Maybe some of these tools are being used used for all sorts of stuff - including black hat affiliate marketing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I woke up listening to the Bill Burr podcast yesterday and he mentioned how odd it was that people would buy 400 dollar Nike sneakers because they&#39;re &#39;Jordans&#39; or &#39;Kobes&#39;. So I got curious and did a Google search for a couple different Nike shoes to see what they look like and then went on with my day. <strong>That</strong> night around 12 hours later my credit card was used (and declined luckily) to buy 400 dollars worth of something from Nike.com. </p>

<p>Now that could just be a crazy coincidence but I thought they may use search behavior to better cater the purchases to your own interests to avoid fraud protection? I have no clue but it was a surreal moment for sure.</p>

By no means do I think our government is perfectly innocent, but looking though some of these documents it looks like alot of them are just proposed ideas and not things they&#39;ve actually done. That being said, they&#39;ve definitely done some shady shit. My point is pick your poison, the dictatorship of trump and Russia, or the shady but mostly free American government.</p>

And also tweet like crazy.  Do this for...mother Russia?  ....in order for me to even entertain Russia Trump w/out evidence, that explanation needs to not make me laugh...not happening.</p>

Sure if you&#39;re rich you&#39;ll be getting a tax break, but if you&#39;re the average american you&#39;re probably losing your healthcare. As for the Russia thing, last I checked at least 5 of his higher ups had ties to Russia, as for him just look at the companies he hires, not american, and generally have ties to Russia. Where there&#39;s smoke there is usually fire. Oh and between all the travel ban countries, there are  955621 visa holders and Refugees combined. Out of the 955621 only 28 were convicted to some degree of terrorism. P.s He&#39;s brought all of zero jobs back, he just takes credit for things companies where doing anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote this <a href="http://www.americandreamdigest.org/us-politics/-here-are-three-reasons-why-wikileaks-vault-7-threatens-you-personally-regardless-if-you-care-about-the-government-spying-on-you">article</a> to help convert nonbelievers. The article doesn&#39;t contain any information you don&#39;t already know, but it&#39;s written for the purpose of being palatable to the people who say, &quot;oh, i&#39;m not doing anything wrong, let &#39;em have at it.&quot;</p>

<p>TL;DR: three reasons for people to care about the CIA&#39;s hacking arsenal.</p>

<ol>
<li>The CIA <em>lost control</em> of their cyber arsenal. Now, not only do you need to trust the CIA, you need to trust everybody with a computer. Non-proliferation matters.</li>
<li>UMBRAGE wholly undermines the connection between Cozy Bear / Fancy Bear / Guccifer and DNC. If UMBRAGE isn&#39;t real (it is), then that needs to be refuted on the record, or else you can&#39;t claim Russian interference. UMBRAGE draws every forensic investigation moving forward into question.</li>
<li>The CIA chose to hoard zero day exploits, leaving millions of Americans to be preyed on by criminal hackers, despite repeated assurances by the Obama administration that they&#39;d do no such thing.</li>
</ol>

<p>We need to convert people, or else this isn&#39;t going nowhere fast since the MSM is pulling the nothing to see here charade. Average Joe isn&#39;t going to care that the CIA is listening through his television, but he might care that the CIA acted incredibly negligently, then can spoon feed from there.</p>

<p>I wrote the article with that goal in mind.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot seem to get conspiracy nor wikileaks thread to approve a new post for this but I have have found some damning evidence.</p>

<p>CIA may have attack servers in China.</p>

<p>Wikileaks accidentally may have forgotten to censor a post. I tried posting this on the subreddit /WikiLeaks but it was not approved.</p>

<p>The screenshot does not censor the username of the windows user davidb and also fails to censor 2 very interesting IP&#39;s</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/files/image2015-6-26%206:56:10.png">https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/files/image2015-6-26%206:56:10.png</a></p>

<p>Here is what INTRIGUES me mostly. The IP he runs tracert on is from China</p>

<p>Lookup IP Address Location For IP: 220.231.37.144 Continent: Asia (AS) Country: China IP Location Find In China (CN) Capital: Beijing State: Beijing City Location: Beijing</p>

<p>reference for page <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_18383036.html">https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_18383036.html</a></p>

<p>Does CIA have a VPN in China to make it look like China is the source country of hacking attempts?</p>

<p>Take a look at the next screenshot of the tracert to the 220.231.37.145 IP address</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/files/image2015-6-25%2013:51:59.png">https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/files/image2015-6-25%2013:51:59.png</a></p>

<p>Note how the IP ends in 145 this time instead of 144 and the number of hops to reach that IP. Also take note of the ms it takes to reach the destination 1ms. That means whoever took this screenshot is connected to the same network.</p>

<p>Comment with your thoughts.</p>

<p>The CIA may have a range of servers in the 220.231.37.XXX range</p>

It&#39;s almost like the CIA wants their data uploaded to clearnet from targets to make it look like other countries are the culprits. If I were the CIA and I wanted to remain 100% anonymous on my malware, I&#39;d have my trojan download a copy of tor.exe run it on startup and have the clients upload data to an onion instead of clearnet. I was decompiling a .reg file that contained a base64 encoded dll that infected pc&#39;s and it uploaded the target&#39;s data to notepad.cc (never used or heard of until then) site is no longer functional (which is also odd) apparently the site was a lot like pastebin but more secure.</p>

<p>While the length is good, it&#39;s not hard to crack because:
1.  it&#39;s formulaic.   The first letter is always capitalized.
2.  No numbers
3.  No special characters
4.  It&#39;s using actual words.  </p>

<p>But, as they have posted it on reddit, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re worried about people cracking it.   :)  </p>
