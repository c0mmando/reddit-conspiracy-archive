But when he lost to Hilary and after everyone saw how they sabotaged Bernie I think a lot of people jumped ship.  I think a lot of people really hate Hillary and just aren&#39;t as vocal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve already said, in this thread, that Clinton was an abysmal candidate. My issue with reducing the answer to that is that Trump is point for point as bad, with the exception of never having held public office before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s was a pretty huge exception in the last election. </p>

<p>GOP knew going into the election a certain number of states were a lock like they always are for the Republicans. Trump needed to flip the Rust Belt states and he worked his ass off campaigning there while Clinton barely showed up--never showed up in a couple of them! </p>

<p>Do not dismiss the importance of actually going out there and asking for citizen&#39;s votes. Clinton presumed she was getting them while Trump was on the stump--day after day, three stops a day--giving speeches and asking for their votes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anybody can deny Trump displayed behavior that suggested he wanted it more, while Clinton displayed behavior that suggested she deserved it more. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s meme minions also crushed Clinton&#39;s. And at least some parts of the military and intelligence community were behind him, that&#39;s pretty clear. </p>

<p>But mostly people just hated her. HATED her. I traveled around the country a lot over last summer and saw tons of Trump signs, they must&#39;ve outnumbered Clinton signs 100-1, or more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s time to put this irrational and delusional argument to bed. </p>

<p>Clinton won the popular vote because of California and no other reason. The vast vast vast majority of districts country wide voted for Trump, with a few urban areas falling in line for Clinton. </p>

<p>I wish there WOULD be an investigation into illegal immigrants voting in California, because several friends of mine who live in state in two separate urban regions said they saw people without ID and without cards just come in and allowed to vote provisionally. Whether these votes were counted or not, I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>What I do know is that there was all kinds of strange discrepancies about uncounted votes and provisional votes during the Democratic primary in California, and that Sanders tight race somehow swung to Clinton significantly in the end, which still doesn&#39;t pass the smell test for me. Thus, neither does the general election.</p>

<p>But even if you take corruption and cheating off the table, the fact remains that Trump dominated in regional county voting and the Electoral College. If the country was not based on Electoral College, perhaps the campaigning would have worked differently. </p>

<p>Clinton lost every Rust Best state she should have won. Trump knew what states he had to win, and California wasn&#39;t one of them. </p>

<p>The Electoral College system has always leaned towards conservative states since the Reagan Revolution since most smaller states are conservative and again, you can win the electoral college with only 22% of the vote by specifically going after the smaller states.

<p>Would be nice to get some voting reform going, including a voter ID measure to help ensure the integrity of the voting system, so that we can stop speculating about how many votes were illegal or not. Also need paper ballots everywhere.</p>

<p>People voted for Trump because they feel the existing system doesn&#39;t matter. Ignoring their concerns and whining about your own misinterpretation of why people voted for him isn&#39;t persuasive.</p>

<p>This constant whining and conspiracy theories about putin attacking america with propaganda the way America attacked the Soviet Union is irrelevant. It&#39;s the reason the Democrats and Hillary Clinton are now less popular than the media.</p>

<p>The Clinton team purposely elevated Trump because they viewed him as the easiest candidate to beat. Remember the story of the Pied Piper? At the end of the day he led away the rats and the children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of the belief that it was a perfect storm of stupidity vs a guy who has fought the NY Post for 40 years!  The GOP ran pussies in the primary!  Bush tried to scare off all comers by racking up a $100 Million war chest but didn&#39;t really have a message other than &quot;I&#39;m the better Bush kid&quot;.  After Trump took him out with &quot;Low Energy&quot; it was all over but the crying!  SNL called him &quot;Jebra&quot; and he was out.</p>

<p>The rest of the GOP crew were cable news ratings gold! And then CNN &amp; MSNBC turned on Trump cause he was beating everyone &amp; could make it all the way!  Trump then as is now is pure ratings gold and sucked up all the air in the room and anyone he went against had to reply to what he said vs pushing out their message!  It was glorious! haha</p>

<p>Then the DNC gave him the biggest gift and put Hillary&#39;s Nomination in a rigged primary against Bernie!  It showed how corrupt the entire system was from the Democrats side.  Sure we thought it might be but then you saw DWS &amp; Donna Brazil totally act out some shady shit!  It was beautiful!  Everytime they did something shady he would tweet and they would have to spend real $$$ to fight him!</p>

<p>Also it didn&#39;t help that Hillary&#39;s only message was I have a vagina &amp; it&#39;s my turn!  Here is a gender reversal video of a Female Trump vs. a Male Hillary and you will see she never had a chance!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many of the facts that Trump asserted were also completely untrue, but Trump didn&#39;t care. He and his audience knew that much of what he said bore little relationship to reality.</p>

<p>This meant that Trump defeated journalism.</p>

<p>Because the journalists central belief was that their job was to expose lies and assert the truth. With Trump this became irrelevant.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly Putin admired this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few moments later in the doc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Liberals were outraged by Trump, but they expressed their beliefs in cyberspace so it had no effect. Because the algorithms made sure they only spoke to people who already agreed with them. Instead, ironically, their waves of angry messages and tweets benefited the large corporations that ran the social media platforms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially we live in a fake world - Trump recognized this and had the existing connections and capital to secure the position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump spent less, but campaign spending by and for Trump still totaled like a billion dollars.</p>

<p>This is an extremely complex question, but part of this is a flawed premise as the Russians were a culpable party. Another was the media who handed Trump a blank-check for air time. Another important factor was the fact that the Republican primary featured <em>seventeen</em> candidates. That&#39;s often overlooked, but it was critical - particularly since most of them did not take Trump seriously early on.</p>

<p>There is no single factor, though, and anyone who says there is is a simpleton. Everything from Russia&#39;s interference to Comey&#39;s letter being leaked played a role in shaping the outcome of the electoral college. From 20 years of Fox News hating on Clinton to the well-understood hypocrisy of Evangelicals played it&#39;s part - who believed, for example, in 2011 that personal immorality was politically disqualifying 70% to 30% but completely flipped those numbers to 28% to 72% in 2016. Don&#39;t even get me started on the people who honestly think all the coal jobs are coming back to some key swing states. (Hint: they&#39;re not.) That&#39;s just a few examples from the <em>Republican</em> side. There are at least dozens more - and then it&#39;s time to start on nonpartisan issues before eventually working on to the Democratic side of the equation.</p>
