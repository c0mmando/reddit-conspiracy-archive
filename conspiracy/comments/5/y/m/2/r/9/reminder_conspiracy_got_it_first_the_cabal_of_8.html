    <div class="md"><p>Well yes, as sibling says, the 4th dimension is time.  As they say, he who controls the past controls the future.  </p>

<p>But more interesting is to take a step back and stop being a judgmental clown.  What do you possibly gain by being dismissive and nasty?  (Do you really care about down votes?)</p>

<p>When I read &quot;inter dimensional&quot; I interpret it as &quot;things&quot; not fully explained  by science.  </p>

<p>For example, ill utilize a real world case where engineers use &quot;dimension&quot; in a way you may be unfamilar with.  That is Dimensional Analysis, where quantities such as Mass, Time, Distance, and others are used to normalize a problem in order to estimate how varying the scale of a problem effects some output.</p>

<p>That was tertiary information, but perhaps could help with reframing your bias. </p>

<p>So, continuing, <strong>the greatest, most powerful &quot;not-understood&quot; dimension is &quot;consciousness&quot;</strong></p>

<p>He who controls consciousness, legitimately, and undeniably controls the future, present and past.  That quote above?  Well, if its not obvious, to control the past, one needs to control consciousness.  </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s up to you to decide if &quot;dimension&quot; is a right word to describe consciousness.  I think its a great description. I presume you conflated it with Archons from the 9th dimension, which is much closer to word salad, albeit not unproven.</p>

<p><strong>Tldr; were being influenced by a war on consciousness.  This force exists beyond the spatial dimensions for sure, and, even the massive and temporal dimensions.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, thanks for your answer.  Not a fan of people claims something to be true without evidence though.  Sorry if my disdain of that bothered you.  I stand by it.</p>

<p>I will consider everything you have offered, though at this stage it appears to be speculative.  Please offer where you ground your beliefs on.  I understand you can&#39;t provide evidence for everything for the interest of time, but you have not provided enough evidence for anyone to consider this in a serious manner.</p>

<p>You can claim anything to me no matter how crazy it sounds, as long as you do your part in supporting your claims with evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t experience the phenomenon of consciousness?</p>

<p>No explanation in the physical realm will give us answers about the immaterial.  Consciousness doesn&#39;t exist in a singular location.  It doesn&#39;t exist anywhere in the spatial or time coordinates.  What&#39;s my evidence?</p>

<p>Think about it.  What we perceive is the singular.  But science&#39;s current paradigm of reductionism will never yield answers in the realm of the &quot;inter dimensions&quot;.</p>

<p>As for evidence that this dimension is manipulable by evil forces?  Look no further than mind hacking propaganda and ignoble lies sold as truth</p>

<p>And also the Archons that attack people who hear voices (schizophrenics)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank God, someone here with a little bit of sense. joondori21  --- I have so many questions.</p>

<p>Could you please explain where humanity came from and why we are here? What is consciousness? Are thoughts just a result of blood, guts and brain matter? Or do they originate somewhere else? Do we a soul?</p>

<p>If we don&#39;t have a soul and our universe is purely physical, then what came before that? Was it just a singularity and if so, what the fuck is a singularity? </p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re an atheist, please, help me understand, how does something come from nothing?</p>

<p>Is nothing even possible? Nothing means No Thing ... implying there has to be a thing, so technically there is no such thing as nothing. 😜</p>

<p>Thank you for your time, it&#39;s rare to come across someone who knows everything and I&#39;m a little excited. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to think consciousness is a bandwidth which permeates existence searching for hosts in order to observe itself.</p>

<p>A soul seems to the culmination in the lower self contacting the inner self while reaching for the higher self of any varying approximation of this notion, sometimes resulting in a &quot;lack there of&quot;.</p>

<p>A singularity is a point of origin. </p>

<p>Condensed existence if you will.</p>

<p>Nothing or Zero is indeed impossible within the realm of our existence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a notion that is inherently incompatible with... all of this.</p>

<p>Which is why Zero is not valued as an actual Numeral.</p>

<p>It is a representation for what surrounded the singularity from which we spawned.</p>

<p>The singularity expanded and due to it&#39;s perfect Geometry, it pushed all of non existence into the ether (which is to say nowhere)as far as we are concerned.</p>

<p>Just a bunch of thoughts I have been toying with but they are all predicated upon years of research, study and an immense amount of thought experiments.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe any of this as absolute truth but I would certainly love input in order to further develop the theories.</p>

<p>Discussion often yields further understanding and comprehension after-all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was never nothing. Our universe is a microcosm, and time as we understand it is not how it works in the universe at large.</p>

<p>To go even deeper, you could argue that &quot;time&quot; is cyclical (see Doctor Who episode &quot;Blink&quot; for a pop explanation). In which case, there was never nothing, because our universe is an ouroboros, for all intents and purposes. It is self-contained, but merely a grain of sand on an endless beach that only continues to expand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, have you heard of &quot;god of the gaps&quot; fallacy?  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps</a></p>

<p>I encourage you to familiarize with that concept.  Then think of &quot;inter-dimensional entities of the gaps&quot;.  The important point here, is that the burden of proof is on the person that claims something to be true.</p>

<p>What I am pointing out, that NONE of these people have honored their burden of proof.  If you here many people doing that that is usually a sign of collective cognitive dissonance.  A la, religion-Scientology, JW.  Just because you speculate something, doesn&#39;t make it true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, have you heard of &quot;god of the gaps&quot; fallacy?  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps</a></p>

<p>I encourage you to familiarize with that concept.  Then think of &quot;inter-dimensional entities of the gaps&quot;.  The important point here, is that the burden of proof is on the person that claims something to be true.</p>

<p>What I am pointing out, is that NONE of these people have honored their burden of proof.  If you hear many people doing that that is usually a sign of collective cognitive dissonance.  A la, religion-Scientology, JW, etc happen because people start believing in what they speculate.  Just because you speculate something, doesn&#39;t make it true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The extra dimensions in question don&#39;t have room for physical space.</p>

<p>The beings that occupy these dimensions would consist of pure energy and not be bound to a timeline or physical travel constraints.</p>

<p>They feed off the outpouring of energy from out dimension.</p>

<p>Any strong frequency we emmit, be it from the low or high end of the spectrum is essentially a power/fiood source.</p>

<p>Ofcourse this is all open to interpretation but it&#39;s pretty funny how most intellectuals are arriving at the same conclusion in these regards.</p>

<p>Especially when you consider there are cabals all over this planet who control governments/worlds and seem to find interest in these notions and practices.</p>

<p>All we can do is look where the information points us.</p>

<p>The only cowards in this thread are the ones chastising others for daring to think outside the box.</p>

<p>Stop trying to sequester information and stop attacking your fellow man because you lack information and refuse to implore critical thinking.</p>

<p>You are accusing me of not using my critical thinking abilities and not grounding my opinions based on facts?  Do you even hear yourself?</p>

<p>How the fuck are you telling me to base opinion based on evidence when you offered NONE.</p>

<ul>
<li>Who are these intellectuals that&#39;s arriving in these conclusions?</li>
<li>Apparently I lack information: provide your goddamn information, instead of spitballing out of your ass.</li>
<li>Instead of just &quot;asserting so&quot; this is true, why don&#39;t you provide your empirical evidence that I can critique?  Don&#39;t you fucking see how you are telling me something is true without providing evidence and are accusing me of exactly what you are guilty of? I have asserted NOTHING, except that no one has provided a reasoning behind the assertions YOU are making.  Do you honestly not see the irony?</li>

<p>Support YOUR assertions with facts before accusing me of lacking critical thinking skills.  Burden of proof is on you, buddy.  I can&#39;t believe I even have to say that to you.</p>

<p>You failed the comprehension/reading part of the test.</p>

<p>F-</p>

<p>Please see me after class!</p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li>The intellectuals arriving at this conclusion both reside in this very comment thread as well as other varying places of open internet discussion that you are free to search for yourself. (Not to mention the very cabals being spoken of in this thread itself. herp derp.)</li>
</ul>

<p>*I&#39;ve given you direct answers that you refuse to look into because it challenges your worldview and scares you.</p>

<p>*This is where you failed the comprehension aspect of the quiz. I already stated that none of this was anything other than speculation worth furthering research into and that I would indeed NOT be doing the legwork for you as you are behaving like a petulant child and would take issue with anything I presented you. </p>

<p>*Further more you absolutely DID assert that these notions were completely invalid.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now before you take that tone again.</p>

<p>I am not your mother.</p>

<p>I will not coddle you because you are hateful and lazy. </p>

<p>A good TEACHER, points his students in the right direction and allows them to do there own research.</p>

<p>The incapable will complain and the rest will flourish.</p>

<p>But if you would rather continue acting like a petulant child and ignore your options instead of putting in the legwork yourself then that is fine.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if you sequester your existence out of ignorance.</p>

<p>That is your choice and yours alone.</p>

<p>You asked a question and got an answer you were unhappy with so you whined some more before falling back on emotional appeals and pointing he finger at others.</p>

<p>Fact of the matter is I never stated any of this was fact.</p>

<p>I left it all open for interpretation because there is no scientific consensus and we are still developing methodology for testing certain portions of these theories via scientific principles.</p>

<p>You just want to whine and be hateful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahahahahahah Wow!</p>

<p>This is the DEFINITION of asinine.  I don&#39;t need a teacher, buddy.  And you sure as hell ain&#39;t one.  You can&#39;t teach me because you do not possess any &quot;knowledge&quot; to transfer to me.  Speculation is not a knowledge you blistering fool!</p>

<p>How the hell are you telling me to support my assertion with facts when you are saying you can just &quot;speculate&quot;?  That&#39;s some ridiculous cognitive dissonance if I ever saw one.  Stop calling me &quot;ignorant&quot; or tell me I&#39;m &quot;choosing to not learn&quot; when you have offered NOTHING but speculation.  How are you this dense?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give credence to fools that claim something is true without bothering to support THEIR claims with FACTS.  So come back to me with FACTS, before you call anyone names.</p>

<p>You think you can just spitball out of your ass your wildest imaginations and call yourself a teacher?  Have you no respect for the work of teaching and transferring knowledge through the hard work of gathering empirical evidence to forge the understanding of truth?  If I wanted to hear some fool blabber about some shit they pulled out of their ass without FACTS, I would have gone to the subway in the middle of the night and listen to the displaced souls yell in to the void.</p>

<p>Your grandiose delusions of self-enlightenment does not faze me in the least.  What I respect is the truth the ones that honor the proper process of epistemology.  Don&#39;t ever mistake your delusions for knowledge, buddy.  Children speculate.  Men back up their claims with evidence.  I know which one you are.</p>

It remains in our dimension, safe and sound.  I understand how someone would be afraid of things that they do not fully understand.  (Just like how people in the past feared newer technology).

<p>I mean, who has proof these other countries actually exist? It could just be a box of crayons. It&#39;s not like anyone has actually seen these people, and if they did, they&#39;d need to send them back to get inline with their proper crayola packaging.</p>
