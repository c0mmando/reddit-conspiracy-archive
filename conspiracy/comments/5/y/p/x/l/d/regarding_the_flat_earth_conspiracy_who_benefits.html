       I'm sure there are a couple flat-earthers in here, and I'm just looking for a proper answer to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       All major conspiracy theories have one thing in common.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Illuminati are engaged in mind control
         <strong>
          to establish the New World Order
         </strong>
         , and use hidden symbols
         <strong>
          to communicate
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Roswell was covered up
         <strong>
          to prevent mass hysteria
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         JFK was assassinated by the CIA
         <strong>
          because he wanted peace with Russia
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Beatles secretly replaced Paul McCartney with a lookalike
         <strong>
          because they were afraid they would lose fans without him
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NASA faked the moon landing
         <strong>
          to beat the Soviets in the space race
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The AIDS virus was created in a lab
         <strong>
          to reduce world population
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Elvis Presley faked his own death
         <strong>
          to escape his fame
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Royals killed Diana
         <strong>
          because she was an adulterer
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bush did 9/11
         <strong>
          so he could invade Iraq
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese
         <strong>
          in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Each one of these, regardless of whether it's true (I don't believe any of them are) or even scientifically plausible (the moon landing one definitely
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       ), at least makes sense from a motivational standpoint. Someone gains from the deception. So my question is,
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       would every country in the world take part in this massive conspiracy that ultimately gains nothing? It makes literally no difference to anyone whether the Earth is round or flat, so what is the incentive to lie?
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory perhaps had some credibility when it was simply a difference of interpretation of facts. "No, reality doesn't fit your model, you are wrong". Fine. But in the rocket age, it's no longer "you're wrong"... it's "you're knowingly lying to us".

       People believe what they see. They can see that the earth is flat, and nowhere on earth can the curvature be measured. That seems to be a pretty good basis for a genuine conviction. It's called: the scientific method.

       You wrote, "I just don't get it," in reference to people existing with genuine conviction that the Earth is flat. What is not to get? A normal person cannot conduct observational experiments to find the curve of the earth. It cannot be done. They have to believe what they are told.

       No. That has never been true, not even at the higher altitudes of  private jets. I take it you've never been in a cockpit before during flight. The views are awesome, but none of them are ever curved. It simply does not happen.

       Your information is wrong, you can definitely see it from a plane. Also you can see the curvature of the earth a much more simple way when you are watching the hull of a boat disappear over the horizon before it's masts disappear.. be ignorant in your own world, but don't speak uneducated beliefs and lies as truth when a person has a valid question.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You will be able to detect the curvature of the earth from an aeroplane at a cruising height of around 10,600 metres (35,000 feet), but you need a fairly wide field of view (ie 60 degrees) and a virtually cloud-free horizon.

       Absolute bullshit.  There is ZERO curvature seen at 35,000 feet.  It's perfectly level and at eye level all around you.  Identical at the top of any peak.  You're speaking easily disproven nonsense.

       Speaking from my own experience and observations, from the cockpit of the plane, you cannot see any curvature of the earth. It might be there, but it is not something that can be seen. The same is true for your horrible boat example. Pull out a magnifying device, and the haul reappears. That cannot happen if the haul disappeared do to the curvature. Again, that doesn't mean that the curvature doesn't exist, it simply means that is not the cause of your observation.

       I don't get it. The shape of the Earth does not imply anything about the existence of God. Christian scholars have depicted the Earth as round for centuries.

       It clearly states there is a firmament in the sky. The earth can't be round and have a firmament.

       And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

       Neither model makes a lick of sense. The first is obviously wrong, because you can fly between two "opposite sides of the disc" in the same time it takes to fly between two points much closer together. The second seems to imply that one could go around this firmament using a submarine and float up to God.

       Which is exactly what you should do when new evidence is discovered. If the Bible says one thing and direct observational evidence says another, then either the Bible is wrong or you are interpreting it incorrectly. Since in Christianity the Bible can't be wrong, the idea of a literal Genesis must be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible says many things that we know today to not be literally true. 90% of Christians take the sane approach and call the stuff that doesn't fit metaphorical. The alternative is insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, if the whole point of the conspiracy is to suppress the existence of God, why would the Pope and other Christian leaders go along with it? It seems like the kind of thing they would be against, yet for centuries Christian artists have depicted a round Earth.

       The Bible is Gods word, NOTHING should be changed. It says there is a firmament, so there IS a firmament. No man's word can change that. There is a lot of other evidence of a flat earth also too.

       I don't get this logic at all. The Bible makes extensive use of metaphor; not everything that is written is literally true. Is Jesus literally made out of bread?

       Sorry to break it too you but there is an almost 100% chance the bible you follow has already been edited. Its been cut and pasted dozens of times with bits added and taken away each time. Just look into the books that were removed from the bible and also the reasons they were taken out.

       Then you have the whole "it wasn't written in English" debate. The way old texts are translated can dramatically change there meaning and context.

       It kinda does. If the earth is flat and there is a firmament above it, then that means all of astrophysics and much of our other scientific understanding isn't a real thing. And if that's the case, and the earth is flat (I most certainly do not believe it is) then it would imply that "earth" and what's on it is all there is. And that implies a hell of a lot.

       Anyway, lets assume for a moment that the earth is indeed a huge disc rather than a sphere, there is only one reason every country in the world would conspire to keep it from us...... Control.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, there is only one thing that every single country would agree to withhold....... The origins and/or the evolution of human life
      </p>
      <p>
       let's imagine that christianity is the "correct" religion, that we are all descendants of adam and eve, who were created, along with this planet, the stars and all that there is.... by one god, and at the end of ones earth life you shall be judged by god..... with the world the way it is, it would do a lot more harm than good to find irrefutable proof of that
      </p>
      <p>
       or maybe theres evidence that we are not actually native to earth
      </p>
      <p>
       or that at some point in time some primates were genetically altered by aliens, and we're the result
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we really are all in some kind of simulation and theres evidence beyond the so called antarctic ice wall
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically proof of anything that doesnt fit the current narrative would destroy society and civilization as we know it
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that wouldn't be so bad for humanity overall, but initially it would be very, very bad

       Have you studied the history of the Bible? Some words don't mean the same thing as they did back then, some had no direct translation and were subject to the scribes who were translating from Hebrew to Greek to old English. Perhaps "firmament" meant "land" at some point? Land would separate the waters from the waters. Compared to water , land seems firm.

       It really isn't. Apart from the fact trivial math proves the Earth is round, for several different nations to fabricate video evidence of a globe Earth would require a massive conspiracy which benefits nobody. Critical thinking says that's not going to happen.

       Tell me this "trivial math" that proves a globe earth.
No massive conspiracy is needed when people are massively stupid and easily led.

       When people think for themselves then they start to ask basic questions. Until then we have a population of ediots who need to be told how to think.

       Lol. The same example stick shadow example that is always used as "proof" of a round earth with parallel light rays. This same example can also be used just as easily to prove a flat earth model with divergent sun rays.
