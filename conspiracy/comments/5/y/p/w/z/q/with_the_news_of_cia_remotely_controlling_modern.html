    <div class="md"><p>No, Reagan started the &quot;Obama Phones&quot; program and George W Bush expanded it to cover cellphones. Fox News just assigned the blame to Obama; give you two guesses why - and if any of them is &quot;race&quot;, &quot;because Democrat&quot;, or &quot;both&quot; you&#39;d be right. What else Fox didn&#39;t tell people is that the modernization of the Lifeline program from landlines to cellphones isn&#39;t happening because cellphones are hip, it&#39;s because cell service is becoming cheaper than landline service. Particularly <em>crappy</em> cell service. Oh, they also didn&#39;t mention how few minutes people received, etc. The crap flip-phones the companies gave out.</p>

<p>So, Obama Phones aren&#39;t real but Lifeline is and it is paid for by a fee on telecommunications providers.</p>

As for evidence of ties between Trump and Russia, of lies to cover-up those ties, and resignations from the campaign <em>and</em> the administration due to it - there is plenty out there. I know it all gets automatically rejected here as fake news, but saying that doesn&#39;t make it so. Nor does saying that &quot;if it were real, the entire MSM wouldn&#39;t be reporting on it!&quot;. Frankly, that is a ridiculous notion. I mean, assume for a moment that the entire MSM here and abroad is under the control of the CIA and they&#39;re all working together on taking down Trump - would they then ignore this story if it were real? Or would they really focus on it? At best - assuming the worst about the entire media - it just means that you can&#39;t trust a word they&#39;re saying. Not that they&#39;re lying, just that you don&#39;t know. Which leaves us with a president bizarrely dedicated to Russia, an administration lying to cover-up their meetings with Russian government officials, then resigning and recusing themselves over it, Trump attempting to deflect the investigation onto Obama, Russian meddling in western elections, Trump&#39;s staunch refusal to reveal his tax returns, etc, etc. The majority of Americans want an independent investigation for a reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good thing this isn&#39;t r/provencrimes, then. Good thing this is all still being investigated. I mean, I&#39;d prefer President Pence, I suppose - but better for the country if things are done with all due diligence.</p>

<p>Particularly good in this case, since I see you think Flynn was an Obama plant meant to make Trump look like a Russian agent. I bet the mythical Trump peepee tape could be, ah, leaked by the FSB and you&#39;d be like, &quot;Oh yeah! Obama is GOING DOWN! #OBAMAGATE #thanksFSB&quot;.</p>

<p>There is a bipartisan demand for an investigation at the top levels of Congress, the majority of Americans want an independent investigation - including a lot of Republicans - and law enforcement/the IC/allies/many noteworthy private sector firms agree on Russian interference in our election. I&#39;m not surprised that isn&#39;t enough for a lot of Trump supporters to agree that an investigation is warranted - no, in fact they want to investigate Obama - but I do think they will be surprised by the outcome of investigations underway and to come.</p>

Some states can really shaft their citizens that way, but $1 isn&#39;t bad.

<p>Nowadays there are more cellphones than landlines, and nearly as many cellphones as people - I&#39;m willing to bet it costs less to setup and maintain a new cell customer than a landline customer. Eventually it&#39;ll be weird to have a landline, I bet. Or it&#39;ll be VOIP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Car nut here,</p>

<p>The only method that is certain to &quot;kill&quot; a car that has been hijacked is to install a manual battery kill switch so the battery can be shut off manually -- common practice in many racing cars.</p>

<p>Further more, full remote control would require a wireless connection via internet, etc. Vehicles without a connection are still susceptible if they are relatively modern and have a CANBUS system that can be physically compromised -- basically any car with an ECU.</p>

<p>If you want security, you need old school -- no computer to adjust timing, ignition, no power features.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, your car runs on the alternator. The battery is only for starting the vehicle. Though disconnecting the battery can strain the alternator as it might overheat as it will operate at higher voltage due to faulty signal from ecu telling it to continue charging the battery since it won&#39;t realize it&#39;s missing.</p>

<p>Alternators run at a slightly higher voltage periodically(cold,after start-up, etc..) to keep the battery maintained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, no. Please don&#39;t comment on matters you clearly aren&#39;t educated on. Switching from a physical accelerator cable attached to the pedal to an electronic throttle is still quite a bit away from being able to remotely control a vehicle. Also, the vast majority of non-luxury cars (honda, etc) still rely on a physical master cylinder based hydraulic brake system that cannot being tampered with remotely. Now Mercedes,Bmw&#39;s etc.. the newer ones say 2010+ are a different story, though I haven&#39;t worked on many cars newer than 2003 or so, as I left the auto industry in 2009.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think once you physically gained access to the OBD connector you could flash instructions to be executed later once certain parameters are reached... you couldn&#39;t hit a button on a remote control and make the car crash but you could make the brakes fail once the car hit 65mph or make the park assist violently kick in after 30 minutes of operation. Hacking and sabotage for sure... just not wirelessly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also keep in mind that many people listen to music streaming into their phones, fed to the car by Bluetooth or by a USB cable. The entertainment system in the car is attached to the CANBUS. So either the Bluetooth system itself could be compromised at short range, or data could be fed through your hacked phone into the car&#39;s CANBUS.</p>

<p>There was some detailed, and probably plausible, speculation that simply playing a song with hidden data in it (either by CD, USB, or Bluetooth streaming from your phone) would be enough to compromise the CANBUS. This may have been what the CIA or other spook agency used to kill Michael Hastings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My uncle had a Datsun truck.  Once my mother borrowed it to pick up a load of manure from a local chicken-farm.  She had them fill the back of the truck with manure right up to the top and then we left for home.  When she exited the chicken-farm and took a left to merge with traffic, the truck continued straight.  It crossed 4 lanes of traffic to the other side of the road and no amount of steering would cause it to change direction.</p>

<p>Nothing appeared wrong when we got out of the truck to see what happened.  I had my mom turn the steering wheel while I was watching the front tires.  They turned just fine.  Actually, much easier than normal because the front tires were hovering about a half-inch off the ground.  The weight of the manure in the back of the truck had levered the front of the truck just high enough so that steering was impossible.</p>

<p>What did we do?  Well, this was the 1970&#39;s so we did exactly what you would think.  I ride home on the hood along with a couple bags of cement the chicken-farm had lying by the gate.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I miss that Datsun.</p>

<p>Of course cars of that period may be mildly compromised wirelessly with stuff like OnStar or a keyless remote, but it&#39;s more along the lines of being able to kill the engine and/or unlock doors than having it be fully remote controlled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree, Ive seen the video of people hacking a car and it seems incredibly likely that the intelligence agencies can do that sort of thing...
That being said, if there hasn&#39;t actually been any proof of it happening, then nobody should ever make a definitive statement saying that they 100% do it. Pretty simple</p>

Are you really suggesting that the president who took over 8 years ago promoted a program taking in old cars so consumers would buy new cars which could then be controlled by the CIA in the chance that the government would then have the opportunity to kill a US citizen whenever they want?

    <div class="md"><p>I expect to get downvoted to hell, but unless I read wrong, the info leaked on this subject says they were looking into being able to remotely control cars. However every post about this touts it as fact they definitely did it and that Obama is behind it. I thought the consensus was that the president does not have direct control over the CIA? From all the hacker conferences that have tried to penetrate the drive train of a vehicle, it was required to have physical access to the vehicle to be able to remotely control the drivetrain. Of course the CIA maybe find a way around this but auto manufactures deliberately separate the systems to make it impossible for someone compromising the &quot;connected&quot; part of the car and the computer controlled drivetrain. There is more than enough bullshit about the CIA that has been leaked , we do not need to fabricate our own assumptions without provided proof. </p>

<p>There is a difference between saying that the CIA may posses to possibility of doing this, and Obama ordered assassinations with this method. I guess truth and facts are lost on most of this crowd unfortunately because this is a great forum of people questioning what we are told, but making up our own facts only hurts the cause. </p>
