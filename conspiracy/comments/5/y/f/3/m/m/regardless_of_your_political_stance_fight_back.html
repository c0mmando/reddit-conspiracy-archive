       Don't fall into this trap of thinking that one party is better than the other, or one party is more corrupt than the other. Also don't fall into the trap of thinking only CNN news is biased, or FOX news is biased. They are all fucking biased no matter what, they are all fucking part of MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are divided then we are weak. If we unite, forgetting politics, forgetting parties, then we can organize and work against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and conquer people. It's one of the world's oldest tactics to control a mass population.
      </p>
      <p>
       So forget your religion, forget your party affiliation, forget all that shit let's all go into our local communities, find and recruit people, and TAKE THE POWER BACK.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB don't want us to see each other together.

       But things will change. Only if we unite, will they change.

       There is just so much misinformation and politics is too connected to everything. I'd say 'organize' but I think groupthink is what brought us here. The need for lijes and upvotes on everything that we think or present to the world...deadens are own ability to be individuals.
