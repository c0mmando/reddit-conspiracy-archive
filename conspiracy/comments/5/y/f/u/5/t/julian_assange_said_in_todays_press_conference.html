       that's a good point, but that isn't what's expressed by him saying he's "watching to see how the world responds". the world's response shouldn't be a factor into whether more details get published. more details should get published anyway even if not a single person exhibits the responses they're looking for.

       It does in some regards.  When Snowden &amp; Greenwald were releasing their leak, they would release a little, watch the Government deny some aspect, then come out with more information showing they lied about it.  It was great and went on for a couple months.  I think they're waiting for the CIA or Government to have an official response so they can counter.  Although it looks like the Government isn't really responding besides the denial on Colbert.

       "Wikileaks has a lot more information on what has been going on with the cyber weapons program. So i want to announce today that after considering what we think is the best way to proceed. Hearing these calls from some of these manufacturers, we have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured. And then once this material is effectively disarmed by us by removing critical components, we will publish additional details about what has been occurring."

       my thinking was that they've already risked their life with the first 1% of info. if they stopped leaking for some reason, it wouldn't un-risk what they've already risked . kind of like the phrase "if you're gonna hit the king you better kill him".

       True, but the CIA would also have a better idea of what is released over what is the worst they do that could potentially be exposed.

       I'm happy to see them taking the moral high ground on this. Assange was a hacker. Surprising as it may be, that comes with moral responsibilities.

       Pretty much he said they'll release more after this first release has been adequately dissected. They will release more after all the juiciness of Year Zero has been readily distributed.

       That, too, because "there's more work than Wikileaks can do on its own", including translation and public feedback to reports.  But the main takeaway is that they want to cooperate w/ companies affected by the leaks and give them a chance to "get those antidotes out there before we publish more information that can give clues to cyber-mafia or other intelligence agencies on how to do this."

       He put it in terms of giving companies the ability to effective disarm these cyber weapons and I think that is an appropriate way to think about it.

       Oh, it's the low res "Assange" with a wrinkle-free forehead. And, I see that they responded to our noticing that the dripper in the background had changed and was no longer dripping. Now it's dripping in some sort of frenzy. Glad to see that WL had time to play around with that graphic, but couldn't be bothered to make a more believable CGI Assange.

       Damn. I'm on the fence about this one. What's the positives of him being faked in this way and truly being dead? Why release these kinds of leaks that are damaging?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me I think he's alive but it can really go both ways and knowing the technology the government has its hands on I'm not quick to jump to conclusions here. Either way it's interesting

       He's gotta give them time to replace the exploits being closed with new ones.

       Those exploits have been closed. Besides, not many people are on android 4 or ios 8 anymore. They need to show current day exploits.
