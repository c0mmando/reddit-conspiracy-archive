        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t necessarily subscribe to this theory, BUT - it&#39;s entirely possible that Vault 7 was released intentionally as their way of admitting that they lost control of their cyber weapons arsenal.. thereby giving them the ability to attack civilian targets and without liability.  They now have complete plausible deniability.  All they have to do is claim that some other state actor is using their own tools to frame the CIA for a domestic or international op.  Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... but they&#39;ve been literally caught hacking US Senators that were investigating them.  Aaaaaand nothing happened as a result. It doesn&#39;t release them from responsibility.  But it gives them deniability.  And of course they have demonstrated time and again that they will lie under oath, again, with no recourse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>meh it seems more plausible that the CIA are run by incompetent criminals, they tried to cover up that the lost control of this tech, and wikileaks true to form is letting the people know about it.<br/>
And relate this to the &quot;russian hack&quot; bullshit. Obviously the CIA has been planting false evidence and blaming Russia to take down the new insane clown president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also a great defense against anything incriminating found on a computer... Say CP is found on someone&#39;s laptop, blame a hack and say it&#39;s planted evidence. </p>

<p>Makes me wonder if someone knows something has been found so release this as a foil. &quot;It wasn&#39;t me it was the malware&quot;.</p>

<p>Call me cynical, but I don&#39;t think this would work for all those guys on copyright charges due to downloaded movies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was the gist of a comment I made right after Vault 7 was released. This was a way to remove them from culpability. Not only that, but the contents of Vault 7 were likely in the original WL insurance files. The keys to which were released into the bitcoin blockchain at the time they scooped Assange up. Once they realized that someone somewhere was likely to extract those keys, this information was inevitably going to be released. Doing it in this way allowed them to control the narrative to some degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone should be suspicious of anything, especially if it involves the CIA, FBI, or NSA.  </p>

<p>I have considered this also, but I don&#39;t think it was released on purpose, simply because it dilutes/counters the Russian hack narrative additionally draws more suspicious looks to the CIA.  The only reason I could see the CIA let this out is to create a wedge between the FBI and Whitehouse, because the FBI/DOJ wiretapped Trump.</p>
