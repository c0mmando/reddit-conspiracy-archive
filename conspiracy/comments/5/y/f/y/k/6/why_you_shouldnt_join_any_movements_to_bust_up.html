        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Because they are very likely honeypots to track people who are most aggressively anti-state.  It&#39;s one thing to see what these ppl are up to, but I recommend you never protest, never organize outside of the internet, because they have drones, guns and nightsticks, and it never ever goes well--especially if you are old.  </p>

<p>The other thing is, diffusion of responsibility.  The slippery slope of evil is greased by the fact that you are in a crowd.  The police can step on you and kill you and then say, &#39;oh well we were just doing our jobs, responding to an angry mob&#39;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot harder for them to say that if you stay at home, </p>

<p>collect evidence</p>

<p>do citizen reportage</p>

<p>get the facts straight</p>

<p>make narratives that undermine them in the eyes of the public</p>

<p>THIS is the best thing you can do.  Protest--as we&#39;ve seen time and again--really accomplishes nothing these days.</p>

<p>Need I remind you that over 15M (MILLION) people protested the GWOT (global war on terrorism--GWB&#39;s war, 2003-4).  They went anyway</p>

<p>The media DID NOT COVER IT</p>

<p>We find out later on wikipedia, the total tally</p>

<p>We had plenty of support worldwide. It affected everyone.  We tried.  Protest failed.  Sorry.  Protesting in person doesn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>(I also want to remind you that the media has been covering up &quot;pizzagate&quot; (pedogate, pedophocracy) for decades)</p>

<p>But what works--as we&#39;ve seen by the fact Trump is president--is <em>shifting opinon</em>.  It truly is an &quot;info war&quot;, but the best info is the truth, and it&#39;s good to know it, get your facts straight and then double down on a dummy which will make them either stfu in shame or it will flip them, or it will galvanize their ignorance so you know they are a baddie that can be put on a blacklist</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fear &amp; violence is boxing the boxer. Don&#39;t box the boxer. </p>

<p>The name of the game is subversion. Subvert, inform, create or perpetuate thought movements. </p>

<p>Society exists in all of our minds, all at once. The human being is predisposed to freedom. Liberty and consciousness have some deep bond of attraction. Subversive cultural forces keep some people from it, but the evil subversive forces are weakening dramatically. </p>

<p><strong>If you and I are &#39;speaking the same language&#39;, Welcome to the collective consciousness.</strong></p>

<p>Trump may not be the answer. He&#39;s certainly a symbol of what seems to be this third great awakening. This realization that we have not been on our natural path, but drawn from it. </p>

<p>Just as one can excel at chess, math, dance, sport, speech, one can excel at what I&#39;ll refer to as cultural Jiu Jitsu. Google Jiu Jitsu if you are not familiar. </p>

<p>Humanity, and the universe as a whole, are bucking hard against those who created the forces pulling us off of the path. They are in their death stages. </p>

<p>When you discover your masters, or those who wish to be your masters, remember that they do not practice a religion, no matter what they claim. They have no moral codes. Only hedonism. They will try to trick you with everything in the book. All tricks are very simple, but can be dressed up elaborately. Your mind, your gut, is good at setting right through these tricks - trust it. </p>

<p>Your master will try to convince you he&#39;s not at all your master, maybe he&#39;s actually your slave! Your master will use taboo, guilt, peer pressure against you - these are little &#39;hacks&#39; if you will, as normal people have consciences and are impacted by it. When you feel impacted like this, you must continue your research. </p>

<p>Humans have a propensity for truth. For liberty. For love. For kindness. We have been subverted from our true natural state. It will feel unnatural to maneuver back into a natural state.. Just follow the facts. The simple facts.</p>

<p>The truth is very simple. Do not be afraid of it. Do not feel guilty in knowing your master. In naming your master. He hides in plain sight. He fears you will, one day, simply open your eyes and <strong>see him</strong>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Protesting&quot; as is presented by the media does not currently work you are correct, so much so that the media is fond of &quot;protesting&quot; to a certain a degree.</p>

<p>I agree that we need to get the facts straight in an effort to increase the numbers of those aware of the countless human rights violations of the Deep State.</p>

<p>At some point they will be savvy to our increasing numbers - and by then it will be to late.</p>

<p>A movement from the people away from anonymity is critical before this turning point.</p>

<p>never organize outside of the internet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as if it&#39;s safer and not a honey pot here. at least outside, you&#39;re actually acting. </p>

<p>I dig what you&#39;re saying, but protests don&#39;t work anymore partly because of the internet, and partly because of the militarization of the police, and protesting on the internet is even less effective. </p>

<p>Acting on the internet requires skills most people who want to act don&#39;t have. Being an effective actor on the internet is just as risky as going out and protesting, if not more so. You&#39;re not lost in a crowd if you&#39;re making progress in this realm. At that point, you&#39;re only as anonymous as your skills allow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, how else is reform going to happen? We need to explain to people that the CIA and NSA&#39;s powers probably won&#39;t be used against them directly, but those powers <em>will</em> be abused on their favorite congressman.
It needs to be explained that the leaders in &quot;our&quot; government are likely just a bunch of figureheads controlled by the intelligence agencies. </p>

<p>What legislation have we had in decades that limited or restricted any of our intelligence agencies? Why have we not been able to enjoy the increased production of our labor, and instead we&#39;ve been losing our middle class and social programs that helped us get there in the first place? We can&#39;t call ourselves &quot;free&quot; if we don&#39;t have our fourth amendment rights. There cannot be a true leader of the people if the enemy is always waiting for them in our own institutions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post, OP.  IMHO, it is ALL about the mind.....a war on consciousness if you will.</p>

<p>You are right about adhering to the truth.  It is the most powerful weapon we have and why the powers that shouldn&#39;t be work so hard to obfuscate, deny, and destroy the truth. </p>

<p>The good news for us is that the truth has a funny way of resonating with people.  That&#39;s because THE TRUTH IS ALWAYS SIMPLE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is join <em>online</em> movements.  Forget people shaming you about being an armchair &#39;keyboard warriror&#39;  </p>

<p>Turns out, they WON</p>

<p>Trump is proof.  Armchair warrioring actually works, because we discovered the main thing that government does is cast big illusions of control and attempt to manage the perceptions of authority</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well today if 15m go out to the street it&#39;s almost impossible not to hear about it. Yes the MSM will not talk bout it or will label it as Communists, reddit and facebook will try to censor it but still, 15m it&#39;s way too many people. If half the people shares everywhere, every media, post photos and shit I really doubt would happen the same as 2003-2004.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just who goes there anymore, their friends and family count too, and if they (msm) try to censor something big as that today I (hope) think they&#39;d implode.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I haven&#39;t.  I just value my life.  If Trump actually does die in jail, what do you think happens to people who &#39;occupy langley&#39;, and do other things like this?</p>

<p>You are still able to talk about them.  But the moment you become a prominent book author for example, exposing the CIA, if you aren&#39;t yourself CIA then you get killed</p>

<p>It&#39; just that simple</p>

<p>You have to know with whom you&#39;re dealing.  ANd trust me, I do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who values the life? Who is scared of losing the life? If you have the balls to ask that question -- what is the &#39;I&#39; feeling really? -- you realize that the sensation of &#39;me&#39;, the sensation of having a center point for consciousness, does not exist. There should be no fear, it&#39;s an illusion. Thus, your post is what the CIA does, in fact, want. They want us to live in fear and be anxious of consequences of our actions when we speak out for ourselves and our freedom.</p>

<p>You&#39;re believing in an illusion and protecting it at all costs. What you are is the universe, is love, so why would you not defend what you&#39;ve created here? Welcome to the path towards awakening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least two factions within the Deep State are at war with each other over who&#39;s in control, which is why at the moment no one seems to be. </p>

<p>None of those factions are particularly good but the ones being outed and ousted are also the ones behind the pedophile networks and controlling important political and business figures not just in the US but around the world through blackmail and extortion.</p>

<p>Ordinary people only have a limited role to play in watching that unfold from a safe distance and keeping themselves safe from getting caught up in it until it becomes clear which faction has come out on top. </p>
