    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been into conspiracy theories for about 12 years. I have found that there is at least <em>some</em> reflection of truth in most of them. Political and economic cabals have been a reality for centuries, as has the silent power of the finance sector. The wealth gap in the United States (and throughout the world) is the <em>largest in human history</em>. Is that by accident?</p>

<p>As for vaccines, even the Hepatitis B insert lists lupus (similar to/exactly the same as syphilis) and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (similar to/exactly like polio) as side effects.</p>

<p>I get your point though, ultimately we can only protect ourselves and our children. Anyone who has the guts for armed resistance should travel to Syria/Ukraine/Sudan etc.</p>

<p>You mean the people that get very rich from peddling unnecessary drugs? Those &quot;smarter&quot; people?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>quantified historical medical data points showing vaccines work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very few people have said vaccines don&#39;t work. That&#39;s a strawman argument.</p>

<p>The problem is not that vaccines don&#39;t work (although some of them don&#39;t) the problem is that many vaccines target relatively harmless diseases but have the potential to cause very severe side effects.</p>

<p>By the way, did you know that only one disease was ever &quot;eradicated&quot; by a vaccine? Did you know that people are still vaccinated against this disease, despite it being supposedly eradicated?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>history..50% child mortality rates before modern medicine...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, modern medicine... not vaccines. But not just modern medicine. Modern sanitation and food production, too.</p>

<p>For example, did you know that nothing more than Vitamin A supplements reduces measles mortality by 50%? Did you know that measles mortality was reduced by over 90% <em>before</em> the invention of the measles vaccine simply because modern sanitation, infection control and medical care reduced the spread and danger of measles?</p>

<p>And did you know that even fully vaccinated people can contract and spread measles?</p>

<p>So tell me, what exactly has that very expensive measles vaccine done for us?</p>

<p>Every dollar spent on a vaccine, is one less dollar spent on the hospitals that can easily treat measles. Hospitals that can also treat broken bones and other illnesses and injuries that vaccines can not.</p>

<p>Every dollar spent on a vaccine is one less dollar spent on increasing food production and availability. One less dollar spent on sanitation and infection control.</p>

<p>Do you know how many hospitals could be built with just one year&#39;s worth of measles vaccine income?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re looking into the wrong topics.</p>

<p>This stuff started as a hobby for me. I&#39;d research the most insane theories for hours until I stated to become convinced they were true, and then I&#39;d try to debunk them. Whatever was left over was at least plausible.</p>

<p>Then 9/11 happened, I stopped looking into the completely crazy stuff and started looking into the more verifiable stuff.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve learned is that the real conspiracies aren&#39;t even particularly well hidden. They just seem dull on the surface until you connect the dots.</p>

My first reaction is if you are presupposing ET exists on basis of personal accounts of interactions and descriptions of ET  thru out the decades, all the images  and decriptions  evolve and mimic previous scifi themes and change with pop cultural and political climates...
there is no hard cold evidence for ET</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i drove taxi ten years weekend nights. I picked up all the social strata on thier best and worst behaviour.
During the day, my second job gives me acsess with and interact with the richest vips in town  and inside thier homes (antique restoration).since the mid 1990&#39;s..
my conclusion is  there is no difference between the rich and poor in morals, ethics, dreams,desires,conversations,behaviour, everyone tries thier best to follow the golden rule.
There is a great prejudice against the wealthy in this country thats never spoken about. Its true the rich hang out with the rich..half the reason is the hate ,jealousy from the lower class (fyi i make $40,000 a year so no Im not an elitist) they can feel it from everyone they interact with, they are demonized into evil subhuman class, they are well aware of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I think your term, demonize the wealthy, is too broad.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there has ever been great generalized resentment against our wealthy talented, gifted and beautiful, so that means you may be referring to resentment against only some of the wealthy.</p>

<p>And by demonize, what specific actions and words do you mean.  It isn&#39;t in the MSM where poor bashing has been the prime sport for about 50 years now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please keep researching!</p>

<p>This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that&#39;s what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn&#39;t see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching &quot;black cube ufo&quot; for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening. edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas) edit: Sorry for the potato quality drawing. I could always take more time and sketch something more detailed, but this is the gist of it. It was below the clouds. This is a sketch as it passed directly in front of me. It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day.

    <div class="md"><p>Im  extremely jealous of people having that experience. Unfortunately it carries minimal evidenterary authority the moment it becomes &quot;another persons eye witness account&quot; 
It such an abnormal incredible story , it demands that the evidence be incredible as well.
But so far,  since the 1940&#39;s and now with the billions of hirez cameras pointing everywhere, and all the thousands of amature astonomers looking thru thier  new affordable  hi tech telescopes (thanks NWO) ......we still lack that cold hard evidence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CIA will go make documentaries and publish books to confuse the public. If the topic is too bizarre like the occult and paranormal, the majority of rational people will associate whatever topic with the those ideas and dismiss it making it very hard for them to dig and find information about it.Those that hang on the ideas will get called crazy. There are even people that get locked into thinking that the occult and paranormal is true and I don&#39;t mean to shit on people that do believe it but that is just not how reality works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really think it comes down to presentation.  You could have posed it as a question perhaps, and then provided your own findings or feelings thereafter.  I have been studying conspiracies for 23 years so far.  I would say about half is bs and the other half is true but told secondhand and needs further investigation.  There is a list of known conspiracies on the sidebar so it is not all bs for sure.  I would just beg you to not give up searching for the truth.  There is a lot of noise on this sub right now, so searching for the gems on /new is the best bay to go.  Anyways, sometimes I feel your frustration after I have researched something to the ends of the internet only to find it a rouse.  But wow what a ride it has been so far.  Thanks yang!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. And now you don&#39;t even get to call bullshit on half of it or you&#39;ll be mauled by cretins. The value was never in uncovering explosive stories of intrigue, it&#39;s in the little facts you can&#39;t disprove. A lot of folks seem happy to run with a different set of lies, and will cling to the Alex Jones and more recently David Seaman types - even though they can be easily verified as lying opportunists themselves. Cling to them with the same denial as those they wish to redpill or whatever.</p>
