       In this post we will explore the origins of the "alternative" media that propelled Trump in 2016, expose its origins as a front for the freemasonic cabal, and dig into Trump's own deep embedding in the pedophilia and child trafficking rings that he purports to oppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       As many here know, the Republican/Democrat paradigm is synthetic, controlled, and of no utility.  As it can be expected that the people would come to realize this eventually, further traps have been laid which we can broadly describe as the Council on Foreign Relations / Council for National Policy synthetic paradigm.  Many are familiar with the CFR and it's numerous illicit deeds, so we'll focus on the Council for National Policy for a bit to familiarize you with the lay of the land before returning to the CFR to show that both organizations are run by the same folks.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Carroll Quigley and colleagues of like sympathy with the Rhodes agenda have widely propagated the belief that the American branch of the Round Table organization is exclusively the liberal Eastern Establishment. However, The Belmont Brotherhood revealed that the Anglo-American Establishment, which represents the interests of the aforesaid corporations, also launched the ultra-conservative movement in the United States, the John Birch Society being a pioneer of the extreme right of this dialectical process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Produced in 1977 by a group of former high-ranking JBS members, "The Belmont Brotherhood" refers to the National Council at Belmont, Massachusetts where JBS national headquarters were originally located. Various sources cited therein document that the early members of the John Birch Society were also members of the liberal Establishment they pretended to oppose, and represented in great measure the corporate interests of America, which are advanced by the oaths of loyalty to one another in a secret brotherhood -- organized Freemasonry. This 12-page report concluded with the perceptive observation that the John Birch Society represents the most diabolical form of the Illuminati conspiracy:
       </p>
       <p>
        ‚ÄùYou may object: 'Look at all the great things [Founder, Robert] Welch has done - he has exposed the Illuminati.' Baloney. The Illuminati was merely a branch of the Conspiracy. How can one attack the Illuminati without attacking the diabolical power behind it: organized Freemasonry? Welch has provided the most valuable service of all time to the Conspiracy. He founded an organization to neutralize millions of Americans from discovering what the true power behind the Illuminati really was. And we concede the Mason's chose an extremely clever man to do the job. Welch, with the help of the Belmont Brotherhood, plays his role very effectively."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The John Birch Society membership in turn spawned the Western Goals Foundation,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One of the earliest members of the Western Goals Foundation and its principal espionage agent was Birch Society member, John Rees, whose Information Digest supplied information to the FBI, CIA, and the National Security Agency. Instrumental in obtaining Rees' entrance to Western Goals was J. Peter Grace, who was also chairman of the Order of the Knights of Malta in the United States. President of W.R. Grace and Co. from 1945 until three years before his death in 1995, J. Peter Grace is profiled in Who's Who in America which lists among his credentials: Bachelor of Arts from Yale University in 1936, Assistant Secretary at W. R. Grace (1936), President and CEO (1945), Newcomen Society, Council on Foreign Relations, Knights of Malta (American Chapter of the Board of Founders), Knights of Malta President, address: 1114 Avenue of the Americas.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       which, again, is clearly operated as a masonic cabal front organization.  And the Western Goals Foundation spawns the Council for National Policy,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nelson Bunker Hunt, who was president of the CNP in 1982-83, is among several of the John Birch Society / Western Goals Foundation principals and associates who also served on the newly-formed CNP Board of Governors:
       </p>
       <p>
        Singlaub, Graham, and Jefferson are/were members of the board of governors of the Council for National Policy (CNP), a secretive policy-oriented umbrella organization for the rightwing in the United States. Other Western Goals members who are/were on the Council's board of governors include: Sherman Unkefer, Hans Sennholz, and Robert Stoddard. The group's financial backer Nelson Bunker Hunt is on CNP's board too, as was Larry McDonald. Oliver North has also been a member of the CNP since its inception. 41.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       where you see some familiar names like Oliver North, famous for gun trafficking and cocaine dealing with Bush Sr.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most interesting John Birchers was a guy named Roy Cohn, a now infamous sex ring operator and admitted mentor of both Roger Stone and Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Like Stone, Cohn combined conservative politics with an outr√© personal life. ‚ÄúRoy was not gay,‚Äù Stone told me. ‚ÄúHe was a man who liked having sex with men. Gays were weak, effeminate. He always seemed to have these young blond boys around. It just wasn‚Äôt discussed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Council for National Policy is responsible for most of famous voices on the "alternative" media sphere like Steve Bannon (member), of Breitbart, Jerome Corsi (member), of World Net Daily, and Alex Jones who serves as the limited hangout / controlled opposition for all of the CNP mouthpieces while
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYl9iZlArjM">
        covering up
       </a>
       the role of the CNP.  Even lesser known names like
       <a href="http://idavox.com/index.php/2017/03/09/mike-cernovich-alan-dershowitz-and-the-jeffery-epstein-underage-sex-trafficking-case/">
        Mike Cernovich
       </a>
       are tied into this pedo trafficking masonic cabal, Mike having intervened on the side of Epstein in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump didn't just happen to be associated with shady characters like Roy Cohn who birthed these sex-based blackmail rings, nor does he regret or disavow the activity as evidenced by his inclusion of Roger Stone in the 2016 campaign.  Did you know the watergate scandal was ultimately about Roger Stone
       <a href="http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?/topic/20715-hotseat-phil-stanford-on-his-new-book/">
        covering up
       </a>
       evidence of Cohn's sex-based blackmail ring?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, given that modeling agencies / beauty pageants are
       <a href="http://www.tobeyleung.com/the-psychology-and-m-o-of-international-human-sex-trafficking/">
        well known
       </a>
       fronts for sex trafficking, do you think it mere coincidence that Trump was mentored by one of the most infamous operators of such rings and went on to purchase such enterprises himself, never mind keeping around the shameless defender of such practices, Roger Stone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course not.  The White House is now being run by some of the most notorious child traffickers in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       That helps us comprehend why the Rothschild agent Wilbur Ross, of Rothschild investments, intervened to bailout Trump in the 90s when his creditors were ready to foreclose.  The Art of the Deal should read only: I sold children into sex slavery, and was rewarded richly for it.  Shrewd business skills played no role.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now you have people who are ideologically in bed with the CFR like Steve Bannon (who is a trumpeter of such silliness as the fourth turning ideology invented by former head of the CFR Peter Peterson) pretending to be opposition.  Now you can see clearly the synthetic dialectic, you know that Trump isn't just a fraud but a horrific personality and that the limited hangouts defending him like the conspiracy media, CIA "whistleblowers" like Pieczenik or Steele, fake news like Breitbart / World Net Daily, aren't just lying to you but actually trying to hold the line in defense of pedophilia and child trafficking in a desperate effort to keep power in the hidden hand of the masonic cabal behind it all.

       Thank you for pointing this out.

       thank you for your write-up, it is interesting; too bad it didn't get the attention it deserved (I surmise that because you denounce Trump as a high servant to the NWO some must assume you must be pro-Clinton, which is absurd).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd add this: in order to sell America down the final road of globalization, you need someone who pretends to be against globalization. Just as you needed someone who pretends to be a pacifist in order to prosecute as many wars as Obama did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never could Hillary sign the US into a new global money system, there would be a revolution; Trump will say he negotiated a great deal, and many will believe him. The current anti-Trump propaganda is meant to provoke rage from Trump supporters (and other honest humans), and have them enter cognitive dissonance (they are much less likely to accept future criticism of Trump). They are preparing something big; soon we'll find out what it is exactly.

       Something to consider: "globalism" isn't really a good way to describe them.  Better word that a lot of people know is "balkanization" or "divide and conquer."  Which is actually very much in line with what Trump does with the hate mongering towards Latin America or Islam or saying that climate change is a Chinese conspiracy right?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact a "new world order" in the sense of a global hegemonic regime wouldn't really work out very well for them.  When you operate as a parasite through mechanisms like usury, you undermine and destroy the host.  If there is no new host to jump towards as the old begins to wither and die, then you've killed yourself too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they very much want things like USSR vs USA in the 20th century or USA v China in the 21st century.  You can ditch the USA as the power base of the empire and take China as a new host, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you are running everything across the globe into the ground all at once, you are just killing yourself in the process.  That isn't really what they want to do,
      </p>
      <p>
       On a deeper level, they have named themselves "globalists" and bragged in public about a "new world order" because it is actually their greatest fear rather than their ambition.  By attaching themselves to such an idea, they hope to discredit it and preclude the possibility.  Parasites need a multipolar world because they need to be able to jump to new hosts after the old is dead.  A new world order terrifies them.

       Kind of like co-opting "Illuminati" and "Christianity" under their own terms. In a sense I guess the Christians eschatology or the American system are more truly globalist in the sense that we want global awakening and cooperation toward a free and post-scarcity future.

       Well, they take over movements etc to push their agenda...just like a lot of people pushed back about the whole fake news narrative. CNN quit using the term (supposedly) because when they did it constantly back fired, and made people call THEM fake news even more. 
The illuminati was a bogeyman meant to scare people info fighting the British right (if I'm understanding the psy op correctly), just saying, what can we use that turns it around on them....?

       Attempting to discredit meme magic as a stupid waste of time could incite coordinated action among 4chan. In this way we could co-opt the regime's meme: you're nothing and unimportant. Articulating an overt suppression upon such an anti-authoritarian group has the effect of generating increased attitudes of revolt, perhaps. Doing so overtly rather than covertly could galvanize the community, making them receptive to notions that are in coherence with their shared attitudes/beliefs, perhaps leading to mass red-pilling.

       I think you're right that the world government would scare them but only in the context of the way the current system is run. If the depopulation agendas are serious then they want to take control of a world "reset" and sit on top as kings while the majority of the population has been dwindled down to just essential workers and the robots creating goods. In this kind of future the big families will have no doubt sectioned off the earth hunger games style and just reap the rewards of advanced technology and working slaves.
