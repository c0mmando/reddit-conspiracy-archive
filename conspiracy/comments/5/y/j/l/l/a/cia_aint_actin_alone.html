    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m seriously considering ditching all &quot;smart&quot; tech. I&#39;d still have a computer but that&#39;d be it. Dumb tv, dumb fridge, dumb vacuum, dumb electric meter, dumb phone, dumb car, navigate using maps. It&#39;s all more trouble than it&#39;s worth. Is life now any easier than in the early 2000s? I feel like I&#39;m constantly fighting to sync everything. It never works right. Looking at how all this came about so suddenly I&#39;m beginning to wonder how organic it was. It seems possible that it&#39;s all part of a vast control grid they&#39;ve be incrementally implementing. Sort of already knew all this tho. Hopefully there&#39;ll be something new in future leaks. </p>

<p>Whatever is going on it&#39;s clearly not about fighting terrorism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s mostly for advertisers, probably. We let them know exactly what we like and dislike, to serve us relevant ads. Likes/upvoting serves no other purpose in my mind, and I wish platforms would do away with it. I don&#39;t think I should see comments based on popularilty contests, and I always, always expand posts under the threshold (I wonder if that can be automated?).</p>

<p>As for law enforcement, NSA, DHS, et al, I certainly believe &quot;liking&quot; behavior is tracked, because suspicious liking/voting activity could tip them off, it&#39;s like the Thought Police, or even Minority Report stuff. Reddit, facebook, they are all complicit giving it all up, otherwise they smile snd shrug when handed those NSLs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i disagree.  each real user is a coherent set of data.  The more reliable sets of data you can feed into your predictive analysis algorithm, the smarter and more accurate it will be. </p>

<p>If they can then seed false information into the population and track the spread and effectiveness of it, and tailor the arguments down to the community, or down to the individual... we&#39;re talking mass mind control.  MSM basically already does it, but as we&#39;re seeing, the internet is a disruptive force to the propagandists.  If they could develop a tool that was everywhere in social media, it would be extremely useful to them.  They&#39;re not going to have an actual person assigned to some random redditor.  There&#39;s super computers learning how people talk and think and spread ideas. </p>

<p>Usually the same, most software is handled through a package manager. Sometimes you get a non-official Tarball / package but usually they are directly maintained by the software developers in that case. </p>

<p>But considering that everything on GNU/Linux is OSS combined with the fact that the Vault 7 leak confirmed many 0-day Exploits being hoarded, I&#39;m sure there are some various GNU/Linux exploits. </p>

<p>Also some things to consider:</p>

<p>1) Linux and Unix are likely exploitable, so good luck making your own kernel</p>

<p>2) If you make your OS, it could possibly be less secure, and will likely still be possible to break into if they wanted</p>

<p>3) Also since it&#39;s your own OS, there is no programs that exist for it. Even if you can port them somehow, good luck with there being no exploits in them. I&#39;d sandbox everything if possible and limit their Internet connectivity.</p>

<p>4) (U)EFI aand BIOS are also weak points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People need to realize that this is much more than just spying, it is creating business and a future of dependency for these corporations. Just look at the evolution of these technologies throughout the years, the average person cannot go a single day without using a smart phone, gps, google, some type of purchasing app, a food app, even transportation apps. Literally everything we do is made easier and more convenient, but with this convenience we are also becoming dependent. People will not want to go back to being self reliant after this. Read a map? no way, use an encyclopedia? no way. Drive without a link to my phone? no way. We literally don&#39;t even need to leave our homes anymore, we can do everything online. Work, shop, interact, etc. It is about developing a need for people to be linked, it is about removing the human control and evolving people into something that is inseparable from this technology. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This shouldn&#39;t be shocking...</p>

<p>Your social networkindg and digital data are all filtered through the nsa. </p>

<p>There is likely a point system with several areas of modulation all conducted manually by an advanced filtering algorithm. Look up sleeping pills, depression, and suicide... Might find a rewarding 100.00 gift card in the. Mail.
Look up anarchy cookbook and various nefarious topics such as rambo and guns and ammunition, maybe catch a tail...</p>

<p>The point is that the data is all being filtered. Like it or not, ever since the www went global they have been implimenting baby sitting program launguage. 
These algorithms sift through every keylogger on your machine and deposit all keystrokes to the data centers for mass storage.<br/>
They are building digital fingerprints, (not to catch you in real time) but to have control of national security. So in the event an attack occurs that they can backtrack the root elements attempting to find a culprit. Or even better use the filtering system to stop attacks in real time...</p>

<p>Grocery store purchases tell them who is buying ziplock baggies and cold medicine in masse. They know who is buying which medications and abusing the medical systems.
The point is to catch the wirst of the worst, not to be condused with all criminals.  I don&#39;t think there is a single marijuana growhouse that can&#39;t be detected by satellite by example. (let alone flir)-</p>

<p>Any criminal dumb enough to not take basic precautions to concealing their crimes is an idiot- period. </p>

<p>They know who is peddling pot or abusing meth. They even allow some networks to operate for years and decades if the individuals are not troublesome or abusing their communities. Factually they could likely stop all drug deals globally overnight. (cartel level), but if they did stop the heroin and cocaine trade there would be international chaos- 
Imo that is exactly why poppy production and assisted cocaine ops take place. Its not so much being conducted by the government. Its aimply being mitigated to keep the people happy...
Take away the things they like and they will get smart or dumb, but the once compliant or otherwise blissfully unaware will take notice realquick. </p>

<p>They use data to shift key players into roles. They use it to remove the abusers and take control of the leaders of all markets and governments. </p>

<p>They will useblocal cable companies to mailmen as infiltrators, phone lines as intel providers... Your isp data, web searches, likes, dislikes, social networks, friends and foes, emails etc to profile you. Its common sense-</p>

<p>This is my very real advice. The word privacy is a false reality in todays world. </p>

<p>There is no isp free tor net that the intel communities can&#39;t seize. There is no vpns that allows you to go unmonitored without leaving a fingerprint of aome sort...
There aren&#39;t hacks and exploits that can&#39;t be reverse engineered. 
There used to be, but there isnt anymore- digital privacy is extinct...</p>

<p>Basically: Dont be a psycho, Don&#39;t be a dissident, Don&#39;t be an agressor, Don&#39;t be a conflicting person to the status quo, and your free to be free. </p>

<p>If your a drug dealer stay ethical, Don&#39;t tote guns and ride high. (you will be demoted). Don&#39;t be an arms dealer and sell to our enemies lest you mind not being seen as one. Don&#39;t insult your communities and make yourself the subject of sore debate, lest you intend to feel your sore word in actions. </p>

<p>Essentially don&#39;t be a dumb cunt-</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t trying to invade your privacy, they are looking out for your best interest. </p>

<p>Here is a fun fact...
There are 11 satellites (operated by the military) that control all gps in our nation. From your car to your cell phone. Pedometer to your isp. Your laptops ipads phones ect. All being actively monitored and filtered for suspicious and irregular patterns. 
They can use predpol to predict where you will be. Where you are going. What you are doing. 
They can place officers in strategic locations ahead of time, having full narratives of your intended actions prior to your making them and essentially set you up with a credible &#39;period&#39; in which a finding can be assessed. Never having mentioned these tools at all. 
Dont believe me???
<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/can-predictive-policing-prevent-crime-it-happens">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/can-predictive-policing-prevent-crime-it-happens</a></p>

<p>Its simple. You have set programs in your google search history. Not your browser history but your google history. 
Every location your cellphone went over several years shows a slight pattern. 
Say every sunday you and jill meet for a beer. 
Lately its been detected youve been a threat to society. Your on isis forums and learning about middle eastern oppression. 
Now you always pick up a six pack to share with jill. Since its her one day off a week and she works at 10am everyday you always leave after drinks. </p>

<p>Was that random speed trap a speed trap? Or were you maybe flagged as a dissident that needed &#39;perspective&#39;?</p>

<p>Note the level of agencies buying into this very software from 2014 - present. 
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/miamiherald.relaymedia.com/amp/news/local/community/miami-dade/article19256145.html">https://www.google.com/amp/s/miamiherald.relaymedia.com/amp/news/local/community/miami-dade/article19256145.html</a></p>

<p>(predpol is &#39;predictive policing). </p>

<p>Its design is used on whole community aspect ratios to single perp identification patterns. It can assess when a perp will be active or dormant. Vulnderable or begrudgingly, and its higly accurate hence the huge amounts of leo outfits hopping on board...</p>

<p>So again- johnnylaw can be a bit overwhelming but its not designed to attack your privacy. (which isnt real).</p>

<p>They are keeping entire communities in check by essentially weeding out the most volatile agents and aggressors of our rights and property...</p>

<p>I know the basis of &#39;violations&#39; it appears to maintain. I know the fundamentals aren&#39;t physically appealing. Yet seriously these systems are fully designed to maintain society by monitoring the most critical aspects of its decay. </p>

<p>Humans aren&#39;t perfect. Law understands this; Legal experts understand this;</p>

<p>Yet the more you strive to be a thorn in the governments side the more likely you are to meet these experts in person. 
Don&#39;t be an idiot or a massive criminal and truly you will have 0 problems. <strong>0</strong></p>

<p>Challenge the operating integrity of our most highly skilled legal enforcers, and suffer the consequences of its full integrity and authority. </p>

<p>I can only assure you that they don&#39;t care about the little things-</p>

<p>Don&#39;t do major crimes and dont get sentenced major time-
The point is thst your not supposed to know their full integrity and reach, because if you did thier systems would be useless.</p>

<p>So expect that you have no such thing as privacy. Respect that you have civic responsibility, and reject the elements in life that put then into the positions of monitoring you more thourally in the first place...</p>

<p>Not exactly rocket science being a good person now is it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While traditionally I agree-</p>

<p>There is a vast amount of unhealthy americans that truly need babysitters-
There are non americans that come here that need babysitters-</p>

<p>Its a filtering algorithm. I dont see thst as being very abusive unless you abuse the laws yourself-
To me if your angry that your own actions cost you your freedoms, its not exactly rocket science that a punishment would follow said actions.</p>

<p>I really just mean to say that while its not a perfect system. Its easily understandable how it was inherited, and adopted. Crafted and executed. 
So anyone &quot;leaking it&quot; isn&#39;t really telling us anything we didn&#39;t already know. </p>

<p>I am not worried about it generally due to it not really affecting me. 
Most non criminals really don&#39;t care? I mean it could be worse and they clearly could be utilizing these systens to completely overstep their boundaries. 
Generally I am thankful for the alphabet soup agencies services. </p>

<p>I mean they do a huge amount of good for us too; So its only common sense that they need a small amount of our trust for them to operate. Not like they are getting much appreciation; Meanwhile they collectively are the very reason why our nation is so strong. 
Without the intelligence communities think cuban missile crisis being undiscovered, sadam ruling the saudis, and hrc as president ...</p>
