       Why was -ENOUGH-TRUMP-SPAM- banned? Mod logs say spamming but three posts hardly constitutes spamming when the user he argued with put up 50+ posts in a day and continues to post all day. Seems to me there is a conspiracy on this sub to silence anything thats negative about Trump. I was also temp banned a few weeks ago for saying "This sub is a Trump soapbox".
      </p>
      <p>
       So whats up? Is this the real conspiracy? The sub I knew a few years ago would not have stood for this...

       Edit: The irony of a comment being removed but still no word from the mods 13 hours later...

       To prove your hypothesis I implore you to post two different topics: one calling for hillary's arrest because of the emails or the Clinton foundation, and the other calling for an investigation into Trump's ties with Russia. I will put money on the trump post getting downvoted and struggling to stay above 0 while the hillary post gets at least 40-50 and possibly hits the front page

       I would wager that the responses would be slightly in favor of the anti-Clinton ones, but the same two posts in r]politics would get you a massively skewed result in favor of the anti-Trump post. Bias is unavoidable, however less bias is always preferable to more bias.

       It's "painting with a broad brush" and labeling the sub as something it's not. More than one user would consider it an attack including myself .. which I personally identify as an independent and rarely speak about Trump in a positive manner.

       I mean, they removed the trump dossier post then put it back up but with the first ever flair in this sub. "Unverifiable". Funny thing is the dossier was by the same guy responsible for the fifa scandal, which this sub ate up.

      <p>
       Shortly thereafter, the second ever post was flaired in this sub....another trump scandal

       My mistake. They've never flaired a post as unverifiable before. And it's not unverifiable considering the man that put it together is now out in the open again. It may be a while or never, but it's certainly not unverifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are hundreds of "unverifiable" posts here daily so why did that one get flaired?

       You know what's unverifiable? What happened to the 2.3 trillion dollars lost on 9/11 as, iirc, the records were destroyed when the Pentagon was hit. We will never know what that money was used for. That didn't stop posts claiming the money was used for various conspiratorial purposes and those posts were not flaired unverifiable either.

       No. The dossier is not unverifiable. Unverifiable would mean that it cannot ever be proven true. That is not the case
      </p>
      <p>
       Unverified would mean that it is currently unknown whether the content is true or false, but it doesn't shut the door on either possibility.

       I wouldn't agree with flairing with either tag and I don't think any posts should be flaired with anything. It just appears to me as attempting manipulating a narrative.

       You are just mincing words to suit your agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unverifiable has no indication of a time constraint nor does the definition say it's an indefinite state. It's a word to describe something at that moment with the information available.

       I'm pretty sure this conversation has been worthless since you just plan on trying to force your opinion instead of actually having a conversation.

       He was banned because all three of his posts were Trump russian ties rhetoric, as the other user you mention posts a lot but on a variety of different subjects.

       My guess is that E-T-S posts mostly nothing but Russian ties thread and the mods finally got annoyed and did something about it.

       I'll put it like this. I was once banned for what I thought was the most ridiculous thing possible. A post of mine about the blockchain where I posted in a trollish way. Yes I did buy into the blockchain kool-aid and the post was trollish sure. But a comment from months ago?? I was muted and unable to comment on anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even messaged modmail and got lost in the crowd. But instead of freaking out I just messaged modmail again and got it all straightened out. Mods are just regular people too and make mistakes. I guess that when mods get a reported comment that it doesn't provide as much context as it probably should.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a post like this while some may see as a shitpost is important because challenging the "power structure" of even our little corner of reddit is important. But not going through the proper channels first will not help the cause at all.

       Well it's a concern of mine with regards to the sub and I know there are others here who feel the same. I mean, I've been a regular commenter here for almost 5 years so you'd think I know what I'm talking about when I say the behavior of the sub has changed a lot from what it used to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe mod mail should have been my first step and next time I'll take that into consideration, for sure. My post was pretty reactionary. But the visibility of the discussion is also important to me and I'm sure other users here as I know others share my concerns.

       I think the change of the subs general feel is that there has been a steady increase of more and more new folks coming to the conspiracy side.(mwahaha). And although they don't see the value of  well sourced posts and having a well informed userbase that does its own research. They are just beginning their quest for the truth. But I could just be talking out of my ass because I have only lurked here about 2 years.

       Didn't you hear ? This is a snow globe for special snowflakes now. Call someone out on there bullshit that the mods approve of and you may get banned . Call someone out when you disagree because they don't have evidence you may get banned. Get pissed because someone talks shit to you , you may get banned. Call someone out for shit posting you guessed it , banned ,Mods are itching to ban/ censor organic accounts that don't fit in around here so watch you say

       It's a numbers game even if the numbers don't add up , the overseers want traffic ,if they ban a user who posts a ton of content it takes away from what the overseers believe what the masses want, ban a guy who post very little who's going to miss that guy ? Also, we have determined over the past few months there is a bunch of paid commercial accounts shilling and to not trust them , not feed them . Keep that in mind when you call for a ban or cry out in concern for a sub that doesn't care about small accounts because small organic accounts are a dime a dozen and don't write a check to  Reddit .

       God forbid we talk about conspiracies that Trump is involved with on a conspiracy sub.

       What's funny is that everyone but this sub and T_D acknowledge that with every passing day it looks more likely that Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia. That is by definition a conspiracy. And it's about the establishment. But obviously I'm just a shill for noticing that according to the pedes

       EDIT: Any proof he was banned?
      </p>
      <p>
       If he's not a shill, a few days timeout would probably be sufficient. It works well in other (non-reddit) forums.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never reported him, but I noticed he would camp on threads, and could push a rate of 50% of the responses in a thread. You can call that fanaticism, addiction, unhealthy or something else. I see it as anti-social, as it's a surefire method to drive off genuine human posters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been guilty of the same in the past, which is why I'm even cognizant of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe he went personal in some posts that are now deleted? We wouldn't know. I've seen him get close enough to that line, and combined with his tendency to camp threads I wouldn't be surprised if he overreacted somewhere and got himself reported for genuine violations. It's a major risk when you won't let a point go.

       Even if that were the case, that does not absolve the mods for a less than stellar ban reason. Just look at what SovereignMan posted in this thread...he's a former mod's that recently stepped down

       I don't know maybe I'm hostile because you automatically believe enoughtrumpspam's bullshit story about why he was banned when all you had to do was click through 3 pages of his user history to see that he is a spammer... Which is exactly what the modmail he screen called said he was banned for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I just looked into
       <a href="/u/Lelouch_Di_Britannia">
        /u/Lelouch_Di_Britannia
       </a>
       about ten pages of his submitted history.  While he does post some pro Trump stuff he also posts some anti Trump administration stuff, pizzagate, domestic spying.  He is all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       He isn't spamming pro Trump stuff as it's been framed by enoughtrumpspam's allegations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here is where we are now man.  You can either deal with it or you can go away on your own or with my assistance.  Your call.  It's don't have time to deal with the tears of people who won't even flip through a spammer's user history before jumping on the bandwagon that the world is ending.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could have easily seen for yourself that enoughtrumpspam is indeed a spammer.  It took me like 20 seconds to rediscover why I banned him.
      </p>
      <p>
       This conversation/debate about this user is officially over.  Any further bitching about his ban will be interpreted by me as "you need my assistance".

       Yeah, people don't realize that these posts only hurt OP since they are being somewhat accusatory without giving the mods a chance to respond. It could also be considered inflammatory or an attack on a mod.
