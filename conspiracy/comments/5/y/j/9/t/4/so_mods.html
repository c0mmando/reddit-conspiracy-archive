Mod logs say spamming but three posts hardly constitutes spamming when the user he argued with put up 50+ posts in a day and continues to post all day.

<p>So whats up? Is this the real conspiracy? The sub I knew a few years ago would not have stood for this...</p>

<p>Podesta emails released</p>

<p>Spirit cooking found</p>

<p>Instagram pictures</p>

<p>Absorbed the Penn state, Catholic church, boystown scandals</p>

<p>Began taking credit for any future sex crime arrests</p>

<p>Today, after 6 months of &quot;investigating&quot; by pizzagaters: 0 victims, no semblance of a where or when podesta or Alefantis would have committed said crimes. That&#39;s why they claimed credit for the arrests and have to include previous scandals. They have nothing so in order to remain relevant they include other stuff</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll put it like this. I was once banned for what I thought was the most ridiculous thing possible. A post of mine about the blockchain where I posted in a trollish way. Yes I did buy into the blockchain kool-aid and the post was trollish sure. But a comment from months ago?? I was muted and unable to comment on anything. </p>

<p>I even messaged modmail and got lost in the crowd. But instead of freaking out I just messaged modmail again and got it all straightened out. Mods are just regular people too and make mistakes. I guess that when mods get a reported comment that it doesn&#39;t provide as much context as it probably should. </p>

<p>But a post like this while some may see as a shitpost is important because challenging the &quot;power structure&quot; of even our little corner of reddit is important. But not going through the proper channels first will not help the cause at all.</p>

<p>Maybe mod mail should have been my first step and next time I&#39;ll take that into consideration, for sure. My post was pretty reactionary. But the visibility of the discussion is also important to me and I&#39;m sure other users here as I know others share my concerns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EDIT: Any proof he was banned?</p>

<p>If he&#39;s not a shill, a few days timeout would probably be sufficient. It works well in other (non-reddit) forums.</p>

<p>I never reported him, but I noticed he would camp on threads, and could push a rate of 50% of the responses in a thread. You can call that fanaticism, addiction, unhealthy or something else. I see it as anti-social, as it&#39;s a surefire method to drive off genuine human posters.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been guilty of the same in the past, which is why I&#39;m even cognizant of it.</p>

<p>Or maybe he went personal in some posts that are now deleted? We wouldn&#39;t know. I&#39;ve seen him get close enough to that line, and combined with his tendency to camp threads I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he overreacted somewhere and got himself reported for genuine violations. It&#39;s a major risk when you won&#39;t let a point go.</p>

<p>How about an entire page of his history spamming the same comment over and over again?</p>

<p>Calling Trump supporters in Conspiracy boot licking fascists.</p>

<p>He deserved his ban.  Get over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know maybe I&#39;m hostile because you automatically believe enoughtrumpspam&#39;s bullshit story about why he was banned when all you had to do was click through 3 pages of his user history to see that he is a spammer... Which is exactly what the modmail he screen called said he was banned for.</p>

<p>Also I just looked into <a href="/u/Lelouch_Di_Britannia">/u/Lelouch_Di_Britannia</a> about ten pages of his submitted history.  While he does post some pro Trump stuff he also posts some anti Trump administration stuff, pizzagate, domestic spying.  He is all over the place.</p>

<p>He isn&#39;t spamming pro Trump stuff as it&#39;s been framed by enoughtrumpspam&#39;s allegations.</p>

<p>So here is where we are now man.  You can either deal with it or you can go away on your own or with my assistance.  Your call.  It&#39;s don&#39;t have time to deal with the tears of people who won&#39;t even flip through a spammer&#39;s user history before jumping on the bandwagon that the world is ending.</p>

<p>You could have easily seen for yourself that enoughtrumpspam is indeed a spammer.  It took me like 20 seconds to rediscover why I banned him.</p>

<p>This conversation/debate about this user is officially over.  Any further bitching about his ban will be interpreted by me as &quot;you need my assistance&quot;. </p>

<p>Seriously though if you want to ban me, go for it. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re itching to. I&#39;ll go hang with <a href="/u/SovereignMan">/u/SovereignMan</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, people don&#39;t realize that these posts only hurt OP since they are being somewhat accusatory without giving the mods a chance to respond. It could also be considered inflammatory or an attack on a mod.</p>

<p>If people have grievances with a mod they should just message the mod mail in the queue first before going nuclear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh?</p>

<p>I was stating that if it were the case that he made an alt and is posting in this sub, it doesn&#39;t absolve the mods of banning him in the first place for a less than stellar reason. I guess I could have worded it better</p>
