    <div class="md"><p>He cancelled his appearance and SXSW... but didn&#39;t skip the opioid speech... He did the ribbon cutting at the new FBIHQ... but dropped a Yankees joke after leading everyone into thinking he was gonna comment on Russia/something &quot;important&quot;... He had a meeting with Senators and they came out serious and not saying a single word... Meeting with Paul Ryan... bounces on the press...  </p>

<p>I think this is &quot;era&quot; that Comey has been waiting for... everyone is asking everyone to investigate everyone else... and he&#39;s already been on the case for a long while... FBI never forgot what the I stood for... out of all the USIC they are one of the few with their ducks in a row... When it comes down to it they got the documentation game by the book. Few bad apples... hell even a couple bad branches... but FBI is doing good work. </p>

<p>Old school Comey in FBI Vault about WJC pardons... Pinkus Greene... Clinton Foundation. Back when he was just <a href="http://i.imgur.com/n9wsIvL.png">enthusiastic USA Comey</a>...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not on any side... thats what so many people have trouble understanding him... He&#39;s just a dude... doing what he swore under oath to do... it&#39;s almost impossible to comprehend because it so rarely happens... Here&#39;s him talking about the HRC mishandling classified info case... </p>

<p>&quot;&gt;I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation—including people in government—but none of that mattered to us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation the right way. Only facts matter, and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldn’t be prouder to be part of this organization.&quot;</p>

<p>He is honest when he says that. </p>
