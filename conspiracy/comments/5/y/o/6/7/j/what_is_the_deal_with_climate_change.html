    <div class="md"><p>CO2 is good for plants because it is what they breathe. Increased CO2  concentrations = larger crop yields.</p>

<p>The idea that CO2 is poisonous is flat out stupid.</p>

<p>The claim that CO2 functions more as a greenhouse gas than any other gas in our atmosphere remains unproven.</p>

<p>Anthropologists claim that humans crossed into North America 20-30,000 years ago in the land bridge that was the result of ocean water concentrating in the frozen polar ice caps. It is entirely possible that warming and reduction in polar ice caps is the result of a glaciation cycle that has not yet peaked (so it should continue getting warmer for the foreseeable future, regardless). The presence of aquatic fossils across multiple strata of the geologic record suggests that this glaciation is a recurring cycle that has existed long before man.</p>

<p>I do believe that we need to be better custodians of our environment. It is important, however, to ensure that we are solving real problems.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the only way to power the futuristic society everyone claims to want, unless you cut populations significantly.</p>

<p>Though obviously it needs to be done with greater foresight. Nuclear plants in geologically unstable regions or within certain range of a coast are bad ideas. Fukushima combined them both.</p>

<p>Though I&#39;ve noticed people claiming that Fukushima isn&#39;t as bad as Chernobyl. Their case rested on a hilarious chart which had taken the effort to update the sievert reading for core 2 at Fukushima to the 2017 levels, but still quotes a 2014 analysis of the amount of radiation which has been released into the environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each carbon dioxide molecule consists of one carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms. While your body excretes carbon dioxide, <strong>too high of a concentration of the compound is toxic</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>QUESTION: IS CARBON DIOXIDE POISONOUS?
Answer: You probably know carbon dioxide is a gas that is present in the air you breathe. Plants &quot;breathe&quot; it in order to make glucose. You exhale carbon dioxide gas as a by-product of respiration. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is one of the greenhouse gases. You find it added to soda, naturally occurring in beer, and in its solid form as dry ice. Based on what you know, do you think carbon dioxide is poisonous or is it non-toxic or somewhere in between?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THE ANSWER
Ordinarily, carbon dioxide is not poisonous. It diffuses from your cells into your bloodstream and from there out via your lungs, yet it is always present throughout your body.</p>

<p>However, <strong>if you breathe high concentrations of carbon dioxide or re-breathe air (such as from a plastic bag or tent), you may be at risk for carbon dioxide intoxication or even carbon dioxide poisoning. Carbon dioxide intoxication and carbon dioxide poisoning are independent of oxygen concentration, so you may have enough oxygen present to support life, yet still suffer from the effects of rising carbon dioxide concentration in your blood and tissues</strong>. Symptoms of carbon dioxide toxicity include high blood pressure, flushed skin, headache and twitching muscles. At higher levels, you could experience panic, irregular heartbeat, hallucinations, vomited and potentially unconsciousness or even death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a waste product of animals. Your body wouldn&#39;t get rid of it if it wasn&#39;t bad for you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Water vapor does exert ~2.5 times as much clear-sky longwave radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere as co2. The big difference between the two is that water vapor rapidly precipitates out of the atmosphere and the earth keeps a roughly constant overall relative humidity. In other words, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is a function of temperature. If you completely saturated the atmosphere with water vapor, for instance, it would precipitate out back to its original levels within a few weeks or months. If a forcing warms the earth, however, that causes more evaporation and allows the atmosphere to hold more water vapor, causing a moistening of the atmosphere which amplifies the warming from the initial forcing. That is why water vapor is considered a feedback on the climate rather than a forcing driving temperature change on its own. We have observed this moistening of the atmosphere as a feedback amplifying the warming from our greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said that. The carbon cycle works significantly slower than the water cycle which is why co2 has a residency time several orders of magnitude greater than water vapor. Secondly, only about a quarter of our emissions get absorbed by the biosphere and another quarter by the oceans; the rest rapidly accumulates in the atmosphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>fair enough explanation there.</p>

<p>my opinion is that the global carbon hysteria is a part of a well-funded campaign (in effect for about 30 years now), which has essentially hijacked the academic establishment. Slowly, the cult&#39;s doubters were shunned from tenure, publication, and eventually forced from their positions, eventually creating a real <em>consensus</em>. It&#39;s big bucks for the priest-class, who use their status to sell the hoax to students who don&#39;t know (or can&#39;t think) better.</p>

<p>Looking through your comments, I see that you are highly invested in this whole business... This is where &quot;science&quot; is heading... shit...</p>

The rapid increase we are seeing today is faster then in the past and the major difference between the past warming cycles and today is the amount of green house gasses present in the atmosphere. Its more then just CO2 but CO2 is the easiest and most effective thing we can control to reduce the warming trend. But with the increase in melting permafrost releasing vast amounts of trapped methane it may be to late to due much.</p>

<p>Mass is a big deal in physics, no shit. Cuck yourself on the regular, dude. </p>

<p>I feel like you are gaslighting me because I just laid it out for you that temperature is measured through physics and is defined as the ability to heat a specific amount of mass. Maybe you just don&#39;t get it - but mass <em>does</em> matter in physics. As I illustrated to you before, it&#39;s <em>essential</em>. You don&#39;t care that it&#39;s true. I guess you choose to believe that heat transfer is some chemical property, which is affected in a catalyst fashion, where mass is not important. The realities of the mechanisms of heat transfer means that it is a physical property (even heat released from chemical reactions is a physical property, but whatever). This is why i think you are gaslighting or a useful idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for an educated person, you sure confuse apples and oranges quite willingly (must be a part of the job).</p>

<p>the situation that you are describing is of a chemical reaction, while sunlight hitting CO2 molecules and making them vibrate is a physical one (CO2 doesn&#39;t become a new molecule, as the sodium does when it contacts water). Still, the degree to which the chemical reaction of sodium and water will generate heat is directly proportional to the <em>mass</em> of Sodium consumed.</p>

<p>So yes, even in your exothermic chemical reaction between sodium and water, mass is still essential. Does this make any sense at all to you? Can you give me a single calculation of heat transfer that is not dependent upon mass (only in CO2 &quot;science&quot;... God help us all).</p>

The earth cools itself off to space by emitting light. Even though nitrogen makes up the vast bulk of the atmosphere&#39;s mass it hardly absorbs any of that infrared light. Greenhouse gases on the other hand, despite their low relative abundance do absorb certain infrared wavelengths. They then either use that energy that would have simply all escaped to space to warming the local atmosphere or by remitting that light in a random direction, sometimes back down to earth. That significantly slows down the rate at which the earth loses heat to the cold of space and causes the earth to be significantly warmer than it would otherwise be. The removal of that 0.04% co2 woud also cause a lot of water vapor to precipitate out of the atmosphere as well as triggering other amplifying feedbacks that would result in the earth being almost if not entirely frozen over pole to pole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Correlation is NOT causation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not just correlation though. We know the mechanism whereby carbon dioxide traps heat. You can plainly see the impact of carbon dioxide on earth&#39;s temperature in both the spectral flux at the top of the atmosphere and in the downwelling radiation from the atmosphere towards the surface. </p>

<p>As a result of the 45% in co2 since the industrial revolution we have observed the enhanced greenhouse effect as a decrease in co2 wavelengths escaping to space and a corresponding increase in co2&#39;s radiative forcing at the surface. You can even observe co2&#39;s radiative forcing at the surface go up and down in lockstep with its concentration in the atmosphere. That shows a direct cause-effect relationship between rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and rising global temperatures. </p>

<p>The patterns of warming also fit the distinct signatures that we would expect from greenhouse-induced warming such as nights warming faster than days, the troposphere warming while the stratosphere cools, the tropopause rising, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>essentially, the video states that a person who argues that the low percentage of CO2 is relying on feeling and non-expertise. Truth is that these people are using <em>reason</em> and the fact that they are excluded from the subsidized world of &quot;carbon research.&quot;</p>

<p>Same could be said for terrorism in the US, and its effect on policy. Such a small chance of death for most of the population, why did it become #1 issue? The issue with terrorism and CO2 climate debate is the ability of moneyed interests to hijack dialogue and policy. Personally, I think that the radiation spewing from Fukushima represents a greater existential threat to life on Earth than your CO2 bogeyman. You can&#39;t agree with me (even though I&#39;m right) because your agenda tells you to do otherwise. We are all in this together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science is based on empiricism, not strictly logic and reasoning. To see what effect something has you need to run experiments, not just pontificate. Aristotle and others before the industrial revolution thought they could just reason their way to natural law, which led them to numerous fallacies such as thinking heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects in a vacuum. That was obvious to people just as it is obvious to you that co2 cannot have a great impact due to its relative abundance. It is obvious, and false </p>

<p>Aristotle&#39;s assumptions were proven wrong because he was ignorant of Newton&#39;s Laws. Again, Newton demonstrated the significance of <em>mass</em> time and time again, but that is beside the point. The CO2 thing is <em>obvious</em> to your group... that is the whole point... you have to resort to complicated jargon (aka bullshit) which is all deliberately forced to the conclusion that human CO2 emissions are the greatest danger to life on Earth (which I again argue they are not). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a couple orders of magnitude off in your numbers, fyi. And you can&#39;t tell effect from relative abundance. For instance, ozone is measured in parts per <em>billion</em> (0.00006% of the atmosphere) yet is not only responsible for the vertical temperature profile of the stratosphere but is also the reason why you don&#39;t receive lethal doses of UV radiation when you go outside. Despite being only 0.04% of the atmosphere carbon dioxide exerts a quarter of the clear-sky longwave radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere.</p>

Think of the difference between predicting the outcome of an individual coin flip (analagous to weather) versus the outcome of many such coin flips (analagous to climate). The former has too many chaotic variables: how much force and torque is applied, the wind speed and air density, the topography and hardness of the surface and which it lands, etc. Whereas most of those variables even out over many coin flips; the probability of a heads or tails from many coin flips would be determined by the weight distribution of the coin. Just because you can&#39;t precict a single coin flip doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t predict an evenly weighted coin will average 50/50 over the long-term. Similarly, weather has innumerable chaotic short-term fluctiations but those even out in the long-term; the two are dominated by different variables and thus methodologies, which is why they are separate fields.</p>
