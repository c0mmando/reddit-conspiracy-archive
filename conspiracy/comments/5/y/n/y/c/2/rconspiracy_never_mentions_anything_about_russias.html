    <div class="md"><p>So far from what I have seen there has never been any reliable information presented to the public validating the &quot;Russians&quot; theory. True, a has been MI5 agent wrote a report up based on hearsay and rumors found around Moscow (see Alexander Nekrassov&#39;s comments on the report). The other evidence presented was a report by intelligence agencies which pretty much said <em>&quot;trust us, we totally know it was Russians&quot;</em>. That&#39;s it. </p>

<p>To complicate matters, we now know that the CIA can fake Russian data-hacking. We also know they lost control of their hacking tools also. What this all means is that even if the Russians <em>did</em> hack US digital infrastructure we can never be sure. It&#39;s entirely possible it was the CIA or any number of other people who got their hands on compromised CIA hacking tools. </p>

<p>In my opinion the Russian narrative is a creation designed to generate hostility with Russia and interfere with Presidential relations with the second largest nuclear power on earth.</p>

<p>Who is even in the Trump administration at this time eludes me. The transition is obviously being sabotaged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can name two who lied about it  (Russia) and another who didn&#39;t even make it to election day (Flynn, Sessions, Manafort). The GOP has full control of the legislature, if this administration knew what it was doing at this point it would be shoring up any loose ends as far as who to appoint and nominate and hire to the 3k+ bureaucracy controlled by the executive branch. The GOP will rubber stamp just about anyone for them. The only people sabotaging it is the administration themselves. </p>

The most common argument for the far left about Trump is that he is part of the establishment, yet the establishment keeps trying to pain Trump as a Russian and corrupt place president. So if he is still part of the PTB plan, why are they trying so hard to paint him as conspiring with the &quot;red scare&quot;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Hillary got elected do you think we&#39;d be having a debate about all the money she received from Saudi Arabia? or Quatar? or Podesta&#39;s ties to Russia? No. This whole Russia Russia Russia narrative is being driven for the sole purpose of undermining our president. </p>

<p>Here are a few facts for you though. Russia didn&#39;t hack our election. The DNC leaks were given to Wikileaks by a DNC insider who met with a go between in Washington D.C. </p>

<p>The Podesta leaks were from John Podesta being a complete fucking idiot and falling for a phishing scam. </p>

<p>Now, we know the CIA can make it look like the Russians. Perhaps, Hillary and Co, knowing full well they were not going to win the election, perhaps they laid the groundwork in place so they could try and impeach Trump in the future. </p>

<p>Yeah, you got a server in Trump tower with ties to a Russian bank, a server that was set up by Evan McMullins wife.   </p>

<p>And then we have the Washington Post, a newspaper whose owner has a multi million dollar contract with the CIA, claiming an unnamed CIA insider has confirmed the alleged Russian ties with Trump. </p>

<p>Quite honestly it just all seems like such bullshit. A lot of people are pissed that Trump won and Clinton lost. A lot of people lost a fuck ton of money betting on Clinton, and now the powers that be are using the media, one of their last weapons against us, to try and get an uninformed populace to undermine our president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they have to due to the media pushing this Cold War era Russian propaganda angle to the public. In reality, plenty of businessmen and politicians have at least some contacts in Russia. The difference is, if Hillary were in office right now, there wouldn&#39;t be a ridiculous &quot;Russian spy&quot; witchhunt calling their Uranium deals or the Podesta brothers&#39; Russian ties into question.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t really see a problem with improving Russian relations and allowing more commerce to be conducted between the two super powers. If anyone knows a good reason why that&#39;s bad for anyone besides the military-industrial complex, then I&#39;d really be interested to hear it. But so far, it seems like the MSM is pushing for war with their rhetoric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Improving relations with Russia is something a president should do. </p>

<p>Lying about conflicts of interest that threaten national security is treason, a violation of the emoluments clause of the constitution, and is treason. </p>

<p>And &quot;but Hillary!&quot; is not a legit excuse for treason. It&#39;s entirely irrelevant if Hillary would have done a better or worse job than Trump. I&#39;m sure you have problems with Obama - is it fair for me to say everything Obama did is fine because I think Romney was a worse choice? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the more important conspiracy. Why is the MSM pushing the Russian thing when they can&#39;t provide hard evidence? There&#39;s a power struggle going on between different parts of the shadow government. Each side is trying to smear the other side with false claims, half-truths and working with the MSM networks to spread that info. They&#39;re hoping people only focus on their lies or half-baked truths. </p>

<p>Also: if Trump was working with Russia, the CIA would&#39;ve leaked that info to journalists to take him down. All we have are anonymous sources and unreliable sources.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists are typically spoken of in a derogatory manner (weird, uneducated, etc.), but the furtive insistence we get in line with the Russian narrative is notable because since when does anyone give a single fuck what we think? </p>

Obama and Clinton rubber stamp Uranium One deal and there is silence. Trump potentially sent spam email to Russia and is KGB agent.

<p>I can name two who lied about it  (Russia) and another who didn&#39;t even make it to election day (Flynn, Sessions, Manafort). The GOP has full control of the legislature, if this administration knew what it was doing at this point it would be shoring up any loose ends as far as who to appoint and nominate and hire to the 3k+ bureaucracy controlled by the executive branch. The GOP will rubber stamp just about anyone for them. The only people sabotaging it is the administration themselves. </p>
