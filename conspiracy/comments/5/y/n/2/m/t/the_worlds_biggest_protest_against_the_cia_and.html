<p>Time to start a revolution NOW, not later. </p>

<p>June 19</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So lets wait three months and see how we feel? If you&#39;re mad as hell now, and know others are too, just start a protest today and invite everyone you meet to join you buy telling them what you stand for, should you think that helps. </p>

<p>Does the date you propose hold any significance besides being far enough in the future for everyone to have simmered down back to complacent apathy? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, we&#39;re in deep trouble and need to change our ways dramatically, but I don&#39;t think protesting &quot;TPTB&quot; with signs and clever slogans is the way to go. If you have a coherent cause and momentum, perhaps, but in general it just won&#39;t change much, especially if it&#39;s not spontaneous and authentic, as organized protests are way too easily cooped and derailed. </p>

<p>South Korea is perhaps the best example of how a spontaneous and unified protest that is immediately backed up by true facts about the cause they represent can change things. It was a cause everyone agreed with and one of which ever one knew, that everyone agreed with. In the US, this is far from the case. Everyone knows that things are fucked up, but almost everyone thinks they&#39;re basically alone in their contempt. If you want your protest to have any kind of impact, you will first need to take care that everyone knows, that everyone knows, only then will &quot;TPTB&quot; have the shorter end of the stick. </p>

<p>Just my 2c.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not hoping for  South Korea style protests so soon. But smaller gatherings like these will also have a huge impact. We don&#39;t know how many people know. Even if it&#39;s not a success this time, more people might join later on.  People need to start protesting against the tptb, and see through the right and left divide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Small and large gatherings all have an impact, but I&#39;ve come to think the we need to be for a new way much more strongly than we are against the old ways. You know what I mean? </p>

<p>I reckon there&#39;s just no point in defeating TPTB if we don&#39;t fight for a new way of doing things. And I think that&#39;s the one thing we&#39;ve not yet understood. TPTB are fine with protesters. They are all too easily dealt with. What they despise and will fight to their inevitable deaths are new and better ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea this was exactly the problem with OWS.  The problem affects all of us, but everyone comes in with their separate axe to grind and their inane, incompatible ideologies.  So zero progress is made and no one who can actually change anything gets involved. </p>

<p>For example, serious question: what would the steps be to end the FED and switch to a tenable solution?  Similarly, how would we do it with the CIA?  These are enormous undertakings and anyone that has any real leverage in the matter is already bought and paid for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know he may just be a LARPer, but something HLI on 4chan proposed still rings very true in my mind. The old world can only survive in the shadows. If he want to break with the old world, we merely have to bring it to light. A protest can achieve that, but only rarely does because they are so easily derailed and if need be ignored. </p>

<p>We have to think forward and think in bigger ideas than we&#39;re trained to. Thorium reactors, orbital space ring elevators, near infinite revenue and resources from space mining operations. Infinite solar energy from orbital solar power plants, 100% recycling capabilities, safe disposal of nuclear waste straight into the sun, free everything but luxury, etc. etc. </p>

<p>This would be just one path into the future they don&#39;t want us to consider, I&#39;m sure you could conceive your own. It&#39;s not enough to shout and paint signs that tell those in the shadows what we don&#39;t like, we know they couldn&#39;t give two shits. </p>

<p>We have to 1) bring them and their ideals to light, and 2) imagine another way forward in love and prosperity for everyone, including those who have sinned against humanity.</p>

<p>Again, just my 2c.</p>

There has to be way way more focused energy at this than just a wild handful of angry protesters. The momentum you would need for a movement of this magnitude is generated from the dealing of years or oppression. I feel we have been oppressed and controlled for years however, the MAJORITY of Americans have been bred into it and are completely passive. Of the people I have spoken to about the evil agency they are almost always with this attitude of yeah so I&#39;m not doing anything wrong or it&#39;s their job to spy on people to help catch evil doers. THEY ARE THE EVIL DOERS!! I am going to pray that something/someone could mount a big enough following of outraged Americans to effect the secret shadow government ruling the entire world but even an Amy of leaves can&#39;t control the wind.</p>

<p>On the Left, unfortunately, there is a systematic cultural marxism that is being spread through the colleges, facebook, twitter censorship that is creating this safe space/pc/sjw/snowflake culture and they lash out with violence if they don&#39;t get their way and there is zero room to speak with them logically, because for these folks, feelings are more important.</p>

<p>The majority of the right is happy right now because of trump, the majority of left is angry illogical snowflakes screaming who won&#39;t let anyone speak with them logically.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about context. In this case, my example is the Berkley U protests where left wingers attack and beat anyone who has a MAGA hat and burn free speech signs while the cops stand down and do nothing, because this is Left-Ran university, Soros&#39; son goes there and controls them with gift$, the State is Left, and so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>antifa did not become facists, they were always facists. antifa is an astro turf made up bullshit thing, dressed exactly like, employing the same tactics as, and carrying the same flags as the ukrainian neo-nazis in the maidan &quot;uprising&quot; in ukraine.</p>

<p>they are not anarchists. nothing they do or say is remotely in keeping with anarchism. the are not using black bloc tactics. and most of all they are not protesting anything real, they are protesting some amorphous, emo, psuedo-existenstial threat of trump and an epidemic of neo-nazis and facists and whatever is the theme of the day. </p>

<p>anarchists drag ourselves out only for real shit--pershing nuclear missles, WTO, iraq war, occupy wall street (that was co-opted though. adbusters, the anarchist mag, had the idea and made the call, then asshats like that guy from 30 rock showed up, as did a bunch of &quot;serious&quot; people). </p>

<p>rule of thumb: no protest is organic and real if it isn&#39;t feared by the cops--with all of these protests, where&#39;s the kettling? where&#39;s the mace and the tear gas? where&#39;s the hoses? where&#39;s the instigating? cops don&#39;t fear what is going on right now, because they know it&#39;s fake.</p>

<p>if you know any of these antifa assholes, ask them the following questions:</p>

<p>what is the definition of facism? (answer--the marriage of the power of the state with the power of the corporation for the benefit of the corporation, i.e. corporatism, i. e. neoliberalism. who says so? mussolini that&#39;s who. they were born into a facist country and have lived in one their whole lives and never gave 2 fucks about it until jan 20th).</p>

<p>who is the black bloc? (answer: no one, black bloc are tactics not people. there is no such thing as a black bloc anarchist. </p>

<p>black bloc tactics do not include violence and vandalism. if anarchists engage in vandalism, it is a personal, individual decision. anarchists who do so target facist and capitalist targets, i.e. the police and goldman sacs. while i agree with other anarchists who believe there can be no crimes against inanimate objects, but i also agree with those who think vandalism is self sabotaging bad optics and creates too big of a chance that some regular person&#39;s property will be damaged in the process.</p>

<p>targeting individual people is what facists do. anarchists put themselves between facist thugs and individuals. we are reactive in conflict not proactive, just like how straight edge punks used put ourselves in front of anyone being hassled by skin heads.</p>

<p>the core black bloc tactics are arm linking, unarresting, covering mouth/nose and/or eyes in case of tear gas, returning tear gas cannisters, everyone wearing the same color to make it hard for the police to single people out, like lions and zebra stripes).</p>

<p>last question for the antifa-tard--what is anarchism? (answer: anarchisim is the opposistion to all forms of oppression, and since oppression is the inevitable outcome of heirachy, anarchism is also the opposition to all forms of heirachy, and since heirarchy is the inevitable outcome of property, anarchism is finally the opposition to all forms of property that impede anyone else&#39;s autonomy, self determination, self sufficiency, and ability to live with dignity--i.e. all land, mineral and water resources, food, and money, and increasingly air).</p>

<p>a real anarchist will answer all three questions right.</p>

<p>Socialism isn&#39;t good because human nature isn&#39;t good. What you&#39;re going to get with socialism is a culture where everyone is a fucking clone in a safe space PC snowflake culture while the vulture sociopaths rule the whole thing from the top and all free speech is gone because &#39;muh feelins&#39;. </p>

<p>Do you see how Socialism is working out in Venezuela? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.insidesources.com/socialism-not-oil-cause-venezuelas-problems/">http://www.insidesources.com/socialism-not-oil-cause-venezuelas-problems/</a></p>

<p>Did you know that Sociopaths/Psychopaths are naturally drawn to positions of power and will do whatever it takes to get them?</p>

<p>So that&#39;s the thing, when you have total socialism, sure it may alright for a while for everyone, until that one Hitler-esque Polpot/Stalin/Elnin/Chairman Mao comes into the pictures and controls the People with Ironfist.....then we are all fucked like Venezuela.</p>

<p>Another problem with the far left I&#39;m seeing is the programming in the Universities to only think left, where conservatism is deemed a disease, anti-white, anti-Christian, anti-free speech, and the most important part is the Feminist movements being hijacked by Islam:</p>

<p><a href="http://markhumphrys.com/left.islamic.html">http://markhumphrys.com/left.islamic.html</a></p>

<p>Biggest issues of them all is this: Believing in this kind of disillusioned utopian society where everyone gets along, including Muslim Fundamentalists, who want the women to dress in hijabs and to undergo female circumcision and being completely fine with that, or being completely fine with a Psychopath/Sociopath running the country as long as she looks like the left and caters to the leftist ideologies, not knowing what this type of person is capable of.</p>

<p>We see now what&#39;s going on Sweden and Germany with this kind of leadership in terms of unchecked and unbridled immigration from 3rd world countries that do not ever adapt to modern day culture and values. </p>

<p>Of course if I asked you if you would take down your fence in your backyard and open your door and broadcast/allow anyone who wanted to come live there including homeless, drug addicts, gang members, meth lab owners, etc.....you would be fine with that because equality right?</p>

<p>don&#39;t work because then we become like Venezuela, or rather, some incompetent smooth talking hustler sociopath takes control (like Obama) who knows nothing about the intricacies of economics, and you end up with a starving country on the verge of being taken over by the highest bidders (China/Japan/Etc)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Unfettered capitalism allows the sociopaths/psychopaths to horde wealth, creating the 1%, raping the middle class, real estate/auto sub prime load bubbles and what should be completely illegal derivatives markets, a military industrial complex that depends on war to make money and is in bed with the deepstate, so you&#39;re left with a ton of inequality.</p>

<p>Either of those is doomed for failure. We need some new hybrid pf sorts, decentralized, renewable energies, revolting against the 1%&#39;ers, alternative currencies that are not tied to just oil, getting rid of the Federal Reserve, and a lot more I&#39;m missing here.</p>

<p>Also true A.I. Robotics are coming that will take everyone&#39;s job requiring a UBI within the next 30-40 years, so some serious shit is on the way and will only lead to a 1% Technocracy while everyone else can get fucked.</p>

<p>They will have all the tech life extension, cancer cures, protected enclaves, etc while the rest of us are left to fight against each other via divided factions based on left/right, religion, race, haves/have nots, and so on, when we really should be storming &#39;them&#39; and redistribution under a new system </p>

<p>Your own mind creates the idea of ownership and permanence, when really you only have X amount left and when you die, someone else will get what you believe is &#39;yours.&#39;</p>

<p>If your wife cheated, your stuff got taken, and you got fired all after finding out from the Doctor some bad news with only a small amount of time left, would you still be happy? Or does your happiness depend on all these things to be in place?</p>

<p>stating facts ≠ insulting</p>

<p>The far-right also has some fucked up things about them and should get called out diligently.</p>

<p>We are all American&#39;s living in this country and have to agree on things. I fucking hated it G.W.Bush was Prez and knew 9/11 was a hustle and the Middle East was a M.I.C. pay day, but the bible thumpers voted that fucker in and we all had to pay for it.</p>

<p>I voted, unfortunately for Obama, and within that first years realized nothing would change except more deepstate puppetry and had to deal with it and all of us have to pay for the Economic deficits and him allowing the banks to get bailed out instead of the people, cause the man is an idiot who simply know how to smooth talk.</p>

<p>Between the 2 sides, the one thing that scares the shit out of me and I will fight for, is seeing the Far Left burn free speech signs and creating safe space/pc/snowflake zones.....that&#39;s not real life and that&#39;s not how America works. If this side got their leader in, we&#39;d start seeing the erosion of free speech</p>

<p>The thing that scares me about the Far -Right is the Bible Belt thumpers with their guns and racism. This side already had their G.W. Bush and it was a disaster.</p>

<p>We need to agree on what this country stands for, Unite, and go after Soros, Koch Brothers, Deepstate, Mega Corps, and R0thsch1lds</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From doing it, I realized that protesting was to inform both the public and political representatives of of the issue and the level of concern for the issue. I found protesting, in my case standing in a group with a sign to be a terrible way to accomplish that.</p>

<p>I saw a couple leave, who had prepared informational cards, that went to go walk among the crowds and personally talk to people, then hand out their leaflet/card. I thought that was probably 100 times more effective.</p>

<p>I also realize that the representatives would totally ignore my actions and the only way to get their attention was to contact them directly as a constituent.</p>

<p>It just seems people ignore protesters. Recently, people have been coaxed to hate protesters. There are a ton of ways to spread information. Many of them are forceful and obnoxious, in a spammy, advertisement, kind of way. It seems like protesting has become spam. Almost any other form of conveying information seemed better.</p>

I&#39;d wager a very large majority of the women&#39;s march were dumb as bricks, but they have conviction in their beliefs, and the sheer number of people involved gives credence to the issue in people&#39;s minds. </p>

<p>I&#39;d suspect the people actually motivated enough and knowledgeable enough about this issue would amount to a relatively small gathering.  So spreading awareness through other means will definitely be more useful in the short term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha ha! After spending years bashing the left and campaigning for Trump Republicans to get elected, this sub suddenly wants their help protesting. LOL Just look at the right wing partisan complaining in this very thread! Good luck with your protest which will be a handful of MRA neckbeards and CIA cyber agents that have infiltrated the right. </p>

<p>There is a reason why at a grass roots level the left have 50 times more people turn up to their protests, because the right has always been the tool of the oppressor. </p>

<p>Step outside your bubble for a second.</p>

<p>Do you really think revolutions come from Republican party supporter/Trump supporter base? No, that base is what elects Nazis and Italian fascists. You guys are all authoritarians. Some of you pretend you are not, then you politically rally around authoritarians like Trump when he masquerades and puts on a clown show saying the things you like at election time.</p>

<p>Your biggest fear is a bunch of SJWs on Tumblr. People who will not ever have any power to be scary, because the SJW Tumblr movement in North America is a lazy movement of the extremely privileged. </p>

<p>So no one wants to support guys, who vote for a Trump administration with Goldman Sachs, Exxon Mobile, and Devos in it, because they are super scared about a bunch of powerless entitled SJW millenials.</p>

I know it&#39;s drastic to pull out all at once and I am by no means perfect but my vehicle runs on veggie oil, I grow lots of my plants for food/medicine/household products, I live in a small truck camper and would love to build earth ships one day.

<p>Our true freedom and sovereignty must be predicated on Peace, Compassion and Love.</p>

<p>Like a child escaping it&#39;s role as the victim in an abusive relationship with their parent...</p>

<p>We MUST break the Archetypal Cycle that has ruled this world for far too long.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying we cannot chant but we must organize in a peaceable manner that prevents agent provocateurs from ruining the movement from the inside out.</p>

<p>We must have a clear statement of desire and intent and we must distance outselves from anyone who behaves in a violent/aggressive manner lest they compromise the entire premise.</p>

<p>Now is the time for organization.</p>

<p>Due not allow extreme emotional reactions/outbursts to be our undoing.</p>

<p>In a time where the world is governed by children, the people must stand tall as the true parents of this world and show love to one and all.</p>

<p>Did operation wall street accomplish anything? What about any other protest in known history?</p>

<p>In order to get what you want you need to cloud seed the ideas to the appropriate parties. (think trump pence etc). </p>

<p>You cant stand in a street full of locals and expect to effect the outside community of politically backed aggressors. .</p>

<p>You have to really get to the top to make a change snd that tskes a group effort.
But 100 million letters to the white house, say way more then a few hundred people rioting in the streets. </p>

<p>Thats all these protests accomplish. We need to really buckle down on an information exchange and amass our own &#39;shill&#39; armies. </p>

<p>Stsrt demanding change with strength in numbers seeding the messages on social networks and organizing public hits to media channels. 
Use their networks against then. See a cnn repporter interrupt their broadcast. 
That hits 10 million viewers with the same message and takes a single person...</p>

<p>These &#39;protests&#39; require permits lol. </p>

<p>They know who is there snd give you &#39;relief&#39; areas to vent. You kick over trashcans. Get maced and beaten. They make you look like a criminal dissident and a fool.No change is established and your arrested in the end with even further reduction of rights then the last time / position you started in. </p>

<p>Instead start reaching out in silence. Ask users what they want. Have a list of demands that are practical. Then use PR campaigns and media outlets to push the issue. Start justifying your causes and retaliating in practical ways.  </p>

<p>We have far more power then we know. Yet we use this faulty &#39;protest design&#39; that never ever accomplishes anything. When basic boycotts are the very pertinent manners we truly have in our power to change the system. </p>

<p>Think if 150 million americans refused to goto work until x y z is accomplished. </p>

<p>Thats how you make change...</p>

<p>After a half an hour what began as wuiet talks began to escalate to full on bantor. The passengers were suffocating over the nerve of the airlines solution. Every body and soul growing more and more furious as they passed the message on. 
Suddenly the airline made an announcement...</p>

<p>You wont be boarding the plane outside. A flight from europe is being reused once its landed within the hour-</p>

<p>To make change you have to initiate it quietly. The nail that stands up gets hammered down- 
These protests arent designed to change the situation. They are nothing more then participation trophys, to make you feel like you made a difference! Yet their true intent is to make you nothing more then a useful idiot in the greater spectrum of things. You become the tool of theirbtrade and it adapts to your efforts. Using them to chisel its future foundations...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be the tool- be the solution-</p>

<p>Literally the protest can be debunked with one google search and one listening to a hearing of house intelligence oversight committee. I&#39;m guessing there&#39;ll be like 2 dozen people there and no news coverage.</p>
