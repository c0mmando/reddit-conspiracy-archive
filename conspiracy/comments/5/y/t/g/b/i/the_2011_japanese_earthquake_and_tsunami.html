      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At the time of the first Fukushima earthquake, I argued (as did many Japanese investigators) that the quake and tsunami had been deliberately and artificially created and triggered.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first assumption here is that the technologies exist to do this. Some of them have been studied since World War Two, when in fact the Allies did study methods of creating earthquakes and tsunamis to hit Japan prior to the presumed Allied invasion of the Japanese home islands, and invasion which, of course, with the dropping of Little Boy and Fat Man on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was not needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        These methods include triggering massive explosions (conventional or nuclear) along certain fault lines, to more exotic methods involving energy weapons, low pressure zones above earthquake-prone regions, to standing waves in the Earth itself. One only has to Google to discover all sorts of theories are out there. My purpose here is not to review or comment on the plausibility of others' speculations, but merely to mention them, because these possibilities have been long bandied about, including at the highest levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, William Cohen, Defense Secretary under the Clinton Administration, mentioned earthquake weapons, and more importantly, opined that "terrorist groups" may possess them, or to put it more nakedly, he raised the possibility that they may be in the possession of extra-territorial, transnational "organizations".
       </p>
       <p>
        There was also a second component in my musings back then, and that was the geopolitical context. After all, if one wants to target Japan with the "plausible deniability" of an earthquake and tsunami, one has to have a reason to do so. My argument back then was that a credible reason may have been provided by the Japanese government that had just taken power a few weeks prior to the earthquake.
       </p>
       <p>
        And it made rapid progress in trying to steer a new course for the nation, as requests were made to the US government to close or at least reign in the US presence on Okinawa. The new government also made significant though quiet advances to China in an effort to patch up the long-standing ill-feelings between the two governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was talk of a state visit of Emperor Akihito to Beijing, and for a few moments, the signals were that China was seriously considering it.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Then an interesting, and to me, highly significant thing occurred
        </em>
        : then US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, the only cabinet level Republican in President Obama's Administration, issued what could only be considered a threat against the new Japanese government, a threat basically warning Japan not to keep pursuing its course, or else there would be "dire consequences."
       </p>
       <p>
        After the Fukushima disaster, it was quickly reported in various sources, some of them even from the corporate globalist media, that Japan had possibly been hiding a secret nuclear weapons development project at the Daichi plants. Subsequently, that nation turned over some (though certainly not all) of its nuclear waste to the USA, including (it was rumored), plutonium.

       What else could cause this heating anomaly? And if HAARP can cause earthquakes is it only possible to trigger them over faults? Could HAARP also trigger volcanic eruptions?

       This is all great info to have. Thanks for posting it op!
