    <div class="md"><p>That one was awesome too... you just gotta pay very close attention to what he&#39;s saying... the mishandling of classified information is sooooo inconsequential in the grand scheme of espionage HRC was up to that he&#39;s got no problem closing that case to be able to expose to congress how the DOJ is a bunch of shitheads. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the slow jam version... so mellow... but with a funky vibe... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a cute mashup. That speech was awesome up until the end. Had my on the edge of my seat until he said he was letting her off the hook.</p>

<p>It would be like Eliot Ness describing in detail how Al Capone broke the law by not pay his taxes, then saying how he didn&#39;t intend to not to pay his taxes, so he&#39;s closing the case.</p>

<p>Also not a good look when the guy he promotes to #2 in charge has his wife taking $675,000 in what looks like bribes from a long time Clinton associate. That #2 in charge has also been stonewalling all other investigations into Hillary.. </p>

I&#39;m pretty sure HRC 05 in the FBI Vault said that Sidney Blumenthal had Top Secret FBI files in his email(prolly regarding the investigation into HRC) and that someone stole 2 thumbdrives of information out of FBI evidence. </p>

I usually avoid all the youtube topics here... my gut tells me the opposite about Comey... thats why both sides hate him... cause he&#39;s not on either side... he&#39;s just doing what he swore to do when he took his oath.... he&#39;s dangerous to both sides. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the end the email server bullshit was just a smokescreen so HRC thought all the investigations were about some lame server and not about her espionage... just a distraction to cover for why so many people were being questioned and so many computers were being confiscated... it was a real investigation... just not a real important one. </p>
