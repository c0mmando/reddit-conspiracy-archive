       Demonize? If they have done nothing wrong, then they have nothing to hide, right?  And as the fuckwit Comey said, nobody has an absolute right to privacy.

       That one was awesome too... you just gotta pay very close attention to what he's saying... the mishandling of classified information is sooooo inconsequential in the grand scheme of espionage HRC was up to that he's got no problem closing that case to be able to expose to congress how the DOJ is a bunch of shitheads.

       That's a cute mashup. That speech was awesome up until the end. Had my on the edge of my seat until he said he was letting her off the hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be like Eliot Ness describing in detail how Al Capone broke the law by not pay his taxes, then saying how he didn't intend to not to pay his taxes, so he's closing the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also not a good look when the guy he promotes to #2 in charge has his wife taking $675,000 in what looks like bribes from a long time Clinton associate. That #2 in charge has also been stonewalling all other investigations into Hillary..

       Don't worry... HRC will be going down... the email server is just the busted tail light that got her pulled over and lets the cops peek in the window to see the piles of cocaine and dead hookers. Not reasonable to write a ticket for the tail light anymore.

       Take a look into him if you get a chance. I've seen speculation that the CIA has basicly infiltrated the FBI through McCabe and the JTTF.

       JTTF was pretty gung-ho to go after Huma for criminal activities... but the FBI has certainly been compromised... I'm pretty sure HRC 05 in the FBI Vault said that Sidney Blumenthal had Top Secret FBI files in his email(prolly regarding the investigation into HRC) and that someone stole 2 thumbdrives of information out of FBI evidence.

       OK.  I hope you are right.  I recall reading about him last Summer, and it seemed that he made a lot of money off of the Clintons.  I can't imagine him betraying them.

       In the end the email server bullshit was just a smokescreen so HRC thought all the investigations were about some lame server and not about her espionage... just a distraction to cover for why so many people were being questioned and so many computers were being confiscated... it was a real investigation... just not a real important one.

       Had to be child porn... possibly evidence photos from DOJ child porn/abuse cases... Nothing else would make the NYPD ripshit angry so quickly... they aren't forensic scientists... they don't know what classified emails are still classified... but they know child abuse when they see it. Nothing else would make sense... thats how 650,000 files are so quickly evaluated... Open the folder... "Oh shit."... close the folder.

       Are you dumb? Basically any rich executive in this country and all over the world should be suspects. This pedogate is a worldwide epidemic.

       Jimmy Saville was allowed complete access to at least one hospital, maybe a few of them. He would have his own quarters and was allowed full access at all hours of the day and night. Surely the higher ups at the hospital had some idea of what he was up to. I mean he was messing around in the morgue for fucks sake.
