    <div class="md"><p>B.F. Skinner wrote a novel about a new kind of society... &quot;Walden Two&quot; no one really had set jobs... you just had to work a bit each day... the more in demand a job was the more hours at that task you had to work... the less someone wanted to do a job the less hours you&#39;d have to spend on that task. The whole book is pretty interesting though... one of my favorites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, however we are already set up using currency. To destroy that very evil system would collapse the world as we know it and there would be global resistance to it. As much as I like the idea of universal labor, I believe that a universal income would achieve a similar goal with much less destruction and resistance and would allow us to continue as a whole with our normal lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because money is a technology, like the wheel.  If we suddenly didn&#39;t have wheels shit would fuck up everywhere, money is very similar.</p>

<p>We can certainly improve our social system considerably, but don&#39;t discount money as a technology just cause we&#39;re getting choked in its downsides right now.  What we need is a good EPA equivalent to &quot;reduce our harmful emissions&quot; metaphorically, like how we chased smog outta the cities to some extent.</p>

<p>Of course money is a <em>really</em> complex system, and most of the heavy thinking on it is done by people who hope to selfishly horde vast sums for themselves mostly, and far less by those who see it as a means to an end, where that end is a functioning, free, ,and just society, so i don&#39;t have much optimism for real progress.  But UBI is a good first step i think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we just need one country to start it and show everyone that it works and is better for everyone.  but that is a huge ask.  a small municipal or city that does this experiment for 10-15years, and then spread that to nearby cities.  i heard they did this experiment in the a nordic city, but i heard nothing from it yet.  People want this but, just like voting, feel helpless and beaten down by the system.  usa is not the beacon that it used to be because fear and greed are controlling their actions.  and china or russia or europe or anyother nation is not in a place to step forward.  sure china seems like the obvious choice, but few people like chinese policies and living in china sucks.  so i bet you that if people hear about a small country trying to do right for its people, knowing that the future will have more people with less jobs, people will respond and flock there.  because this banking, cia, globalist agenda bs is hurting so many people.  </p>

<p>call me crazy, but i want to live in a world where money does not matter and goodwill and good deeds are what you are judged upon.  where if you have lots of money and nice things, you are an outcast.  where you look over your shoulder to see not how much they have, but to see if they have enough.  and all you have to do to achieve personal and social success is improving ones&#39; self.  what did bernie campaign on again? the top one tenth of the one percent control over half the resources around the world.  ofv they dont want change lol</p>
