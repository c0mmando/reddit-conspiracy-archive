Several young girls go missing in Belgium in the 90&#39;s. Witnesses testify seeing a white van. Investigation leads to an unemployed electrician with criminal history named Marc Dutroux. He was previously let out of prison for sex crimes despite his mother&#39;s insistence that he was very likely to offend again. Despite collecting welfare, he owns several houses. Police set up camera outside his residence, but for some reason they only record from 8:00AM to 6:00 PM. A police officer inspects one of his homes, accompanied by a locksmith. The locksmith says he hears girls yelling, but the officer insists the sounds are coming from outside. Officer does not investigate thoroughly enough to reveal door to basement dungeon behind some boxes. Finds video tapes as evidence, but police never watch the tapes because they apparently didn&#39;t have a VCR. The tapes show Dutroux constructing the dungeon in his basement. The 2 girls inside died.
Public outrage over police &quot;incompetence&quot; ensues, hundreds of thousands of protestors. When progress on investigation was made, the judge in charge was dismissed and replaced by someone who hindered the case by focusing on dead end leads. Several prominent people involved in the investigation died under suspicious circumstances.
Marc Dutroux was eventually convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He testified that he kidnapped girls to supply a larger organized pedophile network that serviced politicians, influential businessmen, police, and judges in Belgium&#39;s court system. He also claimed that he had a partner who helped source girls from eastern Europe. These claims were never investigated and as far as the authorities were concerned, the case of the missing girls ended with him.
Those are the facts. The conspiracy theory is that the authorities actively sabotaged the investigation to cover up evidence of an elite pedophile network that still operates today.</p>

<p>Sounds kinda Pizzagatey if you ask me.... This shit is happening all over the god damn world and it&#39;s falling upon deaf ears. Happened in the UK (and still is), happened here in the US (and still is), happened big time in Australia recently. Makes me sick. I hope all the elite scum doing this shit go down in flames soon. </p>

<p>Same MO, same people, same shit</p>

<p>Dutroux affair is one of the reasons I personally strongly believe in PG.  Step 1 is believing that the &quot;elites&quot; do this shit, which is usually the hardest step.  This is one of the many examples of them doing this shit.</p>
