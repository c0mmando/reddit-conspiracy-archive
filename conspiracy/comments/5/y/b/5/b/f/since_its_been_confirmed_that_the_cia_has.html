    <div class="md"><p>Valid Question. Wikileaks is CIA, this leak feels like Wag the Dog thing, a distraction from something else perhaps more disturbing. The entire independent journalism, media is focused on this now, but what are we ignoring in Syria, in Washington, in Korea??? something else is going on here.</p>

<p>When it comes to Trump, the number of the Tribe Jews surrounding him makes me wonder, did they surround him knowing long he was a tribe chosen Presidential candidate? Trump may not be cozy with the deep state cronies but he is being pampeted by Tribe cronies. And the Tribe cronies are in Power now. Of course, they have dirt on Trump, tons of It. He was a regular on Epsteins plane but the factions of the Elite are not going to start a &#39;dirt&#39; throwing war. Causr only we win if they expose their kind in a war of leaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nixon at least resigned to save the country from looking bad from the ordeal of an impeachment and to not further degrade the office of the Presidency and the country&#39;s faith in it.  Clinton dragged the office into the gutter. Dubya should&#39;ve worn a cowboy hat to complete the Alfred E. Neuman picture.  The primaries and  this election were <em>ALREADY</em> enough of a major embarrassment for the country.  And now if it &quot;officially&quot; comes out that the President was in cahoots with the Russians something truly significant and embarrassing would have to be done to make the United States not look like it has COMPLETELY come undone (even if it has under the surface). This would involve impeaching Trump, putting a number of others on very public trials,  making Pence the President, or having a new election, and/or having to somehow punish the Russians - none of which are attractive prospects for the elite who run the country and want nothing more than to keep the status quo.  So they will do everything they can to keep a lid on this thing as long as the dumber half of the country continues to buy the cover story and PR spin.  </p>

<p>Only if the CIA actually opposed Trump. What makes you think he isn&#39;t &quot;tied in with the rest&quot;? Because he says so? Because the media couldn&#39;t possibly be using &quot;reverse psychology&quot; to make a billionaire  member of the elites look like an &quot;outsider&quot;?</p>
