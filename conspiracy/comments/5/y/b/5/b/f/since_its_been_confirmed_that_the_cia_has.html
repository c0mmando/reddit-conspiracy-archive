       They may be saving it for 2020. Releasing a a bit here and there in the next four years to damage the president's image, then during the next election drop huge leaks that are critically damaging towards his re-election effort.

       This is what I believe too. Any dirt they have on Trump or those he surrounds himself with would likely be traceable to them as well. There's a reason politicians don't ever come out and state the real malicious shit the others do, they are in on it as well.

       Valid Question. Wikileaks is CIA, this leak feels like Wag the Dog thing, a distraction from something else perhaps more disturbing. The entire independent journalism, media is focused on this now, but what are we ignoring in Syria, in Washington, in Korea??? something else is going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to Trump, the number of the Tribe Jews surrounding him makes me wonder, did they surround him knowing long he was a tribe chosen Presidential candidate? Trump may not be cozy with the deep state cronies but he is being pampeted by Tribe cronies. And the Tribe cronies are in Power now. Of course, they have dirt on Trump, tons of It. He was a regular on Epsteins plane but the factions of the Elite are not going to start a 'dirt' throwing war. Causr only we win if they expose their kind in a war of leaks.

       Nixon at least resigned to save the country from looking bad from the ordeal of an impeachment and to not further degrade the office of the Presidency and the country's faith in it.  Clinton dragged the office into the gutter. Dubya should've worn a cowboy hat to complete the Alfred E. Neuman picture.  The primaries and  this election were
       <em>
        ALREADY
       </em>
       enough of a major embarrassment for the country.  And now if it "officially" comes out that the President was in cahoots with the Russians something truly significant and embarrassing would have to be done to make the United States not look like it has COMPLETELY come undone (even if it has under the surface). This would involve impeaching Trump, putting a number of others on very public trials,  making Pence the President, or having a new election, and/or having to somehow punish the Russians - none of which are attractive prospects for the elite who run the country and want nothing more than to keep the status quo.  So they will do everything they can to keep a lid on this thing as long as the dumber half of the country continues to buy the cover story and PR spin.
