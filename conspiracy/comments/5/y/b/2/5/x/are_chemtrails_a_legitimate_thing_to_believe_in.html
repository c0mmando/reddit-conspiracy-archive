    <div class="md"><p>Clouds are just condensation. A contrail is just condensation left from the jet engine. If they linger for more then a couple minutes you have essentially made a cloud. If it looks like a cloud then it is a type of cloud and that is weather manipulation if created by us.</p>

<p>The newer styles of jet engines leave much longer lasting contrails (several hours ) which is one of the main points some people use to debunk chemtrails.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/chemtrails-geoengineering1.jpg">http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/chemtrails-geoengineering1.jpg</a></p>

<p>just grabbed a random picture showing showing a large amount of criss crossing contrails which could also possible be chemtrails. Lets just say they are all contrails left by regular planes. You can still see they start to create a cloud cover which is a type of weather geo-engineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re confused on what cloud seeding is. You SEED an already formed cloud with particles and the particles collect the water into droplets which forces it to rain.</p>

<p>Jet engines naturally do create clouds though. A small cloud is about a million pounds of water. A 707 airliner carries ~167,000 pounds of jet fuel (kerosene) when jet fuel is burned with oxygen it forms CO2 and water. Combustion of 167,000 pounds of  kerosene creates ~207,000 pounds of water or ~1/5th of a cloud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Commercial flights are not the ones spraying the stuff. </p>

<p>I dont know who is doing it, or why, but my guess is its either they are fighting global warming, or they are hiding something, always seems to be be between sunrise and sunset that it happens, on certain days of the week. But mostly random, it seems.</p>

<p>Contrails disappear after a few minutes, no matter how high altitude you go. Watch the next time you see them flying in &quot;x&#39;s, criss crosses&quot; the lines drift apart and form a cloud layer of something.</p>

<p>Like ink in water. A drop of the stuff will cover a pretty good swathe. At that altitude (also it can probably be seen for thousands of miles) , they only would need a handful of crews(mostly military most likely), being told they are doing it &quot;to save the human race&quot;, yeah they will keep their mouth&#39;s shut. </p>

<p>They definitely exist, anyone who goes outside and looks up instead of down into their phone 24/7 and actually pays attention can see them doing something. But yet people can seriously think that chemtrails are a symptom of paranoid delusional schizophrenia, you see that shit all day in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, totally fucked.</p>

<p>We truly live in the age of deception. And most people are to fucking blind to see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just google &quot;scientist&#39;s propose to fight global warming by creating clouds&quot;.</p>

<p>The main problem with what they are doing is they have to be using some kind of solution to form the clouds, but they are keeping it secret, most likely if people knew what was being sprayed above them, they would freak out.</p>

<p>A very small percentage of people probably do legitimately have health issues from what they are doing, but not enough to warrant them to stop, you know for fear of the human race&#39;s extinction lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea, read from the CIA&#39;s description of the technology (linked elsewhere in the thread), is to spray particles or chemicals into the atmosphere which would do the opposite of Co2 and Freons, it would reflect sunlight from earth&#39;s atmosphere instead of trapping it like greenhouse gasses. Ideally acting as a counter to global warming. Its unlikely that such a program is in the works, but it actually sounds like a pretty good solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might be mildly jealous at the thought you live somewhere that has a sky that isn&#39;t covered in X&#39;s daily causing it to change from lovely blue to sickly grey. Seeing the planes do their thing on what seems to be a daily schedule makes it difficult to disbelieve in them.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://sitsshow.blogspot.com/2016/04/nasa-confesses-to-dosing-americans-with-air-borne-lithium-other-chemicals.html">article</a> is a good starting point, as it&#39;s NASA admitting Lithium is one of the ingredients being sprayed, but it&#39;s totally &quot;harmless to the environment,&quot; so no biggie. There are several links within the article to supporting documentation as well as the NASA statement on video.</p>

<p>Nutshell is there&#39;s a variety of <del>toxic</del> harmless concoctions being sprayed globally, under the guise of geoengineering/weather modification, so we should ignore the patterns in the sky. We should also ignore that a lot of people have physical reactions that mimic everything from allergies to flu-like symptoms to significant respiratory distress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reposting a comment I made in another thread about chemtrails</p>

<p>The Morisy FOIA of Dugway removed any sort of doubt I had about chemtrails. If you go into these documents and search for aerosol or spray, you&#39;ll find that they have at the very least tested the tech. There&#39;s even some About VX spray.</p>

<p>1961 and 1962 are out there as well if you look, I don&#39;t want to link direct downloads, I don&#39;t have the archive links.</p>

<p>Worth noting that it&#39;s not 100 percent chemtrails, but it has gems like this:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer is no. Long answer is lol no. </p>

<p>Seeding clouds for rain fall vs. a massive global chemical conspiracy are not equal. It would literally take thousands of people who stupidly don&#39;t ever ask any questions, or all of them are fully in agreement to also poison themselves and their families, extended family, friends, etc. </p>

<p>Also, the zero evidence thing. Patterns in the sky near airports are not evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the CIA did used to dust French villages with LSD and fluoride and shit in MK Ultra.</p>

<p>And weather manipulation has been around since nam. So maybe. I kinda think they might spray complacency chemicals and things like that but the bottom line is the white lines you see are more than likely just ice crystal shit, and the real chemicals are invisible and fall to the earth as rain. But nothing that can&#39;t be reversed with other drugs. I think the elites know this and have these drugs.</p>

<p>And on a personal note they say that fluoride closes your third eye, I can tell you for a fact. Magic mushrooms. Psilocybin. Open that third eye right the fuck up.</p>
