<p>If it was any other politician, I&#39;d expect him to drop the usual pile of perfumed turd.</p>

<p>As much his silence may be indicative of his complicity, it may be indicative that his handlers told him not to field the question, because his own reaction would be to trash talk to no end the intelligence community. I mean, look at what he did with Arnold, and Arnold isn&#39;t any sort of threat to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The leaks come from various sources; I&#39;d be surprised if people did think it was the same sources (other than those beating &quot;the Russians did it&quot; drums). </p>

<p>If Trump truly intends to dismantle the CIA, or even clean it up, he&#39;s not going to announce his plans publicly, and definitely not to the WaPo. His hands are full enough as it is with the internal nonsense; even he&#39;s smart enough to not rile them up more than they already are. </p>

<p>Remember, this is one percent of V7, so the releases are presumably just getting started. Time will tell how this all plays out, including how TD&#39;s numerous members respond.</p>

<p>As an aside, the WaPo missed the boat by not having Pedosta write this up. </p>

I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re over there being angels by any stretch of the imagination but this probably is causing actual damage. And this was purportedly only 1% of what they&#39;re sitting on. Julian will eventually dump it all too. I don&#39;t think this will bring us down. We&#39;ll still be the world power we are today.

<p>The fact that voat&#39;s pizzagate community is upset with <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> is silly.</p>

<p>The mods at <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> are here to preserve Conspiracy to the best of our ability.  Part of that means we have to comply with reddit&#39;s TOS to the best of our ability.  So of pizzagate researchers want to be mad at us for removing a multitude of posts which contain crazy amounts of doxxing then they will just have to be mad.  If we continually allow doxx here then the admins step in and install new mods or simply ban the whole subreddit.  If that happens then we have failed to preserve Conspiracy on Reddit.</p>

<p>As far as our subreddit specific rules, rule 10 violations are typically people calling others shills or other direct insults.  Just because you&#39;re upset about pizzagate revelations doesn&#39;t give you a license to break our rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it sounded more like he was going to go after the Obama admin gov&#39;t officials who leaked the information to Wikileaks. Not directly go after Wikileaks. Not sure what they could charge a Journalistic organization operating outside the US with in terms of US law. Otherwise we would have never gotten passed the Snowden era. I believe revelations revealed human rights would have precident. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve already said it was contractors. Wake up dude, they hate Wikileaks for doing this. This is not ambiguous this is cognitive dissonance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub takes a lot of abuse and you can&#39;t really hold it against <a href="/u/creq">/u/creq</a> for having an opinion.  I find it weird that Voat Pgate has an opinion about him or us but if their main beef is that <a href="/u/creq">/u/creq</a> doesn&#39;t like the worldcorpo links spammed here, I am in agreement with him.  Those were being posted constantly with syntax sounding as if it was definiitively Jpodesta.  Some people feel sure it is him, and I lean towards it not being jpodesta.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t care about the happenings of t-d, as they seem out of control.  All their mods are recently hired so not even one oldtimer is there managing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The person who leaked the CIA docs was likely not the same entity that gave Wikileaks the DNC stuff. What I&#39;m pointing to here is what seems to me like an obvious division about Trump&#39;s apparent stance here and how the users of T_D feel. Trump has been very quiet so far. And I know why. Guess it isn&#39;t proof but I think speculation is allowed here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is one aspect about Trump that everyone will eventually learn in that he&#39;s not going to talk about what he&#39;s going to do in detail nor what he&#39;s doing currently. He&#39;s going to tell he he&#39;s going to do it and then he&#39;s going to announce it when it&#39;s done. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like that dad that can never quite bear to tell his kids where he&#39;s taking them, it&#39;s always has to be a fucking &#39;surprise&#39;, even if it&#39;s the Sizzler.</p>

<p>But isn&#39;t the Presidents silence on what is one of the most damaging leaks in US history more than just a little bizarre. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it was any other politician, I&#39;d expect him to drop the usual pile of perfumed turd.</p>

<p>As much his silence may be indicative of his complicity, it may be indicative that his handlers told him not to field the question, because his own reaction would be to trash talk to no end the intelligence community. I mean, look at what he did with Arnold, and Arnold isn&#39;t any sort of threat to him.</p>
