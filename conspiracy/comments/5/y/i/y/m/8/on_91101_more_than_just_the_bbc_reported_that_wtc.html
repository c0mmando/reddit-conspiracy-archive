    <div class="md"><p>Nope. That&#39;s not what I mean. </p>

<p>9-11 exposure will happen this year or next year max. You have to be careful with these things. It can trigger a world war. If you are a regular here, you will see that most of this sub knows about 9-11 being an inside job. You need to research it. There are tons of circumstantial and some pretty damning evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true.  I believe it&#39;s far more convenient and reassuring for people to assume there&#39;s no way our own government would allow 9/11, or many other conspiracy theories for that matter.  I remember Richard Dawkins saying something like &quot;Just because something makes you better, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true.&quot;  Yet we are conditioned as children to believe in things without evidence that make us feel better.  Plus, TPTB peddle MSM fake news in a way that panders to our adult egos, keeping us informed in bite-sized snippets, pundits acting like we are critically thinking equals to them, knowing we&#39;re too lazy to scratch beneath the surface and too naive/stupid to to even comprehend it if we did.  And besides, someone would have spoken up by now, right?!  I don&#39;t mean to be pessimistic, just redpilling is kind of a bummer...</p>

<p>How many seconds? Part of the roof visibly collapsed something like 10 seconds or more before the rest of the structure did. This is almost never shown in videos, and never shown in videos attempting to prove a conspiracy.</p>

<p>The oral histories of Frank Fellini, Anthony Mancuso, William Melarango, David Moriarty, Patrick Murray, Anthony Salerno all specifically indicate the collapse warning came 4 or more hours before it happened</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Falling debris also caused major structural damage to the building, which soon began burning on multiple floors, said Francis X. Gribbon, a spokesman for the Fire Department. By 11:30 a.m., the fire commander in charge of that area, Assistant Chief Frank Fellini, ordered firefighters away from it for safety reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chief of Department Peter Hayden consulted with an engineer:</p>

<p>We posed to him the question that considering the structural
damage that was obvious to the – to the building on the southwest
corner, and the amount of fire damage that was occurring within
the building, could we anticipate a collapse and if so, when.  He
said yes and he gave an approximate time of five to six hours,
which was pretty much right on the money because the building
collapsed about 5 o’clock that afternoon.</p>

<p>Another similar quote by Chief Peter Hayden on the BBC Conspiracy Files program:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We were concerned of the possibility of collapse of the building. And we had a discussion with one particular engineer there, and we asked him, &#39;if we allowed it to burn could we anticipate a collapse, and if so, how soon?&#39; And it turned out that he was pretty much right on the money, that he said, ‘In its current state, you have about five hours.’&quot; </p>

<p>Firefighter Michael Currid:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Someone from the Office of Emergency Management told us that this building was in serious danger of collapse. The consensus was that it was basically a lost cause and we should no lose anyone else trying to save it. Rich, a few other people and I went inside to the stairwells and started yelling up &quot;Drop everything and get out!&quot; It didn&#39;t collapse until much later in the afternoon, but we felt it was better to get everybody out.&quot;</p>

<p>It turns out that the respected news agency Reuters picked up an incorrect report and passed it on. They have issued this statement:</p>

<p>&quot;On 11 September 2001 Reuters incorrectly reported that one of the buildings at the New York World Trade Center, 7WTC, had collapsed before it actually did. The report was picked up from a local news story and was withdrawn as soon as it emerged that the building had not fallen.&quot;</p>

<p>Sure, the BBC and other large organizations lose stuff frequently, even important stuff.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t even understand who at the BBC would have motive to hide anything. </p>

<p>Like just imagine the conversation -</p>

<p>CIA or whatever - &quot;we&#39;re gonna take out building 7&quot;</p>

<p>media - &quot;ok why are you telling me this&quot;</p>

<p>CIA - &quot;so you can say it on tv&quot;</p>

<p>media - &quot;aren&#39;t we going to know when it happens anyway&quot;</p>

<p>What are the chances, that random news anchors of not only several, but including foreign news outlets are informed beforehand?<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>This just doesn&#39;t make sense. Why would they give anyone foreknowledge and use that for reporting? It&#39;s absolutely ludicrous. They don&#39;t need to plan it ahead of time. Have the building collapse and people WILL report on it. To prep them ahead of time would be absurd. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how you think a government can secretly plan and execute the largest terrorist attack in history, but make such a stupid mistake as having it reported before it happens. </p>
