        <h3 class="title">CIA Leaks, Now What?</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">10</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-03-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/klemonstrate.html">klemonstrate</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With yesterday’s CIA leaks many more Americans are now aware of the CIA’s dramatic overstepping of their charter and their deliberate intent to put the American people in a deleterious position.  This begs the question, now what?  It is now crucial that we all work together to accomplish the mission JFK set out to achieve over five decades ago.  We must forge ahead and utilize this information to affect real change.  We cannot let this go stale and Wikileaks cannot do this themselves.</p>

<p>Step 1:  Curate</p>

<p>The synthesis of information and the creation of “cliffs notes” to awaken the general public is crucial.  Despite providing the ultimate public service, reading through the Wikileaks source material is like reading a VCR manual in Japanese.  In order to achieve the maximum impact, we need to create shorter and more easily digestible content, along with graphics and memes to best convey the importance of this information.  Think, what would cause my grandmother to get pissed off about this?</p>

<p>Step 2: Outreach</p>

<p>Contact your elected officials!  This is a much more effective strategy than you would think.  Every American has two Senators and a House Rep. whose duty is to represent your interests.  Let them know that you will NOT be donating to them, nor voting to reelect them should they fail to fight on the side of the American public on this issue.  Tell them (and their staff) that you will personally campaign against them should they no do what’s right.  Also, don’t forget about your Governor, State Reps. and local government.  Local officials are the core of our republic and should also be forced to take a stand here.  </p>

<p>Step 3: Take Control</p>

<p>Own your personal actions and direct them toward a solution.  Ask your representatives to advocate for plenary sessions for every member of the CIA.  Those who are honest and cooperative are treated lightly.  Those who do not / are the major transgressors are charged with treason.  This is simple.  We can then begin to dismantle the agency with the help of our representatives and most likely the military.  Protest if need be, spread the word, be creative.  There is no single playbook for being heard.</p>

<p>Step 4: Corporate involvement  </p>

<p>A boycott of those aiding and abetting this systematic abuse is the logical first move.  A massive sell off of complicit company stocks (even the threat will move the market - remember pricing is all about consumer psychology) will send the correct message.  If you’re holding stock, dump it.  If you’re in a mutual fund, pension fund, etc. contact the fund manager / administrator and communicate that you will not tolerate anti-American activities.  Let them know that you worry about US sanctions against companies involved in this type of behavior and you will be pulling out of the fund entirely if they do not adjust the portfolio.</p>

<p>Also, please remember that what facilitates this control network is still blackmail.  The behaviors of our politicians, business executives, and community leaders, including human trafficking, child abuse, and crimes against humanity, all contribute to this matrix of deceit and the perpetuation of these horrors.  We must now purge our government of the people and apparatuses that allow for the continuation of these transgressions.  Therefore, link this collection to PedoGate, do NOT forget about it!</p>

<p>Finally, once they emerge, link these stories to actual abuses and death.  This is the way to activate the masses.  We all learn and digest information through narrative, and by sharing actual stories of people being impacted we will control the momentum.  You can already see this with the Michael Hastings story.</p>

<p>Best of luck and continue the great work.  You all have a role to play in the dissolution of the deep state and we are still just casting for parts.  Figure out your part and play it well!</p>

<ol>
<li>File for an extension and keep filling for it on your taxes as long as you possibly can (no money == government starves - peaceful legal protest)</li>
<li>Stop using USD</li>
<li>Grow your own food (start a micro garden - counter aquaponics has come a long way)</li>
<li>Hunt your own meat (Put your big boy pants on Vegans and liberals). If you don&#39;t want to hunt, raise some chickens or rabbits</li>
<li>Fish (same as #4)</li>
<li>Shop local, only</li>
<li>Barter and start community coops</li>
<li>Take time off</li>
<li>Take the streets</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Understand WTF you are talking about</li>
<li>Buy land, ~1 acre will do (Fact: if petitioning for bail (you get arrested), land owners are actually considered more legit - fun fact they don&#39;t teach you in school)</li>
<li>Get your medicinal card (if not in a legal State) grow your own herb ;)</li>
<li>Home brew/distill your own drinks. Cider is my favorite :)</li>

<p>Your holier-than-thou ideologies are great for somebody who took their money and ran away from contributing to society in any meaningful way, but somebody actually have a sense of accountability so maybe it doesn&#39;t work for them?

<p>You can debunk concave Earth yourself through the Eratosthenes experiment.  The results would be opposite if the Earth were concave.</p>

<p>Read the thread and read the book linked.  Your messaging is exactly the same as communist propaganda from the 1950s, you can&#39;t deny it because it&#39;s fact.  At the moment you can deny it through ignorance of the topic and hand, but that doesn&#39;t make it any less true.</p>

<p>Conduct the experiments yourself and post the results.  They are readily available everywhere if you are too lazy to do so yourself.  We both know you aren&#39;t going to do it and will continue to get your scientific knowledge from Youtube videos while simultaneously spreading lies though.</p>

<p>Here is evidence regarding seismic waves and how they help us understand the composition of the Earth:</p>

<p>The fact that you are ignorant regarding the communist propaganda you are spreading is your own fault, not mine, but keep burying your head in the sand.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I predicted that you would abandon the conversation once you could no longer continue making false arguments, and you did.</p>

<p>Demonstrating that the Moon isn&#39;t a flat disc because we readily observe Lunar libration is irrelevant and subjective?  Seriously?  You should really try and keep track of the nonsense you spread so at least you can keep your arguments coherent.</p>
