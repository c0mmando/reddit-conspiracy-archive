       You got to practically every news related sub, MEANT TO BE NEUTRAL, and everyone is "no real info" or "this doesn't change anything" or just talking about Russia. I recently have been discovering loads and loads of information from fucking Twitter accounts posting 4chan shit and realized, "oh shit I should probably go there too" and ITS FILLED TOO. WTF CIA CALM YOUR TITS AND STOP FUCKING SHILLING ON EVERY GODDAMN SITE! It's not like they're even trying because really, how many people calmly disagree on /pol/? No one does so these cheesy peanut head looking ass CIA shills stick out like sore thumbs and everyone knows it.

       P.S. Anyway that I can easily keep up with this shit because I don't have time to go to eighteen different sites and forums to understand a new small piece of info

       Not exactly, it's more like people need to feel like part of a community, and will adopt the mindset of the community that they seek to be a part of. It's a process: A community will start with a few individuals that have one thing in common, such as a few snowboarders or a couple of metal fans. As the community grows, individuals within the group tend to form consensuses (is that even a word? It is now) around other things, such as clothing choice. "Ingroup" stuff starts taking effect as well, such as in-jokes and phrases recognizable only to the group. Over time, you end up with a large community with similar dress, similar speaking style and phrases, and sometimes even similar posture and body language.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all this stems from the simple fact that people want to impress their friends.

       These shills remind me of the time I saw a muscled crewcut dude in a pristine Phish t-shirt and brand new Birkenstocks asking people at a huge festival if they "Have any L...S...D for sale?" Best part was fake hippy had his doggy with him... a German Shepard sat at perfect attention amidst all the chaos of the partying and music.

       Are you assuming that I think he was an undercover cop? Cause I never explicitly stated that in my post... Life is full of assumptions, evaluations, and gut instinct... But yeah... he was obviously an undercover cop. Duh... I know hippies... I know hippy dogs... this guy wasn't a hippy and his dog was certainly a well trained K9 unit.

       Or he was a tech bro, off his normal 60 hour start up week and eager to do some acid, so he put on a brand-new hippy outfit and went at it.
