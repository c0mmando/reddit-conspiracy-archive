    <div class="md"><p>Good point, but at the same time -- from a fundamental standpoint, security really boils down to two things (generally/universally): detection and prevention.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s a two-way street; you cannot obtain a higher level of security without discovering a possible exploit or vulnerability. Security exists not only to prevent or protect, but also to respond and adapt to new threats. </p>

<p>Why would anyone buy a safe if somebody at some point in time could just crack it if they really wanted to?</p>

<p>Perhaps this was leaked to prepare people to question the &quot;American Spring&quot; folks are theorizing.

<blockquote>
<p>The idea behind Year Zero is that all culture and traditions within a society must be completely destroyed or discarded and a new revolutionary culture must replace it, starting from scratch.

    <div class="md"><p>This brings to mind the incident that was reported to have taken place between an unarmed Russian Air force SU35 with some sort of basket affair on it&#39;s nose and the USS Donald Cook in the Black Sea in 2014 when the Russian jet remotely jammed and completely shut down every electronic system on the ship leaving it dead and completely helpless in the water. The plane then proceeded to take about a dozen practice bombing runs at it as a little show of force before flying off. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t want to take any bets on whether that has anything to do with the loss of the CIA&#39;s extensive hacking tools that are primarily designed to exploit any American electronic devices in just about every way that&#39;s possible to do. If it did it must have been immensely satisfying to have had none other than the CIA to provide them with that capability and make sure they have no such vulnerabilities of their own. Putin has already confirmed that Russia&#39;s military is developing it&#39;s own stand alone and proprietary internet that needs even less of an explanation if that is true.</p>
