       Oh man here we go. Okay so for the past year or so I've been doing my own independent research in my spare time into all of these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off here is Tom Delonge's message to the American people after winning the UFO researcher of the year award. As usual per Tom he is very cryptic in what he says, but the message here is pretty clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/kxPx-BVN4yc?t=304">
        https://youtu.be/kxPx-BVN4yc?t=304
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have Vault 7 being dropped by Wikileaks exposing a taste of just how fucked up the CIA is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also we have this shit going on in Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here is my theory on what is about to happen in the next 2 months. I am predicting that they are going to give us a small piece of disclosure to completely wipe our attention away from the truth of what is really happening. Pizzagate is real and I feel it's only a matter of months until the shit hits the fan and lots of public figures go down in flames. In order to avoid that and keep the public busy with other things, they'll give us a piece of what's going on in Antarctica. (And i think that they may use HAARP to melt the ice and disclose what's happening there).
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw UFO's in 2004 and it changed my entire worldview. I never uttered the word UFO until i witnessed what I saw that night. The evidence is everywhere but I'm not even gonna start with all of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just for the record, against all odds, I was right in every prediction so far. 
I was correct last year when I said that Trump would win the primary. Everyone laughed at me.
 I was right when I said he would beat Hillary. Everyone called me a fool. 
I was right when I said something was wrong with Hillary and she was sick. She fainted days after I made the hypothesis.
 I was right about the MSM straight up lying to everyone face, gaslighting the polls, pushing agendas, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       My claims are simply my claims and educated guess' at this point, but it is an idea that I think everyone should pay attention to. Just be on the lookout these next few months going into summer. I'm very confident something will go down very soon. And I think it will be a false flag in order to save face.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get my research from many places including David Seaman, Jordan Sather, Ben Swaan back in the day, reddit, wikileaks.org, and a myriad of other resources. Pay attention, do the homework, and get informed.

       So much information to answer this properly but I'll keep it short and sweet. Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon, has been going over there and a while back he tweeted a picture of a pyramid in Antarctica. The ice is melting so shit is being uncovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lZ8_J0BZLU">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lZ8_J0BZLU
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the link to it on google earth. You can see for yourself. But Buzz Aldrin tweeted a photograph he took of it and said "We are all in danger. It is evil itself." Fucking weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part two. Scientists, engineers, and seismograph geologists have reported an insane amount of electromagnetic activity underground in the past few months. I don't have time to link the readings and graphs but the numbers are insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       3rd. Operation High Jump. Look it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I'm not gonna write about the whole theory about the Nazi's in Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all simply conspiracy theory (accept for high jump, that is as real as can be). But it is my prediction that it wall all come to fruition very soon.

       Except that supposed tweet from Buzz was complete bullshit and proven to be a fake. There only thing going on in Antarctica is related to climate change, that is why Kerry went there. There are no aliens. Sorry to burst your bubble pal.

       myriad (n.)
      </p>
      <p>
       1550s, from Middle French myriade and directly from Late Latin myrias (genitive myriadis) "ten thousand,"
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        from Greek myrias (genitive myriados) "a number of ten thousand, countless numbers,"
       </strong>
       from myrios (plural myrioi) "innumerable, countless, infinite; boundless," as a definite number, "ten thousand" ("the greatest number in Greek expressed by one word,"  Liddell &amp; Scott say)
      </p>
      <p>
       of unknown origin; perhaps from PIE *meue- "abundant" (source also of Hittite muri- "cluster of grapes," Latin muto "penis," Middle Irish moth "penis"). Specific use is usually in translations from Greek or Latin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way is appropriate and correct, "a myriad" =&gt; a "countless number" OR "myriad" =&gt; "ten thousand"

       the presidential candidates were 50/50 sooo, official statement is that Hilary is fine and she's still alive now so how did you confirm that she is sick? the other things also very general.

       That's an interesting theory. So about those "admin aliens". Are they visiting us "officially" or are they some kind of "rebels" who want to free us (similar to PETA fighting for animals)? Any more resources for that theory?

       I honestly don't know. And I don't have any specific resources, although you might get something out of Tom Campbell or Robert Monroe's work, since it deals with the basic nature of our reality.

       I can't remember where I read this but I'm glad others are putting all the information together like I am but I believe Tom said somewhere that Pizza Gate and UFO's are directly linked and one stops the other from coming out and my guess is that Podesta has his foot in both. The way Tom talked about secrecy in the government that spans different departments makes me wonder if information is suppressed due to people being blackmailed with Pizzagate info to not release UFO info. I'm not sure but it sure is an exciting time to be on this subreddit.

       When he says the whole thing is about changing the youths opinion on the topic I think he means that the older generation for the most part are decided on the topic so he is not bothering trying to convince them whilst the youth will listen to him because of his status as a musician. Podesta and advisors give Tom the information anonymously then he disperses it amongst a medium that his target audience will enjoy (ie a book series) and trusts their ability to read what information has been given to him from higher up and what is just there to flesh a plot out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get the beef with Tom right now, I'm pretty excited to see what book 2 has to offer and in his C2C interview he said that the content that is being released atm is just to establish his company as a franchise and brand to the masses. He has tried big endeavours like this before (see the LOVE movie) and has failed to capture the general publics attention so I get him playing the long game with this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get we have had our fouche's and our Greer's that have seemed hopeful at the beginning and then over time it has become apparent they have ran out of information or are being fed misinformation but eventually something's gotta come of years and years of hearsay? I mean the first book basically confirms black triangles, the Roswell crash and human-alien politics which is highly exiting to me so I'm all ears if he claims he can back this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please let me know if I'm missing something here just confused to see that every Delonge post is riddled with "STUPID POP STAR BEING DRAGGED DOWN A  RABBIT HOLE OF FAKE INFORMATION " comments.

       I 100% agree with on all aspects here. As someone who has been researching the phenomenon for 10+ years, as a witness, and also as someone who just happens to be an extreme blink fan since 1998, I'm with you here. Yes, this phenomenon is riddled with hoax, people out for fame, people out for money, misinformation, etc. But the thing with Tom is he has alays been fascinated in the phenomenon. He has organic interest in it. Secondly, he's already worth over 60 million, why the fuck would he be in this to scheme money. And lastly, I see it everywhere on the blink subreddit, on the UFO, subreddit, and now here.... "Tom is so full of shit, Tom is being fed misinformation, Tom is playing everyone, etc." The video I linked in my description really ties it all together I think. He acknowledged, "I'm just like you guys, I've been on the topic for 20 years, I read all the same shit, etc." He also said, "The wikileaks showed there was creedence to my ambiguous claims." He IS working with ihg level officials, he IS working with Podesta, etc."So yeah, I'm on board with Tom till the end, not only as a super fan of his work, but as a fellow amateur UFOlogist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, don't even get me started on Black Triangles my man! That's my specialty! Those damned things, above all other UFO's are the weirdest, most unnerving, sinsiter, and downright creepy things in the field. I could write a fucking book on BT's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I have his book, Sekret Machines. I'm actually looking at it right now on my bookshelf. I haven't read it yet. Was it good? It bothers me that it's "fiction". I'm not in this shit to read a make believe story. But again, it's Toms, and it's about UFO's and the government so I will surely read it soon.
