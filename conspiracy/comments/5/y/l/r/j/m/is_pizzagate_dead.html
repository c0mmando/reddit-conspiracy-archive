       If you're so smart, please tell the class how long it takes to build a criminal case against a high profile target. You're implying that enough time has passed that if there was any wrong doing, the FBI would have made arrests by now?

       The relevance is, you should be very angry that there is a coordinated effort to try and protect the VERY powerful people who are implicated in this. The institutions that you trust and pay taxes to are smuggling, trafficking, and raping kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you should continue to spread awareness of this, so that we can unanimously agree to end it.

       You realize the only reason there is a voat sub is because Reddit banned our Pizzagate sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are WAY more people to reach over here, I say we keep sharing those developments here. It's still Conspiracy related. I'll even take the sources and re-word them into my own post instead of sharing voat posted threads.

       The only difference is that this ends with picture , and theirs starts with pictures. And ends in a looooott of information about how 'prominent' they are.   And , also, I would never call Milo prominent. But, to each his own.

       What amazes me is how FAST it happened.

      <p>
       You guys do realize this whole thing started with some emails...
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, yea, there had been accusations of pedophilia and sex crimes among the upper echelons of society for a long time from people like David Icke and Alex jones. Initially, I had always thought of that "element" of the new world order as some kind of disinformation, the data of stuff seemed too wacky for me. However, all it took was one concrete piece of evidence to start pulling at the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spirit cooking emails, Podesta's emails, the connection to alefantis, his Instagram material, the political donations from Soros and Clinton, the Laura silsby connection, the FBI pedophile logos/symbols, the Madelyn McCann element, the Podesta's  matching her kidnappers sketches, ect...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then ALL OF THIS SHIT ^ in relation to past scandals (that Pizzagate brought attention to) such as...
      </p>
      <p>
       (Conspiracy of silence) Franklin coverup, finders cult, Ted gunderson's accounts, jimmy Saville, Sandusky, Hollywood pedophilia, Dutrox case, Pentagon child porn scandal, White House call boy scandal 1990's.

       Pizzagate was always a nonstarter to me; the evidence which launched the... crusade... was some of the flimsiest I've ever seen presented in support of a conspiracy theory - yet look at the large, fanatical fanbase that arose around pizzagate. They latched onto anything and everything and they were encouraged to do so by a deluge of fake news sites that popped up and then vanished as their usefulness waned. Anyone and everyone who opposed Trump, called for investigations into Russian meddling, spoke out against Putin - they were all targeted by Pizzagate "articles" and then baseless accusations of some truly heinous crimes. John McCain? Pedoscum child-trafficker once he spoke out against Russia, apparently. Lindsey Graham? I don't like him, but I never would have suspected he was up to such shenanigans at his age! (I don't.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been a fake scandal kept alive by outside actors encouraging partisan dupes into making disgusting accusations based off absolutely nothing. Kept alive with a non-stop series of fake news articles about unconnected arrests of generic sex offenders, made-up garbage about politicians, and false assurances in the form of "leaks" to websites no one has ever heard of - purporting to be from the administration - promising that arrests will be coming any day now, to give it a bit of added legitimacy. It has been a witch hunt from start to finish and I am absolutely certain it never would have happened if there had been something truly damning in those emails. There wasn't, though, so something had to be invented.

       What amazes me is how FAST it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys do realize this whole thing started with some emails...
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, yea, there had been accusations of pedophilia and sex crimes among the upper echelons of society for a long time from people like David Icke and Alex jones. Initially, I had always thought of that "element" of the new world order as some kind of disinformation, the data of stuff seemed too wacky for me. However, all it took was one concrete piece of evidence to start pulling at the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spirit cooking emails, Podesta's emails, the connection to alefantis, his Instagram material, the political donations from Soros and Clinton, the Laura silsby connection, the FBI pedophile logos/symbols, the Madelyn McCann element, the Podesta's  matching her kidnappers sketches, ect...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then ALL OF THIS SHIT ^ in relation to past scandals (that Pizzagate brought attention to) such as...
      </p>
      <p>
       (Conspiracy of silence) Franklin coverup, finders cult, Ted gunderson's accounts, jimmy Saville, Sandusky, Hollywood pedophilia, Dutrox case, Pentagon child porn scandal, White House call boy scandal 1990's.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        You should start to see a picture forming in your head. Connect the dots, trust in your historical timeline. This is all real. The world's aristocracy and elite partake in sadistic sex crimes, and are spiritually dedicated to a dark force
