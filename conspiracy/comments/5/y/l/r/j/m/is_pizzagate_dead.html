    <div class="md"><p>What amazes me is how FAST it happened. </p>

<p>You guys do realize this whole thing started with some emails...</p>

<p>I mean, yea, there had been accusations of pedophilia and sex crimes among the upper echelons of society for a long time from people like David Icke and Alex jones. Initially, I had always thought of that &quot;element&quot; of the new world order as some kind of disinformation, the data of stuff seemed too wacky for me. However, all it took was one concrete piece of evidence to start pulling at the thread. </p>

<p>The spirit cooking emails, Podesta&#39;s emails, the connection to alefantis, his Instagram material, the political donations from Soros and Clinton, the Laura silsby connection, the FBI pedophile logos/symbols, the Madelyn McCann element, the Podesta&#39;s  matching her kidnappers sketches, ect...</p>

<p>Then ALL OF THIS SHIT ^ in relation to past scandals (that Pizzagate brought attention to) such as...</p>

<p>(Conspiracy of silence) Franklin coverup, finders cult, Ted gunderson&#39;s accounts, jimmy Saville, Sandusky, Hollywood pedophilia, Dutrox case, Pentagon child porn scandal, White House call boy scandal 1990&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate was always a nonstarter to me; the evidence which launched the... crusade... was some of the flimsiest I&#39;ve ever seen presented in support of a conspiracy theory - yet look at the large, fanatical fanbase that arose around pizzagate. They latched onto anything and everything and they were encouraged to do so by a deluge of fake news sites that popped up and then vanished as their usefulness waned. Anyone and everyone who opposed Trump, called for investigations into Russian meddling, spoke out against Putin - they were all targeted by Pizzagate &quot;articles&quot; and then baseless accusations of some truly heinous crimes. John McCain? Pedoscum child-trafficker once he spoke out against Russia, apparently. Lindsey Graham? I don&#39;t like him, but I never would have suspected he was up to such shenanigans at his age! (I don&#39;t.)</p>

<p>This has been a fake scandal kept alive by outside actors encouraging partisan dupes into making disgusting accusations based off absolutely nothing. Kept alive with a non-stop series of fake news articles about unconnected arrests of generic sex offenders, made-up garbage about politicians, and false assurances in the form of &quot;leaks&quot; to websites no one has ever heard of - purporting to be from the administration - promising that arrests will be coming any day now, to give it a bit of added legitimacy. It has been a witch hunt from start to finish and I am absolutely certain it never would have happened if there had been something truly damning in those emails. There wasn&#39;t, though, so something had to be invented.</p>

<p>You guys do realize this whole thing started with some emails...</p>

<p>I mean, yea, there had been accusations of pedophilia and sex crimes among the upper echelons of society for a long time from people like David Icke and Alex jones. Initially, I had always thought of that &quot;element&quot; of the new world order as some kind of disinformation, the data of stuff seemed too wacky for me. However, all it took was one concrete piece of evidence to start pulling at the thread. </p>

<p>The spirit cooking emails, Podesta&#39;s emails, the connection to alefantis, his Instagram material, the political donations from Soros and Clinton, the Laura silsby connection, the FBI pedophile logos/symbols, the Madelyn McCann element, the Podesta&#39;s  matching her kidnappers sketches, ect...</p>
