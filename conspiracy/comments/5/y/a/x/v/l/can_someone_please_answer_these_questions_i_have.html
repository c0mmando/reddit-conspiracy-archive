    <div class="md"><p>Okay, okay, Russia, with the help of sexist racist Donald Trump supporters, amirite?, planted thousands of undocumented Russian nesting voters in numerous critical states. They all showed up at the polls on election day. What appeared to be one typical undocumented HRC supporter in a vagina hat was actually SEVEN Russian nesting voters! They all popped out of each other when they got in the booth, and all seven of them voted for Donald Trump! And that&#39;s how Russia hacked the election for Donald Trump.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a weird roundabout way yes. It was her wrong doing and the leaks influencing that further. Then you have spirit cooking and pizzagate that sprung from all of that causing more investigation. Remember the FBI found nothing in the E-mail investigations after all, but it had a huge impact on her PR. Interesting thing was NOTHING came out about RNC or Rep candidates from wikileaks. It was a massive one sided smear campaign coming from &quot;grass roots&quot; means. It was a perfect storm of anti-establishment influence we still see with the current anti MSM campaign. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s as easy to believe the leak was internal, and the Clinton campaign latched onto a scapegoat to blame. I&#39;ve always believed the leak was a BernieBro. It was months until I first came across the name Seth Rich. Blaming a conspiracy is a classic Hillary move.</p>

<p>The conspiracy about Russia and the election is not about Russia hacking the election.</p>

<p>I will re-post a comment I made earlier:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I keep seeing this misconception pop up. No one is claiming that Russia hacked the election. The hacking allegation have to do with the DNC and RNC being hacked. The claims about the election itself and Russia have to do with Russia using what the Dutch call &quot;the Russian Troll Army&quot; to spread fake news about Hilary and create faux support for Trump on the internet.
However the main focus on the Russian connection has to do with Trump&#39;s employee&#39;s and some admin picks having backroom meeting with Russian officials and Russian business leaders during the campaign and then lying about it.</p>

So let&#39;s say the country prefers dogs to cats 55% to 45% overall and - for example - in Washington State they prefer dogs 65/35 and in Ohio 54/46. Now, leading up to the big dog vs. cat poll let&#39;s say China - the leading manufacturer of cats and cat-related paraphernalia - begins a massive cyberwarfare campaign in the form of propaganda centered and hacking pro-dog organizations, etc. in an effort to sway public opinion. So they launch their campaign, shill here and there, spam fake news everywhere, leak whatever they can find, distract whenever cats do something negative, etc. This results in a swaying of the national sentiment by a few percentage points, give or take a few percentage points. Washington may end up 63/37 while Ohio goes 48/52 - some demographics are more receptive to anti-dog rhetoric, some less. Swing states are swing states for a reason, for example. In some states the change may be considered negligible given the margins - if a state goes Dog every election by 20%, then it isn&#39;t likely to vote for what it considers to be a greasy, balding ginger - whatever Russia has to say about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can take that entire argument and flip it the other way. &quot;Swing states are swing states for a reason&quot;. What color were those swing states for the 08/12 presidential campaigns? The guy that carried those states campaigned pretty hard for Hillary in 16. Why didn&#39;t these emails clinch the popular vote? The emails were a shotgun release. </p>

<p>I never did get to see this coordinated fake news push from the right that everyone says happened. I read the emails that ODNI Chief Clapper said were not forgeries. Did you? Did you see the one on 4/27/16 where they crafted the Russia narrative?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about the Simes email, then saying they crafted the Russia narrative is a joke. An email about Trump being too friendly with Putin, which is a notion a great many people in his <em>own</em> party agree with?</p>

<p>As for the rest, they&#39;re called swing states for a reason; it isn&#39;t uncommon for them to switch party alignment. &quot;How did those emails seem to influence specific states?&quot; is a ridiculous question - it&#39;s like you&#39;re pretending seasons don&#39;t have any effect on weather because it rained in Texas but not snowed in New York. Why did Obama win those states? There wasn&#39;t a massive foreign propaganda campaign conducted against him. There hadn&#39;t been near 20 years of right-wing smear jobs conducted on him, either. There are a lot of reasons and more reasons different states reacted differently to different things. Whataboutisms wont change anything and even if you can somehow prove that Trump would have won without Russian interference (impossible to prove, given Russian interference) it still wouldn&#39;t absolve the Russians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t a joke. Look who the communication is with. They weren&#39;t joking when they flipped on Bernie and tried to turn Dem minorities on him</p>

<p>Where was the fake news? </p>

<p>I still haven&#39;t seen one shred of evidence of the massive foreign interference. I have seen a deliberate effort of democrat media complex to bury the emails, which are legit. CNN even told its drones they were illegal to possess. Right wing smear jobs on a Clinton? Which scandal are you referring to? They are numerous. Your whole argument is a gigantic whataboutism with Russia. What <em>is</em>, I can say. America has rejected the liberal ideology and the left is reeling. They are the party of &quot;it&#39;s not my fault&quot; and victimhood. This whole narrative was crafted in the primaries to only attack in the primaries. They never expected to lose. Do you remember how a few of the polls for Trump jumped 10-13 points in one week? The kicker is that this was released 2 days before Comey reopened the investigation. This was a deliberate attempt to save face and admit they were lying over a longer period of time.</p>

<p>With one tweet and they are trapped into investigating the wiretap with the Russia allegation. NYT has already edited their wiretap headline in an attempt rewrite history. Check the headlines, the media is pulling out of the Russia narrative for now. </p>

<p>The deep state is reeling. CIA just publicly stated that we don&#39;t use any of the code &quot;that they seemed to have misplaced&quot; against citizens. What happens when part 2 says otherwise?</p>

<p>If Russia was so efficient on getting trump elected why did Hillary win the popular vote?</p>

<p>How is it that the DNC emails only worked in states that clinton didn&#39;t even campaign in because of this blue wall?</p>

<p>How did trump win by electoral college in these states that are always blue?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take a very large movement in popular sentiment to cause an electoral loss, given the nature of our current electoral college - a targeted series of leaks in coordination with a massive PR campaign wouldn&#39;t need to sway the majority of voters in the country in order to change the outcome of an election. It would only need to tip things just enough in certain states. Even then, whether or not it played a pivotal role in the outcome of the election is only mildly pertinent - it&#39;s like the difference between someone breaking into your house and stealing everything or someone breaking into your house and being unable to crack open the safe. Unfortunately since the safe in this instance is the critical thinking skills of the American electorate... well. People throw the term &quot;fake news&quot; around pretty loosely right now, but frankly I think it was best applied to the 100% BS propaganda that was being created like mad overseas and pumped into the US - both by foreign shills and/or ad revenue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you really believe the emails were able to sway people who voted obama twice to vote for trump?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not the emails themselves so much as the nonstop propaganda push online and the constant droning on about them in the mainstream media. Not just propaganda about the emails, either. Propaganda is effective, it&#39;s use is historically well-documented, psychologically it is pretty well understood. Russia&#39;s methods of employing propaganda are well-researched. If you don&#39;t accept that propaganda can be very effective - even when it isn&#39;t based in reality, as it were - then you should do some research, it&#39;s really interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Wikileaks we saw the dnc want to push to have trump win the RNC nomination how did Russia influence that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing, but these are completely unrelated facts. In a race so serious as the presidential election, you want to face a lackluster opponent - if you find out later that someone is shooting steroids into their campaign illegally, it isn&#39;t like you can change your previous decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few Russian trolls? The problem is that, I suspect, you&#39;re basing your analysis on the foregone conclusion that you must be right, because partisanship. Yet, the Russian state is run by the wealthiest man on Earth - someone who could, on his own, afford to fund a propaganda operation of staggering proportions - yet, he and his cabal of cronies also control a significant nation-state and have basically unfettered control over the disposition of its resources. &quot;A few Russian trolls&quot; hardly begins to describe the problem - in fact, it is quite deliberately dismissive of the effectiveness of manipulative propaganda techniques. It is - in effect - a form of propaganda itself. You are attempting to dismiss a notion you disagree with by trivializing it, mocking it, and presenting it in such a way as to make it easier for those who are inclined to agree with your basic premise to latch on to your argument - due to confirmation bias - and perpetuate it. All while dismissively belittling those who <em>foolishly</em> disagree, of course.</p>

<p>Tell me, what do you think the CTR budget was and then explain why you think it&#39;s so ridiculous that the Russian Federation couldn&#39;t outperform them? Also, if two people are playing tug-of-war and someone comes and shoves one person in the back - does it really matter how strongly the person so shoved was pulling? If they recover and win anyway, it still matters that someone tried to knock them down and people interfering in our tug-of-war must be strongly discouraged. If they lose because they were going to lose anyway, it still matters that someone tried to interfere in the competition and action must be taken. If they lose because of the interference, well, that matters in particular. Then, what if it is revealed that the other competitor was in on it from the get-go? Whether or not it significantly altered the outcome, it&#39;s still fundamentally important - and despite your illogical arguments, it is possible that Russian interference altered the outcome. <strong>In fact, given that it was an electoral college victory with such a small actual vote margin, it is more likely that their interference altered the outcome of the election.</strong> If it had been a Trump popular victory by a significant amount, then a relatively small change in the overall voting trend due to interference would not have likely accounted for that. A small enough change to cause an unlikely electoral college upset, though? Sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not a partisan issue for me this for me is finding the truth. I am not for trump nor am I for Hillary. I am not for republican nor am I for democrat. The two party system is dead and has been. 
Now my whole reasoning for this thread is that we have little to no proof of Russian involvement. I have read the DHS report AND other IC reports on the alleged Russian involvement. Now if you believe these reports which I admittingly do not you have to believe crowdstrike not the government. Our governmental body the FBI did not once look at the dnc server. John podestas password was p@ssword, also left his phone in a cab, also fell for a phishing scam. A former British ambassador to the UN has come forward saying the dnc was a leak and not a hack. 
So let&#39;s say Russian propagandast pushed Wikileaks. What did they show us exactly? A corrupt dnc who cares not for their voters through rigging an election for a candidate of their choice making a mockery of the primary? What are you arguing when it comes to that? That we should not be made aware of these things keep them secret and hidden so Hillary clinton could&#39;ve won? 
Now we also had a severe propaganda campaign against Donald trump that also cannot be denied you had the entirety of the msm against him yet he still won. Now what you are asserting by Russian propaganda claims is that trump is obviously the less corrupt and a better candidate if he won? By claiming Russian propaganda against the clinton campaign was effective then the better candidate won? This is what I don&#39;t understand. Rather than bringing up the information given to us by supposed Russian hackers we are only to look at the Russian influence rather than the information provided? Then when it comes to the trump admin colluding with Russia are we not to care of our government under obama and even now under trump admin colluding with Saudi Arabia a known terrorist funding government who may even have funded 911 terrorist? These are my true questions I am trying to understand? </p>

<p>Are we not to care about corruption of our parties within our own government and should only be afraid of other foreign entities who shine the light on the corruption? </p>

<p>Are we to ignore actual collusion with governments who fund anti-us terrorism? </p>

<p>What then should we care about? A Russian menace? A corrupt government as a whole? Should we care about a propaganda campaign by our msm to ignore these questions? This is the root of my post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is nothing but whataboutism, untruth, deflection, and nonsense. Russian propaganda showed us the truth? What a joke. Let&#39;s go thank, them, eh? It isn&#39;t as if we coined a phrase to describe the completely fabricated nonsense flowing out of Russian troll farms - one that has since been subverted in a fit of petulance by those who would use it in an attempt to discredit any news source that does not agree with their preconceived notions: Fake. News.</p>

<p>You think we&#39;ve forgotten the completely false stories - often in barely passable English - that constantly swamped right-wing social media? Clinton didn&#39;t leave that campaign event <em>sick</em>, she was taken away in cuffs! <em>Proof</em> of this, indisputable <em>evidence</em> of that! All of it completely made up. 100% <strong>fake</strong>. All of Assange&#39;s twerping about how he was going to release the groundbreaking - indictable - email any day now... all the way through the end up the election? Parroted nonstop by those propagandists. Russian opposition, foreign media, US media, US intel, foreign intel, Trump himself - even Russian authorities have hinted at it - no one credible doubts Russia meddled. Some of the primary actors are arguing over collusion, efficacy, and response, but the fact that they meddled is disputed by none of them. Russia proved government corruption? Russia&#39;s propaganda and shilling campaign has proven nothing but the age-old truth that there is a sucker born every day.</p>
