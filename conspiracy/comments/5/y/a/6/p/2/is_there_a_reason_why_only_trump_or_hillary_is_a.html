<p>Did you read the piece you linked? </p>

<p>Because they all look pretty fucking reasonable. Like going after people who owe massive debts to his casinos. </p>

<p>So are you arguing people shouldn&#39;t be held accountable for their behavior? Must be a democrat. </p>

<p>So, where&#39;s the part where you prove your initial point? Because I asked for evidence and you linked an MSM hit piece that barely stands on its weak meager legs as taking a shot at trump.</p>

<p>Bring your A game or stop wasting my time. You&#39;re just a salty trump hater that&#39;s chapped because with all the spying, prying, defamation, hit pieces, and personal attacks on trump - you, the MSM, this sub, and even Wikileaks ain&#39;t got shit on him yet.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s time to close this chapter in your shilldrens book and move on to your next sub to pedal your bullshit narrative. </p>

<p>Trump is not Hillary. There are no:</p>

<p>Deals regarding nuclear materials with foreign governments.</p>

<p>No ties or evidence of pedophilia.</p>

<p>No evidence of &quot;pay for play.&quot;</p>

<p>No evidence of sex scandals.</p>

<p>No backroom deals with CIA.</p>

<p>No meetings on tarmacs.</p>

<p>No inside info on debate questions or vote fraud.</p>

<p>No support from the MSM.</p>

<p>No support from deep state.</p>

<p>No support from globalists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My concern is that he&#39;s an illegitimate president. It could even be that Trump is being forced into this role under threats of violence, exposure--whatever it takes to destroy his life. I would be sympathetic to that. I&#39;d even accept him taking the Rosneft money, because how can he actually refuse the person who holds him in such a tight grip? </p>

<p>Hell, I&#39;d accept him acting out and being like this as a way to sabotage his presidency. The faster he can trigger an investigation, the sooner he can get out of this nightmare. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to just hate on Trump. I&#39;m just here to say that there is obviously something devious going on here. We are in the midst of a serious constitutional crisis that could result in disaster. </p>

<p>The past and peoples track records. Who&#39;s predictions in the conspiracy theory culture and community have been spot on, whose have been flat wrong? What are those people saying now?</p>

<p>Also see:</p>

<p>Video evidence</p>

<p>Hot mic evidence</p>

<p>Leaked evidence</p>

<p>Hacked evidence</p>

<p>Declassified evidence</p>

<p>Factual first account reporting supported by evidence</p>

<p>Or at least an accumulation of shaky evidence all driving at a common parallel theme that is undeniably beyond coincidental.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I&#39;d had to argue this, it&#39;s because Trump had money to burn, no reason to get into politics to get more and will likely see it burn,  by the things he&#39;s doing, which makes him look like he&#39;s working for a &#39;greater good&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re both elite pieces of shit who want to amass more money and power. Along with the vast majority of high level politicians. It&#39;s mind boggling that people think the billionaire New York real estate mogul, who admitted to buying politicians, who has rubbed elbows with the likes of the Clintons, and who has dealing and relationships with politicians and oligarchs across the world, is somehow a &quot;man of the people&quot;. He isn&#39;t. He may be fighting against the Clintons and the current CIA right now, but he isn&#39;t going to dismantle the CIA. He isn&#39;t going to reduce the size of government. He&#39;s just part of a different team than we&#39;ve had previously, and neither of them give a shit about you or me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let&#39;s just run down the hallways of r/conspiracy screaming biased bullshit then try to backpedal out of it by going &quot;there&#39;s no way to know anything is real for sure?!?!&quot;</p>

<p>Okay Jayden Smith it&#39;s time for a nap.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s how you generally feel then don&#39;t AstroTurf a sub with here-say threads based on no evidence whatsoever pushing MSM talking points and ultimately wasting everyone&#39;s time.</p>

<p>One thing to know about this sub? We are really fucking skeptical and don&#39;t do hit pieces without evidence. When you come in here spouting off this rhetoric it exposes you as a tourist willing to regurgitate MSM talking points. </p>

<p>MSM is a source of information so decidedly agreed upon by the population here on r/con as propaganda that saying &quot;but the Russians hacked our election and trump is illegitimate&quot; is laughable at best here. You&#39;re either a shill, way out of your element, or have a looooong way to go before you even realize you&#39;re a tourist here.</p>

<p>Maybe if you keep posting more kneejerk personal attacks and obvious biased call outs referencing pro trump lingo against those who disagree with you, rather than some form of evidence to support whatever it is you&#39;re claiming to push here, you&#39;ll finally change all our minds that you&#39;re not a salty democrat shill.</p>
