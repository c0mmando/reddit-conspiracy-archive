       Not about price setting at all, it's about foregoing convenience to maintain liberty.  We've become a lazy on-demand society and that has subjected us to these abuses.  It's not a change in the economics of the penniless masses, but rather a shift in behavior and perception (and being a game theorist I understand how difficult this is to achieve - which is why I'm planting the seed).  By implying that we have no choice here, you're being intellectually dishonest and regressive.

       Try writing software and come back. There is a way reason why software requires constant revision and updates. Changes in code break things. New technology and standard forces changes that require changes in codes.  If that is the case all software from every company will never need updates.

       I'm sorry, but I've seen the profit margins at these companies.  They have every opportunity to increase oversight and monitor vulnerabilities, it simply takes investment.  Sorry if I don't adopt the "poor $100B tech company" mindset.  The exchange here is information and eyeballs for convenience and security.  They consistently demonstrate that they are not living up to their end of the bargain and simply get a pass.  There is clearly not enough oversight if the CIA is planting moles within their ranks.  Just because something is hard does not mean it should be ignored or excused.  This is the essence of the apologist mindset.

       I agree with you that these companies should have the users' privacies as top priority but covering all vulnerabilities is hard with a changing landscape. The government is to blame but I don't think because vulnerabilities exist that the companies are inept.

       You have to think how society is organised to understand also how the companies are organised.. There is a reason why the most secure software is produced by open source community and not major corporations.

       Big organisations end up being cluttered with middle managers that hire lame engineers that do an OK job, their managers does an ok job and it keeps going down the chain. In the end everyone doing the work only wants to be left alone and get paid. Mangers do not understand the work because it is too technical so they rely on bullshit documentation. Engineers higher up the chain do not rattle the chain because that means more trouble for them and their managers. In the end everyone's is paid and is shut up while the work is semi done.

       Completely agree, I've consulted to some of these very companies.  However, condoning the vulnerabilities of corporate bureaucracy is, again, a lazy strategy that dooms us to a repetitious, counter progressive cycle.  I'm entirely tired of the status quo excuse making and in search of ideas to combat the problem.  I genuinely wish someone on this site would disagree with me and suggest an alternative strategy as opposed to "well that's just the way it is and we can do nothing."  I reject that line of thinking.

       Problem is that engineers and programmers are also not real men. What I am talking about is "geek culture". They get walked over all the time, they are taught that they are nerds, and weak.

       You wanted a solution... Think about this...
      </p>
      <p>
       Microsoft and Apple spend BILLIONS of dollars employing, armies og engineers, developers, testers, managers, manger of managers. All these people work and make sacrifices every single day, so they can pay the rent and try to live a normal life. And what do we get ? 
Stuff like Windows and OSX.... Sure they are ok... but was it worth it?
      </p>
      <p>
       We also have Linux... made by just as talanted engineers, less effort , less cost, much more fun ....
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the solutions. Better for all... But you can pitch that idea to a manager, or a CTO... there is no place for them to get paid...
      </p>
      <p>
       We keep treating internet and IT as we treat the real world. But we fail to realize that it is a completely different domain.

       Red team will always be ahead of blue team, that's just how it works. It's not as easy as you're making it out to be, companies like Google have amazing security, but government agencies who want to infiltrate them will. Literally any industry, any company, doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our intelligence agencies can hit airgapped computers in foreign nuclear refineries, of course they'll own a private company. Blame the CIA/NSA and the government that's allowed them to do this, it's not Google's fault that this is how hacking works.

       Of course it's collusion, not incompetence. It would be interesting to hear Jobs on this if he was alive ... How to come from being a hacker of system to being a problem in the system.

       I started out young looking to "get into computers", because it was something that I thought that a kid growing up in a poor ghetto could do, without a lot of help with connections or investment. I did some programming for a living - all self-taught.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a while there, I thought that the Internet would go a long way towards educating people, and I thought that a kind of education was the greatest thing which could help the people I knew and loved growing up poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I have mixed feelings about computers and the Internet. So many people, including those in the CIA and the NSA, have poisoned the field, turning it into a tool of scams and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, the Internet
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       done a lot to educate people. The information you read on this sub, and the articles linked, can give you a broader perspective. I love hearing people's personal stories, because I was so isolated growing up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really care what Jobs would think, but I think that it's been a mixed bag - a lot of good, and a whole stinking pile of bad. Wish it were better.
