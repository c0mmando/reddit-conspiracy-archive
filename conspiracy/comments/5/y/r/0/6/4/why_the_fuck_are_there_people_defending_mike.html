    <div class="md"><p>I think he&#39;s 3-D chess in the situation. This was said to buy time and help postpone whatever retaliation the DState has in store soon. He said this because he had to at this time for the situation. We don&#39;t know everything and don&#39;t have the whole story yet. If they actually try to harm Wikileaks before Chapter 2 drops than start to worry. The DState hates the attentions, and really hates the heat of the  spotlight when they&#39;re being called out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA <em>routinely</em> breaks domestic and foreign laws every day.  The Vault 7 report confirms what tons of people already knew, and we&#39;ve had proof for decades alone that the CIA traffics and sells drugs directly and to the major cartels, if they don&#39;t own them outright.  They&#39;re not even technically a domestic agency: the CIA is in service to the Crown of England, NOT our country, and work for the banks and Wall Street.  Interestingly, in 1996, the House of Representatives&#39; Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released a huge report entitled &quot;IC21: The Intelligence Community in the 21st Century.&quot; Buried amid hundreds of pages is this paragraph:</p>

<p>&quot;The CS [clandestine service] is the only part of the IC [intelligence community], indeed of the government, where hundreds of employees on a daily basis are directed to break extremely serious laws in countries around the world in the face of frequently sophisticated efforts by foreign governments to catch them. A safe estimate is that several hundred times every day (easily 100,000 times a year) DO [Directorate of Operations] officers engage in highly illegal activities (according to foreign law) that not only risk political embarrassment to the US but also endanger the freedom if not lives of the participating foreign nationals and, more than occasionally, of the clandestine officer himself.&quot;</p>

<p>Good thing they <em>definitely</em> don&#39;t do that here! /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI does domestic surveillance, the CIA is only chartered for foreign surveillance. You have to keep in mind that everything they do is illegal. No country is going to allow the U.S. Intelligence services infiltrate their governments. Every op is criminal. The whole organization is basically a criminal enterprise that steals information. While I don&#39;t have too big a problem with that on foreign soil I don&#39;t want it here where I could be put in jail by the secret police. </p>

<p>Every other country does it to us, and we should be doing it to them, but when that type of work is internalized it becomes a danger to the citizens where the force of the federal government could be brought down on citizens. The DoJ combined with the Big Brother Arm of the CIA is a terrifying thought. That is the NSA. The government is basically a blind giant that will crush you if it takes an interest in you, but it&#39;s vision is getting clearer, and the NSA is the giant&#39;s glasses. </p>

<p>The CIA has no respect for the 4th Amendment or any of the Bill of Rights for that matter. While they provide a valuable service outside of the U.S. they should under no circumstances be allowed to operate inside the U.S.</p>

<p>The other troubling issue is the politicization of the CIA. How can we as a people trust an agency with the power the CIA has if they have an agenda other than the defense of the nation. They should be concerned with defending American interests abroad, but they seem to have lost their way over the last 40 years. Ever since bush Sr got the reigns the agency had been corrupted, and they have pursued a unilateral advancement of their own power. That really gathered stream after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Cold War was over, budgets were being cut, they needed a new Boogyman, a new purpose. They needed an undefined enemy to build their budgets back up. Keep the criminal enterprises well greased with tax dollars.</p>

<p>And here we are today...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.&quot; — Marcus Tullius Cicero (42 B.C.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because if they don&#39;t come out hard against Wikileaks, their opposition will jump on them for working with them and &#39;letting them off the hook&#39;.</p>

<p>Pence and Trump have to give the media and the establishment as little ammunition as possible until things calm down. I think a lot of this was lip service, which is only reinforced by the point that Pence has no legal jurisdiction over wikileaks or Assange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only fool is yourself if you cannot see how Trump and &#39;the establishment&#39; are opposed - he has been under fire from day 1. They are the same people who were behind Clinton and their master plan of a &#39;pied piper candidate&#39; blew up in their face.</p>

<p>Pence may be part of that group - I can&#39;t say for sure. Trump never had an option to go nuclear on the government - he needs the Republican party to play nice with him or else they could just handcuff him or remove him. The president really doesn&#39;t have that much power with the rest of government working with them.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take this to mean that Trump doesn&#39;t have his own flaws and interests, but he is NOT part of the established powers in Washington. He has been the butt of their jokes for almost 30 years now - they dont&#39; like each other much at all. Remember that Trump was a registered democrat for over 20 years before 2008 (when he went independent). He doesn&#39;t have many friends in the Republican party either.</p>

<p>They are so fuckin&#39; butthurt over losing, that they want him to fail. They refuse to acknowledge any positives that he has done and want to turn every decision he makes into some catastrophic nightmare and they&#39;ve been doing it since before he was elected.</p>

<p>For example, he says &quot;Mexico is not giving us their best and brightest&quot; or &quot;A lot of illegal immigrants are rapists and drug dealers.&quot;</p>

<p>And somehow that turns into &quot;Trump is racist!&quot; &quot;All hispanics will be deported&quot;, They blow everything out of proportion to the point where, even if Trump did do something wrong, it would be hard to tell from their point of view because everything is treated like the holocaust. </p>

<p>Thus far, nothing Trump has done has affected me negatively. Yet, I see all these privileged first worlders acting like their personal utopia is being shattered and it&#39;s fucking pathetic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You were just implying that Obama was trying to take away our rights, and now you are saying that liberals are protesting over rights they haven&#39;t lost yet.</p>

<p>California seceding is funded by Russian groups. It&#39;s a stupid thing to do.</p>

<p>Abolishing the electoral vote dumb. I agree with you there.</p>

<p>They want him to fail because they think his policies are bad for America. They want him to fail, but want America to succeed. </p>

<p>What positives has he accomplished so far?</p>

<p>Even Republicans and his own administration have been saying his administration is in chaos and something needs to be changed fast.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t say a lot of illegal immigrants are rapists and drug dealers. Here&#39;s the full quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you. It&#39;s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they&#39;re not sending their best. They&#39;re not sending you. They&#39;re not sending you. They&#39;re sending people that have lots of problems, and they&#39;re bringing those problems with us. They&#39;re bringing drugs. They&#39;re bringing crime. They&#39;re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Illegal immigrants is nowhere mentioned in that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need Trump to do something against me negatively, to care how his actions affect others. </p>

<p>My wife is a immigrant, and luckily she&#39;s not a immigrant from a Muslim nation.</p>

<p>The TPP is dead in the water, thanks to him. Obamacare is dead in the water, thanks to him. </p>

<p>I see nothing wrong with his quote. Do you think Mexico&#39;s doctors and scientists are smuggling themselves across the border?</p>

<p>It&#39;s people with problems coming here. And while having problems doesn&#39;t make you a bad person, guess what? American citizens have problems too and they need to be addressed first. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What rights has Obama tried to take away?</p>

<p>Liberals aren&#39;t saying women don&#39;t have equal rights all of a sudden. But, it&#39;s about acknowledging that sexism and discrimination does still exist (and yes I know it happens against men as well). This last election has allowed a lot of it t come out, and ignoring these types of issues is not going to make it go away.</p>

<p>His travel ban is one of the fucking stupidest things ever. It just antagonizes our allies and embolden our enemies. We already have one of the most insanely through vetting systems in the world. Do your self a favor, and talk to experts at the immigration office and ask them to tell you what the vetting procedures are.</p>

<p>The TPP wasn&#39;t perfect, but I supported it. I hated the court system that it would impose, but I do support free trade and believe that TPP was important for maintaining our power in Asia. </p>

<p>Trump had nothing to do with shooting it dead in the water. Congress was going to shoot it down no matter what. Trump&#39;s action was just a formality.</p>

<p>I fully support Obamacare. It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s stupidly ridiculous to repeal it instead of just repairing it.</p>

<p>Quote: You&#39;re moving goal posts now. Your point was that he was talking about illegal immigrants, but he wasn&#39;t. He said most Mexicans that come to the states are rapists and drug dealers. </p>

<p>All - some(he assumes) = most.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>American citizens have problems too and they need to be addressed first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Republicans say this type of shit, but as soon as government assistance programs are talked about, republicans shout &quot;Big government! take care of yourselves you bums!&quot;</p>

<p>If my wife was from those 7 countries, she would be at serious risk of not being able to come into the country, or at least at the minimum being detained for several hours or possibly days at the air ports. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re in r/conspiracy. This sub shits on the establishment and they see Trump as part of that. If you don&#39;t think criticizing politicians and import figures is part of this sub, you&#39;re in for a rough time. Sure, the last 8 years was shitting on Obama but that&#39;s because he was in power. Most of the people in this sub don&#39;t look to one party or the other for salvation, as they see them as two arms of the same body. After this past election though, there has been a serious influx of Trump supporters (which there is nothing wrong with) but they can&#39;t handle the spirit of this sub which is to question everything.</p>

<p>So yah, if you are annoyed with posts in R/CONSPIRACY criticizing the president (who I&#39;m assuming you voted for), you might want to leave or at least provide constructive criticism about why you find the opinion of the original poster to be incorrect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just pulling your leg. It is very true that Russia has always been demonized. Remember all those Arnold action movies and alike, where they had the evil Russians all the time lol. Sure there might have been a hint of truth in there but it was always probably overexerted not only make the movie more fun, but to do exactly what we are discussing; to demonize. It&#39;s been put out, ingrained in us. </p>

<p>However, since (the?) Ukraine and Syria, things have escalated to another level between Russia and US, especially in the info war area and financial sector through sanctions and other intimidation methods. Now the media says the sanctions were deserved but when one looks at the whole picture, it paints something different than what the media has been painting for us. </p>

<p>However, it then it started to spill into deaths. Basically on the brink of a real war between USA and America. In Ukraine in a was a proxy war but in Syria, BOTH Russians and Americans were present, so any small move or mistake could have triggered something major. And considering the tensions and what was at stake for US (pipeline domination and a shitload of investments into moderate revels for) it didn&#39;t seem they would be too forgiving. Neither would Russia. But neither seemed to have been willing to back down. I was genuinely scared shitless of our future under Clinton. She is insane. Trump acts insane, that&#39;s the difference. She is a war criminal with nothing stopping her, as in regard for human life. If she could get away with it, she would do it. And she was able to get away with a lot unfortunately. A lot believe US was trying to provoke Russia in order to remain in power, because should a war had started, there would be a state of emergency or whatever it&#39;s called when the country is under war, which meant no elections, no leaks, more money, more control. </p>

<p>In my opinion, these world leaders are like pure gangsters. Putin is trying to overtake the arms sale in the world by stealing markets, and US is struggling with their sales to the terrorists since their plan wasn&#39;t going to shit they needed a bigger war to keep the money machine going.</p>

<p>Those who were following the war news closely from the start, every damn day, from a non-MSM narrative, doing their own research and digging, know the dangers and intentions of the elite, which Clinton would have been happily a puppet for and on board with their plans. That is if she would have been it through her health even. It seemed her health wasn&#39;t even going to keep her stable for long enough. A lot of people felt she was only there as a prop to remain power, and then all the moves would have been made by her controllers, whether she was still in power or one of their next puppets if she had to go because of health. The point is, the keys would have been handed to people who USED ISIS to their advantage. It wouldn&#39;t even surprise me anymore if they were even behind its creation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole mission of US against ISIS was a facade in Syria. They were literally uninvited there and had to come by force by creating false flags events. Even if the sarin gas incident was not deep-state fabricated, they sure try to utilize it their advantage to jump on Russia and Syria without any proof whatsoever and get themselves into Syria. </p>

<p>If Russia were to simply kick them out, they would have to do it by force, which would result in a war, which now seems US wanted all along, considering how much bear poking there has been. It seemed Russia was not interested in this and made a stern decision not to react no matter what. Oh and the poking got worse and worse. But in the end, it seems they got what they wanted and didn&#39;t give in to the bully. Eventually the bully had to leave the school yard. Had the bully managed to provoke a fight, he could have used that to his advantage to not get kicked out of the schoolyard longer, or from the school itself for that matter. No fight, no get to stay longer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For many, Trump seems to their one and only hope, but he&#39;s only one man and it will take a concerted effort by millions of outraged Americans to see any meaningful change in the rampant abuse of governmental powers that is directed far more against them and their best interests than any foreign government or would-be terrorists.</p>

<p>I saw voting for him and putting him in the oval office as being similar to adding a neutral catalyst to two stable and otherwise  incompatible elements to create a reaction and a brand new combination out of them that wasn&#39;t possible without that catalyst being there. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s stirred-up half of the country and riveted their attention on Washington and now the other half is getting steadily pulled in to watch the whole ugly spectacle, like it or not, and see it for what it truly is.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s unaffiliated presence and uncertainty about what he might personally take an interest in, or choose to do something about on his own initiative has created this gigantic shit-storm that&#39;s got everyone quivering in their boots, not anything that he&#39;s actually done because he&#39;s barely had time to actually do anything of any real significance or that was in any way unexpected. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t say he&#39;s actually exposed anyone or anything beyond a taunt or a tease or a jeer that has had his opposition in such a mad frenzy of indignation over it that they&#39;ve been exposing themselves right, left, and center for the bunch of self-serving two-faced liars, hypocrites, crooks, and thieves they all actually are.</p>

<p>How dare Trump suggest such a thing about them? Who does he think he is, the President of the United States or something?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he does and for anyone not paying attention he actually is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The short answer is &quot;yes&quot;, and the world has always been somewhat bizarro but it is now teetering on becoming completely and quite possibly even insanely bizarro with things becoming completely undone and cut-loose to such an extent that virtually anything can happen next.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also an opportunity to make all kinds of things happen that weren&#39;t previously possible that can be good or bad depending on your outlook and how you approach it. </p>

<p>Clearly bad thoughts are bringing bad things to bad people at the moment, so it would seem that the converse should also apply to maintaining a good and positive outlook to see good and positive changes emerge and settle down in place out of the unpredictable storm that has everything up in the air at the moment.</p>

<p>We must try to envision what it is we want to see come together and begin to act and behave as if they already existed as the way to actually make and see them become a reality.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m not convinced he plans on acting on this yet. </p>

<p>Why?
Because Trump would take this public stance even if he actually supports them. </p>

<p>If he publicly endorsed WikiLeaks, it would negatively impact both parties. Trump would seemingly be supporting the compromise of U.S. intelligence, making him easily labeled a traitor. For Assange, public collaboration with Trump would do nothing but discredit future leaks and steal attention from the actual content.</p>

<p>That classifies it as a hack, personal emails from tons of different politicians isn&#39;t &#39;leaked by an insider&#39;, please at least try to think before blindly defending your government based on words. </p>

<p>Your arguments aren&#39;t misinterpreted, they&#39;re blatantly wrong lmao.</p>

<p>Did the IT guy get the OK from every democrat that he leaked? No, that means he had unauthorized access, that classifies it as an act.

<p>If it wasn&#39;t the actual emailers who leaked the documents, it would be classified as a &#39;hack&#39;. I&#39;m not the guy who writes definitions, but when you wanna start a defence war based on the definition of a word I&#39;m gonna have to take you up on that. </p>

<p>Listen dude, I know me and you are on the complete opposite ends when it comes to politics and government, but I&#39;m only arguing that whoever leaked the emails to assange had to hack it to get it. I&#39;m not saying Trump did it, or the Russians did it, but In terms of definitions I am one hundred percent cerain those emails were obtained by &#39;hacking&#39; as stupid of a word as it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>which would be a welcomed change.</p>

<p>trump is a blessing in disguise, because he is reflexively hated and feared so much by the dems, the neocons, the neolibs, the MSM, and establishment repubs, that everything he does is met withoutrage, outrage strangely missing for the last 8 years, and largely absent for the last 27, for the same exact things.</p>

<p>aside: i tried to find an something on the independent voters&#39; opinion of the CIA, but the results were are fucked up with russia bullshit. i did however find a facebook page for citzens for an independent america whose official self chosen accronym is CIA.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.facebook.com/CitizensforanIndependentAmerica/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE">https://m.facebook.com/CitizensforanIndependentAmerica/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE</a></p>

<p>we are too tribalist. peop,e need to stop using cague amorphous words to describe things. there is no left/right dichotomy, there is only top/bottom.</p>

<p>geopolitics has 4 quadrants:</p>

<p>statetist upper right capitalist box is keynsianism, economic liberalism, and neoliberalism/corporatism.</p>

<p>all are capitalist, so it is not helpful to understand them as moving from left to right, but from bottom to top. the difference is how global and brutal the level of capitalism is, how interventionist and brutal their foriegn policy is, and how much of a police state they have. keynsianism is least of all three, neoliberalism is the worst of all three. </p>

<p>bush, obama, and both clintons are all neoliberals. bernie is a kensyian, but also an imperialist, which makes him unpredictable and unreliable, as reflected in his actual voting record. rand paul is a classic economic liberalist, but an anti-imperialist, which likewise makes him unpredictable.</p>

<p>the statist upper left box are socialists and communists, moving from bottom to top based on who owns the means of production and distributes the value of labor generated, along with the level of inwardness/isolationism, how reactionary they are internally, and the level of the police state. </p>

<p>under socialism, the workers themselves own the means of production, distribute the value generated. it is the least inward/isolationist, the least reactionary internally, and has the weakest police state. under communism, the state owns the means of production and dustributes the value produced. it is the most inward, the most reactionary, and has the strongest police state.</p>

<p>(note: the USSR looked outward on a reactionary basis, it had a nuclear arsenal aimed directly at it and its western bord from top to bottom was lined with tanks, missles, and troops. it took over the countries to its west to provide a buffer zone so as to have time to counter another OPERATION BARBAROSA, which killed 20 million of its soldiers and 14 million of its civilians).</p>

<p>the anti-statist lower right are libertarians. the anti-statist lower left are anarchists. the basic tenet of both is that all people everywhere have the inalienable right to be left alone to live their lives as they see fight so long as they abide by the anti-aggression rule (libertarians) and the anti-oppresion rule (anarchists). they also fundamentally differ regarding permissability of heirarchies and ownership of land, minerals, water, access to food, housing, clothing. anarchists say now to both, libertarians say yes to both.</p>

<p>however, push come to shove, being anti-statist and pro-self determination make them far more similar to each other, than to any statists. anarchists cheif critic of libertarianism is that it will always devolve in statism because property et al require a state super structure to enforce and that heiracrchy is inherently aggressive. they likewise say that anarchy will devolve into statism, though i&#39;ve never been clear on what grounds.</p>

<p>all other supposed left/right divisions are moral/existential and i herently personal. they have business in political debate/dichotomy because there is no way 350 million people will ever agree on anything. families can&#39;t even agree. believe what you want to believe, live according to your own creed, but respect everyone else&#39;s right to do so as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re in r/conspiracy. This sub shits on the establishment and they see Trump as part of that. If you don&#39;t think criticizing politicians and import figures is part of this sub, you&#39;re in for a rough time.

Most of the people in this sub don&#39;t look to one party or the other for salvation, as they see them as two arms of the same body.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just pulling your leg. It is very true that Russia has always been demonized. Remember all those Arnold action movies and alike, where they had the evil Russians all the time lol. Sure there might have been a hint of truth in there but it was always probably overexerted not only make the movie more fun, but to do exactly what we are discussing; to demonize. It&#39;s been put out, ingrained in us. </p>

<p>However, since (the?) Ukraine and Syria, things have escalated to another level between Russia and US, especially in the info war area and financial sector through sanctions and other intimidation methods. Now the media says the sanctions were deserved but when one looks at the whole picture, it paints something different than what the media has been painting for us. </p>

<p>However, it then it started to spill into deaths. Basically on the brink of a real war between USA and America. In Ukraine in a was a proxy war but in Syria, BOTH Russians and Americans were present, so any small move or mistake could have triggered something major. And considering the tensions and what was at stake for US (pipeline domination and a shitload of investments into moderate revels for) it didn&#39;t seem they would be too forgiving. Neither would Russia. But neither seemed to have been willing to back down. I was genuinely scared shitless of our future under Clinton. She is insane. Trump acts insane, that&#39;s the difference. She is a war criminal with nothing stopping her, as in regard for human life. If she could get away with it, she would do it. And she was able to get away with a lot unfortunately. A lot believe US was trying to provoke Russia in order to remain in power, because should a war had started, there would be a state of emergency or whatever it&#39;s called when the country is under war, which meant no elections, no leaks, more money, more control. </p>

<p>In my opinion, these world leaders are like pure gangsters. Putin is trying to overtake the arms sale in the world by stealing markets, and US is struggling with their sales to the terrorists since their plan wasn&#39;t going to shit they needed a bigger war to keep the money machine going.</p>

<p>Those who were following the war news closely from the start, every damn day, from a non-MSM narrative, doing their own research and digging, know the dangers and intentions of the elite, which Clinton would have been happily a puppet for and on board with their plans. That is if she would have been it through her health even. It seemed her health wasn&#39;t even going to keep her stable for long enough. A lot of people felt she was only there as a prop to remain power, and then all the moves would have been made by her controllers, whether she was still in power or one of their next puppets if she had to go because of health. The point is, the keys would have been handed to people who USED ISIS to their advantage. It wouldn&#39;t even surprise me anymore if they were even behind its creation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao what? The DNC emails were hacked and then leaked, you can pressume the same happened to the CIA. You do realize that for leaks to happen people need to be hacked right?? Do you seriously believe Podesta released all his emails lmao. </p>

<p>But nice try at blatantly ignoring every point and then picking apart the most miniscule of details. Classic move from a The_Don cult member</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again you misrepresent my arguments, it&#39;s almost like you do that purposefully 🤔🤔. Podesta emails were hacks (although hacks that literally anyone could pull off). DNC emails were not hacks, they were leaked by an insider.</p>
