<p>You have no problem with the theory that an evil cabal run by reptilians/annunaki or demons are controlling our government and our media, but you don&#39;t think that this same evil cabal would control our scientific community or the education system?</p>

<p>What is one of the first things you learn in kindergarten? What does almost every classrooms have? A Globe.</p>

<p>From a very young age, we are taught that the earth is a spinning ball and just how stupid our anscestors were to ever believe otherwise. </p>

<p>All those movies on Space and aliens are fucking brainwashing. All the bullshit about faces on Mars and Fake moon landing hoaxes. Are just that --- controlled opposition.</p>

<p>Notice how quickly reddit and the media suppressed pizzagate/pedogate but they have no problem with aliens or UFO research. In fact they encourage it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so frustrating. If people would just consider, even for just a moment, that a group of Freemasons just might be getting a kick out of lying to us, they might just realize that the Globe Earth theory is absurd.</p>

<p>We are seriously taught that if the earth wasn&#39;t spinning 1000mph, then all the people on the bottom of the earth would fall off into the vacuum of space. </p>

<p>But thank God for gravity right? A force that has never been mathematically proven (but is accepted as fact today, by people who refuse look any deeper) and somehow is able to keep the oceans from flying off into space, while allowing butterflying and birds to fly free around.</p>

<p>They are saying that a butterfly has the ability to defy gravity and fly around, but this force is somehow keeping all of us stuck to earth and the moon in orbit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, yes of course I get defensive, and today I finally have time to at least try to explain why flat earth theory is worth discussing,</p>

<p>I hate being laughed at and am well aware of how ridiculous flat earth theory sounds....until you research what these people are saying.</p>

<p>Just as thought experiment, ask yourself, what you would do if you were skeptical of the accepted mainstream view of space?</p>

<p>Would you maybe try some of the experiments that you were taught in school, which according to our text books, proved to Copernicus (who was a Freemason) and others that the earth was a globe?</p>

<p>Maybe attach cameras to hot air balloons that can fly as high as possible to get a bird&#39;s eye view of the world?</p>

<p>Maybe calculate the curvature of the earth and then see if there are places you can still see or very long bridges that show a curve?</p>

<p>Because these are the things flat Earthers are doing. And there are a lot credible people who have recently come out like acheologist Michael Tellinger, mathematicians, pilots, land surveyors ect. who are saying that the earth is not a spinning globe.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;ve said my peace. It&#39;s a legitimate theory and I don&#39;t know why it would make conspiracy people look bad.</p>

<p>The normies think we&#39;re all crazy anyway, flat earth won&#39;t change that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your thought exsperiment is legit..this is exactly what happens in science.. progress thru falsification of well established theory or ideas...they are the heros of science, they are the famous ones you know the names of...every single one of them did by falsifying a previous idea and presenting a concept that explains huge swaths of wierd cosmic behaviour and phenomenon and makes them
 PREDICTABLE.</p>

<p>This is why you dont have an explination for stars or planets as youve said in past comments...somethings really wrong with your theory if its doing a worse job than gravity in explaining a phenomenon like stars and the cosmos </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know  about the very first exsperiment that showed earths rotation? Its a heavy pendulum. The Pendulums swing is never strait, every quarter hour its shifts a few inches...Why? 
What do pendulums and star formation and earthquakes and rain all have in common with each other?</p>

<p>You need a theory that explains  this strange &quot;phenomenon&quot;. ,better than gravity , the theory needs to beat Gravity , ot needs to explain a wider range of seemingly unrelated phenomenon  and that theory needs to do an even better job at predicting the  precise future motions of a swinging pendulum(and star dynamics). Thats the crux- Predictive Power..... so your  new theory needs to better predict motions by magnitudes of digits behind the decimal point.</p>

<p>After that is accomplished,you may have legitimately falsified the theory of gravity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll address your questions if first you can answer one of mine. </p>

<p>When a ship is sailing away from you and towards the horizon. When it hits the horizon and goes past it. Why does it then lower into the horizon and finally out of view?</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent question, thank you for bringing this up! </p>

<p>Short answer, the ship isn&#39;t going anywhere. (I mean to say, the ship is not disappearing because it&#39;s going over a curve)</p>

<p>There are 100s of videos proving that when a ship appears to go over the horizon, one simply has to grab a pair of binoculars and the ship will reappear, hull in all. </p>

<p>Now as the ship goes out of view from your binoculars, take a camera or a telescope and again, the ship will reappear. </p>

<p>Our eyes can only see so far on a flat plane, we really can&#39;t see forever. What happens is that eventually both the sky and the earth will meet up, it&#39;s a matter of perspective. </p>

<p>I suck at explaining this, but if you have a moment, please  check out this video at minute 5:20.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PBD7A-OMWyE">https://youtu.be/PBD7A-OMWyE</a></p>

<p>They explain it far better then me and it&#39;s helpful to have a visual aid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No dude. When something is getting farther and farther from you to the point of not seeing it anymore (ships or anything else) they get small and smaller and smaller. First to the point where you can&#39;t tell what that thing is anymore, then to the point of being a dot, then to the point of disappearing.</p>

<p>When the ship goes over the horizon that is not what is happening. The size of the object doesn&#39;t get smaller and smaller like it would if it&#39;s just a matter of distance. The bottom of the ship first gets hidden behind the horizon. Then the middle of the ship gets hidden behind the horizon. Then the top of the ship get&#39;s hidden behind the horizon. </p>

<p>This is easily confirmed. Just look at a plane in the air. The plane in the air is much further away from you than a ship near the horizon. Yet you can see the plane, all the way to the point where it becomes just a little dot in the distance. This same effect does not happen with a ship over the horizon.</p>

<p>Gladly! The &quot;pearness&quot; of the planet is very slight, i.e. not visible with human eyes. The term is meant to note that Earth isn&#39;t a perfect sphere, it doesn&#39;t actually look like the fruit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said! I can&#39;t help but wonder if people, so quick to discount flat earth theory have actually taken the time to look at the evidence.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything for sure, but what I do know is that over the last 75 years, if we were to compare the images of earth taken by NASA, we can see where the shape of the continents and oceans have changed considerably in size from picture to picture. NASA is now saying the earth is shaped like a pear, despite every picture of the earth that they&#39;ve ever published previously being perfectly round.</p>

<p>This is my go to point, because I can&#39;t get over that. It just makes no sense for NASA to deliberately tamper with images of the earth unless they are hiding something.</p>

<p>If anyone here has a good camera, please take a moment, go outside and zoom in on the moon or stars and see if space looks like what you&#39;ve been told. The catch is, most cameras (and telescopes) use a fish lens or wide screen lens which distort far away objects, so try avoid those types of lens if possible. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why it would be crazy to question an organization that was founded by NAZIs and Freemasons? And yes, I think it is very possible that every country capable of space exploration is in on it, because they are gate keepers of knowledge. If you disagree with anything they say, you&#39;re not gong to get far with your career.</p>

<p>This is a random point, but is it not a little suspicious that the Vatican has the biggest telescope in the world and they named it lucifer? </p>

<p>Plus we have videos made by pilots, drones and hot air balloons, showing hot spot from the sun and no curvature. Flat earth is a legitimate conspiracy imho. </p>

<p>After World War 2, the Russian and American government divided amongst themselves the top German scientists and America anyways these NAZI really rocket scientists went on to head the NAZA space program. The head of NASA, Wernher Von Braun was both a NAZI and celebrated satanist.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think your grandpa is a satanist, in fact masons at the lower level are likely good people. To people like your grandfather, Freemasonry is a social club, used by most to benefit their career or social standing.</p>

<p>Freemasonry, just like well, all major religions has been co-opted and used a cover for relatively small group of powerful satanists. Just youtube freemasontry and satanism if you&#39;re interested.</p>

So not only is it not the &quot;world&#39;s largest telescope&quot;, it&#39;s not even a telescope at all. The article further says it has nothing to do with the Catholic Church except that there is a Jesuit run observatory on the same mountain as the ASU observatory housing the instrament.

<p>They use the phrase &quot;pear shaped&quot; just to describe how it is not perfectly round. The &quot;pearness&quot; is very slight. It&#39;s doesn&#39;t actually <em>look</em> like a pear. You would never be able to see the difference with the naked eye.</p>

<p>P.S. The New Testament ends with Jesus saying &quot;I am Lucifier&quot;. Lucifer does not mean what most people think it means. It actually means &quot;morning star&quot;. Associating &quot;Lucifer&quot; to Satan, was due to poor translations and misinterpretations that became compounded over the centuries.

<p>Flat earthers are ridiculed because the topic was put to bed hundreds of years ago and flat earth theory is based entirely on scientific ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha crow baby, I concede, I was just looking through my comments and you know in another life, I really would be that crazy person, standing in the middle of street, eyes wild and hair flying about, screaming into a bullhorn to anyone who will listen, that the World is Flat. </p>

<p>To me, after researching this for a very obsessive few months, it&#39;s just so obvious that we&#39;ve been lied to about the shape of the earth. But hey fair enough, lol, if you guys are so sure that cabal of child molesting Satanists who have running the world for thousands of years wouldn&#39;t lie to you about the shape of the earth, then I concede and apologize for wasting everyone&#39;s time. 😔</p>

<p>Gotcha, I&#39;m just shilling and trying to make you feel bad. The illuminati arent real. Demons don&#39;t exist. Don&#39;t fear Lucifer, he&#39;s a handsome rebel and inspires art and creativity. </p>

<p>Donald Trump and the Clintons aren&#39;t good buddies behind the scenes. The leader of North Korea would never publicly use illuminati symbols. It&#39;s not all a big fucking joke to them. It is quite literally a game to them. </p>

<p>The truth is, are studying this for years, my limited understanding of what&#39;s going on is that of our reality is so far beyond what any of can possibly comprehend with human minds. There are unseen forces at work, way more powerful then human beings at play here.</p>

<p>I think the only reasonable thing to do, is get baked.</p>

<p>Thank you and goodnight. 🐸</p>

<p>I&#39;m not making any assumptions on the validity of the flat earth theory.

    <div class="md"><p>Your own source says  &quot;Lucifer&quot; is an <em>instrament attached</em> to a telescope that is operated by the University of Arizona. So not only is it not the &quot;world&#39;s largest telescope&quot;, it&#39;s not even a telescope at all. The article further says it has nothing to do with the Catholic Church except that there is a Jesuit run observatory on the same mountain as the ASU observatory housing the instrament. This is presented as an amusing aside - though looking into that Jesuit observatory will also show it does not house anything close to the world&#39;s biggest telescope.</p>
