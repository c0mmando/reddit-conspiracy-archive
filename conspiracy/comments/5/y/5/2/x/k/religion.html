       During my time of learning conspiracy and enlightening myself I have learned that most religion is to control us. I use to be a Christian and now I'm not sure what to believe about religion. What's your opinion or theory on how we were created, if there a God, and what happens after death. I am very curious about you guys opinion so I can research the information you provide me.

       I find that probably 95% of atheists have not seriously considered the arguments that theists are making, and talk down their noses out of an extreme sense of pride at their own pseudo-intellectualism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try reading Plato, Aristotle, and Aquinas' defenses of the existence of God. Most atheists aren't even familiar with BASIC philosophy of religion such as this.

       Religion is the ancient understanding of nature. Science is the modern understanding of nature. Nature is best described with mathematics. Religion is your relationship with the universe. It is how you interpret it and interact with it. Nature is the existence we all share here in this universe no matter how we relate to it.

       Oh it did leave an impression... but that was like a billions of years ago... and Earth was still soft and goopy under the surface... so we kinda formed back into a sphere after a really really long time... but we aren't nearly as large as we used to be... we lost a good chunk of us that is hurtling thru the universe as bits of debris  to this day... damn it must be so far away by now.

       I said "Maaaaaaybe"... Thats a big "maybe" if you didn't notice. It obviously wasn't spinning the exact same speed it is now... so it was either spinning slower or faster... or not spinning at all! 50/50 chance... pretty good odds.

       I don't know about death, but it seems pretty clear that only the chaos paths have anything to offer in terms of individual empowerment.  Satanists get at least that much right - they're on one of the chaos paths.

       Religion? Bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Christianity is true. There's a ton of intentional misinformation piled on top to confuse everyone, which is why we celebrate the birth of the nature god on winter solstice.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you read the actual Bible on its own, and take the time to understand it in its historical context, it's a profound book.

       I'm with you on that. I used to be a Christian and all it did was set boundaries for my freedom of thought and bring trauma. If anything, my "beliefs" are eclectic- I'll believe it when I see it, so the things I have witnessed and have made an impact on myself, no matter which religion, have shaped my mindset. But I've felt the most free because there's zero rules or regulations getting rid of the church. The Christian church ruined my childhood and it's destroying my family before my eyes, so yeah it's not for me.

       You're asking one of the most important questions you may ever contemplate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there are Universal and Spiritual Laws that apply to all beings throughout the cosmayas. Our body/vessel is temporary but our consciousness is eternal. Reincarnation is real. Most of us have temporal amnesia when we reincarnate. The purpose of which is for us to have an easier time learning new lessons, with the goal of spiritual ascension.
      </p>
      <p>
       Universal and Spiritual Laws:
      </p>
      <p>
       Universal Law of Nature
Universal Law of Symmetry
Universal Law of Light, Sound &amp; Vibration
Universal Law of Movements and Balance
Universal Law of Innocence, Truth &amp; Family
Universal Law of Change
Universal Law of Life
Universal Law of Perception
Universal Law of Free Will
Universal Law of Judgement
Universal Law of Unification &amp; Unity
Universal Law of Love
      </p>
      <p>
       Spiritual Strength of Health &amp; Happiness
Spiritual Law of Man
Spiritual Law of Equality
Spiritual Freedom of Man
Spiritual Law of Choice
Spiritual Law of Karma
Spiritual Growth of Man
Spiritual Law of Healing
Spiritual Law of Protection
Spiritual Protection of Family
Spiritual Law of Future Sight

       I find that probably 95% of atheists have not seriously considered the arguments that theists are making, and talk down their noses out of an extreme sense of pride at their own pseudo-intellectualism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try reading Plato, Aristotle, and Aquinas' defenses of the existence of God. Most atheists aren't even familiar with BASIC philosophy of religion such as this.
