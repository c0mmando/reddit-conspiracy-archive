<p>Have you forgotten the heiarchy?</p>

<p>The globalists and social engineers of the elite still dictate and decide what these cunts at the CIA do. The CIA is simply an extension of the new world order, a &quot;vehicle&quot; that is used to shape global government and implement the new world order agenda under the guise of &quot;justified secrecy&quot;. </p>

<p>The CIA isn&#39;t some rogue entity, it&#39;s still a tool that the globalists use to consolidate and establish world government, Let&#39;s not lose sight of that. </p>

<p>TheY will often try to take control and install puppet dictators of 3rd world countries, to get them on a Rothschild owned bank. People who do this for the CIA are referred to as <strong>&quot;Economic hitmen&quot;</strong>. John Perkins, was one of them, and he discusses in detail below. Remember, global government is still the end goal. </p>

<p><strong>The Central Intelligence Agency, is an entity that is subservient to the global power structure.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is subservient to money. Money can buy an endless supply of mercenaries. Unlimited surveillance and a near unlimited black budget  has it&#39;s power to though. The BIS is the ultimate power but if I was on the board of  directors I&#39;d watch my back. Seems to currently be a stalemate.</p>
</div>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-3" data-depth="3" data-id="denlevm">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">n/a</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TimeBandit88.html">TimeBandit88</a> 2017-03-08</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Money isn&#39;t money though. Money is currency based on a lie, formerly a promise to be repaid in gold and silver, the last legally defined US dollar.</p>

<p>The power the BIS has relies upon its agents&#39; ability to conjure currency from nothing in order to trade it for labor that the serf class must perform in order to have a share.</p>

<p>That ability to conjure currency relies on faith and trust in the ability of the government backing that currency to repay its debt.</p>

<p>And that faith and trust can&#39;t be allowed to be shaken by a high &quot;price&quot; of gold, a competing currency. That would make the pig not look so pretty.</p>

<p>Even though price in dollars would have never been a thing at all if not for gold and silver bringing dollars into existence. That we use this vacuous proxy to measure the very thing responsible for its inception is not only ironic, but also illustrates how fragile the currency is.</p>

<p>And if a nation such as China or Russia, which have been buying gold hand over fist, decided to implement a gold backed currency - which wouldn&#39;t be surprising considering that China has a growing stake in the LBMA price fix that the CME stepped down from this week - the US would have to follow or risk losing global reserve currency status which is an option, but then the buying power of the dollar would subside and the US would have to default on its debt.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t see this as a stalemate. The Basel project has nearly run its course, and global debt slavery is in effect, but the west is not going to be the powerhouse it used to be. The military industrial complex is going to lose its ability to be funded without conjury, and I am much less concerned about mercs as I am about the zombies who will be roaming about when the welfare system can&#39;t be afforded.</p>
