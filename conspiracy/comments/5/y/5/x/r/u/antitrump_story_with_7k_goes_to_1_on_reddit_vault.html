<p>Sure they can post here. </p>

<p>My comment was in direct response to his claim that anyone &quot;right leaning&quot; on reddit is &quot;silenced.&quot; I pointed out it&#39;s not correct, with T_D as an example. That&#39;s not whataboutism - it&#39;s a direct counter-argument. </p>

<p>Then <em>you</em> came in all guns blazing about &quot;my&quot; terms and attacking my character by bringing up my posting history. Who&#39;s using whataboutism now?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s basically saying you can&#39;t openly talk about right-wing ideas without getting attacked on Reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, he <em>actually</em> said that reddit is doing all it can to silence anyone who&#39;s right-leaning, which is demonstrably untrue. That&#39;s an attempt to make a partisan point capture it as part of the pro-T_D narrative in r/conspiracy. The OP, and you, are doing exactly the same by claiming &quot;Reddit&#39;s attempt to hide the story&quot;, which could not be further from the truth when it&#39;s being discussed openly here and in multiple other subreddits. </p>

<p>he bombed the shit out the ME, because the US began invading the region in 2001, 8 years before he became president, and honestly what was the other options besides bombs? Boots on the ground? Yeah Americans loved having reservists and NG troops dying in Iraq, such a popular bush decision. </p>

<p>he didn&#39;t give cash to Iran, it was their cash returned to them after the sanctions were lifted.
trump actually has connections to the revolutionary guard but let&#39;s focus on Obama. </p>

<p>You think by now we would have heard from the guy who created this report, but hes just hiding!  Seeing as you brought up fake news, and now suggest it as evidence, is irony.

<p>Exactly. Most of the media has made themselves very transparently partisan - they gave Obama a pass on the economy (middle class suffered more than at any time since the great depression, most of America has less than $1000 (!!!) in savings,) on foreign policy (aiding and abetting ISIS by creating a power vacuum in Libya/Syria and encouraging the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;,) and on domestic policy (fucking wiretapping.) All very serious issues and were ignored. Media spent 8 years sucking Obama&#39;s dick 24/7.</p>

<p>Now with Trump they suddenly found their goddamn balls. </p>

<p>Above all else, above everything, when the people elected Trump it was a refutation of these people. The people who will make any excuse for a politician as long as they say the right things. The people who will run defense for a pseudo-totalitarian regime overseeing a crumbling and neutered middle class to push an agenda.</p>

<p>Fuck the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, remember how the media kept screaming and screaming that Hillary&#39;s victory was <em>such a sure thing</em>? This is a known political strategy to suppress voter turnout for an enemy candidate: frame your candidate as the underdog and the other candidate as the Big Bad ace in the hole. When people are sure &#39;their&#39; candidate will win no matter what, they&#39;re less likely to bother going to vote. This would be especially effective for people who weren&#39;t very enthusiastic about that candidate in the first place (probably 95% of Hillary voters). And when people are convinced &#39;their&#39; candidate is  likely to lose, they&#39;ll feel more eager to do their part to defeat the Big Bad and get out to the voting booths. We saw the same messaging in both the Brexit campaign and the 2016 election, with similar results. Whether it was intentional or not I don&#39;t know-- if it was, they&#39;re playing a trickier game than most of us mere mortals have any hopes of figuring out. But if the people controlling the media (and we know they&#39;re a very specific small group of people who all meet with each other) <em>really</em> wanted Hillary to win they should have framed it as a close race and had most people thinking that Trump&#39;s victory was a likely outcome, so better go out and vote if you don&#39;t like the sounds of that. The only person in the media who seemed to understand all this and spoke out about it was Michael Moore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone remembers the Mexico story, it was the justices department not Obama.</p>

<p>he bombed the shit out the ME, because the US began invading the region in 2001, 8 years before he became president, and honestly what was the other options besides bombs? Boots on the ground? Yeah Americans loved having reservists and NG troops dying in Iraq, such a popular bush decision. </p>

<p>he didn&#39;t give cash to Iran, it was their cash returned to them after the sanctions were lifted.
trump actually has connections to the revolutionary guard but let&#39;s focus on Obama. </p>

<p>maybe if you hadn&#39;t been skull fucked so hard by a big black dick, you wouldn&#39;t be so retarted and support trump while being so scared of Obama. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>i support trump, but also support being critical of government above all. this anti trump insanity would be ok, if there was equal criticism of the previous administration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. Most of the media has made themselves very transparently partisan - they gave Obama a pass on the economy (middle class suffered more than at any time since the great depression, most of America has less than $1000 (!!!) in savings,) on foreign policy (aiding and abetting ISIS by creating a power vacuum in Libya/Syria and encouraging the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;,) and on domestic policy (fucking wiretapping.) All very serious issues and were ignored. Media spent 8 years sucking Obama&#39;s dick 24/7.</p>

<p>Now with Trump they suddenly found their goddamn balls. </p>

<p>Above all else, above everything, when the people elected Trump it was a refutation of these people. The people who will make any excuse for a politician as long as they say the right things. The people who will run defense for a pseudo-totalitarian regime overseeing a crumbling and neutered middle class to push an agenda.</p>

<p>Fuck the media.</p>
