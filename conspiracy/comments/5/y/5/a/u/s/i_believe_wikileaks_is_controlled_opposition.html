       Wikileaks isn't telling us anything we don't already know.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if feels like, to me, is that Wikileaks is playing a role- just like Assange himself, Manning, and Snowden. The organization itself is not "good guys." There are no "good guys." Everyone in power, everyone in control- they aren't there because they are lucky or skilled. They are there because they can be controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything that is happening is theater. It's all a ruse. You're being controlled, told to look this direction, but pay no mind to the magician as he performs the real trick while you're distracted. Don't ignore these leaks, but don't hedge your bets on the toppling of the NWO just because Wikileaks posted a document about Japanese emoticons.

       Never get the answer to that, lots of claim to not trust wikileaks and they're comprised. I don't trust anyone 100% but I'm at like 90% with WL . I don't think they've been compromised but everyone has an agenda

       Trump is the only one I trust. He's clearly not a part of the machine. The deep state and the intelligence community (the permanent government, run by globalists and corporations and FUCKING PEDOS) are pulling out all the stops to discredit trump and his presidency. I was at the hospital visiting my grandfather today all day long they had the TV on CNN. Not ONE time were these leaks mentioned. All they're pushing is Russia Russia Russia. What a fucking joke.

       How exactly does that "not benefit the elites"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites don't give a shit about illegal immigration, either way. Work for them in the US, or work for them in Mexico. It makes no difference to them.

      <p>
       The only thing that has changed is now you see a billionaire as being on your side, rather than being one of the elites - all due to nothing more than some big talk about an issue they never gave a shit about anyway.

       It's about the bigger picture and the every day news consumer.  They are slow releasing to break the bubble slowly with more and more intensifying leaks.

       It's a huge game for the minds of the status quo and they are playing carefully against the MSM bias.

       Agreed - wikileaks has also never released anything related to actual major political or terror events as far as I know - does anyone else know differently?  nothing on 9/11, Paris, Boston Bombing, chemtrails, no big corruption busts, nothing of that nature -  mostly just bizarre announcements about the deep state surveillance that we've already known about for years if not decades like you said in the title - and e-mail leaks that take hours upon hours of sifting through to get any actionable intelligence.  Whole thing screams honeypot to me too.

       To be fair, anything on 9/11 or the such is not likely to have been passed around using normal channels, nor stored on the normal CIA servers. Whoever leaked this had access to stuff that hundreds or thousands of CIA employees have access to. Quite sure that 9/11 never had that kind of distribution.

       The only device I have in my home that's always on is my cell... Though that's really all they'd need. It's a s7 edge and the mother fucker is basically attached to my hip 24/7. I never got a smart TV. There's no way I'd ever get that echo or dot or whatever. I never even hooked up my kinnect. This shit is sickening. Makes me want to just go live off grid somewhere.

       Here is something you might not have known:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1985, Wim van Eck published the first unclassified technical analysis of the security risks of emanations from computer monitors. This paper caused some consternation in the security community, which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments; van Eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system, at a range of hundreds of metres, using just $15 worth of equipment plus a television set.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a consequence of this research, such emanations are sometimes called "van Eck radiation", and the eavesdropping technique van Eck phreaking, although government researchers were already aware of the danger, as Bell Labs noted this vulnerability to secure teleprinter communications during World War II and was able to produce 75% of the plaintext being processed in a secure facility from a distance of 80 feet.[16] Additionally the NSA published Tempest Fundamentals, NSA-82-89, NACSIM 5000, National Security Agency (Classified) on February 1, 1982. In addition, the van Eck technique was successfully demonstrated to non-TEMPEST personnel in Korea during the Korean War in the 1950s.

       If it is electronic, it emits radiation. If it emits radiation, what it is doing can be reconstructed from its emissions. This is not even new technology.

       The largest impact I see due to this is how we will go forward with securing our data. Whether you are a company that deals with HIPA or proprietary information/software this will effect your bottom line.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the consumer level, this information means that the US government has allowed the network infrastructure to be compromised in order to gain intelligence. You might not be a target of the CIA or NSA but now there's hundreds of zero day vulnerabilities waiting for hackers to discover and use.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone gets their hands on the hacking tools that are part of this leak they can be reverse engineered to find the vulnerabilities. If you thought identity theft or electronic theft was bad now there's a strong possibility that the issue will become an albatross we can't fix.

       <em>

        The idea behind Year Zero is that all culture and traditions within a society must be completely destroyed or discarded and a new revolutionary culture must replace it, starting from scratch. All history of a nation or people before Year Zero is deemed largely irrelevant, as it will ideally be purged and replaced from the ground up.

       Yes, these stuff are known to people like you and I for years, from many sources, as well as from inferring known information.

       However, this does not mean that it's not worth publishing and making a big deal out of it. Before this, we're called "crazy tin foil hat conspiritards". After the Vault 7 reveal, talk about CIA/NSA spying is called talking about "well established facts".

       Agreed. 
Did this latest release tell us anything at all that we didn't already know? 
This is just Snowden take two. Where is the good stuff? And there is good stuff. It's too bad. I held out hope for Wikileaks and Assange.
