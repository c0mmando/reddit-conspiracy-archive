<p>What if feels like, to me, is that Wikileaks is playing a role- just like Assange himself, Manning, and Snowden. The organization itself is not &quot;good guys.&quot; There are no &quot;good guys.&quot; Everyone in power, everyone in control- they aren&#39;t there because they are lucky or skilled. They are there because they can be controlled. </p>

<p>Everything that is happening is theater. It&#39;s all a ruse. You&#39;re being controlled, told to look this direction, but pay no mind to the magician as he performs the real trick while you&#39;re distracted. Don&#39;t ignore these leaks, but don&#39;t hedge your bets on the toppling of the NWO just because Wikileaks posted a document about Japanese emoticons.</p>

<p>How exactly does that &quot;not benefit the elites&quot;?</p>

<p>The elites don&#39;t give a shit about illegal immigration, either way. Work for them in the US, or work for them in Mexico. It makes no difference to them.</p>

<p>The only thing that has changed is now you see a billionaire as being on your side, rather than being one of the elites - all due to nothing more than some big talk about an issue they never gave a shit about anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed - wikileaks has also never released anything related to actual major political or terror events as far as I know - does anyone else know differently?  nothing on 9/11, Paris, Boston Bombing, chemtrails, no big corruption busts, nothing of that nature -  mostly just bizarre announcements about the deep state surveillance that we&#39;ve already known about for years if not decades like you said in the title - and e-mail leaks that take hours upon hours of sifting through to get any actionable intelligence.

<p>Here is something you might not have known:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1985, Wim van Eck published the first unclassified technical analysis of the security risks of emanations from computer monitors. This paper caused some consternation in the security community, which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments; van Eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system, at a range of hundreds of metres, using just $15 worth of equipment plus a television set.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this research, such emanations are sometimes called &quot;van Eck radiation&quot;, and the eavesdropping technique van Eck phreaking, although government researchers were already aware of the danger, as Bell Labs noted this vulnerability to secure teleprinter communications during World War II and was able to produce 75% of the plaintext being processed in a secure facility from a distance of 80 feet.[16] Additionally the NSA published Tempest Fundamentals, NSA-82-89, NACSIM 5000, National Security Agency (Classified) on February 1, 1982. In addition, the van Eck technique was successfully demonstrated to non-TEMPEST personnel in Korea during the Korean War in the 1950s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_(codename)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_(codename)</a></p>

<p>If it is electronic, it emits radiation. If it emits radiation, what it is doing can be reconstructed from its emissions. This is not even new technology.</p>

<p>Even that dumb TV can give away information about you.</p>

<p>On the consumer level, this information means that the US government has allowed the network infrastructure to be compromised in order to gain intelligence. You might not be a target of the CIA or NSA but now there&#39;s hundreds of zero day vulnerabilities waiting for hackers to discover and use.</p>

<p>If someone gets their hands on the hacking tools that are part of this leak they can be reverse engineered to find the vulnerabilities. If you thought identity theft or electronic theft was bad now there&#39;s a strong possibility that the issue will become an albatross we can&#39;t fix. </p>
