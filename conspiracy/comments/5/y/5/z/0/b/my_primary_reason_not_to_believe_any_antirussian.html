        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When Russia hosted the Olympics I watched as a completely new sort of propaganda began to be spun against them by western media sources. It was obvious and deliberate, but at the time I had no idea why it was being done. Articles that were essentially &quot;Russia = bad because ____ &quot; started popping up everywhere, and I remember thinking &quot;Wait, why do we care about Russia all of a sudden? Where the heck is this coming from? Why not articles that read &#39;Saudi Arabia = bad because be-headings and oppressing women&#39;.&quot;  </p>

<p>This was long before Trump was being discussed at all. </p>

<p>So whenever I see a new post on this sub about &quot;But Russia did ect ect, this proves it and Trump is bad now&quot;, I just can&#39;t buy it, because that narrative was being spun long before he was running for president.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been a Trump supporter, never been a Hillary supporter either. Big time supporter of the truth though, and big time opponent of bullshit, and this anti-Russian propaganda 100% bullshit, and anyone with a decent nose can smell it. </p>

<p>Probably something that was in place before they hosted it. If I was going to run a campaign like that I&#39;d definitely do it when the world&#39;s eyes were on a particular nation. Just makes sense from a sort of &quot;business&quot; perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know much about the whole drug testing thing. </p>

<p>What I do know is that when the initial report was released to the public by the FBI about their proof of Russian sourced malware being placed on the DNC computers, it was crazy amounts of bullshit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m no elite hacker. I&#39;m just your average idiot who grew up as a computer nerd. And reading through that report I was like &quot;Yeah, but...you can easily spoof your IP. Essentially Kali Linux could do all of this. and as far as the compiler time-stamps, that could either be faked, or you could just have a simple trojan on some Russian computer and use them to compile the code.&quot;</p>

<p>I wrote a big post about it to my own facebook wall explaining step by step how I myself could have done basically the same thing and made it look like it came from a specific country, which led me to two conclusions: either me, your regular average joe fuck head who grew up a computer nerd is smarter than the Russian intelligence agencies, or, Russia deliberately and purposely performed this attack with the intent that it would be traced back to them.</p>

<p>Of course, the third option is that someone else did it and tried to pin it on them. But that&#39;s just crazy conspiracy talk now isn&#39;t it. :p </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. I first noticed it with the &quot;Russia treats gay people badly&quot; articles. Which I&#39;m not going to dispute. But it stuck out to me as odd, because before then, I wasn&#39;t reading any articles about Russia. Regarding anything. At all. And when I began to see publications suddenly talking about them, I wondered why. It stuck out.</p>

<p>Why are publications not speaking out against how gay people are treated in Saudi Arabia? It&#39;s an actual crime to be gay in Saudi Arabia. A legitimate crime, in the law books. Not to mention the fact that women aren&#39;t even allowed to drive. That is a crime as well. And that has been going on for a very, very long time. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not singling out Saudi Arabia purposely, I&#39;m just using that nation as a contrasting example because they are a trade nation with the US. Neither am I defending Russian policy or legislation. I&#39;m simply stating that I&#39;ve been watching the anti-Russian narrative be spun for a long time now, so when I see it attached to Trump, all I can think is &quot;Well, that would have been attached to anyone who was elected into office who was not going along with whoever was spinning it in the first place.&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on reddit for a very long time, on and off, under various accounts, and only recently did I decide to post again. </p>

<p>By and large, discussing anything here is pointless, because this site is so popular, and so influenced, and this is an example. </p>

<p>Have conversations with like minded people off site. Don&#39;t engage too much with the comment section. I watched reddit go from free public discourse to being a place that has a very close eye placed on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that people have political allegiances, but I don&#39;t think we need to have those any more. I mean, to the person who goes by the username &quot;enough_trump_spam&quot;, if I met with you in person in a coffee shop, we could likely have a conversation together. I mean, why not? Just because your username indicates you are highly anti Trump doesn&#39;t mean that I have to treat you poorly. I&#39;m not pro Trump at all, but let&#39;s just say that I was. I still wouldn&#39;t have to treat you as a bad person because of it. </p>

<p>A lot of this diversionary political bullshit is just that: bullshit. I get hat everyone these days wants to put everyone else into a &quot;side&quot;, but I myself am just not gonna play by that. </p>

<p>You can put yourself into whatever side you want. And you can try to put me into whatever side you want. I&#39;m still gonna say &quot;I have no sides&quot; and try to approach you as a damned human and engage with you in whatever meaningful way I&#39;m able to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interestingly, the &quot;Russia hates gays&quot; and the notorious &quot;Russian anti-gay laws&quot; are also a load of propaganda.</p>

<p>I found this way back when this stuff started being pumped out:</p>

<p>And of course, at the time, whenever I posted this paper to reddit I was accused of being &quot;paid by Putin&quot; and all kinds of other nonsense.</p>

<p>Seriously, you should give it a read, even a ten minute skim. It is mind-blowing.</p>

<p>Aside from that though, I really just made this post to express how I saw the anti-russian propaganda campaign develop and progress, and why I don&#39;t accept the new posts about it being directly attached to Trump. I mean, sure, fuck Trump. After he was elected though, I saw the anti-Russian thing die for a few weeks, and then it started right back up again. </p>

<p>There&#39;s some group out there who have been cultivating this anti-russian thing for ages. I don&#39;t completely know why yet to be honest, I just know what I&#39;ve been seeing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what&#39;s the motive behind Trump working with Russia in the first place? That&#39;s what bothers me about this whole situation. There&#39;s nothing logical I can think of that puts Trump in a position where he would risk his HUGE FUCKING EGO and NAMESAKE while president.</p>

<p>Do you really think he would work with Russia in order to win the election after being so blustery about it being rigged?</p>

<p>This is a person who runs a business. He understands risk/reward. It doesn&#39;t make sense to me that he&#39;s the type of person who would wreck his presidency with the possibility of being named a traitor.</p>

<p>And that brings me to my next point.</p>

<p>Trump portrays himself as a patriot... His base is nationalist and hardcore patriots. He&#39;d be completely alienating his base if he were to be involved with Russia.. But this is the exact propaganda needed to target and turn his base. Coincidence? Maybe, but not likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to reiterate that for me, personally, I have absolutely no political allegiance. I don&#39;t vote anymore. I would not have voted for Trump, and I would not have voted for Hillary. I feel that something very new needs to be developed and cultivated for our society to progress past this point of self destruction, hierarchy, and nonsense.</p>

<p>Trump is an oddity though. It feels like he was never meant to win, and yet he did. That seems to me like an anomaly that was against some sort of &quot;plan&quot; that other very powerful groups had. I&#39;ve never before seen a campaign so concentrated on usurping or disrupting a president. That feels very off to me. I did not see the &quot;democrats&quot; do with with Bush, and I did not see the &quot;Republicans&quot; do this with Obama. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t support Trump. Quite frankly a lot of his policies seem bizarre. That whole wall thing is rather strange, and some of the people he has appointed to cabinet are people I never, ever would want to see in positions of power. I can say that I wouldn&#39;t trust Donald Trump any more than I would trust Donald Trump.   </p>

<p>But that said, I am still seeing a very concentrated campaign to discredit, attack, and usurp him, unlike anything I have seen before in my lifetime, or studied in history. I don&#39;t have to support the man to recognize the levels of media concentration, and likely manipulation, which are being used right now against a democratic process. This is a push back that isn&#39;t just some grassroots movement. This is something new, and to me, feels like an act of desperation. </p>

<p>For some reason, this man/administration/cabinet poses a threat to some very powerful people. I don&#39;t know fully why. All I know is what I am seeing. I don&#39;t believe Trump is some sort of savior, I don&#39;t believe he is some sort of political hero, but what I am seeing is evidence of the fact that him being in office is threatening to someone else. I could speculate as to why that is, but the reality right now is, that, for some reason, it is.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Right there with you. I didn&#39;t like him before the elections and still don&#39;t like him. But someone would have to be deaf dumb and blind not to see that there&#39;s some very powerful people pulling strings in order to take him out of office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been pretty strange to watch. </p>

<p>I still have friends who were for one &quot;side&quot; or another, and other friends who are like &quot;Now wait a second, I didn&#39;t like the the bastard, but what the hell is all this shit&quot;.</p>

<p>Weird days to be alive man. Keep a clear head. Never take a &quot;side&quot;. Instead, try to find ideas that bring divided people together. I mean, really, if we all come together, that&#39;s gonna be the next stage of our evolution. Imagine a world where we pool all our resources, technology, and efforts together. That&#39;s a world where we conquer disease, and maybe even death, and start expanding out into the universe.</p>

<p>Seems like the natural progression a species should be making. If we can get past this whole &quot;No, I CONTROL this! <em>opposing side</em> Noooooo, IIII CONTROL THIS! <em>insert a thousand years of death here</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>Hopefully we&#39;ll all learn someday that we&#39;re all one, and that what&#39;s good for you, is good for me as well.</p>
