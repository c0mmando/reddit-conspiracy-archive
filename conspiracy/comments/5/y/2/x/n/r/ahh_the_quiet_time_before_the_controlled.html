       I was under the impression they were right on time. Have you seen all of the people claiming there is nothing new to these leaks? How about all of the people claiming wikileaks is biased against the democrats? I saw a guy claim wikileaks is antisemitic. They are attacking the source and claiming there is nothing to the leaks.

       We should head them off at the pass by making a talking points sub; and come up with all of their bullshit reactions before they get a chance to.

       I know what happened. Someone at Share Blue looked at the choices for automated bot responses and said:

       What new script? I just watched this video about Ron Paul and NSA Whistleblowers:

       From that, it seems obvious to me that the CIA could and would spy on Trump, for one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was always suspicious of the Russian connection with Trump (since I was rabidly anti-Hillary, but never actually pro-Trump), but based on the way things have been going since Trump was elected, I no longer have many doubts about some sort of Russian connection to Trump and interference with the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Vault7 goes, I haven't checked it out yet, but is there something in there other than CIA's unending meddling in everything since they killed JFK? I already know they are up to no good and meddle in everything. It's not going to convince me they're just lying about a Russian connection at this point.

if you're saying ctr presence and their scripted responses is not real, then that's where the disagreement would be.

       I was bernie all the way, and NeverHillaryNeverTrump.  At no point did I feel Russia was ever a threat, since every "MSM Russian Involvement" narrative was only reactionary to topics of...
wikileaks, hacks, real journalism, bernie blackouts, bernie's popularity, election fraud, voter suppression, exit poll results, trump's popularity, trump's win, hillary's criticism/failure/health/scandal/bill/podesta/epstein/pizza/history".  It was like clockwork and it still is.

       Yeah, I didn't feel like Russia was a threat (often I used to point out Putin made sense in his criticism of America and our media false reporting about the middle east) and when Trump said it would be good to be on friendly terms with Russia, I agreed that made sense, too. But, since Trump became President, it seems many people connected to Trump have in fact been talking to Russia and lied about it for some reason. Trump's bizarre accusations make him look guilty, imo, since he always goes on the offense as the best defense and usually his offense is as over-the-top as his latest comments about Obama.
      </p>

       It was only recently, after the continual info from intelligence, apparently, well past the election that I began to believe there must be some Russian connection that they are being very careful with so they don't fuck up whatever case they're making. It seems unlikely that the CIA would make a false case against Trump as he's in office rather than just assassinate him. What's the backup? Someone has to act as President. If the Trump-Pence win is ruled a fraud, who serves? If the CIA was going to do anything bogus like this, I'm pretty sure they would have done it before the election.

       I agree.  I can definitely disaggregate those those who "want to make people" think. and those using disinformation/censoring tactics.  I'm for it all to be out there, to everyone.. force a culture of critical thinkers!
