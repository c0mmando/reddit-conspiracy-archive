       You implied I was ignorant on your very first comment. What kind of respect is that? Then you imply again that I've said something along the lines of 'knowing everything that's going on', and tell me to 'get over myself'. You're being incredibly rude and attacking someone's opinion just because you don't agree with it. My opinion stands: We cannot legally overthrow the CIA with the current judicial system in place. It won't happen. We just saw a released diagram that shows the CIA at least considers themselves to be controlling the executive office.

       I think rudeness is a tool. Ignorance is a choice. Your mindset from your original comment is the reason why things are this way and the reasoning behind the world maintaining it's shitty position. "It's not possible" is an absolute and ignorant response. You made the decision to respond to a post with something that is neither constructive nor true, you should "get over yourself" because your choice to remain ignorant is making life harder.

       I get it. You only post spam in r/sweepstakes and then all of the sudden you're here on r/conspiracy harassing me in particular. Maybe because of the comment I posted earlier about the CIA? Or maybe just to discredit r/conspiracy in general. Either way, no regular user would go to such lengths to continue an argument like this. Especially after I tried to reconcile with you. You're too obvious, try harder.

       You get it? I don't think you get anything. You think if I was a shill I'd probably avoid trying to win free stuff on the internet? Wouldn't that undermine the "mission". You are an ignorant and narcissistic fool. You have no idea what you are talking about in regards to most things. What lengths have I gone to? I was never having an argument because I already know you are wrong. You will continue to be wrong because you hold your own opinion and self-importance above everything else. You are oblivious, try harder.

       Speaking in absolutes is ignorant. Ignorance is a choice and opinions are informed by our choices. My attempt to inform you of this was met with reasoning that only reinforced my opinion that you are stubborn, self-absorbed and ignorant.

       If you think "get over yourself" is an attack, then maybe some self-reflection is necessary. Get over your cognitive bias, get over your choice to remain ignorant, get over your belief that anyone trying to correct you is attacking you, get over the need to respond in anger and try to center your beliefs on facts vs. feelings, get over yourself.

       Lol wow, those are some serious assumptions and commands. I figured a logical guy like you wouldn't devolve yourself into such logical fallacies and straight up telling others how to live.

      <p>
       Even though you didn't and haven't contributed to the discussion other than to attack me, I'll debunk your silly notion that I'm ignorant and proclaiming absolutes. There was context provided by the OP that he was clearly referencing a judicial and legal process to remove the CIA and not referencing "all possible options". Therefore it wasn't an absolute. There are certainly less than legal means to destroy an agency as I'm sure many users here would agree could be possible.

       They actually said "legislative" responses. Congress can legislate against providing material support to the CIA, this is one legislative response.

       The capacity is definately there... If you look at it from a view of record everything and use a google like network to scan through everything with deep learning algorithms and prioritize information in a searchable database that can be THEN assessed and accessed by real personell... Who can then use other algoriths/ programs/ tools to isolate ALL relevant access and information... Basically all the info is there but only filtered and viewed by someone who is made aware of a 'flag'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternately, if a target person/ organization is identified of interest, algorithms can be used to auto collect potentially relevant previously collected info. And then a person can look at the info and suggest other inquiries...
      </p>
      <p>
       At least this is how a tech buddy of mine hypothesises a system like this would work...
      </p>
      <p>
       And considering that windows and google and the cloud are all part of a cia backdoor network... The 3 letter oganizations merely have to have these companies maintain their databases for them... Its like using all the major tech companies as unwitting dummy/ front corporations to do the heavy work for them.

       Well, we're cornered. The leverage it's been revealed they have is one of privacy. Regardless of whether or not you have something to hide, nothing is hidden. We're dependent on the devices they're using to spy, and functionally speaking there's no getting that privacy back. So there must be a turn among the majority from keeping secrets to refusing them. A shift to loving oneself and others for who we actually are rather than we project ourselves to be. Unconditional ubiquitous openness and love takes away the leverage these people have.
      </p>

       There's still the matter of all the other stuff they do, but this is a start.

       In truth... You cant. Organizations like this have and always will exist. Officially state sponsored or not. What you CAN do is educate yourself. Learn about how the world REALLY opporates, raise awareness, and act/ protect yourself accordingly. You can make it more difficult to opporate, but like the drug war, it only pushes it into the shadows and less accountable. The truth is, as much as i hate to admit it, in the world we live in... This CANT be stopped all together, and while there is potential for abuse, it is also neccessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best we're going to get is awareness and reaction accordingly... Unless you want to live in a cabin off the grid without electrity... &gt;___&gt;
