<p>If you think &quot;get over yourself&quot; is an attack, then maybe some self-reflection is necessary. Get over your cognitive bias, get over your choice to remain ignorant, get over your belief that anyone trying to correct you is attacking you, get over the need to respond in anger and try to center your beliefs on facts vs. feelings, get over yourself. </p>

<p>Even though you didn&#39;t and haven&#39;t contributed to the discussion other than to attack me, I&#39;ll debunk your silly notion that I&#39;m ignorant and proclaiming absolutes. There was context provided by the OP that he was clearly referencing a judicial and legal process to remove the CIA and not referencing &quot;all possible options&quot;. Therefore it wasn&#39;t an absolute. There are certainly less than legal means to destroy an agency as I&#39;m sure many users here would agree could be possible.</p>

Basically all the info is there but only filtered and viewed by someone who is made aware of a &#39;flag&#39;.</p>

<p>Alternately, if a target person/ organization is identified of interest, algorithms can be used to auto collect potentially relevant previously collected info. And then a person can look at the info and suggest other inquiries...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we&#39;re cornered. The leverage it&#39;s been revealed they have is one of privacy. Regardless of whether or not you have something to hide, nothing is hidden. We&#39;re dependent on the devices they&#39;re using to spy, and functionally speaking there&#39;s no getting that privacy back. So there must be a turn among the majority from keeping secrets to refusing them. A shift to loving oneself and others for who we actually are rather than we project ourselves to be. Unconditional ubiquitous openness and love takes away the leverage these people have. </p>

<p>There&#39;s still the matter of all the other stuff they do, but this is a start.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In truth... You cant. Organizations like this have and always will exist. Officially state sponsored or not. What you CAN do is educate yourself. Learn about how the world REALLY opporates, raise awareness, and act/ protect yourself accordingly. You can make it more difficult to opporate, but like the drug war, it only pushes it into the shadows and less accountable. The truth is, as much as i hate to admit it, in the world we live in... This CANT be stopped all together, and while there is potential for abuse, it is also neccessary. </p>

<p>The best we&#39;re going to get is awareness and reaction accordingly... Unless you want to live in a cabin off the grid without electrity... &gt;___&gt;</p>
