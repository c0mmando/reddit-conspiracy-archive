    <div class="md"><p>What? If people think that they deserve this shit. There are ways to make changes. Sitting and accepting things isn&#39;t how we change things either. Maybe we should like you say, march to fucking Virginia. Maybe we should grab our pitchforks.

<p>I think we should all actually start talking about measures we can take here. This is beyond fucking ridiculous. Privacy should hold more importance to people, and OP is right.. people who don&#39;t care about this are fucking dumb. </p>

<p>Um no. I can&#39;t believe this is even a suggestion tbh. We need a complete rework of our government, CIA, NSA, ect. We need a complete rework of the media too. I don&#39;t think the suggestion should be to bend over and take it. I think we should be pushing people to start discussing what we can do to fix all of this. If that fix is </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The powerful have achieved a level to where they can&#39;t be brought down.  It went from the people are the government to the people vs the government.  Over the last maybe 75 years the people lost.   The government has all the power, the rich have all the money and resources.  Now their systematically dumbing us down, paying us less, inflating what money we do have to make it worth less, slaving us to a job, drowning most in debt, your working more hours for less money while producing more.  They have you from every angle already surrounded.  So bold now they can blatantly violate the constitution with no accountability.  You may have the illusion of choice in your life, but there is none.  They&#39;ve already chosen for you.  So, either bend over and take it and live your life the best you can, or commit &quot;suicide&quot; with 2 gun shots to the back of your head if you get to be any bit of a threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes your right be angry, but the CIA isn&#39;t the only source of this problem. </p>

<p>Even with the CIA gone will the monitoring really stop? I think we need a full overhaul. Which has kinda the idea for a while now.</p>

<p>Glad to see the need to support but remember we are on the side of taking down the establishment as well. We need action. We need someone to lead us into action.  </p>

<p>Times have changed and so has technology. Do you think the public can really go up against this tyranny? We would be destroyed in seconds by some technology we didn&#39;t even know existed. They have completed all the steps to ultimately render us as cattle. </p>

<p>The reality is that the constitution is going out the window and most Americans do not care. This is exactly what they wanted. For all your friends on FB to not give a shit. As long as the rent is payed and there is food on the table. What do you expect people to do? There is too much division for this country to come together as a whole. Wether it be political, sports, music, anything. Division is so deeply rooted that unity almost ceases to exist. </p>

<p>With the help of the internet a lot of people are being awoken to this tyranny. It&#39;s just hard to release yourself from the grasp of manipulation, that&#39;s why I think most people on Facebook are so passive about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easily we could if there were real structure behind it..  I was in the US Army as an infantry soldier.  I wouldn&#39;t fire on US citizens, even if I didn&#39;t agree with their stance.. most soldiers would be the same.  The fact that not enough people are willing to stand up diminishes the seriousness of the position.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If God is real and he&#39;s watching everything you do all the time, are you comfortable with that idea?  The new-agers think that we&#39;ll soon be ascending into a realm where there are no secrets, everyone and everyone&#39;s past incarnations will be an open book.   Would this scenario bother you too?   Obviously, most of us with our heads screwed on straight value our privacy in our current reality, but it doesn&#39;t seem like anyone&#39;s willing to actually fight for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell them that acoording to the recent leaks the Government is working on a system that will require every citzen to allow the government to know how many guns they own, the type of guns owned, and how much ammo is in the house. Every gun owner must comply with allowing the government in to their home and submit to a fire arms audit.  Anything found in their home, regardless of whether or not it is firearm related can be used to prosecute the citizen of any related crime.</p>

<p>As part of this program, citizens can only use their firearms after they let the government know when, where, and why the are going to use them.  Also tell them, that the government plans to have the ablity to identify areas that may have terrorist attacks and citizens will be required to turn their guns in, so the bad guys don&#39;t get the guns and kill Americans.</p>

<p>When people express they have a problem with this, then remind them that they are good Americans who didnt have a problem with losing the 4th and 5th Amendments, so since they have nothing to hide from the government let them take the 2nd Amendment also. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you mean. Alot of people outside of conspiracy circles don&#39;t give a flying fuck. They don&#39;t really see past their own selfish interests. Someone said to me today that they&#39;re happy we&#39;re being spied on because &quot;look at 9/11, that would&#39;ve been prevented&quot;. </p>
