       Oh what - you mean the purveyors of fake news?  The
       <del>
        MSM
       </del>
       FNM (Fake News Media)?  Really?  You think they're going to be the ones that actually put forward truth tellers working to bring
       <em>
        down
       </em>
       the very system that they (the FNM) fight so diligently everyday to prop up and keep alive and active?
      </p>
      <p>
       Won't happen that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I 100% agree with your first sentence - Now would be a great time for people who were forced to stay quiet to start coming out of the woodwork. - but it won't be through the FNM that the message will be spread.  It'll be through the ASM (Alternative Stream Media).  It's just a question of inundating the public consciousness with the information so that EVERYBODY gets it and no one can deny it.  At that point it won't matter if the information doesn't come out on the FNM or not because everyone'll know what the truth is regardless and the FNM will go down and away on its own - like an wart that gets old, dries up, and sloughs off over time.

       Sure we will still get disinfo but if everyone is coming forward patterns will emerge I believe.

       I agree.  Disinfo and shills will, of course, continue.  However, if the information flow simply keeps coming and refuses to stop or be deterred, the direction of that truth will eventually win out.  Sort of like a river:  Once the river of truth starts really flowing, the mud and sediment that shills will try to throw on it to stop that flow will not be enough, and the momentum of the information will simply keep flowing forward independent of their attempts.

       Let's say some scientist who worked on black projects came forward. If they provide solid scientific information to support their claims.. or let's say someone came forward about 9-11. They provide info that shows how 9-11 was really orchestrated. It will take detective work. Some things may not be capable of being proven though...

       Excellent idea, this forum is too public for anything to happen to you. It's too indexed, archived, and watched for a post to truly disappear. I know off the top of my head at least 2 site wide copies that are public. There are other tools such as
       <a href="/r/uncensored">
        /r/uncensored
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It will get seen, no doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take reasonable steps to remain anonymous, you should be fine. Burner device, no sims, public wifi, only put battery into device once you are ready to send info, don't turn on device close to your residence or in the presence of your personal devices, no thumbdrive usb transfer. Preferably take pictures of actual documents and upload and release communicado. Don't take pictures of documents you printed with a personal printer.
