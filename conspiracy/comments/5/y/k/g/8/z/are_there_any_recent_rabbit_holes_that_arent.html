    <div class="md"><p>Marine Captain Randy Cramer was authorized by his superiors in the deep state a few recent years ago to come out and begin releasing information about his involvement in space and interstellar operations he was involved in and that have been ongoing since the 1950s - operations that sent him and a cadre of humans that were genetically enhanced in utero to various planets in the solar system, particularly Mars, in order to protect a population of humans <em>already</em> living on the planet.  Protect them from what, you may ask?  Well, from the indigenous species native to the planet that have already been living there for millions of years, and that are in many ways far more intelligent than human beings.</p>

<p>Wrap your mind around <em>that</em> shit.</p>

<p>Oh.  And by the way.  Since Captain Cramer came out with his information, there have been others that have also come forward corroborating his testimony - namely Tony Rodriguez and his interviews regarding his involvement in The Secret Space Program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Holy shit is right.  My reaction exactly.  What actually really made me go <strong>O_o</strong> after listening to him and know that this is information that&#39;s on another level than just some regular shmo coming out and spinning wild crazy tales like anyone else who may or may not be believed, is when I heard him say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2r_ZpYaNwi8&amp;amp;t=41m37s">this</a> and then I looked it up and actually found him to be <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ucmj+impersonating+an+officer&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8">correct about it.</a></p>

<p>Once you really stop and wrap your mind around the fact that there&#39;s a very real possibility that this man is actually telling the truth about everything he said he experienced, then <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joeydevilla.com%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F04%2Fmind-blown.gif&amp;amp;f=1">shit just goes boom.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It makes what Captain Cramer says have a lot more veracity is what it does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To me that sounds more like controlled disinformation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you’re saying that the “model of space we are told” is <em>not</em> like what Captain Cramer and many others have stated?  So what <em>is</em> a “correct” model of space to you then?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It sounds like a great story which is even more suspect and encourages belief in the accepted space construct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you actually <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ykg8z/are_there_any_recent_rabbit_holes_that_arent/derk4uf/">look into what he’s said</a>, then you’d realize that what you just said here is less and less sound and accurate actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And of course it is coming directly from the military - to me that&#39;s a redflag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, if you actually look into and do some real research into what Captain Cramer has said over and over again, you’d realize that there is an active war going on between various elite forces on the planet - some whom want disclosure, some whom don’t.  He happens to represent the side that wants disclosure, so he and his superiors are actively pushing back for it.</p>

<p>I don’t understand how that’s so hard to validate.</p>

<p>Thinking critically about the dynamics of world domination, battles going on, etc means that one understands that there are some forces that have agendas that are more against the population, and others have agendas that are more in line with the educating of the citizenry.</p>

<p>Captain Cramer has thus far demonstrated that he seems to be in line with the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why should we trust this Cramer guy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s like you’re not even making an attempt to be intelligent and critically minded.  Did you click the link?  If I said “Murder can get you prison time” and your response was <em>“Why should I believe what you’re saying?  Those are just, like, your words, man.”</em>  I would say that it has nothing to do with what I’m saying.  I’m just repeating what the law itself says.  It’s not going by my word.  It’s going by an external source and statute.</p>

<p>Same w/Cramer.  The statute <em>does</em> in fact say that if he’s lying about his being in the military and his what he did while in it, he would indeed be breaking the law and subject to criminal prosecution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does he think the moon landing was real?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a <em>LOT</em> the citizens aren’t told about.  The “moon landing” that the rest of the world was told about might not have been real, but there’s a shit ton of evidence showing that <em>many other</em> moon landings have happened…landings on the moon and landings on a lot of other different moons and planets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does he say that nasa is a scam?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He doesn’t have to.  He says that the entire scientific and medical profession of this planet is a scam.  That includes NASA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because we can objectively identify that both of these things have more evidence than the contrary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have been conditioned in your life to look upon only certain “trusted” sources as those you should believe give you “proper” evidence.  What they tell you, you believe.</p>

<p>Many of those sources are not as valid as you are led to believe they are.</p>

<p>This video is amazing, it&#39;s short, 13minutes, but mind blowing. You have to watch to the end. Don&#39;t be deterred by some of the numbers, it&#39;s mostly just trying to show the odd coincidence of the hidden information.</p>
