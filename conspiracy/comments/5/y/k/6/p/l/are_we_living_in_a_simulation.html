       Think about it.... May take a joint (or two - depending on the weed), some shrooms, or a nice tall glass of absinthe (ie. mind altering substances) to acknowledge or think about it, truly.

       If we live in a simulation, it's really 15/35/50. You either go off the deep end, realize it's a possibility but you have no control either way, or completely write it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in the 35 range. It's there in the back of my mind. It's a mind fuck, truly. But, those in the 15 range will go off the deep end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, truly and honestly... You have to be a strong mofo (mentally) to live somewhat "normally", knowing we could be in a simulation (everything we know has been a lie - what the fuck do we know and why are we simulated). Some people lose their shit about this, go totally recluse and break down (hence: I've seen this).

       I truly don't see what difference does it make. If the physical laws are  defined by complex but fixed functions or by some algorithm whose complete nature we can't fully grasp. Neither model tells us about what's outside or our true nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have the suspicion that this is just used as a tender for some philosophical war between imagined "atheists" about random creation and gnostics proof for "God". But what it might be really about is who will rule the mind sphere in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. IMHO they can put their meaningless debate who's right or wrong where the sun doesn't shine as I don't wanna be ruled by neither, says the agnostic.

       I'm one of the most open minded people probably on this board who is vocal. I disagree with modern "psychiatry" in regards to schizos, but... This topic, if not prepared (mentally) can go many ways. Mainly it was merely a "PSA".. Take it however you want..

       Here's a thought: if you had been somehow mind-mapped, and a full replica of your consciousness uploaded to a simulation, (assuming the technology existed), and the original you was killed, you could be existing as that replicated consciousness, and never know the difference.

       That's a hell of a leap, why don't you walk everyone through how you get from reality is a simulation/machine to people have the power to create their own reality, drugs can interfere, and abdicating your ability to control that reality.  I don't think most people here get that yet based on the comments and you are right.  I think most people assume the answers to why are unknowable and think no further.

       step one: spend time alone being creative, and learn to feel comfortable with being in silence, and alone with your own self. It is not difficult, and can be satisfying.

       step two: hold on, i need to get a beer

       Elon Musk mentioned the simulation theory a few months ago (I think it was in a lecture interview, if you're searching), which is maybe where the traffic came from, and is at least how I learned about it. So very interesting.

       If it was a simulation I would think that some jarring events in life would force you to "wake up," like the death of a loved one or intense stimuli.  If you're in a dream and you flip the lights on or hear a loud enough noise you will usually wake up.

       I'm pretty sure people around me I don't know don't exist if I'm not interacting with them, similar to npc ( non playable characters) in a video game. If interaction is to occur it was all programmed in my mind prior to the interaction. The actual "people" I know are most likely other real people experiencing a similar reality and have figured out the others are npc as well . Some real players I know have been terminated by the system which is part organic part "matrix" (because they knew too much and were out of control in the organic world and had the potential to teach others), some people (npc) are stuck in the "matrix" , some live in both . "tptb" do not have complete control of the system because the people that realize they are not an npc in their reality cannot be controlled .

       A simulation of creation yes. We are all fragments of God, experiencing himself in multiple ways with the end goal of self awareness of unity and oneness of who we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, we are creators, because we are God, and so we can create this reality through universal laws such as free will and the law of attraction. Things take longer to manifest and move on this heavy plane of illusion aka the third dimension but it is not a empty void computer game, it is a living, vibrant, natural creation that encompasses the all that is and makes up God, the creator, and all of creation.

       Rememberance of self. You can't experience light without dark. This is all to nudge us in the direction of remembering who we are.
