The lot size is listed as 0.09 acres. 0.09 acres is 3920 sq ft. Therefore, this building cannot possibly have a basement.</p>

<p>The people that continue to push this idea are clueless, but that is pizzagate for you.</p>

<p>Edit: BTW</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like Pastan, James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong, doesn’t build his pizza sauce with DOP San Marzanos. For seven years, he has been buying late-harvest tomatoes from Toigo Orchards in Shippensburg, Pa., and canning them at nearby Stello Foods for use at Comet. Last year, Alefantis estimates, he bought 12 tons of Toigo tomatoes, which Stello turned into sauce and canned before trucking the jars to the basement at Buck’s Fishing &amp; Camping, Alefantis’s other restaurant just a few steps down the block on Connecticut Avenue NW.</p>

<p>Buck&#39;s, James Alefantis&#39;s other restaurant, is listed at two stories, with only one above ground story. So is Comet Pizza. Alefantis has confirmed Bucks has a basement. So, Comet would also have a basement, because as we know there is no second story to Comet.</p>

<p>Your &quot;debunking&quot; of Comet not having a basement is literally just based on the floor plans square footage, when unfinished square footage, <em>like an unfinished basement</em>, isn&#39;t made in a listing anyways. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Definition. The sum of all areas on all floors of a building included within the outside faces of its exterior walls, including all vertical penetration areas, for circulation and shaft areas that connect one floor to another.</p>

<p>Basis for Measurement. Gross Area is computed by physically measuring or scaling measurements from the outside faces of exterior walls, disregarding cornices, pilasters, buttresses, etc., that extend beyond the wall faces. Exclude areas having less than a 3-foot clear ceiling height unless the criteria of a separate structure are met. (See section 2.3, What to Include in a Building Inventory.)</p>

<p>Measured in terms of Gross Square Feet (GSF),</p>

<p>GSF = Net Usable Area + Structural Space</p>

<p>Description. In addition to all the internal floored spaces obviously covered above, Gross Area should include the following: excavated basement areas; interstitial space (i.e., mechanical floor or walkways), mezzanines, penthouses, and attics; garages; covered porches, whether walled or not; inner or outer balconies to the extent of a drip line from a roof or balcony immediately above, whether walled or not, if they are utilized for operational functions; and corridors or walkways, whether walled or not, provided they are either within the outside face lines of the building to the extent of the roof drip line or, if covered, to the extent of their cover’s drip line. The footprints of stairways, elevator shafts, and vertical duct shafts are to be counted as gross area on each floor through which they pass.</p>

<p>Limitations. Exclude open areas such as parking lots, playing fields, pools, courts, light wells, and portions of upper floors eliminated by spaces or lobbies that rise above single-floor ceiling height. Exclude unexcavated basement areas.</p>

<p>Exception. Include top, unroofed floor of parking structures where parking is available. (See the section on parking structures after figure 3-8.)</p>

<p>Yes, it is. Commercial real estate has to be up to code for people to work or if you rent, live in. That&#39;s what &quot;livable square footage&quot; means. Apartments are commercial real estate, do people not live in them?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to say he doesn&#39;t because the original premise that Alefantis was caught in a lie about having a basement at the pizza shop is completely wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like Pastan, James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong, doesn’t build his pizza sauce with DOP San Marzanos. For seven years, he has been buying late-harvest tomatoes from Toigo Orchards in Shippensburg, Pa., and canning them at nearby Stello Foods for use at Comet. Last year, Alefantis estimates, he bought 12 tons of Toigo tomatoes, which Stello turned into sauce and canned before trucking the jars to the basement at Buck’s Fishing &amp; Camping, Alefantis’s other restaurant just a few steps down the block on Connecticut Avenue NW.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was here. I don&#39;t know how to find it either. Comet has a basement as revealed by  the owner himself They claim to grow organic vegetables there and have a harvesting party every year to can it and make it into pizza sauce. There are also unexplained photo&#39;s from them showing a hole being dug in their floor. Not the kind of thing you would get a building permit for. This is all taking posts here at face value, I have no real way to confirm or deny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s completely unrelated. I make up nothing. The Podesta files have a picture of a hole being dug in the floor at Comet. there are lots of references to a tunnel in their images and messages. Construction is not  always  permitted, especially for  this  kind of use.</p>
