       To be honest I believe there was some weird shit going with the Podestas, but in the end it wasn't nothing too serious. Just weird fetishes, as the rich and powerful had for centuries. But they aren't running a pedo ring and they're probably not discussing pedo things via e-mail. I mean come on? Using 4chan code words from 2006? What is this? Small time criminals know better code to use, and even if they did, all they probably talked about was some narcotics related stuff. Why use their real e-mail? Why have it public? Come on, you're fucking children by the hundreds and at the same time you keep an simple office e-mail? Why no encryption?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I could go on and on and on with questions and questionable evidence. Reminds me of the days where Stormfront used pixeled .jpeg files as a basis of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now tell me, does anyone actually have credible proof of anything happening other than some weird correlations that probably don't even mean anything? A witness would be a good start, otherwise get back to your basement and play with your tinfoil hat.

       The mainstream never addressed the Wikileaks  files . All they did was say they were  released by Russia. That go them  off Scott free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they don't address why pizzagate is false. they  just state that it is. It's pure propaganda but unfortunately propaganda works. Once the 'experts' have spoken the public will never question what they have to say.

       Hillary Clinton while acting Secretary of State had an "unsafer" email server than a gmail account. The FBI director literally described it in those  terms during the House Oversight hearing. The Secretary of State obviously has information that is more sensitive than coded pedo talk. So to say this is the "unsafest" thing isn't even correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality we're dealing with is that these people either don't care or don't expect anyone to look into anything they do. I'm not sure which it is.

       Well this is a new conspiracy theory on this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some think the emails from wikileaks are legitimate.
Some think the emails were Russian propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think the emails were legitimate, and that the Podestas chose to make them public? So you think the Podestas run wikileaks?

       It could have been a honeypot type setup.  They setup server that they knew would be hacked/leaked (possibly leaked to wikileaks themselves) and filled with certain type e-mails to lay the foundation for a "fake news" narrative that attacks conspiracy theorists and freedom of speech/the press in general.  Would play into Comey's ruling on the matter. They let trump win (he's in on it) to let the people think they had a victory, and to help them buy fully into the narrative which they would not have with a clinton victory.

       Yeah there are several different conspiracy theory angles in motion right now, and it is impossible to for any of us to know beyond the shadow of a doubt if wikileaks is compromised or not. Which is why I have expressed multiple times that people should focus on doing the right thing, and that in my personal opinion, the right thing in this case is to investigate
       <em>
        just in case
       </em>
       some children are in danger or being harmed. I mean, anyone who scrolls through my history could easily conclude that I'm a bit of a narcissist, myself, but even I'm not afraid of winding up being wrong in my suspicions and looking silly. My personal pride is not worth more to me than what is possibly on the line here.

       What have you been smoking, Russian propaganda doesn't even work for Russians, only on old grandmas and that isn't even real, they just receive 500 RUB more in pensions per month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russian propaganda doesn't exist. There might be some botnets and paids shills, but that's about it. You got to be retarded to buy into RT propaganda.

       Think about it... All these illegal hillary and friends e-mails leak but there's barely nothing in there...  I mean just having the servers is a federal offense and clearly illegal but in the e-mails themselves nothing really juicy to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the podesta e-mails leak out and what do we see?  A bunch of meaningless e-mails where they are talking about boring shit and what kind of italian food they eat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next there is some big scandal about pizza used in the e-mails as some 4chan code word...  Big scandal, tons of hype but all circumstantial "evidence" aka no solid evidence whatsoever but still a big huge hype scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the "fake news" phenomenon comes into play.  A way to use this pizzagate shit to try to silence alternative news or a way to attack conspiracy theorists and alternative news.  A way for them to make a public enemy of conspiracy theories and get the sheeple on board.  And throw in the guy who went to the restaurant with the weapon...
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems almost too obviously manufactured.  It's a manufactured narrative.  The whole thing is manufactured, from the leaks to the interpretation of the leaks to the mainstream attack on "fake news" to the guy with the weapon.  To the coming crackdown on free speech that will happen over the next 4 years.  Bush laid the foundation, Obama took our privacy (nullified 4th amendment), Trump will take away free speech (nullify 1st amendment.) Then they will nullify 2nd amendment when no one is able to speak against it, and the rest is history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it!!!  Obama: "most transparent administration" = take away privacy of the people (the masses are more transparent than ever).  Trump: ran a campaign of running his mouth, saying outrageous things.  People think he is fighting for free speech but this is how they play you.  Instead they will take your freedom of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who buys into the podesta e-mails pizza re-interpretation bullshit is being played, hardcore!  Y'all fools dun goofed again.

       I think people are too hung up on the code word shit. I mean yes that is kind of what kicked things off, but all the other connections that have been found are really there and have nothing to do with code words.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are all really connected and strangely enough, are all connected to either: 
A. someone convicted of human/sex trafficking
B. someone that is in to some weird shit, be it performance art, or art of children in exploitative poses, or bands that sing about the stuff
C. organizations that are supposed to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes its circumstantial but warrants more investigation.

       Good theory. What do you think their motivation is though for setting all this up? What do they get in the end?

       your post makes no sense, so what if they have used 4chan coded words? they been getting away with it thus far, they are under the impression that even if they get caught they control the entire system including the public information channels, they believe they are untouchable so these "coded words" are merely a legacy language used from the days they were setting up their empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe you never going to get caught or cant get taken down there's no freaken reason to worry about any of the crap you just mentioned. Even now they are openly involved with known satanic rituals and art, Just the art by itself should be enough to lock them up and thats fact, but they just laughing at us coz they know they can.
