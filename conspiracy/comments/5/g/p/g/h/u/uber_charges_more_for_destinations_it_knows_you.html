       I used to commute to work using uber pool because it was roughly $4.50 per way which was around the same cost as taking the train through two zones in the bay area. A few weeks ago Uber enabled "location always" to be collected in the background, and since then my estimated costs have increased. I am 95% sure that they figured out quite easily where I live and where I work and are using that information to know to charge me more for my commute. I tested this theory by changing my destination to the apt literally across the street from mine, a few feet from my previous always used destination and sure enough the price is half. I have people type in my apartment from work on their apps and the price is also different. I have no idea why this hasn't been covered anywhere because Uber is clearly using background location and frequently used destinations to charge a hire price to one person vs another for the exact same trip. Anyone who commutes to work using Uber, try setting your destination to the place next door or the apt next to yours and see what happens.

       Wouldn't be surprised.  Ever since Uber made recent internet headlines about them wanting to know your location EVEN AFTER you've been dropped off &amp; have the app turned off = screams shadyness, redflags, and suspicions.......  Talk about creepy intrusive technology, but as time goes on.  It's to be expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their competitor Lyft doesn't do this (or atleast not yet, hasn't made headlines) and they have similiar prices, use that instead.

       I'm not surprised by any means as to why they do this. Background location data is collected for exactly these types of purposes. For some reason Lyft is always around 2 to 3 times more expensive at any given moment for my commute and I've tried many variations. I've stopped using both for work and now take the train.

       That's weird Chicago area here and I found Lyft to be cheaper over the past year compared to Uber. Especially with the inflation rate charges Uber likes to fuck people on.

       It asks you if you're ok if it collects location in the background but when I said no the app stops working at all. It's only "always" or "never".

       This is true. If you plan on using Uber, enable location services before you make a trip then disable en route or when you arrive.
I've also noticed the increase in fare rates, so now I disable both location services and cellular data when I have entered an Uber then turn both on to schedule another ride.
The notification that shows up about the location changes states that Uber uses this information to ensure your safety after arriving at a destination.

       If your using an Android, and your phone is rooted, you can use an app called permissions master to deny any/all access including gps and internet. I don't use the uber app, but you could try clicking Accept and then block access until you need to use the app.

       Google does the same with their chrome browser. A site that you want to share your location with, google must know to triangulate your position but they are equally shady because they use your location at their will. I'm saying google tracks people with their consent and no one bats an eye. Uber does it and murmuring begins.

       This can go deeper than just commutes. I could see them seeing in background locations that you frequent bars and upcharge someone who is a frequent drinker more for a ride to the bar vs. someone who doesn't. You can tell a lot of about a person based on where they go, and with that background collection they can really get a pretty good "profile" on someone and be able to charge more for places they want predict you would be willing to pay more for.

       guy named Hubert Horan not paid by industry figured out that uber's only possible path to success and reason for it's mass investment is a promise to monopolize the cab industry

       Not surprising at all. These are the legitimate reasons why some people have issue with the unregulated nature of Uber vs. established and licensed cabs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how this is a conspiracy, though. There has been lots of information published about how Uber acts unilaterally with rates and wages.

       You thought their business model was getting you from point A to point B? You're practically shouting into their database your movements, that database is then sold to a third party like google or the gov't and patched in with every other database of incidental info to give a 24/7 log of the movements of every citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically they're gonna be able to say "computer give me a profile on John Doe" and up will come a complete profile your regular movements, who you associate with and what you say to them, what your public beliefs and image is and what your private self is like, etc.

       Had a recent uber ride where the driver told me she talks with a lot of her passengers and some of them tell her what the total of their ride is. She said more than once the Uber app has told the passenger the ride was a certain amount (say $25), then when the app processes the payment and conveys to the driver the total it was a lesser amount (like $19), and its from that lesser amount the app calculated the drivers cut. Uber seems to be a shady company all around.

       I have also heard this from drivers. Being the gatekeepers with no information being shared between driver and passenger allows them to easily display a lower fare to the driver so that they get less of a cut.

       Hm.. was your house showing up as a suggested destination? Also was this after they enabled location tracking always as of like 1-2 weeks ago? I used to always have the exact same price up until they made the background location change

       This is capitalism, it's hardly a conspiracy that a business is seeking to be a monopoly and extract as much cash as possible from you.

       I think the point is that they've refused to be regulated like a taxi, which they clearly should be. Due to this, they can do things like OP is pointing out.
