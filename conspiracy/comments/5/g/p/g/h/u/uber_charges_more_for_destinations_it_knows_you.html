        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used to commute to work using uber pool because it was roughly $4.50 per way which was around the same cost as taking the train through two zones in the bay area. A few weeks ago Uber enabled &quot;location always&quot; to be collected in the background, and since then my estimated costs have increased. I am 95% sure that they figured out quite easily where I live and where I work and are using that information to know to charge me more for my commute. I tested this theory by changing my destination to the apt literally across the street from mine, a few feet from my previous always used destination and sure enough the price is half. I have people type in my apartment from work on their apps and the price is also different. I have no idea why this hasn&#39;t been covered anywhere because Uber is clearly using background location and frequently used destinations to charge a hire price to one person vs another for the exact same trip. Anyone who commutes to work using Uber, try setting your destination to the place next door or the apt next to yours and see what happens. </p>

Ever since Uber made recent internet headlines about them wanting to know your location EVEN AFTER you&#39;ve been dropped off &amp; have the app turned off = screams shadyness, redflags, and suspicions.......  Talk about creepy intrusive technology, but as time goes on.  It&#39;s to be expected. </p>

<p>Their competitor Lyft doesn&#39;t do this (or atleast not yet, hasn&#39;t made headlines) and they have similiar prices, use that instead.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. If you plan on using Uber, enable location services before you make a trip then disable en route or when you arrive.
I&#39;ve also noticed the increase in fare rates, so now I disable both location services and cellular data when I have entered an Uber then turn both on to schedule another ride.
The notification that shows up about the location changes states that Uber uses this information to ensure your safety after arriving at a destination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This can go deeper than just commutes. I could see them seeing in background locations that you frequent bars and upcharge someone who is a frequent drinker more for a ride to the bar vs. someone who doesn&#39;t. You can tell a lot of about a person based on where they go, and with that background collection they can really get a pretty good &quot;profile&quot; on someone and be able to charge more for places they want predict you would be willing to pay more for. </p>
