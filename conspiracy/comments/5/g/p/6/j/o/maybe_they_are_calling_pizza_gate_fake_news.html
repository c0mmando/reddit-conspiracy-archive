       You'll notice that pizzagate no longer cares at all about the Anthony Weiner, Abedin aspect, the Clinton's are fading into the background, and even though some of it touches on supposed Haitian orphans, that is also quickly evaporating as well.  Nobody seemingly gives a shit what's happened to Assange, or the open money-laundering aspect of the
       <strong>
        Clinton Foundation
       </strong>
       , or wikileaks.  Most of it is based on how you
       <em>
        subjectively
       </em>
       view photos and art, while mob rule demands you see pedos at every turn.  It's being pushed often in very ridiculous ways.  I would say that yes, it's likely a disinfo campaign, with the caveat that something more would need to break very soon, something that results in a witness coming forward or real, tangible evidence.

       I don't think I'm stretching, I see the connections that are being made and discerning them with my own knowledge. Yes I do agree there needs to be way more evidence. But Jimmy Comets twitter feed alone is pretty fucked up...along with all the art being used and hung in the restaurant.

       They serve alcohol and haves shows (concerts). Seems like a night life spot that is a restaurant during the day.

       Wont lie there is some odd things.. but we have no proof a crime was even committed, let alone by a pizza pedo group.

       Well all their advertisements that I have seen are touting the "kid friendly" environment. Yes I can agree again we don't have any evidence of a crime, that's why it's an on going investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are tons of creepy links between pedos, Podesta, pedophile artwork, and the like, but that's why the search continues. Links and connections need to come first before evidence is drawn up. Basically we are investigating to show the real authorities that there is something to investigate?!?
      </p>

       I'm not actively investigating but I am following the developments closely.

       The authorities will not investigate this if its true, you know that right? They will just shift operations and cover their tracks..

       The links are interesting but i havent seen anything that really stands out as a pedo crime.

       Personally i think the pizza code has to do with drugs, not pedos... they wouldnt drop so many clues out in the open if it was pedos..

       If someone is calling pizzagate "fake news" they need to slit their wrists. When the internet is completely and totally censored and you're not allowed to read anything but CNN/NYT, it will be the fault of the person that claims
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       is "fake news" for spreading the government's own buzzword and giving their internet censorship agenda free advertising. Even if pizzagate turns out to be completely false, it will
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       be worth the government censoring the internet because of it. Ever. Under any circumstance.

       Edit: I'm not investigating pizzagate so I have no personal stake in it. If someone wants to dox someone, it's not my fault and I don't care. They made that decision, I did not.

       Pizzagate has done nothing good for the truth movement.

       Consider this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone in this sub, and in conspiracy circles in general, knows that elite pedo rings are a very real thing. We have a pretty substantial amount of evidence to back that notion up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter Pizzagate, an alleged pedo ring of the same flavor that caters directly to the confirmation bias of the conspiracy minded. Yet, there is no hard evidence at all, no victims coming forward, none of that. The most damning aspect of pizzagate is the creepy art involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way to discredit the notion of elite pedo sex rings than a fake hoax where the conspiracy minded are tricked into frantically pushing a narrative that is half baked?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't think of one.

       makes you wonder what they're doing behind the scenes while everyone here is pouring over wikileaks emails. looking like a big ol' smoke show to get people to react. and so they did by going into that pizza shop with a gun.  now everyone to even believes a lick of this as truth is "batshit" and shouldn't be trusted. This whole thing fucking stinks.
