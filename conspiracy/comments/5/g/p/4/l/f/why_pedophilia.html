        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is simply an open discussion. </p>

<p>I just want to talk about and ask you guys, why pedophilia? Why are the wealthy, elite, and politically powerful people in this world sexually attracted to children? And from some claims, most culprits lean towards a bisexual preference. Do you guys think it might just be a way to keep all the members in check? Like they&#39;re all forced to partake in this sinful act so they&#39;re all guilty of it and all members can be trusted? Maybe it has something to do with their Satanic beliefs and enacting rituals to fulfill an agenda that goes beyond fulfilling sick sexual desires? Are most members simply born into it? Most politicians aren&#39;t necessarily born into politics, are they? I mean it&#39;s safe to assume that there are members that aren&#39;t born into it that join and are invited/accepted into it, right? I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s all just speculation for me. What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a case of what do you buy the man that already has everything...</p>

<p>The wealthy and elite are accustomed to special treatment and privileges because of their celebrity status. They can pay for things that most people simply can&#39;t afford whether it&#39;s trips into space, mega yachts, islands or in this case something far darker. The regular rules do not apply to them and they have so much money and influence I can imagine there&#39;s a desire to push the boundaries as far as they can. These people can&#39;t even comprehend the reality that most of us live in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may or may not be pedophilia. It could be heroin/any drug. However if I can&#39;t do drugs I&#39;d rather my politicians also banned from doing/trafficking them as well but the important part to note is: it&#39;s definitely not pizza. What politician sits around all day emailing about pizza in <em>very</em> strange sentences all day? The other emails are mostly worded in a way that resembles an intelligent human typing a sentence in English. But as soon as pizza gets mentioned, grammar and sentence structure in general just goes out the fucking window and the language gets strange in a way that people don&#39;t type. Remember the pool party email/dominos/handkerchief? Look at the way those sentences are structured. Creep-type.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think first you have to understand it&#39;s not about sex - it&#39;s about power. (All sex crimes are) So you have a bunch of people who lack empathy and are power hungry - they get their jollies from harming others, from having the power to harm others. They get off being sneaking about it - by being oh so clever. Throw it some extraordinary man philosophy and you get a bunch of ass holes who prey on children. </p>

<p>You could throw in some Boredom and occult shit, but really they all are a bunch of narcissists who view most of the population as subhuman, nothing more than big you wouldn&#39;t think twice stepping on.  </p>

<p>This is also why some of this shit is so blatant. They think they are so brilliant, couldn&#39;t possibly get caught, and that they are above the law. Tale as old as time criminal gets full of themselves and then gets sloppy </p>
