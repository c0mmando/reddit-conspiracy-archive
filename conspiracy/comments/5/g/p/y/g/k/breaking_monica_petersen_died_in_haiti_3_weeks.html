<p>Anyone see this article yet? Claiming the Monica Peterson info is another hoax. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wapo has been incredibly deceptive about pizzagate from what I&#39;ve read so far. Subtly spinning evidence in a way that fits their narrative, while even a cursory look reveals they are making false statements. The fact that they say this is a hoax leads me to believe the exact opposite. This is the first time I&#39;ve seen Monica linked to alert sense, the same organization Silsby went to work for after she came home from being convicted under human trafficking laws in Haiti? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with that is you can&#39;t just dismiss every article as being a part of the larger conspiracy. Mainstream people will never take it seriously and the whole investigation goes nowhere. Some of the evidence I&#39;ve seen looks legit and not hoaxed. But to focus on things that can&#39;t be proven or substantiated other than some screen shots of social media postings will accomplish nothing. Even if a massive coverup is real, it has to be proven or most people won&#39;t listen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wapo describes it as a false conspiracy theory right off the bat, their agenda is clear. I think the problem is that the circumstantial nature of the evidence so far can&#39;t be proven or disproven until the question is officially posed. In a normal case this would be the point where the impartial authorities step in, examine the evidence and question the involved parties. Given the fact that has not happened, and the nature of MSM reporting, it&#39;s obvious that these questions are not intended to be asked or legitimized, which is incredibly telling in itself I think. </p>

<p>Thanks for proving my point. </p>

<p>Robinson denied she fanned the flames. “Some guy from Reditt found an old Facebook post on the Clintons and screen shot it and tagged it in to this, and even after I confirmed that her death had nothing to do with the Clintons, he made up stories that the family couldn’t get answers,” she wrote The Fact Checker in a Twitter message.</p>

<p>Confirming that <a href="/u/rutkdn">/u/rutkdn</a> is a desperate liar. </p>

<p>Good find. Thanks.</p>

<p>The facts have been out there all along and have been presented all along. Unfortunately, many people prefer the sensationalist narrative over boring facts.</p>

<p>Of course, this won&#39;t convince anyone who has made up their mind. They will just claim that Bella is being forced to make those statements or other bullshit. </p>

<p>Mark my words on that. </p>
