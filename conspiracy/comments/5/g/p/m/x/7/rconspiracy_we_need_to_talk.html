As far as I have looked there is little to no evidence of pizza gate. There are some poorly chosen social media pics. Some code words that literally by definition could mean anything. I really truthfully feel that so many people are wanting to see something here and it is blinding them. I am sure this will be down voted to hell. But this is getting out of hand guys. You know what I want more than your downvote? Evidence. Maybe I am wrong but I would be thoroughly shocked at this point. Focus on 911 or government corruption or police brutality or NSA spying leave this weak ass pizza boy shit alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider this. </p>

<p>When Jeffery Epstein was arrested for multiple allegations of child prostitution his maid was interviewed and said that <em>he had different underage girls come and give him nude massages every other day</em> and his pilot said that 2-3 times per day the plane was loaded up with dressed up underage people, they would fly prominent people to prominent places in the same place at the same time. </p>

<p>When Epstein was arrested the police said they recovered hidden cameras in his home and plane that were <em>being used to blackmail high level government officials and celebrities</em></p>

<p>To me. There is no way the police could know it was for blackmail and not just for personal pedophiliac satisfaction unless they had viewed the tapes and said, &quot;whoop. I know who that guy is. We gotta bury this shit&quot;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the lead witness in the case, the girl that actually fingered him mentioned having sex with Prince William and Alan Dershowitz (sp) BY NAME</p>

<p>Prior to this, in Omaha NE, the Franklin Scandal followed this exact MO. That particular investigation went on for years, and in hindsight, it was almost undeniably a government coverup. In that investigation, Alisha Owens named George Bush BY NAME and was willing to spend a sentence in jail for perjury to stick to her story. She also named several other high level people and made specific mention of their being photographers at the parties for the purpose of blackmail. </p>

<p>I guess my question to you is, you&#39;re on a conspiracy subreddit. Who would you like to provide you the evidence? It isn&#39;t going to be the justice department. The only people who are going to flesh (no pun intended) this out are the same ones who sniffed out all the other conspiracies and this is how they did it. Only difference is now there are 100,000 people actively digging through this and collaborating in real time. </p>

But its all subjective, meaning it relies on the Alefantis to be brought from a status of high position to one in which the pigs has to defend him for a sustained, and unprofitable period. This erosion of social position from speculative charges can be enough, in practice to break his status. However, this will not happen easily as the pigs are part of the system that protects people of position. CP achieves huge profit margins, the pigs are only there to protect profits. They don&#39;t care about who gets fucked or killed, they are only there to protect profit, that is their job. If the neckbeards affect CP profits the pigs will come down on them, hard.

<p>People actually believe puppets of the global elite will arrest, indict and convict their global elite masters based on 4chan and reddit posts. The mere thought of such a thing is comedy but it goes deeper. You have multiple people using words like plausible deniability and obstruction of justice out of context. You have people <strong>OPENLY</strong> saying they would give Trump a pass if he raped children and even more madness I&#39;m not going into. When you ask about direct evidence such as video, images, audio, transcripts, etc, and then you get downvoted and called a shill, cuck or whatever the insult of the day is, then you know something is wrong.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to know what a period is. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re the one who can educate me about evidence. And speaking of evidence, let&#39;s just say they did contain evidence. Now you&#39;re facing a situation that can possibly be fruit from the poisonous tree (a term you would know without googling if <strong>you</strong> knew anything about evidence) so good luck on getting an arrest and charging document. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hypothetically, if we had no way of convicting people without hard solid proof. And Trump somehow had this proof from previous misdeeds that <strong>noone</strong> else had..  For participating in a &quot;pay to play&quot; society as some theorists have claimed, and used it to bring them down... well..</p>

<p>I think that would lend itself to special consideration. But also consideration for the baby he had to eat/kill. Perhaps NO life in jail but a serious jail penalty. 20-25 years which is pretty much a life sentence anyway for trump.. . But then you have the argument of how undercover work is sometimes necessary to protect the investigation, and/or the life of said investigator. </p>

<p>Would be a classy way to end his 8 year term if he turns out to be corrupt after all.. Just blow the whistle on everyone, arrest everyone even yourself and provide the proof. But don&#39;t hold your breath.</p>

<p>Such arguments about the gray area of undercover law enforcement procedures can be brought up, but at the end of investigations, they are <em>usually</em> determined on a case by case basis. And morally grey area matters should be determined by non bias eyes on a case by case basis. Because that would help ensure a fair trial where both sides get to present their case. However the severity of said crime, and threat of life from even investigating a case can pardon the investigator in some situations. </p>

<p>However I highly doubt it. I feel the government knows about this pizzagate, but its hands are tied. Imagine just being to FBI or DOJ or even both (we can dream....), and your about to tell the heads and upper ranks of the CIA, DOJ and some NSA to pretty please turn themselves in for their deserved tar and feathering.</p>

<p>I think if officials started coming forward revealing pizzagate evidence. People would want to protect them either way until the investigation is concluded. Because we want them to get to trial and make those statements in open court. We want official evidence to be documented for all the public to see <strong>SO BAD</strong>... We want a fair investigation that relies on facts and hard evidence.. But we have to work with what we have right now..</p>
