    <div class="md"><p>Fuck, i HATE to be this guy, but...</p>

<p>Do any of you think this, passive, non violent approach we&#39;re taking to FUCKING EVERYTHING EVER, mite be the cause of why we NEVER win? </p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not suggesting we go shoot up everything we disagree with, or anything of the sort. I&#39;m suggesting, this approach never god damn works. And as far as i&#39;m concerned, it&#39;s 100% of the reason we find out selves here, immersed in a pedophile, corrupt, evil empire of fascist style elites, trying to use the system they created to show them what for. </p>

<p>I understand that the concept of violent approach to things sounds awful, and terrible, but we&#39;ve pacified too much. I&#39;ll also admit this person jumped the gun, but in situation where we&#39;ve got them, is that the right time to finally let the streets run red? What&#39;s it take? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to anger any one with this opinion, but i&#39;m literally tired of seeing everyone, for every incident ever IMMEDIATELY start tossing out &quot;No violence!&quot; Violence, is literally the end game, get shit done resort. </p>

<p>Evil people will harm you, they will harm your children, they will harm your future. Never forget that. </p>

<p>The time mite not be RIGHT NOW, but you&#39;re hilariously, and miserably mistaken if you think we ever win with out it.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but the protest was centered on aboriginal water rights. The proposed pipeline was going to pollute the watershed these people relied on for their way of life. </p>

<p>The rerouting of the pipeline is a big win for this particular aboriginal community, and many others facing similar circumstances across the country. </p>

<p>Most importantly, though, it shows that non-violent protesting can be successful if done in an effective manner. We just need to get off our asses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It&#39;s time to try here. Violence will always lead to violence. Nothing changed in the civil rights movement until everybody saw an unarmed citizen treated like an enemy combatant. That will always be true and there are plenty of people willing to step into that position especially if it affects the greater good. Record everything and stay vigilant! We&#39;re all just waiting for the right time.</p>

<p>Recognize these patterns in everyday life and learn to recognize the time to stand up and shout, and recognize the time to stay quiet and set a good example. I see these opportunities every single day, if you see somebody mistreating a cashier at a business, you have more power than anyone else in the room to stand up and say something; use it. It means a lot more than you would think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the level of subterfuge and the powers at play, nothing new to me. All I&#39;m saying is that violence is a slippery slope that leads to more violence. Wars are started because of it. The powers that be want that war, they want death, they want bloodshed, in whatever way possible because they&#39;re outside of it and think themselves above the law. They think this war machine is unstoppable, and that is true IF we turn to violence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the same way when it comes to this continued violence because its manufactured. There are people, corporations and secrete groups responsible for what we are seeing today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely manufactured violence on their part. Again, my point is that meeting their violence with more violence isn&#39;t the way to go about things. I understand people are worried, but the only thing we can do is continue searching for the evidence that will turn the tide, stooping to their level and inciting violence is precisely what they want. All peoples, no matter their color or creed need to unify and reject the tyranny while we still can. War is the absolute last resort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the honest reply. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have the answer. Not a single person I know has the answer, as everyone I can talk to was raised in this world under the yoke of world banks and corruption. </p>

<p>You can say that a bullet between the eyes of those responsible is the only course of action, but that sounds a lot like &quot;death to the infidels&quot; to me. </p>

<p>I think that mutual respect goes a long way. It definitely doesn&#39;t happen overnight, as it takes time to build like any relationship. I do, however, think that you can indeed force love on to people, getting it reciprocated is what can&#39;t be forced. The reason it hasn&#39;t worked is because we&#39;ve never truly tried it. </p>

<p>Violence is a never ending cycle of cruelty. There is always a new party to take up the mantle of aggressor, which in turn causes rise to another. I don&#39;t know how to stop it. I do know that throwing another stone is just going to perpetuate things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that we need to pressure them to step down and relinquish power, but killing them is only going to further radicalize their friends and family. Again, I don&#39;t know all the answers. From my perspective, the elites have created a world that believes money is power and have devised a way to hoard all the money. The internet is our best and most useful tool, but most of the people I see using it are spouting hate and reinforcing negative stereotypes. We as individuals need to be better, plain and simple.</p>

<p>To be clear, I&#39;m not advocating for good men to do nothing. The greatest country in the world has the power to help all and change the current dynamic. Unfortunately even our humanitarian efforts are veiled with evil. There&#39;s always some form of exploitation involved. This is where fundamental change is required. People need to realize that if we start to do good without the thought of the potential reward we will change the world for the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck you and speak for yourself. The only reason you have a constitution and have any semblance of freedom is because real men with real balls decided enough was enough and threw off the tyrants oppressing them. You know how they did that? With violence. Why? Because in the end that&#39;s the only thing that will ever work. The tyrants of our day will never hand over power willingly, it must be forced from them. Freedom of information is only worth so much on its own. It&#39;s when you utilize that information to achieve force of action that it becomes invaluable. Decisive action at the decisive moment. Until then, arm yourselves with knowledge. But understand you will never just be given freedom, justice, and equality. For that, a people must be willing to fight and potentially die for what they know is true and right. Only when the people rise up and assert themselves as the sovereign authority they truly are, will you ever see real change or justice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that we need to pressure them to step down and relinquish power, but killing them is only going to further radicalize their friends and family. Again, I don&#39;t know all the answers. From my perspective, the elites have created a world that believes money is power and have devised a way to hoard all the money. The internet is our best and most useful tool, but most of the people I see using it are spouting hate and reinforcing negative stereotypes. We as individuals need to be better, plain and simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about if the 99 said fuck the powers that be and just continued society with out money and jobs but used our time to care for each other and gather/ farm food, build shelters...ect and fought back to defend ourself, but fucking took out the people  who tried. That&#39;s pretty much the best compromise I can think of. To many people here couldn&#39;t survive without all the &quot;luxuries&quot; though</p>
