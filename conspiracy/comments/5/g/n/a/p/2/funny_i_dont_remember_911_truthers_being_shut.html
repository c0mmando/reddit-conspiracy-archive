        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I would guess that from the risk of social unrest angle, 9/11 investigations would be at least as significant as PG, yet only now do we see this sweeping use of the words &quot;fake news&quot; and an attempt to shut down discussion. I&#39;ve been unconvinced by the some of the more tenuous links and guesses in PZ, but I can&#39;t help feeling like this shows there&#39;s something to hide.</p>

<p>Also wondering, what has been the actual justification for shutting down so-called fake news? What&#39;s the stated narrative for this, why it&#39;s important to block fake news, when &quot;fake news&quot; has been around for decades?</p>

<p>Others here have expressed a similar sentiment, that the coordinated cover-up/blocking attempt is rather suspicious in its own right, but I would like to know how more of the ways they&#39;re spinning the need for censorship.</p>

<p>This is my first post in this sub, hope I didn&#39;t screw anything up, thanks for all you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my view, Fake News is simply a new term to discredit Conspiracy Theories, since the latter term has lost a fair bit of its negative stigma.</p>

<p>My personal experience is that the general public, while still being largely oblivious to their real rulers whoever they may be, are much more ready now than ever, to accept the possibility of some of the classic conspiracy theories being at least partly true. Perhaps not a majority, but a nonetheless large and growing minority of people know that Oswald wasn&#39;t acting alone, and that there&#39;s more to it, that there&#39;s something seriously wrong with the official 9/11 story and the chain of reactions that followed it. Many, many people now realize that Iraq and countless other wars were purely based on lies to benefit the military-industrial complex and intelligence communities. Many people are aware of the kinds of domestic spying that the NSA and GCHQ and others are capable of, and many more are getting suspicious about these things.</p>

<p>To these people, calling PG just another conspiracy theory is not scaring them away anymore. After so many former conspiracy theories becoming conspiracy fact (Panama Papers is another one), it only serves to give the theory credence.</p>

<p>They needed a new term and strategy to combat the public&#39;s craving and search for truth. Enter: Fake News.</p>

<p>If you can simply label any dissenting research as fake, while controlling the official narrative via the &quot;accepted news&quot;, you effectively decide what&#39;s true and what&#39;s not. The Ministry of Truth is now inevitable and will result in total control of what&#39;s accepted as correct thinking. Dare to disagree, or even dissent with an informed counter-argument, and you&#39;ll get the word FAKE stamped on your forehead in big red letters. This is how they shut us up, and I&#39;m not sure how we can fight it.</p>

But there clearly is, by seeing just how far these self-serving bastards are willing to go to thwart people uniting to look into it and stifle the discussion. These cunts don&#39;t know how bad that is failing, so all they will continue to do is ramp up their counter-offensive as it is all they know.</p>

<p>There is only circumstantial evidence in Pizzagate. That&#39;s why the MSM feels okay drawing attention to it. Because they know nothing will ever come from it.</p>

<p>Pizzagate&#39;s origin is Wikileaks and Julian Assange admitted that Wikileaks is edited by the Mossad. I don&#39;t trust it. I&#39;ll believe when you have things like children testifying they were abused, medical evidence they were abused, etc. which we have in other cases.</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick.</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p><a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207</a></p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report</a></p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a></p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html</a></p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>People have called 9/11 truthers insane from the start.  You do not have a proper comparison here.  9/11 truth was a hard won movement that took literally years to form.  Many brave people had to produce videos to speak up, and then wait for Youtube to even exist,(!!!) then spread the information in the form of home made videos.  I have to ask where you&#39;ve been if you really believe &quot;truthers&quot; have been dealt with fairly?  </p>

<p>Pizzagate exploded in 2 damn days, on the social media sites that now exist, and has fuck all to do with 9/11.</p>

<p>9/11 is still a very touchy subject with me.  I would ask you not to use it in this way please.  9/11 was an inside job by our own government and Israel, to bring about wars on terror that never have to end, and bring about Greater Israel.</p>

<p>My goal was not to be insensitive or make a judgement call about 9/11, but to understand and compare how the MSM handles things, that&#39;s all, and hopefully draw some interesting conclusions about the state of our current world and the MSM in the process.</p>

So forward 2016 the media has  zero control over information and topics that make news. If 911 happened today, we would call their bullshit, and they would call fake it News.

The kind of sites that hire content creators and pay them $1 an article. Now, I am horrified to see that anything that is not a &quot;popular&quot; opinion is now considered fake news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because for 9/11 there was an actual crime and victims, and the conspiracy theories revolved around who really did it.  With pizzagate not a single victim has been produced.  It&#39;s all just conjecture based on a perceived &quot;code&quot; in emails and instagram posts. </p>

No matter how many people they censored, there was always someone pissing on their bullshit story in the comments. Yes, there was lots of threats hurled at 9/11 truth tellers back then too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Conspiracy theory&quot; was deployed as a weaponized term after the JFK assassination to discredit anyone questioning the Warren Commission. The term remained effective up until now. The &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; have been demonstrably correct so many times that the psyop no longer works and now the &quot;fake news&quot; psyop has been deployed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am I understanding this correctly? Claims that Russians were behind Wikileaks. BFD, that wasn&#39;t fake news and I don&#39;t think it came from Russian government. The election was only Trump&#39;s concern over fairness, he wins and now others want to make sure everything was correct. I thought they trusted the system until a winner was declared seemingly. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t put it past any government to plant fake news and it must suck when public chooses not to buy into desired story, but oh well. </p>

<p>If I owned Comet Pizza, I&#39;d add new marketing, Home of Pizzagate! Seriously, if anything happened there I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s been covered up or moved. I could be wrong, but think there is an really scary group of people directing Pizzagate. Locating them will be the hard part as elitist don&#39;t like to get their hands dirty, but will pay well for gold nuggets others dig up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Different time in history, 9/11 truth was always a thing since the day it happened but it was easier to over look these things, 9/11 catalyst was a change. Even if that event happened exactly as the government said it happened it still caused a huge effect in our way of life all over the world. Today people are a bit more (rightfully) paranoid about things and news/memes travel a lot faster.</p>

<p>The fake news narrative just the new conspiracy theorist. It won&#39;t work out well for them though since its very easy to point to the major networks lies. But hey panicked and needed a band aid solution. </p>

<p>Where will this go? Who knows. I&#39;m expecting people to die over this pizzagate and that will be what really sets things in motion. This gunman was just a test.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t even make the rounds on the media that much either, I only seen it in areas where people were actively discussing the topic. Could have been a test run to see who reacts and how. </p>
