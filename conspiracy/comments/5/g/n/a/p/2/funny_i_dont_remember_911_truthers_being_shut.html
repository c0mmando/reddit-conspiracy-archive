       I would guess that from the risk of social unrest angle, 9/11 investigations would be at least as significant as PG, yet only now do we see this sweeping use of the words "fake news" and an attempt to shut down discussion. I've been unconvinced by the some of the more tenuous links and guesses in PZ, but I can't help feeling like this shows there's something to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also wondering, what has been the actual justification for shutting down so-called fake news? What's the stated narrative for this, why it's important to block fake news, when "fake news" has been around for decades?
      </p>
      <p>
       Others here have expressed a similar sentiment, that the coordinated cover-up/blocking attempt is rather suspicious in its own right, but I would like to know how more of the ways they're spinning the need for censorship.

       In my view, Fake News is simply a new term to discredit Conspiracy Theories, since the latter term has lost a fair bit of its negative stigma.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal experience is that the general public, while still being largely oblivious to their real rulers whoever they may be, are much more ready now than ever, to accept the possibility of some of the classic conspiracy theories being at least partly true. Perhaps not a majority, but a nonetheless large and growing minority of people know that Oswald wasn't acting alone, and that there's more to it, that there's something seriously wrong with the official 9/11 story and the chain of reactions that followed it. Many, many people now realize that Iraq and countless other wars were purely based on lies to benefit the military-industrial complex and intelligence communities. Many people are aware of the kinds of domestic spying that the NSA and GCHQ and others are capable of, and many more are getting suspicious about these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       To these people, calling PG just another conspiracy theory is not scaring them away anymore. After so many former conspiracy theories becoming conspiracy fact (Panama Papers is another one), it only serves to give the theory credence.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed a new term and strategy to combat the public's craving and search for truth. Enter: Fake News.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can simply label any dissenting research as fake, while controlling the official narrative via the "accepted news", you effectively decide what's true and what's not. The Ministry of Truth is now inevitable and will result in total control of what's accepted as correct thinking. Dare to disagree, or even dissent with an informed counter-argument, and you'll get the word FAKE stamped on your forehead in big red letters. This is how they shut us up, and I'm not sure how we can fight it.

       That's the most incredulous thing about this. If there is truly nothing to Pizzagate then run a god-damn real investigation. If there's honestly nothing to be found then poof it will vanish like a fart in the wind. But there clearly is, by seeing just how far these self-serving bastards are willing to go to thwart people uniting to look into it and stifle the discussion. These cunts don't know how bad that is failing, so all they will continue to do is ramp up their counter-offensive as it is all they know.

       If they did investigate and said there was nothing to it, you would simply say they are covering it up.

       Not if they had good methodology and investigative procedure, and revealed the details of how they investigated it, you know, like reporters are supposed to do - present the evidence and allow the viewer to reach their own conclusion. In this case the only evidence they're presenting is how ridiculous the other side looks, and their veneer is wearing thin.

      <p>
       "Trust me, I investigated it and there's nothing to it" would satisfy you, apparently.

       Just a reminder: Most of your people voted for the guy who ran his whole campaign on "trust me".

       Can you honestly tell me if the gunman had come out claiming he saw a basement with shackles and ropes you would have told him to fuck off unless he brought photos?
One will always blindly accept that which fits ones narrative. Conspiracy theorists are just exceptionally good at this.

       Can confirm voted third party, i refuse to vote for a candidate i dont believe in. That said when people blame me for trump i dgaf because as far as im concerned $hillary and trump are #teamcorporate and are two sides of the same coin.

       What should really wake people up is that these people have MSM in full control, meaning these companies are probably complicit in their crimes and at the minimum do not care about anyone but their own asses.

       Well that's just it. I get the impression that this sub has mixed feelings about 9/11, maybe I'm wrong, but regardless I would think that to TPTB
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       situations would be considered "fake news", and I find the difference in reaction interesting and am trying to think about what it means.

       The difference is close to 20 years. I was in high school during 9/11 and we weren't using the internet much aside from askjeeves and aol. 20 years later and a sub can add 25k users in a week. People wake up much quicker and more easily now. That's why censorship is hitting overdrive. I think pizzagate blowing up showed TPTB they are close to the tipping point

       over five years, only hardcore were in on it in the early days, people either didn't know or kept silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       some of the early hardcore 9/11 investigators died in suspicious circumstances, some vanished.

       Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was the turning point, the incompetence of Bushco was blindingly obvious at that point. the gloves came off and the floodgates opened, too many to silence then.

       There's a lot of information proving 911 was a false flag. There's a lot of information proving Government pedophilia in case of Jimmy Savile, Franklin scandal etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is only circumstantial evidence in Pizzagate. That's why the MSM feels okay drawing attention to it. Because they know nothing will ever come from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate's origin is Wikileaks and Julian Assange admitted that Wikileaks is edited by the Mossad. I don't trust it. I'll believe when you have things like children testifying they were abused, medical evidence they were abused, etc. which we have in other cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       911 was a cheap magic trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their "art" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">
        http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:

        https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">
        http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the "art students":

       Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, "it's good for Israel".

       I mean as far as I know, 9/11 truthers were ridiculed almost immediately due to the nationalistic upsurge and it went on for years. Now that we're bombing 7 countries the "war weariness" has led everyone to question things more.

       People have called 9/11 truthers insane from the start.  You do not have a proper comparison here.  9/11 truth was a hard won movement that took literally years to form.  Many brave people had to produce videos to speak up, and then wait for Youtube to even exist,(!!!) then spread the information in the form of home made videos.  I have to ask where you've been if you really believe "truthers" have been dealt with fairly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate exploded in 2 damn days, on the social media sites that now exist, and has fuck all to do with 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 is still a very touchy subject with me.  I would ask you not to use it in this way please.  9/11 was an inside job by our own government and Israel, to bring about wars on terror that never have to end, and bring about Greater Israel.

       I understand your point for sure that it was a different Web back then, no doubt. I find it interesting to compare how the MSM handled what
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       called, essentially, two "conspiracy theories", even if they have fuck all to do with each other, in part precisely because it is a different Web.
      </p>
      <p>
       My goal was not to be insensitive or make a judgement call about 9/11, but to understand and compare how the MSM handles things, that's all, and hopefully draw some interesting conclusions about the state of our current world and the MSM in the process.

       That day, George Bush gave a nationally televised speech telling people to accept that osama bin Laden was responsible. I don't think he explicitly said bin laden, his media arm did that for him all day. I was 11 years old, scared shitless, had nightmares of bin Laden when I went to sleep that night. That's a damn good job of propagandizing an event.

       The collective trauma experienced due to the news coverage surrounding 9/11 insulated it against accusations of conspiracy. Now, there are many more people who instinctively distrust the media and the government. Also, pizzagate didn't have that collective trauma induced by the media.

       Well about the only defense the establishment has provided has been "it's the Russians!" since the Wikileaks dumps. So in the spirit of keeping with their scapegoat they've decided to brand everything speaking the truth about these topics "Russian propaganda".
      </p>

       This thing has opened the floodgates of totalitarian censorship. In my opinion it would be mighty damn obtuse to not take note of what's going on here. It leads me to believe that shills are outnumbering those that genuinely don't believe it 10 to 1, but hey, maybe that's having too much faith in human nature.

       Thanks, that's just it, I haven't heard much beyond "it's the Russians!" either, I was wondering if it went beyond that, because it's pretty flimsy, obviously, on many levels. Is it that it's OK for the American people to believe fake news, as long as it doesn't come from Russia or another state "undermining democracy" or what?
      </p>

       I am also concerned about said floodgates, and the coordination of the use of the term "fake news" is freaky as fuck.

       The MSM strategy for 911 was to make it forbidden to discuss it in MSM and they used  blanket censorship of discussions,so  911 was contained to the fringes because of the lack development of social media for the first 10 years after 911 and lack of access to the internet by millions. So forward 2016 the media has  zero control over information and topics that make news. If 911 happened today, we would call their bullshit, and they would call fake it News. The corporate Media officially lost control in 2016, they don't control the narratives or news. Trump in his selfish right to be elected convinced the middle class that MSM is the danger not even Hillary herself. the message was received by all. They are fighting for their existence this year.

       Yeah it's much more efficient to discredit an entire source(s), rather than trying to discredit/dismiss every new story and evidence that comes from it.

       That's why they are going to be pushing the new hot term of 2017, "Fake News"

       But I came to those conclusions based on my reading through the related posts, finding the facts, the speculations, and the underlying foundations of the "conspiracy". Then I take it or leave it

       Most people turn on their one or two sources (usually a MSM source) and listen to the same propaganda. They don't care to look into it at all.

       They're going to take advantage of that and try to shape the narrative according to the agenda.

       That's because the government itself is responsible for the 9/11 truther movement. They have everyone distracted with structural engineers and whether or not jet fuel can melt steel beams which is so goddamn irrelevant. The real key pieces of information about 9/11 are that it was a false flag and Mossad is responsible. But no one asks questions about those things. They'd rather have you

       You can't pull the same stunt on 9/11 stuff because there is tons of actual evidence the official story is bullshit. Instead, you make up one yourself that is simple to debunk, and has no evidence that can hurt you if it is fully examined. They don't want more light shed on 9/11 but pizzagate is totally safe because they planted the story to begin with.

       No, so they can close down fake news sites, which is well underway. Perhaps, if they play their cards right they can even make fake news a criminal offense. This would be ideal. The UK just jailed someone for simply looking at pro-ISIS websites, and we know the UK is a testbed for what will be introduced here. They could also try to bring in identitiy-verified user IDs online, as China has been doing, so you cannot comment or post anonymously. Lots of fun stuff comes out of this for the PTB, and they hardly had to do anything at all, a few little planted hints, a few fake posts, some minor media coverage denying it. It writes itself.

       When they first started talking about banning fake news, I thought it would be the totally false clickbait sites that blatantly make up stories. The kind of sites that hire content creators and pay them $1 an article. Now, I am horrified to see that anything that is not a "popular" opinion is now considered fake news.

       That's because for 9/11 there was an actual crime and victims, and the conspiracy theories revolved around who really did it.  With pizzagate not a single victim has been produced.  It's all just conjecture based on a perceived "code" in emails and instagram posts.

       9/11 truth muckrakers are the single biggest reason most (actually, just about all) online mainstream media got rid of their comment section for articles. No matter how many people they censored, there was always someone pissing on their bullshit story in the comments. Yes, there was lots of threats hurled at 9/11 truth tellers back then too.

       "Conspiracy theory" was deployed as a weaponized term after the JFK assassination to discredit anyone questioning the Warren Commission. The term remained effective up until now. The "conspiracy theorists" have been demonstrably correct so many times that the psyop no longer works and now the "fake news" psyop has been deployed.

       Am I understanding this correctly? Claims that Russians were behind Wikileaks. BFD, that wasn't fake news and I don't think it came from Russian government. The election was only Trump's concern over fairness, he wins and now others want to make sure everything was correct. I thought they trusted the system until a winner was declared seemingly.
      </p>

       I don't put it past any government to plant fake news and it must suck when public chooses not to buy into desired story, but oh well.

       If I owned Comet Pizza, I'd add new marketing, Home of Pizzagate! Seriously, if anything happened there I'm pretty sure it's been covered up or moved. I could be wrong, but think there is an really scary group of people directing Pizzagate. Locating them will be the hard part as elitist don't like to get their hands dirty, but will pay well for gold nuggets others dig up.

       Different time in history, 9/11 truth was always a thing since the day it happened but it was easier to over look these things, 9/11 catalyst was a change. Even if that event happened exactly as the government said it happened it still caused a huge effect in our way of life all over the world. Today people are a bit more (rightfully) paranoid about things and news/memes travel a lot faster.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fake news narrative just the new conspiracy theorist. It won't work out well for them though since its very easy to point to the major networks lies. But hey panicked and needed a band aid solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where will this go? Who knows. I'm expecting people to die over this pizzagate and that will be what really sets things in motion. This gunman was just a test.
      </p>
      <p>
       It didn't even make the rounds on the media that much either, I only seen it in areas where people were actively discussing the topic. Could have been a test run to see who reacts and how.

       Yes of course, for the first and only time in human history, three steel framed skyscrapers collapsed due to primarily jet fulled office fires and just normal office fires for WTC7, all on the same day, in what looked exactly like controlled demolition, so they tell us.

       The US government then cam up with a a fantastical story for the day which has been proven false.
