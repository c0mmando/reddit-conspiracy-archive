       Apologies if this isn't the right sub...
Today two men in a personal vehicle (old jeep) cruised through the neighborhood before abruptly pulling into our driveway, and pulled out an extendable ladder. They propped the ladder onto a power line pole by our mailbox, and climbed up to where the transformer is housed. My husband saw them as he was leaving for work and asked what they were doing. They claimed to be contractors for the internet provider we use, but when asked for id or badges, they said they didn't have any. They got pretty defensive, and quickly worked on doing something to the wires. It was definitely suspicious to us because we live in a tucked away neighborhood. I called the internet provider to ask about it, and there were no work orders scheduled or reported on our property, and I was transferred to a supervisor who said that was completely out of the norm and that we should contact the police. The police came out, and we filed a report. We don't have cable, or phone lines-  just internet access.
 My question is what would someone be able to gain access to through the power lines/ internet cables? The power company, internet company, and police were very cautious and awkward..
What could be potentially gained from this? The guys with the ladder sped off in a hurry just after my husband walked to his truck to get a pen to take down the plate number (he got it either way). The cops said it's likely a bug of some kind or something to monitor internet data/passwords or info. The officers asked if someone was out to get us. The Jeep the guys used had tx plates, we're in VA. 
I don't know what to think of it, and neither does anyone else we've talked to. My husband's all like "well, your into conspiracies, so what does it mean"?.
I'm not in any way a paranoid person, even this doesn't worry me- I'm just curious as to what it means- but I've been looking into and researching a lot of shit, and it's a weird coincidence that this bizarre shit happened. 
Not trying to distract or post irrelevant shot, but wanted to share and see if anyone could help with what any of the above could possibly mean?
Thank you guys!
Edit: Friend came out, master electrician, checked it out, and there are cut and stripped wires which he said has been happening to people as a way to steal/hack info through data to obtain cc info.

       I'm not a really techy guy... But maybe it would be helpful if you posted a picture of the pole in question. It might help people understand what equipment is up there that could have something worth tampering with... it could have also been a simple theft attempt if there was something of value. People do some sketchy shit to steal copper.

       He said climb up and SEE what they installed.  Propping up a ladder near the pole and simply looking at the newly installed equipment WHILE ON YOUR OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY IS NOWHERE NEAR BEING A CRIME.

       Mulder and Scully visit the murderer's house, where Mulder sees a repairman working on the cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have led him to the murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder.

       I enjoy the x files, and I definitely love a conspiracy. But this was just a bit different, only because it was dumb and happened at home. I don't think anyone is out to get us, but I don't know enough about what would be of use to someone tampering with our power lines. No one involved with any of our provided services knows what it means. Currently, our good friend, who is a master electrician/welder is having a look.

       I suggest that you use some program to check your internet speed when only the computer that make the measurement is connected (disconnect all your others appliances of the internet), if it is more than one number under your nominal (18 instead of 20) go to your provider and ask for a change of your router and ask some friend that personalize your access point name, password (both of your router and of your connection) and install a good firewall, instead of the one that came with your S.O.

       Sounds like a direct tap or monitoring device.  Was the box they worked on changed?  Can you see any new equipment?  This was trespassing, and you should have demanded they leave, while recording the whole incident.  Why does no vide exist of this interaction?  ALWAYS film everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be forceful with these criminals.  Inform then that they are trespassing, and tell them to leave your property IMMEDIATELY.  If they don't/won't, take appropriate actions to secure your property.

       Have you contacted the police again with what your friend came up with? Was your electrician friend able to fix it? Did the police check it out meaning did they call someone to take a look at what accrued or did they just assume? What did the police say they would do or you should do? Sorry for all the questions but I'm just curious. Did the police check the plates to see who it connects too? It's just crazy that the police say it's odd but do nothing isn't it? This is legit interesting! Thank you.

       Our friend who came out was visiting (before we told him what happened), and didn't have any equipment with him, but he couldn't visually see anything off- but it was dark. The police said they were going to run the tags, and put a BOLO out for the tags- which he said would stick out like a sore thumb being that it was a TX plate. And you're right about it being weird because every company is just completely dumbfounded, but didn't offer any information or investigation. You would think at least the power company would want to check their lines if there was suspected tampering. We just wound up getting a new router and changing all passwords through a different network.

       I didn't get any pics of the guys, and it's hard to see if anything was put up there. It was by the transformer directly infront of our mailbox. The electric company came out, and didn't really do much than take down the info. They were really confused by it, and surprised the guys didn't get electrocuted. We just wound up changing all passwords on a different network and got a new router... Still confused by it all.

       I've been trying to download imgur, I have pics. They're dark being that it's dark out. But, no, I didn't climb the ladder because one, they took the ladder they brought when they left, and also we've found two electrically minified squirrels that have fallen from that power line. Not interested. I just wanted to know what info someone could get from installing something there. Either way, I anticipated the down votes from wanting feedback from a like minded community.
Thanks.

       Fair enough, but that doesn't explain why two people went out of their way to work on power lines for no reason, and then got hurried along by my husband approaching them in his private security uniform. I'm not worried or concerned, just curious to what could be done, or what the goal would be.

       Sounds like dismissing something very obvious to anyone that has ever grown weed. People tamper with electrical boxes to steal power
       <em>
        all the fucking time
       </em>
       . Seriously its very very likely. Also this would explain why they sped off. I'm not 100% sure but i am 90%. She should check her power bill and make a judgement from that.

       Ok, but that is a TV show. In real life, criminals are not stupid. CSI and Law and Order may want you to think that way, but there is a chain of command with criminals. Criminals who have a grow OP work for a bigger organization, and are given orders. They would never be given orders to do what OP has stated, in broad fuckin daylight (better means to an end). That is stupid. Meanwhile, the Sinoloa-Zetas cartel are building submarines, and the Crips, Bloods, and Counts (all working with Cartels and mobsters) are working with the CIA. This isn't a TV show, and to think otherwise, shows how naive you truly are. This isn't a boozer getting caught on cam trying to get more booze from a close 7-11.... This is organized crime...

       Ok so we know everything about what they had in their jeep right? We have no fucking clue what they were doing, I just provided an idea as to what I think it might have been. For all we know they could have had the wire right there in their vehicle but got spotted before hooking it up. Hell it could have been aliens dressed as humans working for the CIA installing a bug to listen to their dogs thoughts. Who knows.

       You don't even deserve a response but here you go. Your ego is outside what is known as this universe. I am going to keep you labeled as a lunatic. Because sometimes you are fine and sometimes you are a drunk egotistical fuck. You think i'm being a dick, you have no fucking clue. i'm not the one being a jackass on a sub which has rules against harassing people in the sub. Be glad i'm not reporting you for this because you at least make some good contributions to this sub but realize that your stupid shit is out there for others too see. I hope you can learn from this.

       Report me bitch. You want a safe place? Get bent, and head to Tumblr or other subs here on reddit. I can report you as well for your words (I never report people - not a lil whiny bitch and believe in free speech). You want me banned? I can get you banned as well. Try me...

       Sounds like dismissing something very obvious to anyone that has ever grown weed. People tamper with electrical boxes to steal power
       <em>
        all the fucking time

       . Seriously its very very likely. Also this would explain why they sped off. I'm not 100% sure but i am 90%. She should check her power bill and make a judgement from that.

       Fair enough, but that doesn't explain why two people went out of their way to work on power lines for no reason, and then got hurried along by my husband approaching them in his private security uniform. I'm not worried or concerned, just curious to what could be done, or what the goal would be.

       Ok, but that is a TV show. In real life, criminals are not stupid. CSI and Law and Order may want you to think that way, but there is a chain of command with criminals. Criminals who have a grow OP work for a bigger organization, and are given orders. They would never be given orders to do what OP has stated, in broad fuckin daylight (better means to an end). That is stupid. Meanwhile, the Sinoloa-Zetas cartel are building submarines, and the Crips, Bloods, and Counts (all working with Cartels and mobsters) are working with the CIA. This isn't a TV show, and to think otherwise, shows how naive you truly are. This isn't a boozer getting caught on cam trying to get more booze from a close 7-11.... This is organized crime...
