       Obviously, there's a lot covered up in the government.  It seems to be a rabbit hole that gets deeper and deeper.  Do you think there's something at the center?

       . You are far more special than they want you to think (You are a creator for the Creator created you). Love others, be kind, give with out expecting reciprocation. Realize self, and grow. We are here for a reason, though that reason may not be clear (and you may never truly understand). Our spirit beings chose to be here, to be tested.

       My guess is that it's a lack of something at the center, rather.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean if you imagine people at the top who have more money than they can spend, can get away with doing nearly anything, can go almost anywhere they want at any time they want, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       People with ordinary lives seem to often think of it in terms of what ordinary lives tend to lack. Money, power, thrill, a life with almost no inhibitions in regards to consequences. But people at the 'top' are often born into all of that, so none of that is their goal. Not anymore that it's your "goal" in life to make sure you have laundry detergent or to get Chinese takeout on the weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I assume that for most of them, there is a certain type of freedom that they
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       have, if JFK is any example to go by. They have
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       freedom than most in some ways, but at the end of the day, they share the same figurative shackles as the 9-5 office worker who can't tell his boss to fk off.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while the 9-5 office worker can distract and fulfill himself well enough with various small side goals throughout his life, to give himself and his shackles a sense of purpose and meaning, most of the people at the 'top' don't have that. Instead everything comes instantly and effortlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which means that if they want to have some sense of purpose and meaning, in order to justify their own shackles, then they have to come up with something that will take time, require strategy, the accumulation of resources, etc, but ultimately something that requires
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       than just the money and power they already have.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's where my own theory tends to differ from a lot of the conspiracy theory peers I've had over the years. From the science fiction angles like reptilians, to the occultist angles like the Illuminati, to the religious angles like Satanists, to the racist angles like Jewish people running the planet, to the angles of aliens and beyond, and all the various combinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I think it's nothing more than a bunch of bored, shitty people, doing corrupt, shitty things, like a bunch of sociopathic kids with an ant farm.

       Something at the center of the government conspiracies rabbit hole? Yeah, The Vatican is at the very center of it all.

       I once saw a photo of Hitler shaking hands with the Pope.

       I think the Black Pope is the top dude in the world. Funny how "religion" still pulls the strings. Perhaps it is more power and mind control than religion.

       Current Pope is the first ever Jesuit pope, so black pope is pulling his strings too. Have you checked out the stickied post in this sub about pizza leading to Rome?

       I think we are pawns in a global war of elites, who are an ever-changing coalition that spins in the wind like a rooster on a barn roof.

       Their goals do not always align. There is always a 'loser.' But to them it is a game that means increased (or lost) reputation. It is a game that has spanned centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any given moment, the allies in this game change, the teams evolve, dependent on what is desired. They think not at all about us, the little people.

       They are constantly, against each other, trying to consolidate power. And in the rare cases when power is actually consolidated, they use that power to dictate their wishes. Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, Trump America, Pol Pot, and on and on. Those leaders were not the power. They were the result.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one at the top of this food chain cares about us. They care about themselves. And each other, depending on the goals and alliances of the moment.

       Satan.
Then the unholy Roman Empire, Synagogue of Satan, financial institutions and the rest of the usual suspects (TPTB) under his command. Then a few layers down the pyramid you have Reddit and the crap we interact with more directly day to day, receiving orders from higher up.
Total world domination.
Oh, by the way, the triangle with an eye in it was a Catholic symbol before Freemasons used it. No joke.

       The elephant at the bottom of the rabbit hole:
       <a href="http://www.unz.com/article/political-sciences-theory-of-everything/">
        Political Science's "Theory of Everything"
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The 7 “Blind” men and the US Elephant
       </p>
       <p>
        The famous Indian story of the Blind Men and the Elephant is a metaphor highlighting that while one’s subjective experience can be true, it can also be limited by its failure to account for other truths or a totality of truth. A similar metaphor can be used to try to explain the hidden forces guiding the US Government...
       </p>
       <p>
        Contemporary main-stream pundits now openly describe these hidden forces as a “shadow government,” a “corporatocracy” or a “deep state” controlling American politics. None however can do justice to what truly is an amorphous, complex and intricate web of overlapping entities. All who have tried to define who really governs America have essentially behaved as “blind” men.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       While the conditions that have led to the evolution of the US gov't's current form are unique to America, any system which distributes power is going to attract the full scale of humans seeking power, from mere ambition to full-on sociopathy. The variance between gov't systems is more a reflection of those differing external conditions (geography, resources, time) than it is an indication of disparate human motivations.
