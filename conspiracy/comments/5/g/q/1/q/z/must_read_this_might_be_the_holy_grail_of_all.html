This goes back about 2100 years and these power holders have been playing us since. They literally are the decedents of the worshipers of Baal. All the sick things they do is for power and the belief that they will eventually rule the universe through the Occult religion they worship. </p>

<p>Part 1-3:</p>

<p>This highly secretive Khazarian Mafia works directly with money to control it. In the end, they seek total destruction of the minds of the masses, a break up of families, lots of drug addiction, gangs, cartels, ect.. They control almost all of the systems in America, England, and Israel. There is a lot of information inside including Hitler, false flags and more. </p>

<p>It seems that the internet, originally developed to spy on the masses, has backfired on them and become a source for alternative media that is slowly exposing this Kahzarian Mafia. They have even posted nukes in major cities in case something goes wrong and they have to detonate. Its pretty sick stuff and Rothschild is definitely one of the top members and the face of the Mafia. They worship Baal and the Owl worshipped in Bohemian Grove has something to do with worshipping Baal. They even drink the blood of children to empower themselves and they eat the hearts of the children. Hell, they were responsible for the murder of 100 million Russians during the Bolshevik movement. </p>

<p>Please read. These articles hold a LOT of clues on what&#39;s happening here and now but this group has been at work for about 2100 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That <a href="https://webbrain.com/brainpage/brain/A4276BA6-CF6E-8995-4C91-9ED993EC7D98/parent/com.thebrain.webbrain.pages.clientsupport.BrainFullPage#-42">owl of bohemian grove</a> has been associated with</p>

<ul>
<li>Moloch</li>
<li>Mammon</li>
<li>Minerva</li>
<li>Baal</li>
<li>Lilith</li>
<li>Isis (Queen of Heaven of Antiquity of many names)</li>
<li>Hecate</li>
</ul>

<p>The name &quot;bohemia&quot; refers to ancient czech republic and eastern germany; which was the epicenter of the rosicrucian / alchemical movement to transform europe through craft / magic.  So in trying to decide what the Owl represents, I&#39;d look at esoteric christian symbolisim, celtic magic tradition and nordic magic tradition for the answer; the esoteric christian symbolism comes from israel, italy, greece, egypt and turkey/syria.  </p>

<p>My money is on the owl being greek goddess of magic, death, darkness Hecate.  I can explain why, but it would take a while. I&#39;ll just summarize by saying the statue of liberty / lady columbia is hecate, and you know by several icongraphical features but most salient is the fact she&#39;s placed at a crossroads of 3 rivers or tri-via, which is her roman name, and she is emblematic both the danger and opportunity offered to newcomers greeted by her as the main port of immigration.  The same ppl who came up with columbia / french guy who built the statue, and built the cities also put the owl on the dollar and meet at bohemian grove--the high level freemasons</p>
