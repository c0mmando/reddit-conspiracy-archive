    <div class="md"><p>You have to keep in mind how lazy/apathetic the average person is regarding this. I am literally the only person in my family (my family on my dad&#39;s side alone is 20+) that has done any kind of research at all. Mention pizzagate and I&#39;ve been met with blank stares and/or scoffs about not believing in such non-sense. I asked one family member what kind of research they had done and was not at all surprised to hear that they had done zero research and simply took what CNN told them at face value. This is what scares me more than anything. People just seem to not give a fuck at all about this. The shiny TV tells them it&#39;s &quot;fake&quot; so it&#39;s &quot;fake&quot;. Fuck doing research or having your own original thought process though right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its also because they just can&#39;t grasp how unspeakably evil this whole thing is. Rather than facing the diabolical truth, they shut it out and use the &#39;CNN told me&#39; argument so they atleast have <em>someone</em> that tells them its all good. </p>

<p>For example, my girlfriend isn&#39;t as tv-blanked as most people and she believes me when I say there is something horrible going on, but she doesn&#39;t want to think about it or talk about it or read about it. I&#39;ve tried to show her dozens of summaries but she just refuses because she says she can&#39;t handle it. It makes her sick to her stomach to think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the whole thing is so evil and that&#39;s why people won&#39;t accept it. 
Take my uncle. He is over 40 and is hellbent that pizzagate isn&#39;t real. He said I was insulting his intelligence to even suggest it was happening. I don&#39;t understand what is so outlandish about these theories though, I really don&#39;t, not to the point of vehemently denying it even though I&#39;ve given him all the evidence we have. </p>

<p>The worst part is, he believes pizzagate isn&#39;t real because &quot;half of what you read on the internet is lies&quot; and he believes the MSM is not lying. &quot;Why would RT lie to me?&quot; he says. He actually believes the fucking BBC over hard working research people have done. I guess there&#39;s no hope for him. I actually can&#39;t argue with him anymore it makes me too mad.</p>

<p>A much more likely explanation is that</p>

<p>1) the election is over, and <a href="/r/thedonald">/r/thedonald</a> and <a href="/r/hillaryforprison">/r/hillaryforprison</a> (and many other subs) now have an enormous mobilized and energetic base with nothing to do.</p>

<p>2) so they&#39;ve focused on pizzagate, because it still (in theory) would harm their opponents, as well as being justice porn/vigilante vindication.</p>

<p>3) now this stuff is hitting <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> night and day, exposing it to a huge amount of people who are skeptical or think it&#39;s outright nonsense clogging up reddit, not to mention subs like <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. So you fell for it, I am sorry. Now you are so sure you are willing to do the work of those trying to censor us. Brilliant.</p>

<p>You think fake news was not designed at least partially to censor PG related discussion? Or that they need more? They even passed a law already. We are toast.</p>

<p>They are not afraid of pizzagate. They just are liberals and don&#39;t like Trumpers. That is the game here. Next election won&#39;t go the same way, because groups like CTR are smart. They have set up the control mechanism necessary to censor non-liberal discussions. The MSM is owned by liberals, as is hollywood. The entire propaganda arm of the US government is essentially against PG and conservatives in general.</p>

<p>George Soros is paying for this to happen.</p>

<p>Accusing an otherwise innocent person of being part of an international satanic child trafficking cult is a wild claim. The speculation is based on conflating together disparate piece of unrelated information, out of context, assuming evil and criminal intent, and arriving at a vague conclusion. Any person would be shocked by being on the receiving end of such accusations. I think I can say without a doubt they are wild claims; wouldn&#39;t the gravity of such crimes be so?</p>

<p>Jimmy Saville&#39;s crimes are not evidence of Comet Ping Pong being a bedrock of satanic pedophila. And Saville was not part of a &quot;ring&quot;.</p>

<p>Well my view is that pizzagate is doing no harm by bringing this to more people&#39;s attention.</p>

<p>If the comet ping pong people are innocent, that&#39;s great, there are simple ways they could have proven that by now. Instead, they&#39;re raising more and more suspicion. </p>

<p>Instead of saying &quot;hey look, people, of course we don&#39;t hurt children, come take a look around our facility and then eat some pizza&quot;, they have the NYT and some of the biggest news publications in the country simultaneously start defending a pizza shop (just one of about 70,000 pizza shops in the US). Does this raise any red flags with you as a journalist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The handkerchief code for white. The only code that suggests pedophilia according to the picture they give. The rest of the codes come from Wikipedia, but Wikipedia doesn&#39;t show a code for white, so I looked it up. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a set code for white, but the two common codes are vanilla sex and masturbation.</p>

<p>The Antinous statue in Alefantis&#39; twitter profile picture. They ruled that it is related to pedestry, therefore pedophilia. Despite how common pederasty was in the Greek empire, I dug further into the Wikipedia article used to find out the relationship to pederasty. Turns out, Antinous was popularized in western culture that associated him with homosexuality by people like Oscar Wilde. Alefantis is gay, so it is of no surprise he&#39;d use homosexual icons to represent his sexual orientation. </p>

<p>Many other concerns really revolve around the gay community working at Pizza Comet. A gay man poses with a pizza on his crotch and some honey. A photoshopped image of the restaurant with with gay overtones. Things like that. </p>

<p>References to satanic ritual abuse. We are taught about the 80s hysteria over satanic ritual abuse in intro to psychology. Turns out psychologists back then thought they could bring out repressed memories, and their clients would talk about SRA and sexual abuse by their parents, too. Turned out repressed memory recall was a product of bad science, and people were generating false memories that tore families apart. This opened up new areas of research in psychology regarding how false memories, and is still a problem regarding police confessions where innocent people honestly believed they committed crimes later found to be not guilty of. </p>

<p>Criticism of art preferences. Morbid art is appreciated by many. The morbid is a fascinating thing. Pizzagate started on 4chan, ironically, a bastion of morbid jokes and pictures. My favorite pice if &quot;evidence&quot; are the pictures of band posters. These band posters are made in retro style that harkens back to the psychedelic music scene if the 60s and 70s. Even Pink Floyd had morbid psychedelic posters. Fascination with morbid art and judging these people for their art tastes is akin to McCarthyism. Any tenuous link to SRA is considered solid evidence to the pizzagate community.</p>

<p>Portugal abduction? Happened in 2007. First line of evidence? A Podesta email of a trip tout Portugal in 2015. Second line of evidence? Police sketches of two men who look very close to the Podesta brothers. Problem? The two very different looking sketches were made from a couple describing the same event. The couple saw the event together at the same time and were describing one man of whom, they said, looked like a typical Portuguese man. If you look up average Portuguese man,  you&#39;ll find a composite image made of several Portuguese men that resemble the police sketches. </p>

<p>Pictures of kids? I&#39;m in my 30s, my FB wall is filled with pictures of kids from parents. Nothing new, nothing special. </p>

<p>Jeffery Dahmer like statue? It represents a man falling, hence it is hung up with arms  and legs outwards rather than it being displayed in the floor with folded arms and legs like one of Dahmer&#39;s victims.</p>

<p>Pedophile code images? Common geometric shapes probably adopted from pop culture references. The heart?  Not only does it look nothing like the picture from the website they link, it originated with the logo used for Good Humor ice cream (the identical heart). </p>

<p>References to pizza scattered in the emails? Well, shit, I eat a lot of pizza. So does any department at universities for get togethers and meetings. You&#39;ll find several references to pizza in my academic emails.  Cheese pizza (CP) to child porn started out as a 4chan joke before pizzagate was ever a thing. </p>

<p>My favorite is the TMNT pizza picture posted by Alefantis. The damning part were two comments left on the post. One guy whose username is drnwo, another conspiracy theory reference, the other had &quot;kek&quot; in his username and a subtle reference to pepe if you check his odd references. Clearly 4channers &quot;touching the poop&quot; as we call it when a person under Internet criticism is contacted by the members of the community doing the criticizing.</p>

<p>The list goes on, but pizzagate internet detectives have done very little to delve deeper into their own claims. It&#39;s a perfect example of sense out of nonsense. Bible code level rigor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A child with hands taped on the table smiling to the camera suggests no fowl play to me. Seems like a joke about dealing with annoying kids, as they can often be. </p>

<p>Chickenlovers can mean anything. Maybe he really enjoyed that south park episode entitled &quot;Chickenlover&quot; and made a joke. That entire picture was full of nonsense editing for a desperate hunt for clues. They pointed to a necklace and called it a bracelet. Sex bracelets, for one thing, is an urban legend started when kids got big into the charity bracelet fad. </p>

<p>Back to chickenlover, their definition only exists in an obscure online slang dictionary likely entered after pizzagate became popular. The oldest slang definition is on urban dictionary, which makes no reference to pedophilia. </p>

<p>These things aren&#39;t evidence. They aren&#39;t suspicious. There are a number of innocuous alternative explanations. I&#39;d have my ass handed to me if I presented my research in this format at my lab meetings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody should investigate pedophilia based on internet crusaders pouring over 20,000 e-mails and twitter posts until they found a narrative that supports their preconceived conclusions. That is not a scientific strategy. </p>

<p>And the thing is, a conclusion has already been drawn. Now I&#39;m being accused of defending suspected pedophiles despite living in a country where people are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. The evidence amounts to e-mails referencing pizza, a handkerchief, a geometric triangle pattern akin <a href="https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/276019/326203988/stock-vector-geometric-v-letter-inverted-triangle-logo-326203988.jpg">to</a> <a href="http://logok.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Linkin-Park-Logo.png">very</a> <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/07/5c/ed/075cedb585dda65e6e9d2dd522f00548.jpg">popular</a> <a href="http://bashooka.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/geometric-logo-templates-22.jpg">pattern</a> co-opted by pedophiles, a heart that resembles nothing like the pattern of a pedophilic symbol, originated with <a href="http://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/1wUAAOSwNyFWgr5S/s-l300.jpg">Good Humor ice cream</a>, a <a href="https://www.prlog.org/11249013-the-pong-network-logo.jpg">common</a> <a href="http://www.wordans.ca/wvc-1374442680/wordansfiles/images/2013/7/21/199946/199946_340.jpg">design</a> for <a href="http://pingpongranking.com/images/logo.png">ping pong paddles</a> used on a menu at a restaurant that, with enough squinting, resembles a pedophile pattern of a butterfly. </p>

<p>Furthering their agenda, pizzagate investigators linked Podestas and Pizza Comet to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse#Skepticism">satanic ritual abuse myth</a> based on art preferences alone. A portuguese kidnapping of police sketches that look like the <a href="http://i876.photobucket.com/albums/ab329/786512/lo12/01/706ebc04.jpg">average Portuguese male</a>. Handkerchief code for white that supposedly means something to do with juveniles, <a href="http://www.ravenews.ca/en/read/2010/october/31/">but</a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/marysatlanta/4115766450">evidence</a> <a href="http://media.tumblr.com/255916d557ddd93a793f031283bfbdde/tumblr_inline_mrj0qznYBJ1qz4rgp.png">suggests</a> <a href="http://viceland-assets-cdn.vice.com/blogs/en/files/2011/05/hanky1.jpg">otherwise</a>. </p>

<p>Looking to deeply into photos to find incriminating evidence. The chickenlover photo called a NECKLASS and bracelet, then gave a color code for the bracelet even though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_bracelet#Urban_legend_of_sex_bracelets">sex bracelets is an urban legend</a>. Creepy band posters that resemble posters of <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b2/55/12/b25512f1c0fa4f3dcadd93ac1ce56817.jpg">psychedelic</a> <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/3a/49/9b/3a499bdbaf33da056421f38889145371.jpg">rock</a> of the<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/429953095659094181/"> 60s and 70s</a>. </p>

<p>Yes, your character assassinations are TOTALLY justified. Just like everyone should be suspicious when a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/18/will-self-reported-suspected-paedophile">man walks with his child.</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve hit the critical pieces of &quot;evidence&quot; with my posts. Regardless, I&#39;m clearly open to evaluate any other pieces of evidence presented to me, but all I&#39;ve been getting is complete dismissal for not accepting the current narrative of pizzagate. </p>

<p>But the dangerous thing about promoting pizzagate and claiming that these pieces of evidence are powerful is that it can ruin innocent lives. We have a knee-jerk reaction to pedophilia because it is deplorable, but we have to be careful of assuming guilt based on tenuous evidence. People blindly believe that pizzagate is absolutely real without a hint of skepticism. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve done my part in providing alternate explanations for the major claims surrounding pizzagate. And I have been more than accommodating with regards to countering further arguments which you have presenting, like the chickenlover example. Instead of providing me further challenges, you threw your hands up and accuse me of defending suspected pedophiles, and that I selectively chosen pieces of evidence to criticize. Well, present me with more evidence and I&#39;d be more than happy to look into them. What powerful pieces of evidence do you want me to examine that I have not already? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well no</p>

<p>People getting suspicious of &#39;a man walking with child&#39; is <a href="http://tedgunderson.info/index_htm_files/US%20Customs%20Service%20Report%20of%20Investigation%20FINDERS.pdf">the whole reason The Finders were discovered (and subsequently covered up)</a>. And they were simply playing in a playground.</p>

<p>You&#39;re further welcome to individually discount everything that&#39;s been uncovered - because indeed there has not yet been a smoking gun - but your warning about the dangers of investigation are bizarre for two reasons. 1 - To use your own argument, what kind of harm would be done if the allegations were true but kept being denied? A lot more than what&#39;s happening to this guy &amp; his pizza shop. and 2 - Why are you defending them on the internet, instead of them putting an end to this themselves? It would literally take 1 youtube video of someone being allowed to thoroughly search Comet Ping Pong for the existence of the denied basement, etc. And if it&#39;s a family-friendly establishment, there should really be no reason why not... Instead, millions of dollars are being spent in front of your eyes just to discredit the theory and attack the researchers... Apparently to defend one of 70,000 pizza shops in the US... Because obviously there&#39;s nothing to see.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why Andrew Brietbart was making the same accusations against Podesta five years ago before he died. That&#39;s why Monica Petersen&#39;s family says she was murdered in Haiti last month while investigating the Clinton Foundation &amp; child trafficking. That&#39;s why Max Spiers&#39; mom says he was investigating pedophiles when he died. That&#39;s why thousands of government employees were found to be pedophiles and nothing was done about it. That&#39;s why Hillary Clinton and the Pope himself are trying to silence it. Because there&#39;s nothing to see here.</p>

<p>People getting suspicious of &#39;a man walking with child&#39; is the whole reason The Finders were discovered (and subsequently covered up)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading the report, an anonymous caller was concerned when two men wearing suits and ties were supervising 6 children who were &quot;dirty and unkempt&quot;. It turned out they were covered in bug bites, incredibly dirty, not bathed for several days, and many of the children were not wearing underwear. Furthermore, their van clearly appeared like the 2 men and 6 children were living inside--they were arrested for child abuse charges and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/us/inquiry-spreads-on-6-children-and-cult.html">slapped with felonies upon further investigation</a>. This goes far beyond a man simply walking with his child in public. Curiously, this is the only information I can find about the alleged Finders cult. How do we know if this a cover up? The link you sent me came from a site dedicated to Ted Gunderson, who earnestly believed in conspiracies range from the US being responsible for the 1993 WTC bombing, the US setting up the Oklahoma City bombing, Satanic Ritual Abuse, and the NWO. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>what kind of harm would be done if the allegations were true but kept being denied? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the allegations have to be reasonable for an appropriate investigation. So far, nobody has found the allegations to be reasonable outside of niche internet communities. The real question is, why? Why do you think nobody from the local police to the FBI have bothered to investigate this issue if there is clear probable cause? I can surmise why, but let&#39;s get to that later.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is akin to the dangerous argument, &quot;why do you care about privacy if you have nothing to hide?&quot; Edward Snowden, whom I have a great deal of respect for and yearn for a pardon, leaked classified documents regarding the US government&#39;s mass surveillance on US citizens. Why should we care about what the NSA does if we have nothing to hide? </p>

<p>Imagine you are driving on the interstate to go your favorite concert. You have no open container of alcohol in your car and no drugs. However, you borrowed a DVD from your friend and accidentally left it in the car, the DVD is Half Baked. The officer asks where you are going, you tell him a concert. He immediately notices the Half Baked DVD box and becomes suspicious that you may be harboring marijuana in your vehicle. He asks you if he can search your car. What do you say? If you say no. He bothers you further, and tells you, &quot;if I just do a quick search of your vehicle, you can go about your day and make it to your concert in a timely manner without having to worry about parking. If you have nothing to hide, this will be quick.&quot; Would you agree to those terms?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>millions of dollars are being spent ... to discredit the theory and attack the researchers</p>

<p>Can you verify that millions of dollars are being spent to discredit pizzagate and attack people partaking in the internet investigation?</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Breitbart</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewBreitbart/status/33636278100561920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Tweet in question.</a>. Breitbart determined that Podesta was part of a mass coverup of child sex trafficking rings <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CyTPH-GUkAAgvmL.jpg:large">Planned Parenthood (PP)</a> and <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CyTAe4JWEAEa4l7.jpg:large">ACORN</a>. PP had several undercover investigations by LiveAction to demonstrate PP supports and aids sex traffickers trying to get services for their underaged prostitutes. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/01/AR2011020106135.html">In all but one case, authorities were alerted regarding these sex traffickers.</a> prior to LiveAction releasing videos, but with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuoI8vbtPvM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">a notable exception</a>. PP fired that woman for her actions. ACORN was also implicated in sex trafficking of minors by O&#39;Keefe, but was cleared of wrongdoing after several investigations due to O&#39;Keefe&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACORN_2009_undercover_videos_controversy">artistic license and lying regarding his heavily edited videos</a>. Breitbart earnestly believed the O&#39;Keefe documentary, however, the raw footage from the ACORN videos presented an entirely different picture than what they painted. As it turns out, according to California&#39;s Attorney General documents, Vera (the interviewee of ACORN) <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press_releases/n1888_acorn_report.pdf">reported the situation to authorities. (read pages 16 and 17 of this document to save yourself some time)</a>. So Breitbart was accusing Podesta of covering up unsubstantiated sex trafficking supported by Planned Parenthood and ACORN.</p>

<p>Breitbart&#39;s death. His death really came at no surprise to anybody. Prior to his death, he already had a history with heart problems, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA2YIQr1XM4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=100">having suffered a heart attack before.</a> Additionally, further rumors came out to support that foul play was going on with the death of coroner Michael Cormier. I am anticipating that I would get this as a followup response. <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/news/andrew-breitbarts-fans-think-his-coroner-was-suspiciously-poisoned-to-death-2388318">Cormier did not perform the autopsy of Breitbart.</a></p>

<p><strong>Monica Petersen</strong></p>

<p>If we believe Monica Petersen&#39;s friend, and I don&#39;t see why we shouldn&#39;t, she certainly was <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TmiB2gU.png">critical of the Clinton Foundation.</a> Petersen, however, was not in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/12/06/another-false-pizzagate-tale-the-death-of-a-sex-worker-activist-in-haiti/">Haiti to investigate the Clinton Foundation nor child trafficking</a>. While the reference I linked is critical of pizzagate and comes from Washington Post, they are citing the chief director of her employer, <a href="http://www.du.edu/korbel/faculty/destree.html">Claude d’Estree</a> of the Human Trafficking Center. The Human Trafficking Center has an <a href="http://www.snopes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/human-trafficking-center.jpg">unfavorable opinion</a> of those making allegations that she was murdered.</p>

<p>I found a rather questionable article referencing a <a href="http://wikileaksdecrypted.com/journalist-monica-petersen-found-dead-undergoing-child-trafficking-investigation/">person speaking for Petersen that&#39;s rather damning for the Clinton Foundation</a>. I cannot find this information anywhere else, and therefore cannot determine the validity of it as a result.</p>

<p>Additionally, I cannot find anything stating that Petersen&#39;s family thinks she was murdered. Could you provide some references for me?</p>

<p><strong>Max Spiers</strong></p>

<p>Max Spiers was, indeed, an interesting character. His main interest seemed to be investigating UFOs and the paranormal. People have speculated that his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/uk-conspiracy-theorists-mother-fears-he-was-murdered-in-poland">research into UFOs is what led to his demise.</a></p>

<p>Max Spiers&#39; death may not be surprising considering he had an opiate addiction, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUTU5fNmpvY">according to his mother.</a> He struggled with addiction, although he may have been clean for a long period of time. But as anyone knows, when opiate users relapse, they often overdose by taking the dose they used to take prior to being clean. This may have been the case of what happened to my cousin with heroin, or it may have been more likely that my cousin died from badly cut heroin. Spiers suffered from headaches and vomited black blood, which sounds like intestinal bleeding. <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/52ll4v/black_vomit/">Someone posted on an opiates subreddit explaining the same issues of headaches and black vomit from three days of opiate tea use.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4KrCzit1o">Here is Spiers&#39; last interview</a>, he is clearly slurring his words and unable to speak articulately.</p>

<p>Was he investigating pedophilia? In the interview, I think he did mention something about child abuse, but I didn&#39;t listen to the entire thing because he&#39;s difficult to understand (like Ozzy Osbourne levels). The only other sources I could find on his investigations regarding pedophilia are from very sketchy tabloid websites like The Daily Mail and The Sun, and many websites I&#39;ve never heard of before that clearly post similarly alarming content. </p>

<p><strong>Government pedophilia</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_paedophile_dossier">Yes</a>, shit like this does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6W8H5Z0XAc">happen more</a> than we&#39;d like to admit. <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42108748/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/massive-online-pedophile-ring-busted-cops/">Although we can&#39;t say nothing is done about these situations.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why Hillary Clinton and the Pope himself are trying to silence it. Because there&#39;s nothing to see here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Catholic church certainly has its sordid history with child sex abuse. But we&#39;re still speculating that Hillary Clinton is involved. Perhaps we could even argue that there is another conspiracy that all of these allegations exist to bring down the Clinton, and in conjunction, the Democratic bid for 2016. Republicans have been after the Clintons for decades, with the only thing that stuck to Bill Clinton was his affair with Monica Lewinsky, where he lied under oath. Hillary Clinton has been tagged with a number of scandals in an attempt to bring her down, which, ultimately, ended up wildly successful for Republicans. So perhaps this pizzagate scandal was engineered as high up as the upper echelons of the GOP, implanted in the hypervigilant /pol/ chan communities to rile up the alt- and new-right emerging base. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They are still private businesses with some expectation of privacy. There is nothing stopping you from going to Pizza Comet to the publicly accessible areas. Other areas are closed off to the public, often for good reasons for restaurants to avoid health code violations, and we have regulators to investigate those areas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your critique of Brietbart is that his claims were unsubstantiated... really missing the point there.. point is his claims were extremely relevant to pizzagate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, my critique of Breitbart came from the source, his twitter posts. I needed context, and he railed against the Podesta because of topics relevant at the time: Planned Parenthood and ACORN. That&#39;s why I included those additional twitter posts as links so you can see the context. Imagine arguing with a fundamentalist Christian over the meaning of a particular Bible verse they interpret. Is it not valid to criticize their interpretation based on the context of that verse?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monica Petersen - you can do a search on this sub if you&#39;re interested. What her friends and family are saying is vastly different from the washington post. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not just the Washington Post, it&#39;s from her employer quoted in WashPost. I even provided a link to a post from her employer disparaging pizzagate for linking her untimely death to a political scandal. </p>

<p>However, I encourage you to link me directly to additional sources that provide me further information. This should be something you should have on hand or, at least, be able to quickly find. Google searches pull up a lot of noise from very sketchy websites. It&#39;s hard to dissect out the credible sources as a result. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Funny you discredit former FBI agent Gunderson while most of your links are from MSM publications that are known liars. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gunderson is used as an argument from authority. Even the most respected, Nobel Prize winning scientists have believed in the craziest of things regardless of scientific evidence (factually incorrect things): Linus Pauling, James Watson, Kary Mullis, etc. </p>

<p>The MSM still has reliable information. The biggest issue I have with the MSM are in two major areas: 1. They&#39;re still in the hands of the CIA and 2. They&#39;re guilty of omission, rather than fabrication</p>

<p>My preferred source of news comes from The Intercept, but I like to keep my options broad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spiers - you couldn&#39;t understand him? how is that a relevant argument..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I provided a lot more information about Spiers other than his Ozzy Osbourne style of communication. I think the most parsimonious explanation of his death is simply due to his drug relapse. Opioids are nothing to fuck with, especially when you alternate between being clean and relapsing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Hillary is innocent because scandals have been made up about her in the past... ok</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Innocent until proven guilty. She has been under trial how many times? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well you sure seem eager to deny what&#39;s right in front of you. Most of your reasoning is laughable, to me. Feels like I&#39;m wasting my time take care.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you don&#39;t bother to take the time to elaborate my supposed failings in logic. You hand wave them away and call it a victory. I&#39;m making the effort, why aren&#39;t you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>B+ for effort
D- for research and logic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More arrogance and condescension. If you&#39;re not willing to bother countering my points with your own references and logic, what business do you have arguing from any level of authority? </p>

<p>I&#39;m arguing from the perspective of a skeptic and a scientist. Here are the basics of the scientific method:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make an observation of some phenomenon (An event occurs)</li>
<li>Ask a question about that phenomenon (Why does this event occur?)</li>
<li><strong>a.</strong> Generate a hypothesis (This event occurs because of this reason) <strong>b.</strong> Use existing data that justifies your hypothesis. <strong>c.</strong> Your hypothesis must be testable.</li>
<li><strong>a.</strong> Design an experiment to test your hypothesis. <strong>b.</strong> The experiment must be designed with the explicit purpose of falsifying it.</li>
<li>Make a prediction of the results of your experiment if the hypothesis is true.</li>
<li>If your experiment failed to support your hypothesis, generate a new hypothesis. If your experiment supported your hypothesis, generate a new experiment to determine if your hypothesis holds up under a different angle. </li>
<li>All experiments must generate new questions to be investigated. There is no such thing as a terminal experiment.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some implicit strategies are used in the scientific process. You want to employ Ockham&#39;s Razor. The most reasonable explanation is the one that is the most parsimonious, meaning the explanation relies on the least possible amount of unsubstantiated claims. The other major strategy is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. </p>

<p>I have been extraordinarily patient and incredibly detailed and meticulous when addressing your claims. If you sincerely believe this is a major issue that implicates the lives of children, I would think it would be your top priority to do everything you can to give me the very best effort and evidence to convince me to support your cause. If this is real, and you honestly believe this, then why aren&#39;t you making a greater investment to build you case as to prompt a legitimate investigation?</p>

<p>I figured it would end up here.

    <div class="md"><p>You gave me one leaked document. I guess to arouse suspicion that all males around children is reasonable enough probable cause to assume pedophilia. That means that I should always have to prove my innocence if I have children and want to take them to a playground without their mother.</p>

<p>Historical examples mean what? What historical examples are we talking about? Do you even know? That pedophilia can occur under our radar, even though they&#39;re eventually exposed? Shouldn&#39;t that promote faith in the system?</p>

<p>What late journalists? Petersen? You have to believe her employer is <strong>lying</strong> about why she was in Haiti. You have to take it by faith that somebody nobody has ever heard of until her death was murdered by the Clintons to silence her, even though this would, obviously, result in the Streisand Effect. Somehow, the Clintons are smart enough to get away around massive conspiracies, but too dumb to recognize the Streisand Effect. </p>

<p>Or Spiers, this guy believed in several conspiracy theories. He died early, why? He struggled with drugs. The fact that he promoted many conspiracies that most of the world dismisses made him the least possible threat. He died because he fucked up when he relapsed. He wasn&#39;t on anybody&#39;s radar other than fringe communities. His unexpected death as a result of murder would be stupid to any fucking intelligence agency. Never arouse suspicion, especially when someone is considered a nutjob. You know who coined the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;? The CIA. Conspiracy theories existed before the CIA coined the term, but they defined the pejorative, and society accepts this. Spiers was no threat as a result. Again, his death would only result in the Streisand Effect as a result of a calculated assassination. Nobody would have believed him if he uncovered the truth other than small communities. The best strategy would have been to let him do whatever he wanted because he was of no threat.</p>

<p>As far as everything else. I provided plausible deniability. If I can poke holes in your claims based on existing evidence, then you don&#39;t have a strong case. That means you must build a stronger case. You might be right, but your presentation is terrible. This is often the case for graduate students (like myself) in the sciences. </p>

<p>As for the MSM. I honestly believe it&#39;s hard to sell out if you are truly passionate. The MSM is never completely controlled, even if influenced heavily by certain authorities, like the CIA. This means developing a discerning eye. It&#39;s easy to dismiss it completely, but what do you have left? Sources you never heard before making outlandish claims? Renegade members of the FBI and the CIA who make very interesting claims without proof? What about ex-FBI and ex-CIA agents that contradict them? Who is right? Who is wrong? Who is just fucking nuts?</p>

<p>We are not in a post-fact society. We were never in a fact society to begin with. So who do we trust? Why do we trust them? What is credible? How do we determine credibility?</p>

<p>This, ultimately, boils down to philosophy. For a primer in this area, look at Peirce&#39;s pragmatism (or, as he redefined it, pragmaticism), and James&#39; pragmatism (Peirce disagreed with James&#39; stances, hence Peirce continued his work under the header of pragmaticism). </p>

<p>I can tell you never thought this deeply before. This is not an insult, but it&#39;s readily apparent when somebody has never left the &quot;doubt&quot; phase reasoning when it comes to certain authority. You will dismiss this, but I hope you remember this discussion and think about it over time. Think about how weird reality is. Think about how hard establishing conspiracies truly is as you increase the number people involved. Think about what we know about human psychology, advances in neurology. Think about the uncomfortable truths of Terror Management Theory. Think about how reality is always unattainable, but probabilistic. Think. </p>

She graduated with a Master&#39;s in &quot;<a href="http://www.prayfuneral.com/obituaries/Monica-Petersen/#!/Obituary">International Development with a concentration in Human Trafficking from the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado in 2014</a>&quot;</p>

<p>She was employed by the Human Trafficking Center (HTC) listed above until June of 2016. This is correctly stated in the Washington Post. The Washington Post made it pretty clear, giving the organization she was tied to, that she he interests in human trafficking. The website links to a Colorado senate meeting article back in January of 2015, which she was employed under HTC, the director of the HTC is Claude d’Estree. </p>

<p>Here obituary I liked further went on to say about her recent activities in Haiti:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After leaving her position at the Korbel School this past June, she moved to Haiti in September to teach and set up an NGO (non-governmental organization). At the time of her death she was teaching Social Sciences at the Union School in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>HTC&#39;s Facebook account has gone on record to discussed her untimely death in Haiti in her involvement regarding advocating for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/humantraffickingcenter/posts/10154194973851395">sex workers</a>. Yes, she was there to also start up an NGO. </p>

<p>Your link has gone on to quote her mother:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monica was teaching social studies at the union school and working to start a non-governmental organization. The NGO that she wanted to get started was an affordable guest house for volunteers in Haiti, which would have then helped her fund research in human trafficking, which we now know never came to pass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unsurprising that she wanted to use her NGO to fund her endeavors involving human trafficking. The NGO never took off because she died two months later. This means that between her responsibilities of teaching and work regarding sex workers, she was also investigating human trafficking. Okay, this is plausible, but is it supported by the facts? </p>

<p>The article gets a little long winded to build up a case that Petersen is still interested in human trafficking (no shit). After slogging through some of that, we finally get back to Haiti and Clinton.</p>

<p>Your link states that Petersen was not writing a 2 year, 110 page expose on Siddarth Kara&#39;s work:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, this is patently false. According to Petersen’s former boss, Claude d’Estree, he stated at the memorial service</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their link to the video FB page has gone private, no mirror exists to the video, but they go on to quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“”(She) decided to take on one of the demagogues in the field of human trafficking.” […]
“Produced a 110-page analysis of human trafficking in Haiti – 2 years of research.” […] “We were looking for someone who was smart enough and maybe brave enough to publish her work” […] “I will continue to seek out and publish it for her” […] “We are in a state of shock. We may never know what exactly happened to her”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Washington Post cites d&#39;Estree in her 2 year unpublished work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>D’Estree said Petersen had gone to Haiti a number of times, but she was not there to research human trafficking and was not investigating the Clinton Foundation. He said she had been a “brilliant” research fellow, working the past two years to produce a still unpublished article that critiqued a controversial book on the business of sex trafficking by Siddharth Kara.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your link goes on to link to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4og64Y4.png">Bella&#39;s post</a>, claiming she&#39;s blogging for Petersen.</p>

<p>Bella&#39;s credibility comes into question based on a close friend of her&#39;s, Domina Elle, <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dbdz9/i_found_a_smoking_gun_monica_petersen_found_dead/da8pbbo/">who argued with people in The Donald about not understanding Bella&#39;s true intentions.</a></p>

<p>From your link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Washington Post neglects to link to the Facebook post where Petersen claims she’s investigating the Clinton Foundation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is misleading. All claims to Petersen investigating the Clinton Foundation is from a single second hand source. </p>

<p>They end up linking a Podesta e-mail that is concerned with foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation, paid speeches, and her brother&#39;s gold mining in Haiti could hurt her campaign. These things were used against her in her campaign, so these fears were legitimate. </p>

<p><strong>Wrapping up</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Petersen committed suicide, but this is under suspicion because he was highly motivated and a high spirited person. Although she surrounded herself around a lot of suffering. Her mother is in disbelief that her daughter could commit suicide. This is not atypical of parents. I&#39;ve seen a lab mate of mine who was a free spirited person with such amazing optimism become rather bitter and foul mood after about a year into the degree program. I warned him that would happen. He&#39;s not suicidal, but the situation is also not remotely similar to dealing with the dire situation with sex workers in Haiti. Did she crack? I&#39;ve seen people crack in interesting ways when stress gets to them. My dad attempted suicide and failed thanks to my mom finding his nearly lifeless body on the floor in the living room in the middle of the night. An ex-coworker of mine a decade ago snapped and murdered his mother. It is possible that after so many years of seeing deplorable conditions and living in them, she eventually experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion">willpower depletion</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>The Human Trafficking Center and the director of the HTC have gone on record to dismiss claims made by pizzagate believers. We have to believe that d&#39;Estree is lying regarding her work in Haiti and her 110 page report she was working on. </p></li>
<li><p>The major source of the claims regarding Petersen&#39;s involvement in human trafficking related to Clinton is from an acquaintance of hers, Bella. </p></li>
<li><p>Petersen made no point to relay information she gave Bella to other people. None of her other friends of hers were in this loop, especially not to people who would be most interested: those in the HTC. </p></li>
<li><p>Why would the HTC try to cover this information up if they were in the know? Collectively, the group would be harder to stifle and members dying would only serve to make Clinton and the Podestas even more suspicious. The HTC would be at a greater advantage to expose these major violations of human rights, and Petersen would clearly know this. That, alone, makes this whole pizzagate subtheory suspicious. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>As of now, the Washington Post article remains completely credible and thorough. I think we&#39;re seeing a classic case of starting with a conclusion (there must be terrible corruption with the Clintons) and desperately finding evidence to support the conclusion made, which is unscientific and a poor way to conduct an investigation. But no matter the efforts of actual skeptics regarding pizzagate, it&#39;ll continue to pick up steam and torture &quot;suspects&quot;, family members, and friends in a desperate attempt to uncover a large pedophile ring that goes all the way up to the top echelons of the Democratic party, because, well, damn, that&#39;s sexy if you&#39;re part of a history making endeavor! In the meantime, pizzagaters like you try to shame skeptics, like me, to silence by accusing us of defending suspected pedophiles. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen these tactics used by several groups: anti-evolutionists, anti-GMO, alternative medicine, antivaxers, 9/11 truthers, HIV denialists, NWO believers, etc. You&#39;ve made up your mind, laughed at me as if I&#39;m a naive fool, and yet give me shitty sources like this that purposely engages in disinformation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a skeptic. I&#39;ve given plausible deniability for every claim you have made. There is zero evidence to support any of your claims, you take it as a matter of faith that people who have died have been murdered, or, at the very least, have died under suspicious circumstances. You wouldn&#39;t even acknowledge that Breitbart&#39;s claim about the Podestas had anything to do with Planned Parenthood and ACORN, which had earlier posted on his twitter regarding their tenuous links to human trafficking. </p>

<p>You can believe of me whatever you want. I&#39;ve tackled the claims and have shown that they&#39;re all based on a number of additional assumptions that are necessary for those claims to have any validity whatsoever. You&#39;ve consistently demonstrated a complete lack of critical thinking. </p>

<p>So I&#39;ll keep coming back and provide both my perspective and analyses of claims. I appreciate r/conspiracy for not silencing me like other subs, which is a giant plus in their favor. Unfortunately, the userbase is not very receptive to skepticism. </p>

<p>I do appreciate the irony of these statements, however:</p>

<p>Most of your posts have been laughing at others and completely dismissing arguments rather than anything constructive regarding your faith-based belief system. Again, I&#39;ve encountered this over and over again with Christian fundamentalists, New Ageists, anti-vaxxers, etc. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it&#39;s probably a duck.</p>

<p>Do you realize people have been suspiciously dying while looking into this </p>
</blockquote>

<p>if you&#39;re talking about human/ child/ sex trafficking- yes absolutely. It&#39;s a real thing and people kill to protect it.  If you&#39;re talking about pizza code and secret child trafficking tunnels under washington dc pizza restaurants... nobody has died that we know of.  if you&#39;re referring to breitbart&#39;s tweets, he was talking about Okeefe&#39;s investigation into ACORN where he got them to offer consulting on helping 16 year old prostitutes get social services.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you realize there are direct ties between child trafficking in Haiti and the Clinton Foundation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that&#39;s a bit harder to prove, but not an unfounded concept.  the clintons are very involved in Haiti, whose culture basically revolves around child trafficking (at the very least in terms of indentured servitude, but generally admittedly in terms of the global slave trade as well).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the organized disinfo campaign refers to MSM. Mainstream media</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the msm is using this story to promote their &quot;fake news&quot; narrative which seeks to discredit alternative media by associating their competition with racism/ homophobia and crazy conspiracy theories which promote violence.  but pizzagate isn&#39;t news, it&#39;s a scandal which may or may not have any veracity to it (i personally don&#39;t believe it does).</p>

<p>remember that david brock (media matters/ ctr/ alefantis&#39; ex) was actually the person responsible for creating and reporting TrooperGate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The allegations by state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in the conservative magazine American Spectator,[1] in a piece entitled &quot;His Cheatin&#39; Heart&quot;[2] that was released in December 1993 with a magazine publication date of January 1994.[3] Brock had found the story via a big donor to GOPAC, who connected him to Cliff Jackson, a longtime non-fan of Governor Clinton.[4] Brock&#39;s story also included material from two other troopers who wished to remain unnamed.[2] The same four troopers were also interviewed and their charges written about at length by the Los Angeles Times in a story published in December 1993 a day after the Spectator story came out.[5][6] They also spoke on air to CNN in the same month.[7]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troopergate_(Bill_Clinton)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troopergate_(Bill_Clinton)</a></p>

<p><a href="https://spectator.org/49976_his-cheatin-heart/">https://spectator.org/49976_his-cheatin-heart/</a></p>

<p>This is political operative who has SUPPOSEDLY worked with both sides to manage and manipulate information.  So while everyone is talking about CTR shills working to discredit Pizzagate, also don&#39;t discount the possibility that this is all a stunt by CTR to create a workable story around &quot;fake news&quot; to associate the &quot;alt right&quot; with ridiculous conspiracy theories and homophobia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Laura Silsby was accused of kidnapping by the Haitian government, which is notoriously corrupt. Unfortunately, many organizations working in relief services with children -- attempting to place homeless children as US adoptions, for example -- are often accused by foreign governments of kidnapping or other crimes. This is not to say that children are not sometimes removed from safe conditions by shady adoption agencies -- this has happened in Russia, quite a bit; sometimes the foreign parents are complicit in this, because $$$.</p>

<p>Still, this doesn&#39;t tie Silsby to pizza or a satanic pedophile ring, unless you assume that all children moved into adoption are sold into sex slavery.</p>

<p>The other thing is that Silsby has worked for companies doing real, quantifiable good for the benefit of exploited children, like the Amber Alert system. And anyone suggesting the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is engaged in anything but helping kids is off their rocker, sorry.</p>

<p>Puello being arrested is not evidence that Silsby, Hillary Clinton, or Comet Ping Pong are involved in a satanic pedophile conspiracy.</p>

<p>He said &quot;you could put tomatoes in the basement&quot;, and I took it to mean he was just talking about canning tomatoes in the figurative sense, not that he necessarily had a basement.

<p>It&#39;s wonderful there&#39;s a little thing called &quot;freedom of speech&quot; (art is a kind of speech protected by the constitution) which protects people who collect, say, Nazi war memorabilia from accusations of being a Nazi. If a museum has <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/black-people-lynched.jpg">this photograph</a> in their collection, does it mean they&#39;re endorsing lynching? No, of course it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s a crazy leap of logic to suggest that.</p>

<p>Where are you from, North Dakota? Being gay and being into art are not exclusively the territory of pedophiles.

    <div class="md"><p>And I just saw a Philly Weekly article where he talks about his other restaurant, Buck&#39;s:</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Alefantis estimates, he bought 12 tons of Toigo tomatoes, which Stello turned into sauce and canned before trucking the jars to the basement at Buck&#39;s Fishing &amp; Camping, Alefantis&#39; other restaurant nearby.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>So there you go. He was probably referring to this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because Antinous became something of a gay icon in the 20th century; Oscar Wilde wrote about him. Or that it&#39;s simply a beautiful Roman sculpture? Antinous has been a subject for many sculptors and his face resides in many musuems; I don&#39;t think any of those works of art are endorsements of pedarasty anymore than a Dali painting suggests the artist actually melted clocks in his free time.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting theory. He wasn&#39;t the artist who created the sculpture though. He specifically chooses the child lover of Emperor Hadrian, from a culture that found pederasty acceptable, one of the most prominent figures in regards to the legitimacy of child love as his profile pic.</p>

<p>That and the content of his <a href="https://sli.mg/a/gaffhM">instagram</a> are incredibly suspect at best. </p>

<p>Do you think Alefantis would be able to land a teaching gig with a social media account like that? </p>

<p>Hardly, unless you have a citation handy. He was idolized through the cult Hadrian created, which ensured him a place in history, but not for &quot;legitimizing child love&quot;. Ancient Greek culture of 2,000 years ago did not scorn pedarasty the way the modern world does, that we know, but Antinous wasn&#39;t worshipped for Hadrian&#39;s pedophilia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For centuries, pederasty had long been socially acceptable among Greece&#39;s leisured and citizen classes, with an older erastes (aged between 20 and 40) undertaking a caring sexual relationship with an eromenos (aged between 12 and 18) and taking a key role in their education;[20] and Hadrian took Antinous as a favoured servant when they were aged about 48 and 13. Such a societal institution of pederasty was not indigenous to Roman culture, although bisexuality was the norm in the upper echelons of Roman society by the early 2nd century.[21]</p>

<p>You call me a shill but I see a subreddit which is bit-by-bit turned away from sceptical about every information they get towards accepting a narrative without even asking twice while ignoring one of the biggest social &amp; finacial changes in US politics. </p>

<p>I <em>is</em> sorta funny how everyone is so concerned with pizzagate while the oil&amp;banking industry gets rid of regulations. Seeing who pushes the narrative I&#39;d say you are the shill. </p>

<p>baseless ? Why? Because you don&#39;t belive in it? Read it up and you might realize that you&#39;ve been played.</p>

<p>and yet you are all defensive about it. spoiler alert: The same narrative was used by e.g. the Nazis denounce and break the resistance of the catholic church. Has there been child molestation: sadly yes. Was that the reason why the narrative was pushed? nope. </p>

<p>Just read trough old white power forums, just search for the narrative of stalinist jews (funny as stailn was a antisemite) being pedophile and raping christian childs and you will find the agenda for pizzagate. </p>

<p>If it really would be about the children there would be a discussion about if and where the sexual theory &amp; liberation of the 50ties/60ties went too far but there is no such thing. Just a narrative.  </p>

<p>Sums this entire thing up quite nicely. You can&#39;t. You won&#39;t, and when you&#39;re asked to the only thing you can do is call me a shill. I throw shade because when I see a conglomeration of delusional people talking nosense, and it results in an attempted shooting I get concerned. No such thing as a simple disagreement. Check mypost history, I talk shit about Conor Mcgregor too. Do you think I&#39;m shilling for Eddie Alvarez?

<p>The reasons seem quite apparent. Citizen investigations have as much potential to cause harm to innocent people as law enforcement investigations when they&#39;re on the wrong track. Parents of murdered children are continuously harassed by citizen investigators claiming their children were fake. People working at pizza places are continuously harassed by occasionally armed citizen investigators claiming they&#39;re part of a child sex ring.</p>

They seem to have reversed the process through which these theories are supposed to be accepted, jumping to the conclusion that they are &#39;proven&#39; when they are in fact not, and that those who don&#39;t believe them are required to provide &#39;evidence&#39; of them being false.

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t actually debunk anything, they simply claimed it was not true without providing a single iota of proof. How many times did they use the words &quot;fake&quot; &quot;not true&quot; &quot;conspiracy&quot; without actually providing a single source for their claims? </p>

<p>This is an open investigation, they have not addressed even the basic claims, unfortunately thers isnt one comprehensive collection of all the data put together yet as new shit comes out by the hour and no one is claiming to have all the answers, but debunking the entire investigation without even addressing 2% of the evidence is insane. </p>

<p>I am not here to convince you, if you dont beleive in it then thats fine, no one here is looking to sell anything, we are not making money from this and we are not doing this with malicious intentions. The investigation has bought together thousands of people from different countries, with different cultures and different political ideologies, with one goal. To uncover the truth. </p>

<p>The fact is that pedophile amongst the rich and powerful has been uncovered many many times, and cover ups have also happened, I for one am happy to accept legitimate debunkings, but you have not actually posted one. </p>

<p>This is not an official sub for pizzagate, if you are relying on this as your main source for pizzagate information then i suggest waiting until a legitimate comprehensive breakdown is avaliable, but that wont happen until the investigation is finished. </p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters; we are at war. </p>

<p>I, like you, never thought I would find myself on the front lines of the First Information War. It seems though, that we have been drafted, and now we must do what soldiers do. </p>

<p>We must fight with every tool we have at our disposal. Our enemy is insidious, powerful, and very very real. They will not stop, they will not negotiate, and they are legion.</p>

<p>But so are we.</p>

<p>Use the tactics T_D proved effective before it was neutered.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Support the mods.</p></li>
<li><p>Upvote like your life depends on it (it might).</p></li>
<li><p>Spot the shills.</p></li>
<li><p>Dont harass, threaten or insinuate violence of any kind. Downvote and report to the mods any agent provocateurs who make these sorts of threat posts. They are chomping at the bit for us to make such a noob mistake to shut us down. </p></li>
<li><p>Browse NEW and upvote. Browse RISING and upvote. Dont just trust the front page of r/conspiracy anymore. UPVOTE.</p></li>
<li><p>Join and support those engaged in verbal battle with shills. They cant shout us all down, and the longer we tie one down the less help he can give his crony friends. </p></li>
<li><p>Post new evidence everyday!!! Visit VOAT (v/pizzagate) and subscribe. They are our fallback plan if all goes to shit. </p></li>
<li><p>TALK to friends, family, anyone who will listen. THey can control some communication, but not all of it. Not till they can control us.</p></li>
<li><p>Archive EVERYTHING. Save files to flash drives.  Brush up on resources for encryption and hacker protection. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is a war going on - and history will remember the soldiers that fought it. They have the plans but we have the power. </p>

<p>Without knowing any of you, I can say confidently that if you are on the side of Freedom, I love you, you are my family.</p>

<p>God Bless and Protect You All.</p>

Pizzagate is Donald&#39;s pet theory and their way to try and continue attacking the opposition. Not only do they do this, they accuse anyone who disagrees to be a shill and/or a pedophile.

<p>Only time I see Donald and pizzagate related is when people deny pizzagate.</p>

<p>IT has nothing to do with politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By specifically accusing members of the democratic party. Now obviously there is no point in arguing this further, since your point will be that they are being accused because they&#39;re involved, so let me just say one other thing that annoys the shit out of me. This cheap tactic of trying to appear on the moral high ground, like you two are doing. By saying the conspiracy theorists pushing pizzagate are on the side of THE CHILDREN and are against HUMAN TRAFFIC implying that those who disagree are for HUMAN TRAFFIC and are pedophiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why go to the extreme? I&#39;m just saying it has nothing to do with politics.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me that members of the republic party might be involved in some way, this is not about politics.</p>

<p>Look, people have their own personal reasons to try and stop human traffic, if you don&#39;t want anything to do with it it&#39;s ok, you can also be skeptical.</p>

<p>The thing we don&#39;t like is when people repeat what the MSM says, all we ask is to people to form their own opinions, if after reading everything you still think there are just &quot;a lot of coincidences&quot; then fine.</p>

<p>That&#39;s honestly all I ever asked, too many coincidences is where we are at, and until something blows up big it will be like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone please look into Laura Silsby. She was caught in Haiti and jailed for trying to traffic 33 children and the first thing the Clinton Foundation did when they moved into Haiti was Hillary pardoned her, and she now creepily works on the board of directors for a company called AlertSense that is in charge of issuing amber alerts. <a href="https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/">https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/</a> (Laura Silsby-Gayler) </p>

<p>The lawyer Hillary used to help absolve Laura also was a convicted child trafficker, you just can&#39;t make this stuff up. </p>

<p>So basically, a woman who served time for trafficking kids in Haiti now sits on the board of a company that serves as the backbone for many local authorities when they want to issue Amber Alerts. </p>

<p>WikiLeaks also retweeted this story confirming it&#39;s truth and supported with emails to and from Hillary: <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417</a> </p>

<p>WikiLeaks then confirmed Hillary has a LONG history with convicted child trafficker and kidnapper Laura Silsby, and Huma Abedin (vice chairwoman of Hillary&#39;s 2016 presidential campaign) has been forwarding emails about Laura Silsby&#39;s non government organization to Hillary for years. </p>

<p>Laura Silsby was also former director of The New Life Children&#39;s Refuge, the same group that was busted by Haitian authorities trying to traffic kids:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case</a></p>

<p>And the video below is about a bunch of Haitians protesting the evils of the Clintons, and the man protesting in the video mentions how the Clintons have exploited Haiti&#39;s resources for themselves, and even specifically mentions people in Haiti are afraid to go out at night because of  fear of kidnapping. (4:48 in the video)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PeO0SfCw5s&amp;amp;list=PLeAhFbYkBiH1sLiFUnWChhofsYQk7Mc9M&amp;amp;index=66">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PeO0SfCw5s&amp;amp;list=PLeAhFbYkBiH1sLiFUnWChhofsYQk7Mc9M&amp;amp;index=66</a></p>

<p>At around the 2:00 mark he even mentions Tony Rodham (Hillary&#39;s brother) is now in charge of gold mines in Haiti and sits on the gold mine&#39;s board of directors. </p>

<p>Many people are talking about this story, continue to spread the word!! We need justice for these
 crimes, and the Clintons should be in prison. </p>

<p>hold on, .. </p>

<p>First of all we are talking about two different things - pizzagate is all about a global liberal conspiracy of pedophiles and not about an actual case of child molestation, which is exactly the reason why it is shunned and why it will lead nowhere except strengthening the narrative of an pedophile elite in certain parts of society. </p>

<p>Furthermore pedophilia and child molestation is used as one-and-the-same which is not only not true but won&#39;t help anyone as it reduces the amount of pedophilies seeking help instead of either fighting on their own or giving in to their urges. </p>

<p>Without a doubt there will be pedophilies among the elite - but should we assume that there are actually <em>far more</em> pedophiles among the elite than among e.g. workers?</p>

<p>It is actually easy: 
Never ever vote for someone who used his influence and power to gain sexual favors. Never ever look away when someone speaks up about rape or sexual harrasment. But also: Never condemn before you are completely sure.  </p>

<p>And yet these bastards get voted for and are admired for their virtility. Be it Berlusconi in Italy, be it Bill Clinton or Trump in the States. </p>

<p>Even when it comes to child molestation people tend to look away for a long time, ignore signs in their own family, are mostly afraid of strangers. Our perception is crooked. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not correct - Silsby and Co were arrested on child trafficking charges and then Clinton stepped in and got the others released and Silsbys charges reduced to &#39;arranging irregular travel&#39; and she was found guilty of that. </p>

<p>In my opinion the only real justification of that would be if the parents and children wanted to leave the county.If not, it&#39;s child trafficking. </p>

<p>I would not be surprised at all if it was trafficking and Clinton knew it - we know she got that rapist reduced charges too, many years ago, that kind of shady shit is right up her street.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being convicted of Attempted child abduction does not  necessarily mean that the convicted actors attempted to take children with ill intent. From what I have read Silsby and Co thought they had approval to remove orphans from a country during a state of emergency. </p>

<p>I could take my child across state lines to flee from his abusive mother but if the mother decides to report it to the authorities by state law I could be charged with kidnap. Does that make me a kidnapper or am I someone trying to do the right thing?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this is not the first time a Christian missionary group has went into a third world country trying to do good and ended up pissing off state officials. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not justifying or condoning Silsbys actions, I just need more evidence to support the claim that  Silsbys intended take children and provide them to pedophiles. </p>

<p>Questions unanswered: </p>

<p>Did Silsby have a relationship with Clinton prior to Clinton&#39;s intervention in the case? </p>

<p>Did Silsby associate with any known pedophiles? </p>

<p>Has Silsby carried out missions in other countries where children have been abducted or reported missing? </p>

<p>Why would Silsby go through the trouble to get state approval  from Haiti and the DR for child addiction? Doesn&#39;t that bring more attention to her actions? I&#39;m sure it would not be too difficult to abscond unnoticed with children after a natural disaster like the Haitian earthquake. </p>

She blatantly violated the law with her email server and Clinton Foundation bribery/Pay to Play. Do you seriously think she would be brought to task for breaking protocol? Wikileaks literally released emails where her legal counsel/advisors were openly discussing the fact that the State Department was helping to keep certain emails of hers from the Senate Oversight Committee. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a black and white legal issue due to corruption which has subverted the integrity of the law. Publicizing this information is the best bet we have to ensure something gets done about it down the road.</p>

<p>And Silsby formed a charity which was meant to build an orphanage which was never followed through on. Her lawyer was later himself convicted of human trafficking. She&#39;s dirty and blatantly guilty. I&#39;m pretty convinced you either haven&#39;t read up on the case at all or are being incredibly disingenuous about it based on your response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as other Clinton&#39;s  criminality I am sure she should be indicted for something. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why you would immediately jump to a pedophile ring. Silsby and others had clearance from one state government to rescue refugees. They thought they had clearance from Haiti and thought the people they were working with were providing them with orphans. How does this translate to these people are providing children to the podestas? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t jump to conclusions about a pedophile ring, I&#39;ve only ever pointed out that the Clintons have a pretty weird way of associating with sex offenders. Others have done made those jumps.</p>

<p>Silsby stole those kids from families, they weren&#39;t even orphans. The parents were lied to and told the kids would be returned to visit, and weren&#39;t informed that they&#39;d be leaving the country. And her lawyer was subsequently convicted of human trafficking as well. That doesn&#39;t raise the possibility in your mind that there might have possibly been a criminal conspiracy? She wasn&#39;t acting above board on this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It definitely is a possibility I don&#39;t rule anything out but I just need more proof. Who knows maybe there will be a smoking gun but as of now there is not one. </p>

<p>We need to know more about Silsby before drawing any conclusions. </p>

<p>Has she done this before?</p>

<p>Did she know Clintons before Haiti? </p>

<p>Did she associate with any known pedophiles?</p>

<p>What approval did she have to rescue children from Haitian officials? </p>

<p>Further, why attempt to go through the  state approval process if you are going to abduct  children? Doesn&#39;t that draw unnecessary attention? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, there will likely not be a smoking gun revealed until January at the very earliest when the administration changes.</p>

<p>Ironically, yes she did do this before. She tried to take 40 children out of the country prior to her arrest and was told not to do this without proper permits. This email shows she was driving around Haiti with a bus, snatching kids off the street:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741</a></p>

<p>In regards to the other questions, I have not looked into that and would have to do further research.</p>

<p>Lots of companies went through the state approval process to violate the law and engage in corruption. Getting the veneer of state approval is important if you are going to have a proper cover story so that questions are not asked. Just look at the long paper trail of donations which were made to the Clintons from companies who immediately received economic exemptions upon giving money. The State Department was staffed at top levels with people who were either Clinton cronies or were still actually employed at the Clinton Foundation simultaneously which is also blatantly illegal.</p>

<p>Clinton was stupid and never thought she was going to be caught for this stuff. Otherwise she wouldn&#39;t have been keeping her emails on an unsecured personal server in the first place. She just assumed she wasn&#39;t going to get burned for this.</p>

<p>The list your references makes a ton of assumptions to reach a predetermined conclusion. Take the &quot;code&quot; for example. Podesta is an avid cook and it would not be unusual for him to speak about food and cooking. why would a group of pedophiles talk in  a code that is readily identified by the FBI as code.

<p>Yes you do, and you satisfy the first point with the second point. Pizzagate was shut down (like every other subreddit that has been shut down) because shit on the internet started to interfere with real life. In this particular case, it&#39;s life threatening.</p>

<p>No they&#39;re not impartial. And I don&#39;t blame them. They have no need to be. He was receiving hundreds of messages calling him a pedophile, threatening him, and generally harassing him. Also, there&#39;s a difference between the idea of free speech and the right to free speech.</p>

<p>You guys have thing hang up about &quot;how you&#39;re being censored&quot;. It&#39;s not someone trying to stop you from discussing whatever, it&#39;s because you guys travel from place to place breaking rules.

<p>You should probably take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act">this</a>. No one needed a hard proof to persecute Assange nor Iraq (<a href="https://mic.com/articles/101420/no-iraq-didn-t-have-weapons-of-mass-destruction-after-all">oh btw</a>), just to make a few &quot;important&quot; examples.</p>

<p>And no, it&#39;s not inherently life threatening. Nobody here is trying to harm potential criminals, it&#39;s just a guy (it could still be a false flag OP for all we know) with a really hard life.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists are by definition weirdos, and not for the right reasons; luckily there aren&#39;t that many &quot;paranoid&quot; ones here, just healthy questioning. Either way, labeling is always wrong a priori.</p>

<p>As i previously said, the media is controlled by an extremely restrict group of privates: i do think we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYRN8Clddw">wouldn&#39;t be listened</a> (this is just a taste), it&#39;s not that hard to control &quot;our kind of stuff&quot;, they have all the excuses in the world.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The credibility factor varies based on the reader&#39;s mindset: if you wanted to ignore all the labels you related to that specific site (i don&#39;t know the site, nor anything about your accusations, i just googled something real quick and that came up) you could have concentrated on the content, which i&#39;m sure we can all agree, is what counts.</p>

<p>No. I can go make some random blog or imgur post that accuses whoever of whatever. The source absolutely matters. If I went into a conservative site citing nothing but huffington post, what do you think would happen to my argument? People would slap it down for being biased. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/aAzwAwq.png">Slimgur</a> was created as a direct reaction to Imgur banning racist, sexist and dangerous images.</p>

<p>Also, Persecute and prosecute are two completely different things. Prosecuting Assange would be done by a recognized court of law, using evidence from both sides.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Right there you just said you just said that you were willing to close (prosecute) a case based on an investigation that you admit isn&#39;t proper. </p>

<p>You&#39;re disregarding the first actual action that is provable in this entire thing because it doesn&#39;t agree with what you want it to say. A man walked into this pizza parlor with a rifle and fired a round. However, you refuse to take any sort of responsibility for this, because you think that everything that has ever happened is a false flag.</p>

<p>You are creating very, very, very dangerous people. Nobody cares what weird shit you cook up on the internet. But once you start <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-online-conspiracy-theories-about-a-salt-lake-city-daycare">threatening daycares</a>, <a href="http://wtnh.com/2016/09/02/pd-man-arrested-for-making-threat-at-sandy-hook-elementary-school/">threatening shooting victims</a>, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-falsely-accuses-sunil-tripathi-of-boston-bombing-2013-7">accusing the wrong people of a bombing</a>, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/latest-police-pizzeria-gunman-ar-15-rifle-handgun-43982089">shooting up a fucking pizza parlor</a> or <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/02/08/aurora_victims_harassed_by_conspiracy_theorists/">harassing shooting victim&#39;s families</a>.</p>

<p>THAT is the sort of bullshit you&#39;re brewing here. You have a responsibility to act like adults while you are &quot;investigating&quot; this stupid shit.</p>

<p>But, I&#39;m sure those are all false flags, right?</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t talking about sources, i was talking about credibility. The environment in which you read information should not influence your rational sense over the actual content. The source always matters, but when you link to a picture (on any site dedicated for that) you&#39;re hoping your interlocutor is going to valuate the picture itself. The picture i linked has links on it, those are all the source you need. In fact, you should have doubts even if you just &quot;took a walk&quot; on wikileaks.</p>

<p>What i&#39;m saying is that thanks to the USA Patrioct Act the US government is free to detain anyone who is only remotely suspected to be outlaw. No hard proof needed there see? Also, can we agree that US&#39;s behavior towards the middle east is the one of a bully? An illegal, criminal behavior, in fact.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t! I said we cannot exclude the possibility a priori: it would be irrational and dangerous.</p>

<p>I realize this discussion might start to become annoying, but from what i&#39;ve gathered the difference is in mindset: you tend to exclude conspiracies to happen in the first place, despite the fact that a super short research would demonstrate the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/locc">countrary</a>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see myself being wrong here, i&#39;m sorry.</p>

<p>Do you realize that what CIA is forwarding is a conspiracy theory? And it&#39;s a tinfoil hat kinda theory. I mean we&#39;re talking 0 proofs, and yet the US MSM is already bringing it in TV (also, the post got 5 gold donations!).</p>

<p>Sure the CIA is powerful... but that&#39;s my <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v09/v09p305_marchetti.html">point</a> to being with!</p>

<p>To say that flat earthers, ecc are &quot;our people&quot; is back to that labeling i was talking about. Distinct between good conspiracies and bad ones. Either way, to say that fluoride is dangerous is a <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2016/09/24/flouride-still-officially-classified-as-a-dangerous-neurotoxin-in-worlds-most-prestigious-why-is-it-still-in-our-water/">fact</a>, it&#39;s just that it also has plus sides when it comes to teeth health, so we keep it in water (and i&#39;m fairly ok with that). It&#39;s also not arguable to say that many powerful people are jews (George Soros comes to mind...), but that&#39;s not a conspiracy theory, nor something we should care about.</p>

<p>Hold on a minute: i didn&#39;t come up with it, nor i actively support it. All i say is that the way it&#39;s been disregarded and ignored by the public is ludicrous. There is enough &quot;weird stuff&quot; to at least open a proper investigation.</p>

<p>Are those involved supposed to address every individual claim? If they provide explanations, would the &quot;investigators&quot; believe them?</p>

<p>Perhaps the new influx of people seeing this stuff is making the community look bad, coming into the message boards with nothing to add to the conversation and the questions they have answered if they actually looked through the information available.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the regular joe doesn&#39;t have the time to debunk and investigate every claim made on these message boards and they take lack of a differing opinion as something that is widely accepted.</p>

<p>When really these boards are about posting your findings and people taking that into account while doing THEIR OWN research on top of it. This is a public message board, i&#39;m sorry but noone is going to drop a sex video here even if it proved everything true! You have to do your own research to truly know for yourself.</p>

<p>All your evidence is circumstantial at best but you all treat it as stone cold fact and it emboldens people like this guy to take a gun into a pizza shop and demand to see the whole building. You&#39;re fucking dangerous and really need to think about what you all are doing to innocents all because you&#39;re bored at home and aren&#39;t able to change anything in your life so you hope to keyboard warrior your way.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so let me give you an honest answer based on my perspective. First let me state that I have been following pizzagate right from the beginning and have mocked you all many times. I am also not being paid by or working for anyone to debunk or discredit this (but hey that&#39;s exactly what a shill would say, right?).</p>

<p>I have been on Reddit for 8 years, this account for 5 years. I have visited <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> off and on plenty of times over the years for some good reading (and sometimes laughs) and then I leave. But pizzagate in particular bugs me enough where I feel I have to respond to it. </p>

<p>There are several reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>You people view it as if it were a proven fact--not some conspiracy--to the point where it is scary</li>
<li>You are hurting real people in real life </li>
<li>You are constantly brigading and commenting wherever possible to &quot;get the word out&quot;</li>
<li>And of course, anyone who disagrees with you is a shill or is in on it</li>
</ul>

<p>Of all the posts I have read, they all come down to the initial fact that some emails with no context didn&#39;t make sense to you. The leap from that to a conspiracy is expected here; that&#39;s what makes a conspiracy theory. But then you build on that as if it were a fact and use that to make the most feeble connections. In fact, the whole motivation of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was to find yet one more undiscovered connection which was validated by other readers there. By doing this, you have brought in and hurt so many innocent people. You all justify it by saying you are helping investigate pedophiles. The thing is most of you don&#39;t know the first thing about investigations and if anything you are harming any real investigation (if any) that might occur. With an investigation you take solid evidence and build a narrative. You people are doing it backwards--taking a narrative and trying to find anything you can to support it. </p>

<p>But think about the harm you have done to so many people. Those children who have had their faces posted all over the internet on those evidence infographics (i.e., crazy walls) will be there forever. Whenever someone googles them this is what will show up. These children will always be known as the pizzagate victims. Don&#39;t you see how messed up that is? And so many businesses will forever be tarnished by these accusations. This will harm the owners, their families, children, employees, and their families. It&#39;s one thing to come up with stuff about political and public figures, but that&#39;s just not cool to completely destroy lives because an email about a napkin seemed strange. </p>

<p>But the thing that gets me the most is how, at least initially, there was so much brigading and abusing sites like Reddit. I mean come on, you people bombarded Yelp with accusations to the point they had to step in and put a halt to it. And any chance you get you people bring it up in comments, even if it has nothing to do with the topic. And when someone questions you, you respond that if we would just look at the evidence we would be convinced too. </p>

<p>But actually some of us have looked at ALL the evidence and simply don&#39;t make the same conclusions to you. That seems to be so incomprehensible to you all that the only possible explanation is that we are being paid or are otherwise involved in covering it up. In reality, there are people who simply disagree with you and disapprove of the damage you are causing. That&#39;s why <a href="/r/pizzage">/r/pizzage</a> was shut down and why youtube videos get taken down, etc. <em>You are hurting people with your conspiracy theories.</em> </p>

<p>Now I am saying <em>you</em> but I don&#39;t really mean you all in particular. This subreddit has done a fair job of keeping things in line and I commend you all for it. But seriously, do you really believe that there is this massive army of shills trying to shut you down to protect an underground pedophile ring? Or is the more likely explanation that we simply don&#39;t agree with you? Are you really surprised that people call you crazy when you say that this is the biggest conspiracy in history that involves hundreds or even thousands of people, including most of the government and media? Or is the most likely explanation that you do sound a little crazy when you say that? </p>

<p>Seriously dude, people aren&#39;t freaking out because you are exposing a well-connected pedophile ring. People are shocked at how far so many people have taken this and who are completely convinced of it&#39;s truth and will absolutely not be persuaded otherwise. </p>

<p>But hey, if everyone wasn&#39;t in on it, it wouldn&#39;t be much of a conspiracy, would it?</p>

<p>No, because you&#39;re thinking in a very close minded way. Nobody on this forum promoted violence of any sort. We are all non partisan and we don&#39;t condone the actions of the lone individual from yesterday&#39;s &quot;incident&quot;.

<p>Since this US voting bullshit this sub here is spammed with shit. Its insane. People here are here because they can think by themself. We dont need others to think for us. And thats why i can not take this &quot;pizzagate&quot; drama serious here in this sub. 90% of all postings is bullshit - it feels like the MSM tries to plant a story here.</p>

<p>I really wish the moderators would make one thread for Pizzagate and move all this postings, so we can have back our sub.</p>

<p>so in one line - &quot;dont tell me how i have to think about&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most all conspiracy forums were pretty neutral back in the 90&#39;s when I first got interested in conspiracy theories. It was mostly stuff about JFK, NSA spying (which is one that conspiracy theorists <em>nailed</em>), and some overlap with aliens. </p>

<p>When Bush Jr. became president, the community got mildly left-leaning. But when Obama won, and Alex Jones got really popular a bunch of alt-right survivalist types joined in. But even then, they were <em>usually</em> focused on the shit that went down in Waco with the Branch Davidians in the 80&#39;s, and things like that. Understandable and credible theories. </p>

<p>With T_D and this election, we&#39;ve been overrun with idiocy. And it&#39;s extremely right-leaning. </p>

<p>There have always been conspiracy theorists who are basically level-headed skeptics who rightly distrust the government, and the true believers who cry &#39;lizard people&#39; at every glitch in their tv. But lately there seem to be way more of the 2nd type. </p>

<p>But it seems like that happens with everything good once it becomes popular. Add in credible stuff like CTR which just bolsters their beliefs, and here we are. </p>

But no matter who you are or what you&#39;re talking about or what sub you&#39;re in, there should be a respect for logic and proper argumentation.

    <div class="md"><p>This gentleman has demonstrated my point.
Feels no obligation whatsoever to raise evidence in support of his claim that this conversation is scripted. </p>

<p>What would it take to have a conversation where both parties just assume that they&#39;re talking to an informed, rational person with an opposing point of view? Even if they don&#39;t believe the opposing point of view, assuming the conversation is being had in good faith a prerequisite for a philosophically useful conversation. Because you want the best ideas to win out in the marketplace of ideas. So if you can falsify the strongest arguments, your arguments are better. Whereas if you attack the source of the arguments, that&#39;s ad hominem. You never get to the point of separating the true and false things that come out of your opponent&#39;s mouth because you&#39;ve already dismissed your opponent out of hand. </p>

<p>So now I&#39;m talking to GayBoyAdvanced. Let&#39;s try this exercise. What is your issue exactly with our conversation? Please use precise terms. </p>

<p>Not surprising in any case, considering the amount of time that those accused would have had to tidy things up - since the story first broke... IF there were anything to &quot;hide&quot;, you understand...</p>

<p>Indeed. Who&#39;s to say? A couple of weeks remodeling and scrubbing can cover a MULTITUDE of &quot;sins&quot;. </p>

<p>And the MSM pronouncing him <strong>NOT GUILTY</strong> from day ONE certainly didn&#39;t hurt such efforts.</p>

<p>Prefers prepubescents? Possibly.</p>

<p>Pedophiles are REAL. Their victims are REAL, and history has shown us that they tend to pervade the ELITE classes, and that they are PROTECTED by their peers - ostensibly because said peers are equally at risk.</p>

<p>Try shifting your motive focus from &quot;perversion&quot; to control via BLACKMAIL, and suddenly, it all becomes far more tenable. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> It was called to my attention that the <em>&quot;Hair on my pizza&quot;</em> quote referenced above is a fake and a forgery. </p>

<p>Or more likely, doesn&#39;t like finding hair on a piece of pizza.  Yes there are pedophiles and they are awful people who deserve the full brunt of the law.  But talking about pizza does not make someone a pedophile!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are literally the <em>most</em> powerful people on the Earth.  Literally.  There will never be any &quot;real evidence&quot; that goes public, unless there is a whistleblower.  </p>

<p>People have died all around Clinton Foundation, strangely enough when trying to bring evidence into light.  You can deny the connection between the deaths but you can&#39;t deny the deaths themselves.</p>

<p>Similar thing happened in Hampstead, where the entire village was complicit in conducting a pedo-ring involving <em>5 different elementary schools</em>, teachers, politicians, polices, and other public figures.  Guess what happened when this story started gaining traction?  Children (key witnesses) were taken from the parents (still kept from the parents btw), while parents were accused of torturing their children to give false confessions.  The case went cold real quick, real fast after psychiatrists confirmed sexual abuses on the children.  The parents of these children are in exile and trying everything to get themselves heard and get their children back.  Any &quot;real evidence&quot;, or as the favorite talking point goes, &quot;a real victim&quot; who speaks out is immediately silenced. </p>

<p>I deplore dishonesty, and do my best to vet and authenticate anything I quote. I failed on that one.</p>

<p>Shame on the bastard who forged the quote. Totally uncalled for, especially given the volume of material that is authenticated and verifiable. I can only imagine that the forger&#39;s motive was an attempt to discredit the entire inquiry by &quot;poisoning the well&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem isn&#39;t what you&#39;re saying. My problem is the things to which you respond this way.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about my post specifically because I didn&#39;t provide evidence in my post, but this subreddit is replete with evidence, documents, connections and unanswered questions that have unpalatable answers no matter what the actual answer turns out to be.</p>

<p>When you say, &quot;I&#39;m just saying I want to see some evidence,&quot; you&#39;re saying it in response to evidence. It&#39;s the slimy way the powers that be attack legitimate concerns.</p>

<p>If you say that, you&#39;re implanting in the mind of your readers that the evidence they thought the saw is actually not evidence. They doubt the evidence that just saw because they&#39;re probably somewhat skeptical already and following the crowd is very easy to do when someone says something that reinforces your comfort zone.</p>

<p>People&#39;s comfort zone in this scenario is that there is no pedophile conspiracy reaching right to the top of the upper echelons of leadership in America. When someone shows evidence of that, it feels bad to learn about. When you then say there&#39;s no evidence, people can sigh in relief that there was no evidence. People are very impressionable.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t call you a shill if you attack the evidence. Look at the false flag news reports of the shooting at Comet Ping Pong, which were supposedly written earlier than the event. I honestly haven&#39;t looked too hard into that, but if I wanted to be an honest opponent of the notion that those news reports weren&#39;t written earlier than the event, then I would say, &quot;The evidence is false because of this,&quot; or, &quot;The evidence doesn&#39;t lead to those conclusions because of that.&quot; That&#39;s the non-slimy, non-shill way of arguing.</p>

<p>Your way is to look at the evidence and say, &quot;We need to be reasonable here folks. I would be more than willing to believe pizzagate if there was only some evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>Conspiracies are real. There have been many proven conspiracies, and they should go to show that your gut reaction of &quot;Come on. No one can really believe that many people would conspire to do THAT&quot; is an untrustworthy feeling.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t give a shit about anything except control by division of the people and manufacturing reality for us. If Pizzagate is fake, freedom of speech and the press is taking a huge hit. If it&#39;s real, the result is the same. They win either way because they&#39;ve initiated the process of subjugating the acquisition of knowledge and the concept of free thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live my life on a day to day basis. I am a busy dude. I have shit to do. Outside of my early AM Reddit routine, I don&#39;t sit digging through a conspiracy perpetrated by right-wing spammers/trollers/centipedes/etc based off of a few pictures and limited data.  I&#39;ve read up on this, there is some evidence that makes you think, but it&#39;s grasping at straws evidence in the end. I have an incredibly open mind to it, but there is nothing to say it&#39;s definitive, and when you get nut-jobs posting here (and firing rounds at the pizza place), you&#39;re starting to lose me. People are losing track of this conspiracy and just attacking the media again when the media is again, right. This is just fake news, because it got escalated before there was any proof at all. You don&#39;t go to court with limited evidence and hope to win. If you wanted anyone or the media to take this seriously, you should of gotten more proof than what you did. But you couldn&#39;t, because there likely isn&#39;t any.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, let&#39;s see here.  </p>

<p>First, &quot;fake news&quot; didn&#39;t hit the MSM and draw major attention until <em>the day after</em> pizzagate initially started (search google trends).  </p>

<p>Second, it gets fucking suspicious when the MSM denies to basic research on the topic or, even worse, flat-out lie about it: look at BBC&#39;s comment on how Comet Pizza doesn&#39;t have a basement, but there is a recorded interview with the owner about storing sauces in the basement.  Also, look at WaPo&#39;s article on Monica Petersen, a trafficking researcher who died recently under mysterious circumstances after investigating Clinton Foundation.  There are clear evidence all around (FB posts from Monica herself and her friend) that Monica did indeed go to Haiti to research about Clinton Foundation and its connection to human trafficking, yet the author of that WaPo article intentionally leaves out the main parts of Monica&#39;s posts to lead the viewers on.</p>

<p>Third, the gunman at the pizza joint is suspected of being a false flag.  The circumstances (how there is no video feed at all, no injuries, ultra-fast reaction from the police and the media, with the stories <em>being written before the fucking thing started</em> according to internal timestamps) are highly irregular.  </p>

<p>Listen, I get you.  I honestly thought this shit was just a hoax and started reading about it as a good joke.  Then I remembered what happened in UK with high profile politician pedo-ring, and how everybody just forgot about it, without people involved punished.  I&#39;m also Korean, and something stranger than fiction, about as equally &quot;conspiracy-y&quot; as pizzagate, has happened and proven.</p>

<p>All you have to do is lose your faith in humanity, accept that there are evil fuckers wearing human masks, and just open up the possibility.  There are so many uncanny coincidences, connections, and accidents around the whole pizzagate and Clinton Foundation for it to be just a pure coincidence.</p>

<p>Your perspective shows that, but the comments in this sub says otherwise. I understand the grand scheme is non-partisan, but this all stemmed off of right-wing digging through emails to find anything to be used against HRC. I shouldn&#39;t have to clarify that I don&#39;t condone any of the things suggested in this conspiracy, and I hope that if definite proof is found that it will come to a proper light and be taken care of. Just right now the same kind of stuff that would leak from the_donald is leaking into here. There is a wide range of people tracking this conspiracy for different reasons. I&#39;m not going to act like I know your reasoning, I just hope it is the right one. But to tell someone they can&#39;t comment in a sub (which I have been active in before if you want to dig my history) is just dumb. I&#39;m aware of the story.  I&#39;ve read almost everything posted here on it. As I said I am <em>interested</em> and <em>intrigued</em>. But I am also allowed to be a countering voice when I see things going off the rails a bit. I&#39;m not the enemy here. Neither are you. Read the comments in this thread. Calling everyone who disagrees a Shill just for disagreeing. It&#39;s just all so beaten to death. People are allowed to ask questions and doubt things, which is exactly the whole point to a conspiracy sub. Y&#39;all once said Sandy Hook was an inside job though. Some things go too far. I don&#39;t know why you took what I said so personally. </p>

<p>Not necessarily, that&#39;s a false assumption. A lot of people (like me!) were digging through the e-mail despite being not right wing. One does not have to have a political motivation in order to be curious. And again with the_donald, the_donald is irrelevant to this. It did not start there, it was not promoted there until LONG after it was huge, and it&#39;s already been banned from there. It is just not part of the equation and there&#39;s no reason to shoehorn it in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the weirder and more creepier things in this pizza gate thing is the police composite sketch of the kidnappers of Madeleine McCann. It does look a lot like the podesta brothers, and they were supposedly very close to the scene of the crime in may 2007 at a Portugal vacation house or something. If police really do use those sketches to identify potential suspects and it&#39;s true the podesta brothers were in Portugal around the time of the crime, the police should definitely be asking those two a few questions. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwothzUVQAAAFmD.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwothzUVQAAAFmD.jpg</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve only came around on this thing in the past 24 hours, before that I was fighting against it and offering up holes in the theory, not here but on facebook. I&#39;m not a shill, I don&#39;t work for anybody, I&#39;m a thinking person who doesn&#39;t jump on witchhunts until I&#39;m properly convinced and my questions answered.

<p>It also helped that both Maher and Silsby had substantial supporters at home campaigning for their government representatives to intervene in their cases.</p>

<p>Silsby&#39;s biggest US government advocates were <a href="https://votesmart.org/public-statement/484266/idaho-delegation-reacts-to-news-that-most-of-the-americans-held-in-haiti-have-been-released#.WEbob9IrKUk">2 senators and 2 congressmen from her home state of Idaho</a>, all but one of whom are Republican.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so you say the handkercheif bit was suspicious, and worth investigating, correct?</p>

<p>We did investigate. And it exposed a cozy relationship with James Alefantis, owner of comet ping pong. </p>

<p>See how that works? How things link to other things? You can&#39;t just pick out one little facet of an investigation, and if it doesn&#39;t suit you, you can&#39;t deem the entire investigation as phoney...Thats not how that works, man...We&#39;re thinking BIG picture, a lot of you guys are thinking small picture, and it&#39;s clouding your judgement. The ability to think critically and make connections isn&#39;t something everybody has, you have to develop it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Edit</strong>: Thanks for my very first gold, stranger! You took my goldinity!</p>

<p>Hi, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing in this sub because I am going to get downvoted to hell. I am a journalist...not a super well-known one and one focused on lifestyle reportage. But I am not a &quot;shill.&quot;  I am, however, by all accounts, a Brooklyn dweller. And I&#39;ve dug deep into this conspiracy, because the other thing I am is a trained and literal researcher. I have a couple of comments. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>What instances of coded speech? If someone shows me anything about &quot;dominoes&quot; being mentioned in an email, I will scream. That&#39;s so beyond circumstantial. The email with the realtor about the kids coming to the lake house to hang is also such a far leap, it makes me concerned. Did you read the whole thing? This is a family friend. </p></li>
<li><p>If you look at my Instagram, it looks like I sacrifice shit all the time. </p></li>
<li><p>The logos are what comes up when you LITERALLY google &quot;triangle clip art&quot;: <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-image-spiral-triangle-shapes-icons-image2246916">https://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-image-spiral-triangle-shapes-icons-image2246916</a></p></li>
<li><p>Once again, if you look at my Instagram feed, I look super creepy. I allude to death and becoming death (...the Neil Gaiman character). I have photos of black, dead eyes. Me with ripped tights and bloody knees. And yes, they exist alongside pictures of my tiny niece and nephews. </p></li>
<li><p>I can&#39;t see the avatar, but do you think, in the age of social media, this dude would be THAT obvious? Worry about the shit you don&#39;t see, right?   </p></li>
<li><p>This is the one that gets me the most. There is a restaurant in Brooklyn called Roberta&#39;s. It&#39;s ostensibly child-friendly. But at night, it becomes a venue for punk and weirdness. No kids are there. It&#39;s just using the space after hours. As for the posters? Have you been to an indie rock show lately? I mean, fuck, google Liars videos, or Professor Professor. Shock is an aesthetic. (Note: I haven&#39;t heard of the bands that you guys are focusing on, but for what it&#39;s worth I have heard of Title Tracks. That dude has been around for a while). Have you considered that imagery concerning lost and disenfranchised youth feels applicable to rock musicians?</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;perverted&quot; taste in art is motherfucking Marina Abramovich. She is not a &quot;creepy satanist.&quot; She is very actually the most important performance artist alive. That&#39;s like calling Leigh Bowery a street rat, or Basquiat made gang signs. Her entire, VERY well-documented career is based on making people uncomfortable. I was actually AT the Pace when she did the performance with Jay-Z, and Jeffrey Saltz, and Michael Musto, and basically everyone ever in the art world. She returns to themes of alienation, bodies, and touch again and again. &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot;, the original book, is beautiful and poetic. (I don&#39;t typically like Marina but that piece of work, which lives in the MoMA, is great.)</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, you guys are freaking out about a Louis Bougeois statue in a &quot;Jeffrey Dahmer&quot; pose. A) If I got to see someone&#39;s private Louise Bougeois statue, I sure as shit would take that pic and put it on social media because she is one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. B) It saddens me that this is how art is being viewed today. Don&#39;t google Henry Darger, Jenny Saville, or the Kremaster Cycle. You will be very upset and probably think they are pedofiles too. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>As for the Haiti connection: I can&#39;t speak to that as clearly. But to show me someone with a Louise Bougeois in their home and call it &quot;creepy&quot; isn&#39;t fair. </p>

<p>Lastly, and most honestly, Alefantis is a gay hipster restaurant owner. Last week I went to my friend&#39;s comedy show where she discussed mother hood (she&#39;s heavily pregnant. Look up &quot;small hole, big head&quot; at Ars Nova if you don&#39;t believe me.) One bit was her gay friend talking about how terrified he was of babies, and how they depress him. Another was a burlesque dancer acting as her doula but doing an S&amp;M inspired dance to NIN &quot;Closer&quot;. So, yes, there is video out there of a woman stomping around a pregnant belly, lip synching &quot;I want to fuck you like an animal.&quot; Out of context, taken from outside of the space, outside of the theatrical space where signs and signifiers are supposed to be messed with, where irony and discomfort are employed...yeah, that might look insane. But I don&#39;t want my friends to stop making fun of our friends with kids because, what if they like a place on FB that has political ties, run by a gay man, and suddenly they are stalked and harassed. </p>

<p>Most importantly, though, to me: The thing that makes me the most upset, and why I am commenting, is that this response feels like a complete misunderstanding--and also fear--of gay men being gay around children. That Instagram cache has photos of kids, and photos of sexuality, but not a single photo of a kid being sexual. (Oh, as an aside...those &quot;yellow anal beads&quot;? Whomever made that claim has never seen an anal bead before up close. Have you considered the possibility it&#39;s a teething necklace?) I have dug through the art, the photos, the symbols, watched the videos and I don&#39;t see anything even remotely perverted. I see, you know, someone being a weird person, being and living out of the &quot;norm&quot;--even if we find it distasteful--someone who might have a lot of friends and family. And that disconnect, for everyone expounding this theory, worries me.
[Edit: Henry Darger was also probably a pedophile. The rest stands though. RENAISSANCE PAINTINGS. There. There you have loads of naked kids.]</p>

<p>What instances of coded speech? If someone shows me anything about &quot;dominoes&quot; being mentioned in an email, I will scream. That&#39;s so beyond circumstantial. The email with the realtor about the kids coming to the lake house to hang is also such a far leap, it makes me concerned. Did you read the whole thing? This is a family friend.</p>

<p>Where someone literally mentions three young girls&#39; names, their ages and that they would be &quot;entertainment&quot;.</p>

<p>If you look at my Instagram, it looks like I sacrifice shit all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Non-argument. You could be a Satanist for all we know.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. You must have scrolled through tens of pages to find that because I can&#39;t find anything like it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once again, if you look at my Instagram feed, I look super creepy. I allude to death and becoming death (...the Neil Gaiman character). I have photos of black, dead eyes. Me with ripped tights and bloody knees. And yes, they exist alongside pictures of my tiny niece and nephews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you are creepy. However, I assume you don&#39;t do anything like referring to children as &#39;hotards&#39;, or taping their hands to the table.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t see the avatar, but do you think, in the age of social media, this dude would be THAT obvious? Worry about the shit you don&#39;t see, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why not? You realise some people &#39;get off&#39; on flaunting their misdeeds in front of oblivious others, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the one that gets me the most. There is a restaurant in Brooklyn called Roberta&#39;s. It&#39;s ostensibly child-friendly. But at night, it becomes a venue for punk and weirdness. No kids are there. It&#39;s just using the space after hours. As for the posters? Have you been to an indie rock show lately? I mean, fuck, google Liars videos, or Professor Professor. Shock is an aesthetic. (Note: I haven&#39;t heard of the bands that you guys are focusing on, but for what it&#39;s worth I have heard of Title Tracks. That dude has been around for a while). Have you considered that imagery concerning lost and disenfranchised youth feels applicable to rock musicians?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, that place is weird as fuck, but I don&#39;t see how that makes CPP any less weird. For all we know they could be involved in some shady shit as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;perverted&quot; taste in art is motherfucking Marina Abramovich. She is not a &quot;creepy satanist.&quot; She is very actually the most important performance artist alive. That&#39;s like calling Leigh Bowery a street rat, or Basquiat made gang signs. Her entire, VERY well-documented career is based on making people uncomfortable. I was actually AT the Pace when she did the performance with Jay-Z, and Jeffrey Saltz, and Michael Musto, and basically everyone ever in the art world. She returns to themes of alienation, bodies, and touch again and again. &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot;, the original book, is beautiful and poetic. (I don&#39;t typically like Marina but that piece of work, which lives in the MoMA, is great.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah, she&#39;s sketchy as fuck. You&#39;d have to be a nutjob to have any sort of relationship with that hag. Any idiot can do batshit insane shit and claim &quot;hurr durr it&#39;s art&quot;, doesn&#39;t make it any less sinister.</p>

<p>I mean, cool. That&#39;s your opinion. It is not the opinion of, say, MoMA, universities, art critics, galleries, and authors. Plenty of art is sinister. It&#39;s kind of the point. (I mean, FFS, have you ever SEEN Damien Hirst&#39;s work?)</p>

<p><strong>Edits:</strong> 
I&#39;m not going to go through each of these, but every one is so circumstantial and, furthermore, such a reach. I do not read—AT ALL—that email as anything other than, &quot;These kids are coming to the swimming party with us, and they will be small and fun and entertaining. </p>

<p>Look, I don&#39;t want to feed your delusions, but that Luzzatto woman has a pretty open Facebook. You can see her and her three kids, over and over again, and her lake house, and people at her lake house, doing summery things. Lastly, as to &quot;taping hands to a table.&quot; Yeah, I mean, that&#39;s not in good taste but it is not exactly evidence of a pedophile ring...and furthermore, like—kids are weird. I used to ask my father to wrap me in a blanket and tie it up and see if I could get out when I was little. Like, a sack of kid. Sorry, the kid is smiling, unstressed out, and it was a public photo. </p>

<p>Also, if you look at child trafficking stats, it is very, VERY rarely white kids who are victims. If this is focused on a ring out of Haiti, why, um, aren&#39;t any of the kids in your evidence pictures black?</p>

<p>Also, as for &quot;La Boum Boum Room&quot;?

<p>Sure, you can write off a couple coincidences as being odd, but when they just keep stacking up, your gut should tell you that something is definitely not right about the situation. Every time I see someone say that Pizzagate is bullshit, they conveniently focus on one aspect and completely ignore the vast majority of other evidence there is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you&#39;re basically piling mountains of vague bullshit up faster than it can be debunked. People focus on the more substantial points, but by then you&#39;ve moved on to other unrelated shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about all the other instances of coded speech?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You guys are reading code into speech. Could be regular speech, maybe a bit rushed, could be abbreviated for convenience, could be in-jokes, could be a million things. That&#39;s the weakest shit ever. If your online conversations with friends were pored over by thousands of internet trolls--who started out <em>convinced</em> that you&#39;d done something wrong--do you think they&#39;d come away with nothing at all unusual?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about blatantly saying sacrificing chicken to Moloch?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Point to it. I&#39;m betting it&#39;s a joke, but I&#39;ve never seen it...nobody ever links to evidence, they just evade and then call you a shill.</p>

<p>BTW, is this part of the conspiracy now? They&#39;re not just pedophiles and slavers, they&#39;re not even satanic, they&#39;re worshiping Moloch and sacrificing children?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about the pedo logos at Besta?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say it&#39;s a pedo logo. It vaguely resembles some logo that apparently has been used by child porn forums in the past...and also the logos of like a million businesses in the 90s. Could it just be a coincidence? Of fucking course it could. Anyway, if you were a child trafficker, would you put a well-known pedophile logo <em>on your sign, in the nation&#39;s capital</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about the odd proximity of all these businesses; CPP, Besta, Terasol, Beyond Borders?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s DC? There&#39;s lots of organizations in a relatively small area. The country is governed from there, you know. Anyway, it&#39;s you guys who are first connecting those orgs in your own mind, and <em>then</em> asked why they were so close together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about Alefantis&#39; countless creepy instagram photos and comments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Creepy is subjective. Maybe he&#39;s a wannabe artist with some kooky friends. I saw a few in another thread, they looked odd. Odd like an odd friend might take. They did <em>not</em> suggest child sex slavery to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about the odd bands with sexual/pedo innuendos associated with a &quot;child friendly&quot; pizzeria?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or...maybe...<em>maybe</em>...bear with me here...the dude owns a pizzaria and likes kids. Is that possible? Naah, it must be an underground child sex slave ring (and sacrificial cult, to boot!). Occam&#39;s razor, right?</p>

<p>Have you considered the possibility that all the sexual innuendo is in <em>your head</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about Alefantis&#39; instagram avatar being a statue of a guy involved in pederasty?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know who his avatar was. Socrates? Seems like you&#39;re being deliberately vague.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about the Podestas looking identical to the police sketches of who abducted Madeliene McCann?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you grabbed a handful of random police sketches, you could find some that looked like Podesta, who&#39;s a pretty typical looking white dude. You could probably find one that looks a bit like me, or a bit like you, too. Not exactly compelling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about John Podesta still remaining friends with a known pedophile for years?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If true, and if the pedophile isn&#39;t of the &quot;I was 18, she was 17 1/2&quot; variety, then that casts him in a bad light. He might not be a guy I&#39;d like to hang around with. Does that do much to support the accusations of pizzagate? Nope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about their disturbed taste in art plastered around their homes, pictures of half-naked children tied up, people being eaten, etc.?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s an exaggeration, based on what I&#39;ve seen. What I saw (from one of you guys, so I assume it was supposed to be damning) was an abstract sculpture of a guy hanging upside down. Pretty weird. Par for the course for modern art, but sure, weird. Podesta seems like an odd guy. Still, nothing that would <em>begin</em> to suggest a child sex slave ring (unless you think the MOMA is the biggest slaving operation in the world?! <em>Gasp!</em>).</p>

<p>We&#39;re getting close to the end of the list, hope you saved the best for last...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about their ties to Marina Abramovic, the creepy &quot;spirit cooker&quot;...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, what <em>about</em> their ties to an artist? Seems like this Podesta guy is really into weird modern art. I don&#39;t...<em>think</em> that&#39;s a crime...let me check...nope, definitely not a crime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...with links to Satanism?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...That you guys made up?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about Hillary Clinton&#39;s connection to Laura Silsby?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean her tenuous, six-degrees-of-separation connection? Or the fact that she, as Secretary of State, paid attention to an international incident in Haiti?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about the massively disproportionate amount of children going missing in Virginia around Halloween?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, is that even unusual in the country? Second, WTF does Halloween have to do with anything? What relates this to Podesta, or Hillary, or whoever? This is just like the rest, a random fucking fact just thrown out there.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re building a case, you&#39;re supposed to find evidence that points to the conclusion you&#39;re trying to establish. This is just a pile of facts (well...maybe facts) that are basically intended as character assassination. Some of it is weird, the rest is actually pretty normal. None is at all related to your conclusion. If you were trying to convince the world that Podesta, and maybe the pizzaria guy, has an unhealthy obsession with children...you <em>still</em> fell way short, and that&#39;s a hell of a lot short of your real claim, which is that they&#39;re part of a whole network of child sex slavers and a child-sacrificing cult. Your evidence is that they have an odd taste in art (as far as you&#39;re concerned, at least), and that there sure are a lot of organizations in DC.</p>

<p>Alright, I&#39;m done. I tried to address <em>all</em> your point for you. You can go ahead and dismiss me as a shill now, and go back to patting yourself on the back for your awesome investigative skills.</p>

I have friends in DC who know the owner of comet pizza, and this crap going on has seriously hurt him and his employees, it&#39;s really fucked up.  Comet pizza is like a 3 room building with solid concrete floors, the people I know in the area have lived there since the building went up, there&#39;s no secret basement, there&#39;s no &#39;kill room&#39; Just the normal kitchen, main dining area and a back room for parties/overflow, they use black curtains to cover the unattractive exit doors and roll-up doors, and the walk-in freezer is out back and shared with another restaurant iirc (why it&#39;s larger than necessary) there&#39;s nothing going on there, and nowhere to do it.</p>

<p>Then what the hell is that supposed to mean? You&#39;re not contributing much here man. Any rational person is able to see that there is clearly a campaign to control the climate of this subreddit regarding pizzagate. </p>

<p>Go on the record for us, have you done your research on this topic? What is your stance on pizzagate? Sure, there are probably a few legit skeptics, but almost everybody here has agreed with the notion that the majority of them are CTR, which is why this thread made it to the front page so quickly, the majority agrees. However, you seem to be against that notion or proposing your own theory...</p>

<p>If you wanna talk about pizzagate sometime, PM me man. I&#39;d be happy to go over some of this stuff with you. You seem like a relatively rational person who could be convinced that there is a logical basis to all of this, and we need as many people as we can get. </p>

<p>Where we disagree is the CTR-supression angle, now maybe that does go on, I&#39;m sure it did during the election, but I don&#39;t feel that the behavior OP is talking about is a product of a mass clandestine attempt to suppress. Being someone who was one of these dissenters until now I can empathize and feel that these people are skeptics just like I was who haven&#39;t been swayed or seen the right piece of evidence yet. </p>

<p>Ask yourself, why would a bunch of random, newly made accounts swarm a conspiracy forum in unison that they rarely (if ever) have visited, and discourage people from critical thinking and independent investigation? It&#39;s a conspiracy forum! This is supposed to be a safehaven from persecution and terms like &quot;whacky&quot; &quot;loony&quot; &quot;fucking crazy&quot;, right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s wayyyyyy out of the ordinary and it all started happening recently.</p>

<p>Then you should just think a moment about what you a really doing. By pushing the bs narrative you create exactly the situation where child trafficking and molestation accussations are only used for political gain. </p>

<p>You wanna see a big conspiracy and don&#39;t give a damn about the real life where there is still no frigging public discourse about pedophilia and how to stop chidl molestation.  </p>

<p>If you would really give a damn about &quot;the children&quot; you would push for strong social services, for a situation where churches and cults couldn&#39;t hide behind &quot;religious freedom&quot;, where the export of religious intolerance from the US to africa would be shame in public. </p>

<p>You would push for a society where people with pedophile tendencies would get treatment <em>before</em> they go all teh way to child molestation, you would push for a society where orphan shelters would a normal budget to operate and you would push for transparency. </p>

<p>You are doing neither of that. You use the topic to push a political narrative.    </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t you kind of just answer your own question? If the photos are in no way suspicious, why would they spend valuable airtime showing profoundly uninteresting photos?</p>

<p>Because these are the origins of the theories. Reporting is their fucking job, so they&#39;re doing a piss poor job of explaining to people what is going on without showing these images. Besides which, by not showing them, they are just giving more ammo to people like me to go around and ask &quot;why aren&#39;t they showing this&quot;</p>

<p>I know why, because everyone I&#39;ve shown has done a 180 lol because the images speak for themselves </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thinking about this more, it&#39;s so clear it was. The timing is just too much. People were talking about comet pizza, so let&#39;s make a huge new story about comet pizza that distracts from the original story and can dominate the news to block out any pizzagate stories... then also it&#39;s just a random one-off terrorist shooting, which happens with a fair degree of regularity now (unfortunately), and it&#39;s being focused on overly-heavily (as compared to the OKC shooter at an airport), which shows they&#39;re trying to overwrite people&#39;s idea of comet pizza as being associated with pizzagate, to now associating it with this random act of terrorism (which was probably done by a 3 letter agency to protect those people involved in this ring, because then their blackmail control of the politicians would become worthless).</p>

<p>Last week I saw a printed piece of paper with broken english and a picture of a girl with &quot;missing&quot; at the top. This gives zero evidence for any of the stuff going on with this whole conspiracy theory, but the missing kids and scared parents are probably all in places in the world where they don&#39;t have a voice to be heard. </p>

<p>My answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Virginia has suspiciously high missing children per-capita</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>correlation =/= causation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?  I&#39;m literally pointing out that Virginia indeed has way more missing children per capita, which answers the original question.  Now to say definitely that the discrepancy is indeed caused by this pizza joint running a pedophile ring would be to imply causation from correlation.  </p>

<p>Time and time again, this conspiracy isn&#39;t about one &quot;smoking gun&quot;.  There will <em>not</em> be a smoking gun unless a grave mistake is made by one of them.  This statistics isn&#39;t a smoking gun, but it&#39;s part of a huge pile of evidence that keeps stacking up, all pointing to one conclusion.  We are in the process of proving causation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So...you&#39;re starting out with the assumption that anyone in government is <em>already guilty</em>, and it&#39;s just a matter of pinning something on them. Correct?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you not aware that many governments around the world are caught doing this regularly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accusations were thrown around, but didn&#39;t go very far. I&#39;m sure you <em>assume</em> that&#39;s because they were suppressed. I think they just didn&#39;t have very far to go--there may have been some pedophiles in government, but there were no massive conspiracies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the catholic church</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were priests who were pedophiles. The church, for fear of losing trust, covered the stories up and shuffled the priests around. They&#39;ve been condemned for that--and quite correctly. They have a shitload to answer for. But what exactly does that have to do with <em>these</em> accusations? You&#39;re not claiming that there may be a few pedophiles in the DNC, you&#39;re claiming that there&#39;s a <em>massive secret child sex slavery conspiracy right at the top of the DNC</em>! For <em>that</em>, there is no precedent...unless, of course, you <em>assume</em> there is, and then also assume it was covered up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you have refused to put forth the tiniest bit of effort to begin researching pizzagate like the rest of us</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You assume. I&#39;m familiar enough with conspiracy theories that it didn&#39;t take long to debunk it.</p>

<p>You guys won&#39;t actually stand up and put forth an argument, you&#39;re always telling people to &quot;look it up yourself, do the research&quot;. That&#39;s because--whether you realize it or not--you know deep down that if you put up your arguments, they&#39;d be torn to shreds. If you can convince somebody to enter the echo chamber of conspiracy pages and forums, they may actually be worn down by the constant barrage of misinformation, coincidences, half-truths and tenuous links and start to believe. Particularly people without much real-world experience.</p>

<p>Once you start to be able to sort rational arguments from vague assertions, and evidence from coincidence, then it&#39;s not too hard to figure out that there&#39;s <em>nothing here</em>. There&#39;s no single tangible piece of evidence--just a whole bunch of random facts that you guys are <em>determined</em> to build a story with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have spent enough time on the internet to know that no matter what I say will not convince you so I&#39;ll just quickly list some obvious things.</p>

<p>1. The emails are really weak evidence. It all hinges on assuming that certain words are code for pedo shit, but there&#39;s no evidence that this really is so. All of the email could realistically contain no code whatsoever; the wording is little weird in few emails, but this could easily be someone writing a quick email without thinking about it much. Furthermore, even if you assume that the words are codewords, the emails don&#39;t actually make much sense either. Take this:</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta&quot;</p>

<p>This really doesn&#39;t make any sense if you assume that cheese means little boy and pasta a little girl. But if you read the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613">whole email</a> it really looks like there is no code and he is jokingly asking if he would play dominos better after eating cheese than after eating pizza. Or take the handkerchief email. Assuming map means semen, why would he want it back? It doesn&#39;t actually make sense. Even if these are codewords, they may be completely unrelated to pedos.</p>

<p>2. Let&#39;s assume that Podesta actually built an underground vault to torture,rape,... kids. Why the fuck would he talk about it to the media? Similarly, if they were making secret tunnels in the Pizzeria, why would they take a picture and put it online?</p>

<p>3. The police sketches of the suspects in the kidnapping case are actually supposed to be of one person.</p>

<p>There&#39;s of course much more &quot;evidence&quot; than this, but I can&#39;t really go through it all. The point is that pretty much all of it is weak and not connected. A person who maybe knows Podesta a little posting few weird pictures on instagram really is no proof. Bill Clinton flying on a private jet of Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted for soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14 (though accused of much more) is no proof. John Podesta liking somewhat weird art is not a proof of anything.</p>

<p>You might say that while the individual evidence is weak, all together it&#39;s too much to be a coincidence, but I don&#39;t agree. A lot of bad evidence does not make a good evidence. But of course I can&#39;t really disprove it and frankly most of the evidence for pizzagate really seems so weak that to me it feels pointless to even argue about it.</p>

<p>Anyway, feel free to call me a shill and ignore everything I said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really campaigning. I generally avoid discussions like these because there&#39;s no point to them, so I&#39;m not going to argue further. Think about it, is there anything I could say that would change your mind? Even if I would have evidence that pizzagate is not true, you would not believe the evidence. But of course I don&#39;t have such evidence, how could I prove that something like this is not happening?</p>

<p>It&#39;s very close minded to assume that everyone who disagrees with you is a shill. The reason why this subreddit sees many people who are disagreeing is because it became big and reaches <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> regularly (that&#39;s why I&#39;m here) and because this scandal is pretty political and most redditors and not very fond of Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shills are useful in their own way. When shills engage, it unfolds one of three ways.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They have nothing but immature, empty words, such as ad hominem insults and such, which shows how incredibly weak their stance is to anyone with an ounce of critical thinking capability. </p></li>
<li><p>They serve as &#39;prompts&#39; for discussions and essentially keep the wheel turning, as far as new/updated information and explanations for anyone who pops in to check things out at any given time. In essence, shill pops up with a typical straw man argument, then anyone else can knock it the fk down for all to see.</p></li>
<li><p>In the rare case that they do bring up a good critical observation of something, it helps to encourage vetting and refining evidence and a theory itself. Beware the pitfalls of an echo chamber, in essence.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However it pans out, they help, even if that&#39;s not their intention. That is the power and beauty of truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone please look into Laura Silsby. She was caught in Haiti and jailed for trying to traffic 33 children and the first thing the Clinton Foundation did when they moved into Haiti was Hillary pardoned her, and she now creepily works on the board of directors for a company called AlertSense that is in charge of issuing amber alerts. <a href="https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/">https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/</a> (Laura Silsby-Gayler) </p>

<p>The lawyer Hillary used to help absolve Laura also was a convicted child trafficker, you just can&#39;t make this stuff up. </p>

<p>So basically, a woman who served time for trafficking kids in Haiti now sits on the board of a company that serves as the backbone for many local authorities when they want to issue Amber Alerts. </p>

<p>WikiLeaks also retweeted this story confirming it&#39;s truth and supported with emails to and from Hillary: <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417">https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417</a> </p>

<p>WikiLeaks then confirmed Hillary has a LONG history with convicted child trafficker and kidnapper Laura Silsby, and Huma Abedin (vice chairwoman of Hillary&#39;s 2016 presidential campaign) has been forwarding emails about Laura Silsby&#39;s non government organization to Hillary for years. </p>

<p>Laura Silsby was also former director of The New Life Children&#39;s Refuge, the same group that was busted by Haitian authorities trying to traffic kids:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case</a></p>

<p>And the video below is about a bunch of Haitians protesting the evils of the Clintons, and the man protesting in the video mentions how the Clintons have exploited Haiti&#39;s resources for themselves, and even specifically mentions people in Haiti are afraid to go out at night because of  fear of kidnapping. (4:48 in the video)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PeO0SfCw5s&amp;amp;list=PLeAhFbYkBiH1sLiFUnWChhofsYQk7Mc9M&amp;amp;index=66">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PeO0SfCw5s&amp;amp;list=PLeAhFbYkBiH1sLiFUnWChhofsYQk7Mc9M&amp;amp;index=66</a></p>

<p>At around the 2:00 mark he even mentions Tony Rodham (Hillary&#39;s brother) is now in charge of gold mines in Haiti and sits on the gold mine&#39;s board of directors. </p>

<p>Many people are talking about this story, continue to spread the word!! We need justice for these
 crimes, and the Clintons should be in prison. </p>

<p>correlation does not equal causation.  Do you really think that pizzagate is why the fake news issue came up and not the GUY WHO WON &lt;50% VOTE AND IS AN UNSTABLE MESS WON THE PRESIDENCY LIKELY DUE TO FAKE NEWS???  I think that&#39;s the larger narrative of the fake news story, and hey, it&#39;s coming up as a news story in wake of the election which just happened.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a silly assumption and you know it. </p>

<p>The fact there was a terrorist thing right outside comet pizza and the media won&#39;t shut up about it is pretty damning, considering the timing. Also the extremely uniform &quot;fake news&quot; thing that came out right when pizzagate did. There&#39;s so many circumstantial things, like the podesta wikileaks coded language emails, and the giant basement, and the 3 restaurants with known pedo logos all right next to each other, and the comet pizza owner being named #49 most powerful in GQ... lots of circumstantial stuff. Especially if you connect it to Epstein and the Lolita Express, and Bill Clinton. Enough to warrant an investigation, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

<p>But of course the three letter agencies are in on it, and use the pedo stuff as blackmail, so they&#39;re trying to keep the public from finding out or else they lose that blackmail power over those high-level elected politicians. If it does come out in an official way and there is an investigation and some people go down, it&#39;s going to be very surgical and only certain specific people will get thrown under the bus. Seems like Podesta and maybe a few others, but then the Clintons and many others who participated will walk away and the media will exclusively blame it on podesta. I think that&#39;s how they&#39;ll do damage control. </p>

<p>But seeing as this seems to be international, and several very high-level rings have been broken up and the those people arrested, in other countries. I think they&#39;ll use this as a way to globally &quot;trim the fat&quot; and get rid of high-level political people they don&#39;t like. After all, they never let a disaster go to waste. But the real power structure will remain intact and generally untouched, unless most people move beyond the narratives provided by the media, which is owned by that very power structure and thus will never betray it. </p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Calm down man. I don&#39;t doubt that there are high level pedophiles in the government at all I just think that you and everyone else is going down the wrong rabbit hole here. Like the incorrect one, that&#39;s making you appear unhinged. I would not be surprised if evidence came out about it in the near future I just don&#39;t think pizza gate and harassing pizza restaurants is going to actually lead anywhere. </p>

<p>Imagine just for a second these restaurants don&#39;t have anything to do with pedophilia at all besides the accusations, how do you think you&#39;d feel if you were an owner? Scared and mortified and weirded out? Nothing good I would imagine. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s fair that if you are going to stand in solidarity and deny something, especially on a forum where well over 85% of us are in support of this investigation, you should explain why.</p>

<p>It would take me hours to debunk everything but by bit. The video above does a good job. </p>

<p>Regarding the death threat I don&#39;t really know how to prove it. It&#39;s in my comments and a screen shot would have to much personal information embedded. I&#39;m hoping not to get doxxed tonight. But your right it kind of sucks without proof however would you even believe it if you saw it? </p>

<p>I can say this, I&#39;ve been on r/conspiracy for about five years. I change accounts every few years to keep the personal information low. Never have I seen what is going on now. Ever since the lead up to the election it feels like this place has been co opted by the right. If anything I believe this is where the real conspiracy lies. The right wingers co opting of r/conspiracy. With all that is going on the main focus is on this pizza gate thing and I think it&#39;s sad. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you so aggressively against this notion? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>1) Because it&#39;s led to death threats, and now a guy walking into a restaurant with a gun based off of it. It&#39;s not innocent conjecture, it&#39;s dangerously delusional. If someone gets killed because of this, you are partially responsible for spreading this shit. 
2) Because it&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg of the crazy shit that I think is coming. There&#39;s been a surge in fake news and propaganda lately, and Trump and his supporters are all-in supporting it. I&#39;m afraid that it&#39;s going to get way worse before it gets any better - attacks on random-ass people like this, attacks on Muslims, on Mexicans, whatever. We&#39;re entering a scary time right now and pizzagate seems to be a taste of what&#39;s to come in terms conspiracy theories empowered by a truth-averse president and effective Russian propaganda. </p>

<p>This is not a joke, this is not innocent questioning, this is serious shit. I doubt you&#39;ll care or be convinced by anything, but at least I hope you realize that the majority of people who care at all feel the way I feel about this and are concerned about people getting hurt based on ridiculous conspiracies. </p>

<p><strong>I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place.</strong> I immediately realized something was different by the <strong>shape of the box</strong> and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of <strong>pasta and wonderful sauces,</strong> it was a lovely, <strong>tempting</strong> assortment of <strong>cheeses</strong> , Yummy.

<p>Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.</p>

The one witness they had on CNN, was way suspect. If you ever see a witness to any crime. They never try to push an agenda, but this guy was the opposite. He didn&#39;t try to just describe what happened. He was very adamant about not only defending the pizza place, but condemning those investigating it. He appeared to be way to knowledgeable about things to be a random witness. Until he started name dropping people yesterday, I had never heard of the individuals actually pressing this theory. </p>

<p>I have never seen &quot;the perfect witness&quot;, but that&#39;s what was presented to me yesterday. He seemed way to &quot;good&quot; to be true. Go back and watch the initial footage of this guy on CNN it crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not normal behavior. At no time did he ever state the individual in question ever stated anything to him about pizzagate. He said he walked in and went straight to the back, I thought he was a security guard. Then he says that an employee grabbed him and told him to get out because it was a gunman. </p>

<p>There are only two potential reasons for this individual to even bring up pizzagate. 1. He felt the need to reinforce the statements made by CNN, or 2. He had prior knowledge of said incident and was a plant. I&#39;m not saying he was a plant, however it doesn&#39;t give the said news agency any credibility to have a &quot;whiteness&quot; to a crime discussing his stance on a fringe conspiracy. They only asked him what happened, then allowed him to rant on uninterrupted. He made every effort to defend this pizza place, and bash this theory. It was way outside the norm of a whiteness statement. </p>

<p>If I were describing an incident I had just witnessed, and there was mention of something weird going on, I would make every effort to indicate that I did here him say X Y Z or I didn&#39;t here him say anything about X Y Z. Thats not what happened. He not only agreed with said narrative, he reinforced it without hearing first hand why this guy was there at all. That doesn&#39;t seem strange to you? How come CNN never asked him how he heard the guy was there because of said conspiracy? At no point did they ask him how he knew this was pizzagate involved. At no point did he seem surprised when they reported it was pizzagate involved. Did the police tell him? How come he didn&#39;t state the police told him? It was very out of the norm if you ask me. I&#39;m not saying he was a plant, maybe CNN was just looking for someone to back up their stance, but it was out of the norm. </p>

<p>And sorry if I seem a bit on edge, but after a day filled with some of the most vile shit I have ever read I am on fucking edge.

It&#39;s the straight death threats that bother me; even though it&#39;s the internet and this is to be expected.  I wouldn&#39;t expect it from people claiming to be doing so because they are against violence.  That level of hypocrisy is what bothers me.  </p>

<p>And cool, disagree, that&#39;s your right.  I would never begrudge you that.  If whatever evidence, or lack there of, that comes out makes you think so then there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.  There&#39;s only a problem when you start responding to such with violence or that type of thing.  You get what I mean?  There&#39;s nothing wrong with open discussion from both sides, nor should there be.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not worried about the shills who pop in to mock it. I&#39;m worried about the ones that have been around the whole time, the ones that injected blatantly false narratives into what I&#39;ll call the &quot;evidence pool&quot; and then, with the other shills, managed to upvote it and include it in these short summaries of pizzagate. It&#39;s a carefully crafted plan to throw people off of the scent.</p>

<p>To give an example, look at evidence summaries including the alleged podesta sketches. That right there, for anyone familiar with the story and also how there&#39;s absolutely no evidence putting them there at the time, makes it easy to dismiss everyone. I submit that everyone sharing it as part of the evidence is, in fact, someone who infiltrated the investigation to discredit it from the inside.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not entirely sure I disagree with Alex Jones more recent statement. The refusal to spend any time crafting alternative interpretations of the original evidence is not helping either, and it may well be the biggest false flag operation among us. I think there&#39;s an entirely different conspiracy to be found among the actual investigation pieces themselves, one of carefully planted individuals with carefully crafted narratives.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;ll be downvoted because dissent is not allowed in the pizzagate conversation. It&#39;s controlled by infiltrators who need to bury reason and massively upvote the tainted &quot;evidence summaries.&quot;</p>

<p>Julian Assange must have known how explosive this can of worms was going to be and how it would impact some of the biggest names around. So he&#39;s either never coming out of hiding or........they already got him. I do think it&#39;s one extreme or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can explain most of them. Honestly, there&#39;s a video that makes it pretty clear. I&#39;ll leave it <a href="https://youtu.be/2OrX0U4qwTM">here</a> and also give my own take. Thanks for the kind response I appear douchy but I really just like to speak on logical grounds. Appreciate the comment.</p>

<p>Lemme see, first one- she is a person that receives Christmas packages for Podesta yearly. Just got a different box this year (instead of pasta and sauce, he sent her cheeses this time). What&#39;s pedophile code about it? That whole &quot;I think you should give notice...&quot; is an obvious joke if you don&#39;t see it from that POV. Think about it, she was acting like it was super official and important when it was a cheese box. I think that&#39;s called...humor.</p>

<p>Lmao, not pedophilic at all, unless you are already thinking it is. They&#39;re KIDS. KIDS ARE INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING TO HANG OUT WITH AND MAKE FUN OF. That&#39;s entertainment, not fucking them for Christ&#39;s sake. They&#39;re adults talking like adults about children. Classic confirmation bias.</p>

<p>The box that was referenced in the first quote is the one they&#39;re talking about now. I guess they would play dominos on the pasta boxes, but now they have a cheese box so she was again being facetious about the box an playing dominos. Last year they played dominos or something, look through the context emails.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just an unfortunate phrasing. I still don&#39;t think it is proof of anything. Probably just an innuendo...again, pretty disgusting if you already were looking at it from that side of the equation.</p>

<p>This one is kinda hard to know, it seemed like a typo. But in the emails there are actually two people asking him about the handkerchief. On one they called it black and white, on the other they make a weird typo possibly? I don&#39;t know for sure or something, but I think that I would say it&#39;s more likely they mistyped (maybe) &quot;pizza-related mark&quot;? I feel like that&#39;s one that is really hard to say one way or the other. But to think it&#39;s code, is a little much. Look through the rest of the emails, do they use pizza weirdly again and again? It doesn&#39;t seem so, it seems like it was just a one-time weird thing. I mean, most all of them were just ordering pizza for an event, or asking if someone wants to go eat pizza. David Seaman seriously used &quot;wanna go get pizza for an hour?&quot; as evidence for code language. PLEASE!!!!!! NOOO!!!!! I DON&#39;T KNOW HOW TO COMPUTE.</p>

<p>Sure, that&#39;s true that that symbol was on Besta Pizza&#39;s (not Comet&#39;s) logo for a second. It was changed almost immediately it seems like, it was the logo you see on google maps, not on their website anymore. It wasn&#39;t changed post-pizzagate either. Just seems like they realized the concentric triangles were already taken LOL.</p>

<p>Ever since that guy drew a gun on comet ping pong, I&#39;ve been thinking what would that accomplish. And its clear. Set the stage to ban &quot;fake news&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know whether there&#39;s real child exploitation or not, but what is pretty clear is that anything deemed fake news is going to be considered dangerous and outlawed soon.</p>

<p>Full media control, followed by the loss of net neutrality. Theyve got the people in power that could pull it off, they&#39;re just testing the waters. Give it a few months, a &quot;fake news&quot; story is going to end with someone dead. No one will believe it was staged. We&#39;ve been crying things have been staged since sandy hook.

    <div class="md"><p>If its true they won&#39;t be able to stop it.  Its already too late for that.  They can still get away with it, but the cats out of the bag.  Look to the Catholic Church having a generations long pedophilia crisis being covered up at the highest levels.  They weren&#39;t able to stop that.  When it came down to the truth or the Pope the Pope got sent packing.</p>

<p>Anyway, it looks like there was consensus to lock down all media to an approved narrative after the election.  Hillary may have fallen, but they are going on without her.  I don&#39;t think they can do it without the presidency, congress is worthless, the courts are too slow.  These things always fail even if they did have the power to do it, its a fools errand.</p>

Leading up to election day, it was all about suppressing the Podesta emails and anything relating to the private email server. The day after elections, the whole web seemed like it took a breath and went back to the way it was a solid several years ago. Then the very next day, everyone was back to suppress anything having to do with this story. It was astonishing to behold how coordinated it was, and continues to be. There are some powerful people with very deep pockets behind this. I wonder if it&#39;s a full-on govt. backed thing, because it certainly seems that way, but the govt. can&#39;t be <em>that</em> efficient and coordinated, can it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well one of the biggest things to do is to stop calling the shit that&#39;s being investigated &quot;conspiracies&quot; because that does the work for them. Calling anything that might be true a conspiracy just discredits itself because of people&#39;s cultivated view of people and their opinions who happen to be labeled conspiracy theorists or similar. Basic psyops.</p>

I have to say that many of these rant videos get way to personal. NO one is going to win over any minds talking like this. You have to drop the ego and get the info out there if someone attacks you, you don&#39;t attack back. Give evidence, make your stand and don&#39;t get personally. This attitude is the reason why people don&#39;t take things like this seriously. This is an EXTREMELY sensitive subject, treat it that way. Don&#39;t witch hunt, counter personal attacks with facts.

This guy u/talented thinks he has all the answers, and accuses others of not backing up their statements, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5glzva/for_those_that_question_whether_pizzagate_needs/datz890/">when he&#39;s fucking guilty of doing it himself LOL.</a></p>

<p>I find it even more suspicious that he&#39;s been gifted reddit gold. I don&#39;t like accusing someone of shilling, and I have to admit, u/talented makes pseudo-sense, but it feels like he&#39;s using a classic red herring argument. He doesn&#39;t even address the Madeline McCann case, in which police sketches implicate BOTH the Podestas.</p>

<p>Then what the fuck are you even doing taking part in this circle-jerk of aggressive skepticism against those investigating Pizzagate? </p>

<p>Alright, time for some clarifications:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you believe that the current data we have warrants an investigation into James Alefantis (ranked in top 50 most powerful people in DC) and his dubiously &quot;family-friendly&quot; Comet Ping Pong Pizza establishment?</li>
<li>Do you believe there is credibility in the evidence (yes, I admit, it&#39;s highly circumstantial at a glance, but it falls into place when EVERYTHING is looked at in unison) implicating the Podesta brothers (oh by the way, Tony Podesta and his wife are also ranked in the top 50 most powerful people in DC) in the abduction of Madeline McCann?</li>
<li>Do you honestly think $65,000 dollars would be spent on flying in Hot dogs and pizzas into Washington without it being some sort of code?</li>
<li>Do you really think a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code">handkerchief</a> would not be code to something very sinister in the <strong>absurd context it was being used in by a fucking realtor?!</strong></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a circlejerk, well not on my part. I have been around. I live my life with heavy skepticism. Though, I have seen poor responses with no references from both sides way too often. I waste so much time reading source material.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>James Alefantis - other than being gay, having liberal artsy bands and occult references. Sometimes akin to 90s death metal I used to see. No not really. I haven&#39;t seen anything on the guy that made me question whether the dude was a pedo. The picture of a photo of sex in an art gallery is something the guy definitely should not be posting on Instagram. I am sure there are friends who don&#39;t appreciate that stuff. Though, some of the guys complaining in this sub about his Instagram have worse shit in their Reddit history. Yes, I do look. I don&#39;t accuse them of being pedos.</p></li>
<li><p>I am still reading your links in the other post about it. Links I got to say are rather sketch but I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt. My impression so far is they rented from a famous guy, Sir Clement, who apparently nobody knew was a possible pedo in his youth. He was accused after death and has no way to defend himself. Though, seemingly credible accusation. Still. Regarding the Podesta&#39;s and their possible link to the kidnapping. This was cited: <a href="http://victuruslibertas.com/2016/11/do-john-and-tony-podesta-have-a-connection-with-missing-child-madeleine-mccann/">http://victuruslibertas.com/2016/11/do-john-and-tony-podesta-have-a-connection-with-missing-child-madeleine-mccann/</a>. But that site has no citations about them actually being there. &quot;One of our FBI insiders can confirmed the Intelligence community  indicates John and Tony Podesta were in Praia da Luz,  Portugal on May 3rd 2007– the day Madaline McCann vanished.&quot; I mean a sketch site and no references to this FBI anon. I have seen that over the years too often to trust a random person to claim it. I half have the urge to look for a source but I don&#39;t want to waste my time.</p></li>
<li><p>I do think $65,000 is possible to spend on Hot Dogs and Pizza. The white House apparently can&#39;t bring in outside food, so they fly in Chef&#39;s to cater specific things. I imagine between setting up a party, hiring a chef and staff, and procuring the specific items that those chefs need. Yeah, I do. My friends spent $30000+ on an engagement dinner party here in California. Nothing about it surprises me.</p></li>
<li><p>The handkerchief map reference is a relatively odd but there are handkerchief maps to restaurants. Whether it is code, the link you sent essentially states it is just Gay code. They are liberal, I doubt they need code. I mean look at the public discussions they had. I also don&#39;t care about them being gay. How does it connect to pedophilia? The only supposed connection was the 4chan troll comment about made-up code words. I have asked to see actual historical usage from people who have tried to link it. I haven&#39;t seen it. Whether that specific thing was we will never know, but John&#39;s convo was casual and it was thrown away.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I was promised a pedo ring. I didn&#39;t get it. Though, I am sure there are pedo&#39;s in Washington. I mean every country has had the problem with people in power taking advantage of youth. I also fail to see people arguing pizzagate forget that a lot of child trafficking has been an evangelical movement to save the children around the world for decades. A lot of it legal but also illegal. Schemes in which unsavory people have taken advantage of. Which is why we have so many adoption laws in this country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rothschild KM then create an illegal taxation System in America:</p>

<p>The KM put an illegal, Unconstitutional tax system in place, in order to make sure that Americans would have to pay for high-level USG spending, approved by a bought-off, crooked Congress and Presidential puppets, put in place by corrupt KM campaign finance.</p>

<p>It is easy for the KM to garner enough money to elect anyone they want, because when you control a bank that is a secret major counterfeiter, you have all the money made for you that you desire. At about the same time that they created their illegal tax system in America, they also bribed members of Congress to approve the Internal Revenue Service, which is their private collection agency incorporated in Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, they set up the Federal Bureau of Investigation to protect their banksters, to serve their cover-up needs and prevent them from ever being prosecuted for their child sacrifice rituals, pedophile networks; and to also serve as a covert Intel operation on their behalf.</p>

<p>Note that the FBI has no official charter, according to the Library of Congress, and has no right to exist or issue paychecks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not part of the topminds community because I dislike the idea of ridiculing people for their beliefs. If they&#39;re malicious, that&#39;s different, but over there they&#39;re making fun of people who clearly have mental issues and attribute mental illness to people who simply have weird opinions. That&#39;s also why I don&#39;t post there. I&#39;m not a ban evader because I&#39;ve never been banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read many subreddits. I also made a joke. Note that a &quot;X subscribers&quot; post isn&#39;t ridiculing anyone, and I wasn&#39;t ridiculing any one person in my comment, I made a joke about pizzagate. IIRC the other comment I made there was arguing with a holocaust denier.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t dismiss anyone&#39;s beliefs unless it&#39;s malicious. You can disagree with someone without dismissing their beliefs. Pizzagate is a bit of an odd one since in this one the gap between strength of evidence and the certainty with which it&#39;s believed is overwhelming. With 9/11 conspiracies and such there are reports and historical information you can discuss. With pizzagate there is absolutely nothing to show, and yet all the headlines in this subreddit are &quot;we must keep pushing this forward&quot; and any dissenting opinion is just assumed to be a paid shill.</p>

<p>Conspiracies exist, that&#39;s why I care in the first place, and you won&#39;t uncover a single one of them if you waste all your efforts chasing misinformation and things that aren&#39;t there. This subreddit is woefully short on critical thinking. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ymrd6/leaked_emails_show_ctr_efforts_and_messaging_is/">This</a> is me calling out a troll by EnoughTrumpSpam that got upvoted to 1700.</p>

<p>On that I agree, I won&#39;t dismiss it out of hand as there&#39;s some interesting points there, and a wealth of evidence for elite paedo rings too, but much stronger evidence is needed before I&#39;ll entirely believe it in that instance.  </p>

<p>I also actually do believe that a few &#39;tame&#39; skeptics are a well needed addition here to balance out the few users who believe things at face value despite a lack of meaningful data <em>but</em>, if I didn&#39;t remind them to stay respectful or attempt to hunt out topmind infiltrators I wouldn&#39;t be doing my job as a mod here IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I couldn&#39;t help but look into your post history too. Anyway,  if reddit wants to remain a place where you can sign up without confirming your identity then yeah I suppose that you&#39;re right, en masse it&#39;s hard to know who is paid and who is not. But if you think about it rationally, the percentage of people being paid by some organization will always be extremely small in the face of the rest of us normal ass people who spend way too much of their free time here. If you factor that into you&#39;re thinking it becomes pretty clear that there are just a shit ton of people in this world with strong and differing opinions. Doesn&#39;t mean we are being paid by the man.</p>

<p>Absolutely fine by me man.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Undoubtedly, which is why it&#39;s necessary to extra vigilant when dealing with users we don&#39;t immediately recognise arguing for censorship on a sub that absolutely abhors &#39;curating&#39; by moderators. It&#39;s not our place to dictate what is acceptable to believe if a user speaks their mind <em>within the framework of the rules</em>.<br/>
I may not always agree with them, I very often don&#39;t, but I have absolutely no right to dictate acceptable topics or act in a censorious manner due to personal biases.<br/>
This to me is everything wrong with the vast majority of reddit.</p>

<p>Same horrendous topic doesn&#39;t make it the &quot;same narrative&quot;. I commend you on your grasp of history but it&#39;s foolish to use that as sole reason to call pizzagate a political strategy.</p>

Its funny that instead of just stating facts that support your claim, facts that would be hard to ignore you just yell shill. You cant state the facts that support your claim because there are no facts, it is all a bunch of cobbled together hearsay. Please correct me if I am wrong by just laying out the facts in manner that does not include name calling or require me to jump to a bunch of conclusions.

<p>In regards to the other questions, I have not looked into that and would have to do further research.</p>

<p>Lots of companies went through the state approval process to violate the law and engage in corruption. Getting the veneer of state approval is important if you are going to have a proper cover story so that questions are not asked. Just look at the long paper trail of donations which were made to the Clintons from companies who immediately received economic exemptions upon giving money. The State Department was staffed at top levels with people who were either Clinton cronies or were still actually employed at the Clinton Foundation simultaneously which is also blatantly illegal.</p>

<p>Clinton was stupid and never thought she was going to be caught for this stuff. Otherwise she wouldn&#39;t have been keeping her emails on an unsecured personal server in the first place. She just assumed she wasn&#39;t going to get burned for this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read many subreddits. I also made a joke. Note that a &quot;X subscribers&quot; post isn&#39;t ridiculing anyone, and I wasn&#39;t ridiculing any one person in my comment, I made a joke about pizzagate. IIRC the other comment I made there was arguing with a holocaust denier.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t dismiss anyone&#39;s beliefs unless it&#39;s malicious. You can disagree with someone without dismissing their beliefs. Pizzagate is a bit of an odd one since in this one the gap between strength of evidence and the certainty with which it&#39;s believed is overwhelming. With 9/11 conspiracies and such there are reports and historical information you can discuss. With pizzagate there is absolutely nothing to show, and yet all the headlines in this subreddit are &quot;we must keep pushing this forward&quot; and any dissenting opinion is just assumed to be a paid shill.</p>

<p>Conspiracies exist, that&#39;s why I care in the first place, and you won&#39;t uncover a single one of them if you waste all your efforts chasing misinformation and things that aren&#39;t there. This subreddit is woefully short on critical thinking. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ymrd6/leaked_emails_show_ctr_efforts_and_messaging_is/">This</a> is me calling out a troll by EnoughTrumpSpam that got upvoted to 1700.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>People getting suspicious of &#39;a man walking with child&#39; is the whole reason The Finders were discovered (and subsequently covered up)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading the report, an anonymous caller was concerned when two men wearing suits and ties were supervising 6 children who were &quot;dirty and unkempt&quot;. It turned out they were covered in bug bites, incredibly dirty, not bathed for several days, and many of the children were not wearing underwear. Furthermore, their van clearly appeared like the 2 men and 6 children were living inside--they were arrested for child abuse charges and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/us/inquiry-spreads-on-6-children-and-cult.html">slapped with felonies upon further investigation</a>. This goes far beyond a man simply walking with his child in public. Curiously, this is the only information I can find about the alleged Finders cult. How do we know if this a cover up? The link you sent me came from a site dedicated to Ted Gunderson, who earnestly believed in conspiracies range from the US being responsible for the 1993 WTC bombing, the US setting up the Oklahoma City bombing, Satanic Ritual Abuse, and the NWO. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>what kind of harm would be done if the allegations were true but kept being denied? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the allegations have to be reasonable for an appropriate investigation. So far, nobody has found the allegations to be reasonable outside of niche internet communities. The real question is, why? Why do you think nobody from the local police to the FBI have bothered to investigate this issue if there is clear probable cause? I can surmise why, but let&#39;s get to that later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would literally take 1 youtube video of someone being allowed to thoroughly search Comet Ping Pong for the existence of the denied basement, etc. And if it&#39;s a family-friendly establishment, there should really be no reason why not...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is akin to the dangerous argument, &quot;why do you care about privacy if you have nothing to hide?&quot; Edward Snowden, whom I have a great deal of respect for and yearn for a pardon, leaked classified documents regarding the US government&#39;s mass surveillance on US citizens. Why should we care about what the NSA does if we have nothing to hide? </p>

<p>Imagine you are driving on the interstate to go your favorite concert. You have no open container of alcohol in your car and no drugs. However, you borrowed a DVD from your friend and accidentally left it in the car, the DVD is Half Baked. The officer asks where you are going, you tell him a concert. He immediately notices the Half Baked DVD box and becomes suspicious that you may be harboring marijuana in your vehicle. He asks you if he can search your car. What do you say? If you say no. He bothers you further, and tells you, &quot;if I just do a quick search of your vehicle, you can go about your day and make it to your concert in a timely manner without having to worry about parking. If you have nothing to hide, this will be quick.&quot; Would you agree to those terms?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>millions of dollars are being spent ... to discredit the theory and attack the researchers</p>

<p>Can you verify that millions of dollars are being spent to discredit pizzagate and attack people partaking in the internet investigation?</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Breitbart</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewBreitbart/status/33636278100561920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Tweet in question.</a>. Breitbart determined that Podesta was part of a mass coverup of child sex trafficking rings <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CyTPH-GUkAAgvmL.jpg:large">Planned Parenthood (PP)</a> and <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CyTAe4JWEAEa4l7.jpg:large">ACORN</a>. PP had several undercover investigations by LiveAction to demonstrate PP supports and aids sex traffickers trying to get services for their underaged prostitutes. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/01/AR2011020106135.html">In all but one case, authorities were alerted regarding these sex traffickers.</a> prior to LiveAction releasing videos, but with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuoI8vbtPvM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">a notable exception</a>. PP fired that woman for her actions. ACORN was also implicated in sex trafficking of minors by O&#39;Keefe, but was cleared of wrongdoing after several investigations due to O&#39;Keefe&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACORN_2009_undercover_videos_controversy">artistic license and lying regarding his heavily edited videos</a>. Breitbart earnestly believed the O&#39;Keefe documentary, however, the raw footage from the ACORN videos presented an entirely different picture than what they painted. As it turns out, according to California&#39;s Attorney General documents, Vera (the interviewee of ACORN) <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press_releases/n1888_acorn_report.pdf">reported the situation to authorities. (read pages 16 and 17 of this document to save yourself some time)</a>. So Breitbart was accusing Podesta of covering up unsubstantiated sex trafficking supported by Planned Parenthood and ACORN.</p>

<p>Breitbart&#39;s death. His death really came at no surprise to anybody. Prior to his death, he already had a history with heart problems, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA2YIQr1XM4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=100">having suffered a heart attack before.</a> Additionally, further rumors came out to support that foul play was going on with the death of coroner Michael Cormier. I am anticipating that I would get this as a followup response. <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/news/andrew-breitbarts-fans-think-his-coroner-was-suspiciously-poisoned-to-death-2388318">Cormier did not perform the autopsy of Breitbart.</a></p>

<p><strong>Monica Petersen</strong></p>

<p>If we believe Monica Petersen&#39;s friend, and I don&#39;t see why we shouldn&#39;t, she certainly was <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TmiB2gU.png">critical of the Clinton Foundation.</a> Petersen, however, was not in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/12/06/another-false-pizzagate-tale-the-death-of-a-sex-worker-activist-in-haiti/">Haiti to investigate the Clinton Foundation nor child trafficking</a>. While the reference I linked is critical of pizzagate and comes from Washington Post, they are citing the chief director of her employer, <a href="http://www.du.edu/korbel/faculty/destree.html">Claude d’Estree</a> of the Human Trafficking Center. The Human Trafficking Center has an <a href="http://www.snopes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/human-trafficking-center.jpg">unfavorable opinion</a> of those making allegations that she was murdered.</p>

<p>I found a rather questionable article referencing a <a href="http://wikileaksdecrypted.com/journalist-monica-petersen-found-dead-undergoing-child-trafficking-investigation/">person speaking for Petersen that&#39;s rather damning for the Clinton Foundation</a>. I cannot find this information anywhere else, and therefore cannot determine the validity of it as a result.</p>

<p>Additionally, I cannot find anything stating that Petersen&#39;s family thinks she was murdered. Could you provide some references for me?</p>

People have speculated that his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/17/uk-conspiracy-theorists-mother-fears-he-was-murdered-in-poland">research into UFOs is what led to his demise.</a></p>

<p>Max Spiers&#39; death may not be surprising considering he had an opiate addiction, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUTU5fNmpvY">according to his mother.</a> He struggled with addiction, although he may have been clean for a long period of time. But as anyone knows, when opiate users relapse, they often overdose by taking the dose they used to take prior to being clean. This may have been the case of what happened to my cousin with heroin, or it may have been more likely that my cousin died from badly cut heroin. Spiers suffered from headaches and vomited black blood, which sounds like intestinal bleeding. <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/52ll4v/black_vomit/">Someone posted on an opiates subreddit explaining the same issues of headaches and black vomit from three days of opiate tea use.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4KrCzit1o">Here is Spiers&#39; last interview</a>, he is clearly slurring his words and unable to speak articulately.</p>

<p>Was he investigating pedophilia? In the interview, I think he did mention something about child abuse, but I didn&#39;t listen to the entire thing because he&#39;s difficult to understand (like Ozzy Osbourne levels). The only other sources I could find on his investigations regarding pedophilia are from very sketchy tabloid websites like The Daily Mail and The Sun, and many websites I&#39;ve never heard of before that clearly post similarly alarming content. </p>

<p><strong>Government pedophilia</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_paedophile_dossier">Yes</a>, shit like this does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6W8H5Z0XAc">happen more</a> than we&#39;d like to admit. <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42108748/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/massive-online-pedophile-ring-busted-cops/">Although we can&#39;t say nothing is done about these situations.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why Hillary Clinton and the Pope himself are trying to silence it. Because there&#39;s nothing to see here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Catholic church certainly has its sordid history with child sex abuse. But we&#39;re still speculating that Hillary Clinton is involved. Perhaps we could even argue that there is another conspiracy that all of these allegations exist to bring down the Clinton, and in conjunction, the Democratic bid for 2016. Republicans have been after the Clintons for decades, with the only thing that stuck to Bill Clinton was his affair with Monica Lewinsky, where he lied under oath. Hillary Clinton has been tagged with a number of scandals in an attempt to bring her down, which, ultimately, ended up wildly successful for Republicans. So perhaps this pizzagate scandal was engineered as high up as the upper echelons of the GOP, implanted in the hypervigilant /pol/ chan communities to rile up the alt- and new-right emerging base. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, it&#39;s long and right off the bat you start by trying to just discredit my sources. Terrific...</p>

<p>Next is your privacy comment...well guess what, places that serve food to the public aren&#39;t exactly privy to the same kind as you enjoy.</p>

<p>Your critique of Brietbart is that his claims were unsubstantiated... really missing the point there that his claims are relevant to pizzagate. Not to mention they tie in David Brock (think CTR, Hillary Clinton)</p>

<p>Monica Petersen - you can do a search on this sub if you&#39;re interested. What her friends and family are saying is vastly different from the washington post. Funny you discredit former FBI agent Gunderson while most of your links are from MSM publications that are known liars. </p>

<p>Spiers - you couldn&#39;t understand him? how is that a relevant argument..</p>

<p>And Hillary is innocent because scandals have been made up about her in the past... ok</p>

<p>Well you sure seem eager to deny what&#39;s right in front of you. Most of your reasoning is laughable, to me. Feels like I&#39;m wasting my time take care.</p>

<p>B+ for effort</p>

<p>D- for research and logic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have very much shown that to be false. I hopelessly urge you to reassess how &#39;skeptical and thoughtful&#39; you are, only for your own good. I&#39;m not invested in you.</p>
