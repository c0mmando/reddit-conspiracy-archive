        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe the key to a better world is the transparency of those in power. Whether it is through financial or political means those who seek power from the people must remain accoutable to those they represent. In our current system those in power are allowed to be the most secretive and as we know with more power the pressure to corrupt becomes stronger. To help ourselves we must help dissuade those in power from the temptations of corruption by making them completely transparent and accountable to the people who elected them as representatives of their beliefs, who all know in their hearts what is right and wrong. That is why I would like to put the power back into the hands of the common righteous men and women by requiring all politicians to wear body cameras or be video recorded at all times to ensure we the people are in fact being represented truthfully. Part of volunteering for a political position should be the sacrifice of freedom by that politician for as long as they are in power, because if they truly are in it for good reasons they have nothing to hide. End secrecy of authority. Give power back to the people, where it belongs. Every signature share or like is one step closer to a real solution and peaceful political revolution. #bodycamerasonpoliticians</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this idea and the idea of total transparency like this is nice.  The thing is though, that the politicians are only those who are publicly in power.  The day we get body cameras on the rockefellers and rothschilds then ill be interested...  </p>
