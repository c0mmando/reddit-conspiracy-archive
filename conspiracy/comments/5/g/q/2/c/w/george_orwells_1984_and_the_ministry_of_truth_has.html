        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.&quot; (1.1.8)</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s a beautiful thing, the Destruction of words. Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn&#39;t only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word, which is simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take ‘good,’ for instance. If you have a word like ‘good,’ what need is there for a word like ‘bad’? ‘Ungood’ will do just as well – better, because it&#39;s an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of ‘good,’ what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like ‘excellent’ and ‘splendid’ and all the rest of them? ‘Plusgood’ covers the meaning or ‘doubleplusgood’ if you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already, but in the final version of Newspeak there&#39;ll be nothing else. In the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words – in reality, only one word. Don&#39;t you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was B.B.&#39;s idea originally, of course,&quot; he added as an afterthought. (1.5.23, Syme)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know right? When I was in high school a few years ago they were just starting to tell teachers not to cover it anymore. I will always be greatful that my teacher told us this and had us read it anyway because it was &quot;very important&quot;. Needless to say he lost his job two years later... I read it again recently and it felt more realistic, and terrifying than ever.</p>
