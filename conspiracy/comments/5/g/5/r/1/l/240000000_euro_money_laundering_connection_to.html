       I apologize for this fuck up. I was even sitting here staring at my computer screen this morning trying to remember how the fuck I linked it.... need more sleep and more organization
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've been asked about the connection to Besta Pizza and Besta World. Right, at this moment I don't have irrefutable evidence linking this, but if you consider that Besta World links to this massive amounts of money, drug, child and arms laundering thru the Taylors, which just so happens to pop up the thumbnail for Bounce, which just so happens to be nearly identical to Comet Ping Pong (and Ace for that matter), and just so happens to be next to a law firm that Cheryl Mills used to work at with Sandler, that just so happens to have a place next door to it called Besta Pizza, that just so happens to be owned by a Qatari with pedo symbols in the logo.... then I have a bridge to sell.

" A few notable businessmen said to be calling the shots in Shaba are American Maurice Tempelsman, Zimbabwean Billy Rautenbach, South African Marc Rich, British John Bredenkamp, Swede Adolph Lundin and Jean Raymond Boulle.
Tenke Mining, owned by Swedish mining magnate Lundin is one of some 15 multinational mining companies partnered with GECAMINES in Shaba. Lundin is called a longtime associate of George HW Bush; African Confidential reported in 1997 that the ex-president telephoned Mobutu on Lundin's behalf after the dictator had threatened to terminate a mining contract.
Pardoned by outgoing President Clinton for tax-evasion charges, Marc Rich operates the Swiss-based Glencore company. "

       "Katanga's militias and racketeering are connected to criminal networks of businessmen, including Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, Billy Rautenbach, John Bredenkamp, and Marc Rich. U.S. diamond magnate Maurice Tempelsman has profited from Katanga concessions since the Kennedy era. Lawrence Devlin, the old CIA station chief of Lubumbashi under Eisenhower, maintained Tempelsman's criminal rackets with direct ties to Zaire's former President Mobutu, and was subsequently employed by Tempelsman (16).

       What can we do? 
Wait it out till these dinosaurs die? 
Boycott their business? 
Vote out their accomplices?
We can't have vigilantes deciding what's real and what isn't.
What's the best move here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Compile everything and continue notifying authorities? Isn't the DOJ corrupt? Will individuals face personal harm for exposing links to child trafficking? Harassment from their own government? We need an anonymous tip line, but they will continue to investigate themselves and claim no wrong doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recall the information coup going on within the government, will they continue to provide bread crumbs for us? Will Wikileaks be resurrected? It's going to need to take catching them in the act and them ratting everyone out. Any info from Wiener laptop?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep up the excellent work to those who continue to stay involved in this fluid investigation.

       The media's "reporting" on this issue has been miserably pathetic.  Never addresses the evidence, just attacks the accusers.  Takes owners word.  I can only imagine how this would have went down if they would have handled it the same way with Jeffrey Dahmer.
