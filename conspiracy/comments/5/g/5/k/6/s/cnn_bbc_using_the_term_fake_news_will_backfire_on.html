       I noticed this term being thrown around. They are calling #pizzagate "fake news". I believe this will backfire on them as it shines a light on their own credibility. People will be pondering this term as it rattles around their vernaculars. They'll wonder what fake news really means. Hopefully they'll notice whats staring them right in the face.

       The "Fake news" push is based on a very common marketing strategy called "Perceived Value." It's the idea that when packaged correctly, a product is perceived to be prestigious/valuable/luxurious, etc. It has nothing to do with absolute value of the actual product, only the perception of the presentation.

       MSM is struggling to remain relevant in a time where they are not. They desperately
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       people to believe they are offering something of value to stay afloat - and in the case of pizzagate, tourniquet the wound.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are absolutely right. It will ultimately backfire, and it is gonna be epic.

       CNN is an entertainment channel to sell commercial air time and the BBC is so worthless that it requires constant government funding. In fact the BBC started out as a government propaganda channel, just like the American PBS, and has never left it. Now that they no longer accurately relay information about disasters or crisis, like terrorist attacks, they have even less useful to normal people, i.e. people who don't work in a government or globalist capacity. People who work in the Information Technology field, like the News organizations, which are really just old-school IT for Broadcasting with Advertising space that say what they are paid to say and act how they are hired to act.

       And I hope people will start to notice the difference between real news and sponsored pieces. So, McDonalds has a new sandwich?  Top notch investigative reporting there. There's some new drug? I'm sure Phizer didn't sponsor that.

       This "Fake News" bullshit - fake and fabricated articles have been around as long as we've had news to read or hear - might just be big enough to kill MSM. It's big enough that it could discredit some major newspapers, which would be the end of them.

       Mainstream media is already on the way out. Celente has a good point in one of his interviews, many MSM outlets tied to that list of 65 journalists blindly supported Hillary and it showed in their parrot like messaging and SHE STILL LOST!
      </p>
      <p>
       A recent stat said about 30% of respondents thought that MSM was truthful or real. That means about 2/3 rds of their viewers likely just see them as infotainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's already happening. The Internet and associated technologies are opening information up to all with access. Just because MSM' broadcast medium is one way doesn't mean most people (edit
       <em>
        don't * ) doubt them and (
       </em>
       don't*) completely distrust them.

       Of couse it will backfire. I'm actually surprised they devised this crap, barely ANYBODY trusts the mainstream media anymore. Don't they realize the irony of this whole thing? The actual "Fake News" calling alternative media sources "Fake News"? Dumbest thing the system has ever done, because when they created the term fake news, they didn't anticipate the possibility of having that term applied to THEM. "Fake news" is going to be applied to them and used against them.  It will take some time to spread, but this is the fucking nail in the coffin of the MSM.
      </p>

       Just a perfect example that when TPTB are faced with an immediate crisis (pizzagate being leaked), they are forced to rush, and when they rush, they make mistakes. They are not "all powerful and all knowing", they fuck up too, and they are frequently forced to bury their mistakes and run damage control.

       2016 and the bizarre Orlando, the imperial HRC POTUS campaign and all the MSM onboard the HRC ship.

       the MSM has dug its own grave, people know and/or have suspicions on the infamous news stories, not all of them but enough to raise doubts.
      </p>
      <p>
       all these billion dollar news orgs that fcuk up so often in reporting basic stories, or fail to keep their respective stories straight to the official story.

       them talking 'fake news' will crucify the MSM.

       There was an article I recently read where they claimed pizzagate was debunked, and linked to another site (NYT or something), and I clicked over. The article went something like this: "Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that has been debunked...."
uhhh, they didn't debunk crap. Just saying its debunked doesn't make it so. They also managed to omit all the weird ass crap, like Ping Pong social media pics showing kids duct taped to tables and the like.

       do not forget the Daily Mail, they quite often are the originating source for a lot of TLA disinfo. DC is outsourcing to London outlets.

       back when Google and Bing could be relied on for accurate dates on news, the story/article or picture could often be traced back to the DM.
      </p>
      <p>
       late 2012 and definitely 2013 Google deliberately fuzzed up their date records (Bing remained accurate for a while), and Bing made their picture search tools less useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       it used to be possible to look for comparative pictures on Bing and find the MSM's original hires source pics. this often told a story and showed who had placed the first picture onto the web.

       Did you not have cable/CNN a couple years ago?  If not, I think the flight was called "mh370" it vanished en route to somewhere and CNN literally did nothing for 40 straight days but cover the fact there was no information about what happened to the plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing but endless speculation about what happened, guys in flight simulators flying over the same route the plane took showing how it could have gone down, interviewing the pilot's ex-girlfriend, shit like that, non-stop, no other news
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       for the entire time.  Not
       <em>
        one other news story
       </em>
       was reported on (except for the crawl at the bottom), and this was the same time period Russia was invading somebody, maybe ukraine(?) or whoever they invaded back then, and tons of other world events.  I was watching almost non-stop in utter disbelief because I could not believe how insane it was becoming, but it really was
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       insane.  Like crazy-people insane.  I thought maybe I had maybe entered the twilight zone.  They had
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       info
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       , and they just kept rehashing and rehashing
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       with non-stop "BREAKING" updates that were always just complete bullshit about how nothing new was being discovered.  "BREAKING!!!!  SEARCH CONTINUES FOR FLIGHT MH370!"  Shit like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what you mean by links, like, I don't know if anyone recorded 40 straight days of nothing.  I just remember watching it while it happened.

       Oh yeah that was pretty funny. The people at the top of the media, the editors/owners etc, are seriously just fucking with people's heads at this point. Maybe their secondary motive was to subliminally discredit Malaysia but honestly the whole thing is just to manipulate people's emotions.

       We have a troll government and a troll media and a troll economy and troll "justice" system and a troll culture, and it's all just a bunch of fucking magic and misdirection and who gives a shit.  There is nothing authentic anymore
       <em>

       except the weapons they use when you step out of line.  Everything else is Bizzaro Disneyland on an epic scale.  I don't see why anyone participates in this madhouse anymore.  It's not worth the grief.  Just fucking drop out.  Grow pot and potatoes, burn your TV and and say 'fuck you!' to this farce of society is maybe the right move.

       Haha. Your description of this is gold. I couldn't figure out what the fuck mgmt at CNN was thinking. I guess they were getting good ratings. They seem to exhibit this behavior often on some news items but that 40 day period with the missing plans was insane.

       After that I realized that the middle N in CNN is like the M in MTV.  It no longer has anything to do with "News", it's just a meaningless anachronism from the ancient past when things meant things.  Today it's pure "currentish events" based entertainment.  And they're all like that now, not a single one is immune to the cancer.  If I were a journalist today I would be in a ball crying on the floor.

       remember the CNN dude (park arrest guy) who took a film crew onto the same MH370 plane a couple of weeks before it vanished.
      </p>
      <p>
       same co-pilot too.
      </p>
      <p>
       there was a 100% CNN PRE-connection to the vanished MH370.
      </p>
      <p>
       somebody on that CNN film crew had access to the planes electronics bay.
      </p>
      <p>
       inserting a command module or changing software would have been easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       remember that just four months later MH17 was shot-down over the Eastern Ukraine during a NATO exercise !?
