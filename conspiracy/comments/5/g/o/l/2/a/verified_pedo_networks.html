The allegations also claimed that the alleged sex ring was led by, "a cult of devil worshipers involved in the mutilation, sacrifice and cannibalism of numerous children." Although dismissed as an 'elaborate hoax', there are numerous witnesses, numerous witnesses, hard evidence, and a conspiracy of elite-protective countermeasures having been revealed as disinfo, all of which continues to be ignored by the mainstream even today.

His wife, Michelle Martin, was convicted as an accomplice. Dutroux was also convicted of having killed a suspected former accomplice, Bernard Weinstein. He was arrested in 1996 and has been in prison ever since, though he briefly escaped in April 1998."  Dutroux was arrested for kidnapping and raping five girls and severed an exceedingly short sentence and released on parole with government pension.  He used sleeping pills he received from his psychiatrist on his further victims in a pornographic rape dungeon with assistance from his wife and at least one other accomplice; starving their victims to death and burying their bodies in a garden.  He was again arrested for six months while his wife managed the rape dungeon.  He was arrested a third time with his wife and accomplice Lelievre, and police found the victims' bodies including former accomplish Wittingstein, and a huge stash of pornographic videos.  A total of 4 conspirators and 7 victims in this sex/murder ring, but questions were asked about the Belgian Justice system with respect to how investigations were botched in allowing this to happen, though the conclusions drawn were that Dutroux benefitted from corruption, sloppiness and incompetence.

Some were drug-dealers selling heroin and cocaine, while others were described as "well-educated men with good prospects".  The gang coerced the girls into sex with small payments of money, gifts of drugs and alcohol, and by persuading them that having sex with many men was part of "Somali 'culture and tradition'".

          : Widespread organized child sexual abuse took place in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England, between 1997 and 2013. Local investigations into the abuse began in 1999, although some reports were never finalised or made public by the authorities.  The report estimated that 1,400 children had been sexually abused in the town between 1997 and 2013, predominantly by gangs of British-Pakistani men. Abuses described included abduction, rape, torture and sex trafficking of children. Over the course of several arrests, a total of 20 Pakistani men were implicated [M,A,P]

In May 2013, they were convicted of sexual offences including rape, conspiracy to commit rape, arranging or facilitating child prostitution, trafficking for sexual exploitation, and procuring a miscarriage. Their victims were "subjected to sexual violence marked out by its sadism: sexual assaults designed to draw blood, multiple rapes, [and] physical attacks in which [they were] choked".  As in the similar Rochdale, Rotherham, Derby and Telford prosecutions, all the girls were white and all the abusers were not, leading to renewed discussion as to whether the crimes were racially motivated and whether the initial failure to investigate them was linked to the authorities' fear of being accused of racism."

       I think you need to include  the Hastert/Foley/Boehner coverup to the list as this was most likely tied to a much larger ring in the House of Representatives,  that included predatory acts towards pages.   Also,  maybe the Sandusky case,  which likely included many enablers.

       As a safeguard,  I think we should also include the Kern County false pedophile case,  as a reminder that this investigation can also turn into an unjustified witch hunt when hysterical suppositions are taken to be "proof",  and then it might take decades for child abuse cases to regain traction lost in the miscarriage of justice.   Let's hope Pizzagate does not end up helping the criminals in the same way.    Lots of people include sadistic and perverted memes and virtual worship of sick fucks in their daily lives while not personally acting out on criminality:

       Btw, in pulling this together, I noticed an emerging theme.  It's that many of these UK sex abuse cases were by gangs of affluent british-pakistani men with underage girls, engaged not just in molestation/rape but drugging, drug abusing/dealing, prostitution, rape-torture, slaying and acts of mind control and cultism.  Literally a criminal mafia of the worst sort of abuses. They were allowed to flourish because of political correctness leading to investigative and legislative policies that inhibited racial profiling. Even though, fuck, was it ever warranted to racially profile g d pakistanis if you look at what all this very specific group did.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the other type of pedo network involved both underage girls and boys and were perpetrated by Catholics/Clergy, Football / sports coaches, entertainers, british intelligence, police and high level politicians / gentry.  You know, the usual suspects.  And less than 10 females involved in the above, with the exception of the Yewtree findings which ... no one can know how vast that network is, but that it

       I didn't check all your posts real careful but I didn't notice the Pedoahile Information Exchange 1974 to 1984. Among its members was Peter Hayman second in command at MI6. Caught with pornagraphic pedo material he wasn't prosecuted because it could be used as blackmail against him( which makes no damn sense) and that he wasn't an "executive" board member of PIE. Also that the child porn found wasn't radical enough, whatever the fuck that means. 5 members of the board were prosecuted though.

       Glad I could help. There's an Australian 60 minutes piece on you tube that talks about the case and one of the victims absolutely identifies Hayman. There is also a horrifying interview with a PIE member justifying consensual sex with a ten year old. He claims the only trauma to the kids is the authorities calling it wrong. The scary part is most of these guys don't even think what they are doing is wrong.

       Right but there was no arrest so we can't include that one....still many believe he absolutely was involved.  I don't see how he coudln't be.  People don't spend that much time and energy (and money) draggging their children through the trauma of bringing false accusations against a powerful person like that, knowing they are connected with intelligence and miltary and other satanic networks....knowing there will be consequences.  You don't start fights with powerful people in order to lose.

       This is what I fear most; that yet again, another horrific
       <em>
        cell
       </em>
       is exposed and the perpetrators skate under the wire! That the victims and survivors are condemned, ridiculed and forgotten!

       Keep up your excellent work in here!

       Why'd you lead with one that actually was a hoax? Wouldn't it have been better to begin with the sex tapes of Reagan and others Vickie Morgan claimed to have before she was beaten to death by her ex-bf the next day?

       It might also be fruitful to look into Kevin Annett's research. He seems like a crackpot on the surface, but he has a lot of information about the past pope, the current pope, and their ma fia ties ('n d r a n g h e t a and c o m o r r a), as well as human traff icking in the past and present day in Canada.

       That's what I thought too!!!  Wow.  As I was writing it, I was like...hmm these fellows seem like scapegoats.  But then I crossreferenced and looked at witness testimonies and no these guys are bad dudes.

       BUt that doesn't mean that there aren't Saviles, in fact these sloppy mafiosos are just helping the hellfire white freemasons rape kids and drink their blood that much harder.  in other words, they are useful. Maybe that's why they want to import syrians....more human shields to scapegoat criminality
