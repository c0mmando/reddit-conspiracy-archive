       Why are people reflecting blame off the gunmen and instead trying to blame it on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The man acted alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       He went there on his own intention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are people trying to say it's someone else's fault when he was the one that took it upon himself to go there himself with a weapon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and conquer perhaps?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever happened to taking responsibility for your actions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are people blaming other people instead of blaming the guy that acted on his own free will to go there?
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm here, I'm going to post this evidence that cemented my fact that there are suspicious things going on that need to be exposed.

       I don't think this sub is the particular target. However, Reddit being mentioned as banning the sub and Spez making the national level last week does focus energy here. As shitty as the content and these comments have become, YouTube and Facebook are worse.

       Yes this sub is targetted and so is pizzagate and conspiracy theories more generically.  It's a total media-manufactured hit job.  A false flag / false victimhood.  Totally scripted.  Alefantis said basically 'this is what happens when you have unfounded accusations and conspiracy theories'; which means that it's manufacturing consent in the mind of the public to curb free speech and make 'conspiracy theories' illegal and thus make it also ok for Obama to pass legislation to eliminate the "russian intelligence driven" alt media as antistate propaganda--you know like that damn russian James Corbett or Alex Jones  lol
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a narrative they are trying to play now, to manufacture consent to give up our speech rights

       According to this article:

       </a>
       they're targetting Reddit and more. Read the last line of the article where it states:
       <strong>
        "The FBI and police have since instructed the completely unsubstantiated story be removed from sites such as Facebook and Reddit."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then ask yourself how an Australian news outlet has this information?

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Simple, it's a diversion tactic. If a group of people have enough evidence about a conspiracy based on the RICO Act, to indict hundreds of politicians around the world, then those stand accused will do all they can to try and point the finger at the investigators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steps to discount a group:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hire a stupid actor (not wily enough to circumvent your tactics) using a fully enforceable non-disclosure agreement, send him to target location to cause a ruckus,  then when local police arrest him, you can publicize whatever story to meet your agenda, then a certain spy agency can go to the police station, bail him out based on National Security reasons, pay him whatever (probably less given this is a criminal enterprise under another guise) was agreed on, keep tabs on him so he doesn't become a whistle-blower.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's honestly getting so predictable. The only reason tptb are using an actor is because they need a plausible event so that local police think it's a legitimate event.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you interview them months later, if the attending police can even talk about it (probably not), they will say:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The situation was about bit weird
       </li>
       <li>
        Evidence was confiscated for national security reasons
       </li>
       <li>
        The suspect didn't seem with it, like he was hallucinating (read hypnotized, possibly drug induced psychotic episode)
       </li>
       <li>
        Coinciding events are disjointed, like the suspect's friend or colleague has a questionable background, like was linked to the CIA or something, or a related event doesn't make sense etc.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       All these types of events have repeating patterns. TPTB are losing control to convince the masses and hide their agenda, and they are getting more desparate, with fewer resources.
