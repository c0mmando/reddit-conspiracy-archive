        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is the thread in question: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5gmvye/more_than_half_us_aid_goes_to_israel_and_its_govt/">https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5gmvye/more_than_half_us_aid_goes_to_israel_and_its_govt/</a></p>

<p>Go to <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, sort Top, by Past Week, should be on the front page. It&#39;s not there. Ctrl-F to search for it, you won&#39;t find it.</p>

<p>This was on the front page, but now users are unable to find the thread without a direct link. Sort the comments by &#39;new&#39; see that my comment from <em>19 hours ago on one of the most upvoted threads of the day</em> was the very last comment made, which asked why the thread was censored.</p>

<p>Edit: Aaron Swartz is rolling in his grave. He (of Jewish descent) would not have intended Reddit to be a platform to serve political interests. He advocated open information. This has nothing to do with anti-Israeli sentiment. This is about media, including social media, censoring what news people are allowed to see to serve special political interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I&#39;m actually the one who submitted the article to <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5gmvye/more_than_half_us_aid_goes_to_israel_and_its_govt/">Here&#39;s a link to the thread</a>.</p>

<p>I contacted the mods about it and they said it was removed because it is an opinion/analysis piece, and that mondoweiss is not a credible news source because it is a &quot;blog.&quot; Although I can see where they&#39;re coming from, I find it rather annoying that they waited until it had over 5k upvotes, was gilded, and had hit the front page of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> before they decided to remove it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure a lot of pro-Israel Redditors spammed the mods to get it removed. Again, I agree that mondoweiss isn&#39;t the best source, but they were actively removing comments in that thread all day. They had plenty of time to remove the submission. </p>

<p>For the record, I don&#39;t think this is full blown censorship. I do think a group of Redditors rallied to get it removed, and the mods apologized that it took then so long to take action. That doesn&#39;t make it any less annoying, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really think that&#39;s fair though? It was the 3rd most upvoted post that day, reaching the front page of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and it is about news. The title states facts about foreign aid amounts and a statement from Kerry who is Secretary of State. Everything in the title is news. I do agree there is some opining going on in that article, but that would be an inconsistent reason to edit a gilded, 3rd most upvoted post that day, completely off of reddit without a direct link, given that there are other posts in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> which have more opinion thrown in and are not removed. I think it&#39;s still a clear-cut case of censorship.</p>

<p>Well, this is interesting!</p>

<p>I was perusing yesterday&#39;s (deleted) r/news thread, and saw something that looked familiar.</p>

<p><strong>What a coincidence!</strong> I guess it&#39;s true that <em>&quot;great minds think alike&quot;</em>, huh?</p>

<p>&quot;This sub&quot; is not a single sentient being, rather, it is merely a platform that allows folks - over 400,000 different individuals - to communicate and discuss various issues. As such, &quot;this sub&quot; is incapable of &quot;hate&quot;, or any other emotion. :-)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The thread addressed a VERY controversial topic - and in spite of all the upvotes, it got pulled. I suspect that is why some folks have asserted that it was &quot;censored&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yes, Spez is Jewish, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that so? That&#39;s interesting - but is it relevant? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but not every Jew is involved in a clandestine cabal.</p>

<p>Who says that the thread was pulled by u/Spez? It could have been any of the mods, no?</p>

<p>Methinks you may be having a &quot;victimhood breakdown&quot;. Maybe a nice cup of chamomile tea would help?</p>
