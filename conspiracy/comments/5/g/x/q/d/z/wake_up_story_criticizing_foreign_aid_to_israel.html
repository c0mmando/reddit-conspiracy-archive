      </p>
      <p>
       This was on the front page, but now users are unable to find the thread without a direct link. Sort the comments by 'new' see that my comment from
       <em>
        19 hours ago on one of the most upvoted threads of the day
       </em>
       was the very last comment made, which asked why the thread was censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Aaron Swartz is rolling in his grave. He (of Jewish descent) would not have intended Reddit to be a platform to serve political interests. He advocated open information. This has nothing to do with anti-Israeli sentiment. This is about media, including social media, censoring what news people are allowed to see to serve special political interests.

       Hey, I'm actually the one who submitted the article to
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5gmvye/more_than_half_us_aid_goes_to_israel_and_its_govt/">
        Here's a link to the thread
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I contacted the mods about it and they said it was removed because it is an opinion/analysis piece, and that mondoweiss is not a credible news source because it is a "blog." Although I can see where they're coming from, I find it rather annoying that they waited until it had over 5k upvotes, was gilded, and had hit the front page of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       before they decided to remove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure a lot of pro-Israel Redditors spammed the mods to get it removed. Again, I agree that mondoweiss isn't the best source, but they were actively removing comments in that thread all day. They had plenty of time to remove the submission.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I don't think this is full blown censorship. I do think a group of Redditors rallied to get it removed, and the mods apologized that it took then so long to take action. That doesn't make it any less annoying, though.

       Do you really think that's fair though? It was the 3rd most upvoted post that day, reaching the front page of
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       and it is about news. The title states facts about foreign aid amounts and a statement from Kerry who is Secretary of State. Everything in the title is news. I do agree there is some opining going on in that article, but that would be an inconsistent reason to edit a gilded, 3rd most upvoted post that day, completely off of reddit without a direct link, given that there are other posts in
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       which have more opinion thrown in and are not removed. I think it's still a clear-cut case of censorship.

       This is what happens when you let others define your rights. Moderators are criminals. All of them.

       Are you a legal person online? Don't give me the "it's their website" shit. Are you a legal person online?

      <p>
       Cause if not I could just bomb Reddit or shoot some admins. Can't even be liable for the threat cause I'm not a legal person. That's why you get to ban me and my content. That's the law

       You're not allowed to criticize israel its anti semotic. Even if a jew crew of 5 people were dancing jubilantly at the explosion of the twin towers and later found with explosives. Stating this fact is clearly anti semotic as jews aren't physically capable of doing anything wrong even if you see it and document it right in front of your eyes.

       actually the majority of Hasidics don't agree with Zionism and if you read about the creation of the new Isreal you will learn that the Hasidics and most the Orthodox boycotted the new flag; they called the hexagram a pagan symbol that had no history in the Talmud or Torah and they lobbied for the menorah on the flag instead.

       He screwed up the link. You can't have both www and np in the link or it isn't covered by the HTTPS cert mask. Just drop one or the other and you get no SSL error.

       If you look at the historical context it makes sense. It was a huge win for America because during the '50 and '60 Egypt was under Russian influence and this agreement moved Egypt further into the realm of Washington's influence.
Egypt had soviet technology in their military and Israel had far better US equipment. If peace were to last Egypt's military had to be modernized so it could feel more secure when compared to Israel.

       First time I've run across Mr. Bigly, but after chatting with both (88 sent me a PM), I'm convinced that they are one and the same.

       "This sub" is not a single sentient being, rather, it is merely a platform that allows folks - over 400,000 different individuals - to communicate and discuss various issues. As such, "this sub" is incapable of "hate", or any other emotion. :-)

       The thread addressed a VERY controversial topic - and in spite of all the upvotes, it got pulled. I suspect that is why some folks have asserted that it was "censored".
