       There are multiple threads in this sub about the European Commission threatening retaliation if

       </a>
       within 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also read
       <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/12/5/13842258/pizzagate-comet-ping-pong-fake-news">
        this propaganda article
       </a>
       where Vox.com desperately tries to debunk PizzaGate; but notice well that it simply repeats the phrases "fake news" and "totally false" close to half a dozen times; it doesn't actually offer any contradictory evidence.  The Daily Dot also called PizzaGate "
       <strong>
        <em>
         not even worth
        </em>
       </strong>
       fact-checking."
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at all the chaos that is going on here.  Look at how visibly terrified they all are; and ask yourselves this question.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         If this was really fake, why would it be exploding so much?
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They are shooting themselves in the foot.  The very fact in and of itself that there is so much effort to censor this and silence it, is proof that this is legitimate and
       <strong>
        <em>
         NOT
        </em>

       a hoax.

        <em>
         DO NOT GIVE UP ON THIS.  DO NOT LET THEM SCARE YOU INTO SILENCE.  WE MAY NOT HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE.

      </p>
      <p>
       This story must remain open, no matter what it takes, and the paedophiles
       <strong>
        <em>
         MUST
        </em>
       </strong>
       be brought to justice.  For all I know I am potentially endangering myself by even writing this, but I

       I want their tyranny to end now.  I want all of their sickness, and all of their predation to be exposed, and I want everyone to know about it, and I want them to be thrown in cages for the rest of their lives.
       <strong>
        <em>
         I WANT THE CHILDREN SAVED.  I WANT JUSTICE.
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been waiting for nearly 20 years for this.  I have given up almost my entire life to learn about them and what they do, and I have known about it for longer than most of the rest of you.  This is the time in which people like myself are finally vindicated, and this is the time in which the justice that we have craved for so long, is finally at hand.
      </p>

       <strong>
        <em>
         DO. NOT. STOP. PUSHING.

       Not for one second.  Not for a single moment.  The future of our entire species is at stake.  This is about nothing less than the survival of humanity.  This is the most fundamental conspiracy there is.  This is how humanity wins, and the noose of psychopathic tyranny is finally thrown off our species' and our world's neck, forever.

       Same here! Even the weirdest stories are NEVER classified as fake, they say something like it's sketchy. I've been watching news for 30 years...this is a first. They aggressively try to destroy the story without even looking at it. It it telling.

       Pedophilia is the strings with which people in power are controlled; globally. Only a person with these sick habits is allowed to rise to senior positions in the government; judges, head of states, military officials, financial and media mongrels, etc. This has been built up over decades. They now have influence and control over everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every one of them commits these abuses. They can do this as long as they do as they are told in exchange for power and immunity. If they don't comply, they are outed and publicly shamed, humiliated or worst. If you see a prominent figure going to jail for pedophilia, it is because he disobeyed or pissed someone off in their chain of command.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there is going to be an insane amount of push back. They will shut down the internet if it comes to that. They will nuke cities and start WW3. They cannot allow for their entire power structure  to collapse.

       You can't comment on the details of the case in /politics or /the_donald without having your post straight up ghost deleted. Voat scrubbed an entire thread that was about posts getting removed itself and it didn't show up in their removed submissions.

       It's not just the MSM trying to "counter" it; it's the fact that thousands of paid shills have flooded this sub (and other subs) desperately trying to discredit PizzaGate.

       Not even close.  As much of a false flag as 911 is, there simply wasn't as vociferous an outrage and a cry
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       those looking for the truth of a situation as the MSM is attempting to pour on pizzagate.

       That's because they knew no one could do anything about 911. People were helpless. Now we have the Internet at our fingertips. Unlimited information in real time. Open sourced and away from their control. Once we get our hands on a smoking gun, the Internet will forever be recognized as the single most important tool to protest free speech and the truth. And the saturation of news has become a screaming match aimed at dividing the population. And it's working. Except our side is the only one with facts and evidence behind it. And once we reach the tipping point, the spread of information will be so powerful, we will see a change in the general perspective of the world. It's inevitable at this point.

       I certainly hope so...but am very not sure.  We still need to actively fight in order to make sure the tide turns in favor of those attempting to uncover the hidden truth that the MSM and TPTB keep desperately trying to blind people from.

       That's probably because the internet was pretty rudimentary as far as social media goes. YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, all the tools people are using to easily spread the pizzagate stuff didn't exist. This is small potatoes next to the 9/11 stuff as far as conspiracy goes.

       Not even close.  There is literally
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       on the planet - nothing in the entire history of humanity - that is more damning than the raping and killing of the absolute most important, most vulnerable, most valuable members of the species:  It's children; the progeny of its next generation; those in charge of continuing the values and successes of the civilization as a whole.  Without them, without ensuring their protection and their safety,
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       matters.  The entire species is done and gone.

       911 was a horrific false flag attack to be sure.  No downplaying it even a little.
      </p>
      <p>
       A systematic, predatory child abuse epidemic, however, makes 911 - as absolutely massive a crime against all of humanity as that definitely was/is - look like petty theft.

       Just because pedophilia rings have been outed before does not automatically mean this one. It needs to be proven first. There is not one person linked to a specific act.

       The potential of what the crime is in pizzagate - what the crime actually is if pizzagate is true - is in fact far, far worse than 911.  Again, 911 was absolutely horrible.  No denying that.  No one's trying to play that down.  At all.  However, people - specifically grown, adult, independent human beings - get killed and murdered all the time on this God forsaken planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's actually quite a different thing altogether than dealing with the molesting, raping, and killing of innocent young children - the figures in a society that are its youngest, most vulnerable, most dependent members which need our help and guidance and proper upbringing the most.  These are the members of a society that are its most precious and important resource actually, for without them, the society simply cannot prosper and continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, yeah.  An organized racket that's designed to damage
       <em>
        them?
       </em>
       And that's aided and abetted by the very organizations in a society that are designed to help and prevent that damage?  Yeah.  Sorry, but that's actually
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       bigger than something as admittedly horrible as 911.

       9/11 alone killed, what, around 3500 people? How many of those were children?
      </p>
      <p>
       We then went to war because of 9/11 where I've seen numbers of 100,000 up to over 1,000,000 civilians were killed in Iraq alone from the war. How many of those were children?
      </p>
      <p>
       How many children has the US bombed and drone striked as part of their war on terror which is a direct result of 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's asinine of you to even argue against it, especially when we can actually see it happen almost on a weekly basis where the US kills some civilians with a drone strike. They've killed many, many children, injured more, and displaced more from their homes.

       Good points.  The collateral damage caused by 911 is absolutely massive.  Yes.  Correct.  Agreed.  I admit that I didn't consider it with regard to the effect it's had around the world in continued wars of aggression, etc.
      </p>

       The fact that pizzagate seems specifically geared toward children and pedophilia, however, I'd say makes it no less horrific.

       That's because this is just the tip of the pedo iceberg in D.C., they want to nip this in the bud before people start to realize it's connected to the bigger picture. In my opinion people should be focused on the situation as a whole and not just on the people involved in "#pizzagate".

       I am going to copy/paste my reply from another thread. Let's say I'm curious.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Some of the emails I have the most questions about.

       To which he replies - "I've never had an affair, so I pass the Walter Jones test." - Walter B. Jones has for 20 years been the U.S. Representative for North Carolina's 3rd congressional district; in DC he's regarded as the absurd caricature of a do-gooder, i.e. he is a noble man indeed.

       Those are what got me looking into the actual emails, because they just seemed strange. Then when you start adding up all the pedo logos from businesses on the same street as Comet Ping Pong. The creepy pictures and responses to Jimmy Comet's (James Alefantis) instagram photos and pics. How his instgram profile pic is of Antinous - A literal monument to pederasty. And all the pedo logos and direct mentions of pedophilia from more than a few bands that perform at Comet, and in their youtube music videos, that are linked on comet ping pong's website. It gets even more strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Podesta's have ties to more than a few convicted pedophiles, and even talk about, in an email, Dennis Hastert fleeing the country to an island in Japan, when being faced with charges.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when you see how similar (I mean, down to the mole on Tony Podesta's face) the Podesta brothers look to the efit sketches from Scottland Yard police department in regards to Madeleine McCann, and the fact that Podesta's emails start the day after McCann was kidnapped, it starts to spin the wheels.

       Bill Clinton has traveled privately to Jeffrey Epstein's (convicted pedophile and kidnapper) lolita island at least 26 times, ditching his secret service before some of them. Epstein has flown in prominent politicians to have sex with adolescent girls he had imprisoned. Epstein installed concealed cameras in numerous places on his property to record sexual activity with underage girls by prominent people for criminal purposes such as blackmail.
      </p>

      <p>
       In January 2015, a 31-year-old American woman, Virginia Roberts, alleged in a sworn affidavit that at the age of 17, she had been held as a sex slave by Epstein and he trafficked her to several people, including Prince Andrew and Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.

       Then when you see how fast the media responds immediately to "pizzagate" calling it fake, fake news, debunked, alt-right, fictitious etc, without actually addressing the pedo logos from businesses and bands, the Podesta McCann connection, or doing any investigative journalism it raises questions to me. Plus the government passing bill HR6393, and a shady group of anonymous people that get to decide what is "russian propaganda" and possibly censor the internet.

      <p>
       Then when you learn that the pizza shop owner lives in the same neighborhood as Podesta, and Obama bought a house in the same neighborhood too, that just adds a bit to the strangeness. Also the fact that Alefantis has visited the white house at least 5 times, and visited with Obama at least one of those times.

       There are many more things that seem to connect top level elites to pedophilia, dating far back (Franklin Scandal Coverup that implemented many high level Republicans in a pedo ring, Jimmy Savile, Mark Foley, Dennis Hastert, and more - all proven cases). Once you start really digging, it all starts to seem a bit more plausible. These things do happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to the fact that the Clinton Foundation CEO (Eric Braverman) is missing, Assange is assumed missing or compromised (
       <a href="/r/whereisassange">

       ), Marina Abramovic's twitter was suspended, and John Podesta hasn't tweeted since the election (which is strange), things get even more weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not completely convinced about the email/pedo connection yet, but I am very curious. Just remember, as much as someone who has been looking into this stuff for a while could suffer from "confirmation bias", someone who hasn't really even scratched the surface yet could suffer from "cognitive dissonance". Feel free to really dig in and come to your own conclusions though.

       Okay, I don't value my time at all so I'm gonna spend a few minutes going through this with my skeptic hat on;
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Dominos Link
       </strong>
       - The main body of the email reads like the Podestas usually send an assortment of pastas and sauces as a holiday gift, but this year sent cheeses. The first sentence Re: strategy reads like a joking nod to the way they would normally email each other professionally. The 'dominos' p.s. is strange, but then again if it were an inside joke between them we'd have no context to understand it so of course it would seem strange to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Hot dog link
       </strong>
       - Reads like he's stressed out and looking to vent. Again the 'hot dog stand' line is strange, but like I said in the last one if it were an inside joke between them we wouldn't get it anyway. "Your hot dog stand" doesn't have to mean 'the hot dog stand you own,' it could as easily mean 'the hot dog stand you like.' These guys have known each other since the 90s, it's not unreasonable to think they may have spent time together in Hawaii, during which time they went to a hot dog stand together. The title of the email suggests he is feeling nostalgic, so this wouldn't be totally unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Austin link
       </strong>
       - Pretty clearly a joke, especially considering the reply email.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Uber link
       </strong>
       - Where is the 'Walter' reply? I don't see it on there. As for the rest of it, the line "Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to the farm" implies they have done this trip before, which makes the line "Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7)" make sense. She's updating friends on the ages of her kids, since they haven't seen them in a while (and furthermore, "almost 7" reads affectionate, not predatory. I reckon if she were selling kids to pedos, she'd round that number down).

       - Completely unrelated to anything you've been talking about. Yeah that shit's super fishy, but it in no way adds or subtracts from the Podesta/Comet/Trafficking theories, so I'm not sure what it's doing here. It'd be like saying "I think Trump will start a nuclear war ... and ya know, we

      <p>
       The election is over, they need to fill time again. This story fits the narrative of Trump supporters as nutbar conspiracy theorists. It's perhaps disingenuous, but not really evidence of much more than the fact that the media is sensationalist, and we all know that already.

       </strong>
       - You're going real wide here, I'm not gonna go into all this because tbh it's a totally different issue. Government propaganda is real, government spying is real, desire for censorship is real, I just don't see how this particularly relates to Comet Ping Pong or John Podesta if we're still not totally clear on the details at the lowest level.

      <p>
       Aaaaand we're back. None of this is strange at all? How close are the houses? What are we defining as a neighborhood? Can you clarify this? I live in the same neighborhood as a lot of people, that doesn't really mean I have any particular association with them.

       What the fuck does any of this have to do with Comet Pizza? Again, you're zooming out the lens to this big picture conspiracy before you've really nailed down the details at the smallest level of this theory. This is just shitty practice if you want people to take this seriously.

       First I just want to say, thanks for taking the time to give such a detailed, skeptic, and civil reply. I have to leave for work soon, and won't be back for a while, but I wanted to make a few rebuttals before I have to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to take any time to rebut any of the actual emails, because I don't think they're that important honestly. Mostly because with the emails, it's pure speculation. At times I do believe they're speaking in code, but I'm not totally convinced it's pedo code. Some of them could be inside jokes, of age prostitution, drugs, or any other thing. That said, I've been around since long before there was an "offical" name for it, and I was adamantly and vocally against using the word pizzagate, mainly because it depended so much on the code from the emails. To me, the real issue is mainly about human trafficking, not always involving children.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I did want to reply a bit.

       ). Sex Stains is a band that performs at Comet Ping Pong. Not saying it's smoking gun evidence, it is rather strange. Add that to the constant direct references to pedophilia and child abuse that Majestic Ape makes in their videos, and there is kind of a pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two times Amanda Kleinman (Majestic Ape) directly references pedophilia. The two times directly are:

       Here are also some still shots that are shown in rapid succession from one of their videos

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, all of that stuff is speculation, and nothing like actual meat/evidence. Each one individually seems innocuous, but when all put together, does seem strange to me, you can make your own judgments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scotland yard link - if it were one of the Podestas, no problem I would completely agree, but both, down to the mole above the eyebrow. Also, what are the odds that the only 2 computer generated images released (the rest were hand drawn sketches) would look like the two Podesta brothers, down to the mole? That has to be a coincidence of extremely low percentage. Combine with the fact that Podesta's emails start the day after McCann was kidnapped, and Clement Freud (known pedophile) lived 3 minutes from where she was taken and the Podesta's are known friends and have been to his place before. It just seems odd to me, make your own conclusions.

       No, I believe this could be brought about specifically because of alternate information becoming more popular like "pizzagate". And it's happening at the same time as pizzagate. If the government wants certain information censored, this is how they can legally do it.

       I'm not saying it's proof that it is happening, I'm saying many people are unaware of it happening in the past. It's important for people to be aware of this, so they don't immediately dismiss it as something "ridiculous" on premise alone.

       But this is kinda the basis of the whole thing, isn't it? If this stuff isn't on point, then you're not really pointing at pedophilia or human trafficking, you're just pointing to people being connected, and then zooming out to the idea of government media control. That's all well and good and worth investigating, but it's not really the same thing anymore.

        Scotland yard link - if it were one of the Podestas, no problem I would completely agree, but both, down to the mole above the eyebrow. Also, what are the odds that the only 2 computer generated images released (the rest were hand drawn sketches) would look like the two Podesta brothers, down to the mole? That has to be a coincidence of extremely low percentage.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We'll have to agree to disagree about how much like the Podesta these images look, because as I said in my first post I just don't see it. The skinny ones look similar, but with several notable differences. The fat ones both have a mole (on different sides, at that), are white, and are both fat but that's where the similarities end.

        No, I believe this could be brought about specifically because of alternate information becoming more popular like "pizzagate". And it's happening at the same time as pizzagate. If the government wants certain information censored, this is how they can legally do it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But like I've been saying, the 'fake news' thing is different from Pizzagate. If the details surrounding the pedophilia and human trafficking aren't there, it doesn't make a ton of sense to connect Podesta/Comet Ping Pong to this. They just become different theories then.

        Clinton/Epstein - Completely unrelated to anything you've been talking about. Yeah that shit's super fishy, but it in no way adds or subtracts from the Podesta/Comet/Trafficking theories, so I'm not sure what it's doing here. It'd be like saying "I think Trump will start a nuclear war ... and ya know, we did drop nuclear weapons on Japan."

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       John Podesta had a senior position at the Clinton Foundation. The same organization that Epstein made an official claim to the US Attorney that he co-founded. This was a claim made by Epstein in regards to the charges brought against him for human trafficking to insinuate that the Clinton's foundation played an integral role in his human trafficking. It was a threat and one that was considered a threat to national security.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why then, is it so off topic to bring up Epstein and Clinton? It is very important to tie this case of known human trafficking to Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Podesta also served as chief of staff to Bill Clinton and is the former chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. So this should lead you to appreciate his close ties to a questionable foundation linked to Epstein's human trafficking.

       You seem to assume I've come to the conclusion that Pizzagate is 100% unquestionably correct. Why would we even investigate if this were the case?
      </p>
      <p>
       Epstein is a known pedophile connected to the Clintons. Critical thinking would suggest this is a natural starting point if we're going to look into Pizzagate. It's important to know what role Epstein played in the Clinton Foundation, especially if we're starting to suspect other people involved with the Clinton foundation of the same wrong doing.

       Great comment. This is what I am firmly convinced of pizzagate. Your comment is rooted entirely in fact, paints a picture that is hard to defend and doesn't even contain all of our evidence. There is still the Silsbi connections, the foundations "work" in Hati, the NCMEC board of directors and their ties back to Clinton. The missing kids in VA being about 7 times the national average, previous scandals like Larry King, Jimmy Savile, others and then there is this article written a few years ago...

       In my opinion we have so much pointing toward MASSIVE conspiracy we have to take our tactics off line and into our real lives.

       Good summary. There are hundreds of other links and clues as well, but as of right now you listed the most provable evidence. As long as we keep researching this it will come out. If they censor or kick people off of places like Twitter or Facebook for talking about this stuff, it only makes those people who may have been on the fence about these things more interested in them.

       Gab is taking off, VOAT is growing, sites like vid.me and others will replace youtube. We don't want any single sites or platforms to become monopolies. It is good to have multiple smaller platforms to keep things free from corruption.

       This is a good counter post. I hope people in the sub will appreciate the effort involved even it runs counter to what we want to believe. Personally I'm on the fence feels like the evidence is very finally balanced. That is in itself fairly intriguing.

       Notice there's a new angle of outburst on here against Pizzagate following every major breaking point. The "theory" the shills present you with are determined by the latest news to hit the alternative media on the topic. When it was obvious to everyone that the MSM and government are doing their best to denounce it and call it propaganda, their rhetoric immediately became "it's a psy-op to bring about censorship. Oddly that would insinuate that censorship should be implemented in order to prevent censorship.

       strangely enough, i've gotten 6 responses in the last 24 hours that were not there when i went to inbox. Not sure what's going on but something is looking a bit sketchy with my account, like they're getting accessed before i get to them. Your comment was one of them, so just a heads up to anyone who might be seeing weird stuff go on with their own accounts.

       It's ridiculous the type of logic they are trying to use. If fake news is bad because it can cause some one to go for vigilant justice then they shouldn't even report real news. How many people would love to beat the crap out of a convicted pedophile that is reported on the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the all the riots that came from reporting real news. I.E travyon martin, mike brown, etc. They might as well not report those so people don't riot. Those aren't the best examples because they was covered slantingly. The point still stands. Real news also hurts people. Just look at the election.

       I agree with you. If this is the story that it takes to bring the tyrants down once and for all, then so be it. They have had the blood of our ancestors and the blood of our children on their hands for long enough...and who knows what other atrocities they have committed. These royals and elites will soon get what they deserve.

       I don't think it will unless they successfully censor everything on the internet which is next to impossible to do. Humans fight back, it is our nature. More people will beginning using vpn's, tor, privacy extensions, and alternate media platforms. More people will beginning questioning things when they start being censored for just speaking their mind or questioning the narrative. It isn't going to be an overnight awakening, but more and more people are waking up right now and we need to be positive about the future as best we can.

       It's possible, anything is possible really. Just do your best to remain positive. I have been cynical for years due to what I learn that nobody else knows or cares about. More people are beginning to open up to this stuff now so we have a chance at defeating them and we need to act accordingly. We need to get people using different search engines, different social media platforms, and cancelling their cable subscriptions. The less money and control the establishment has, the better chance we have at overcoming them.

       what is that exactly.  Royals?  There is no monarchy here.  What elites are you speaking of?  I keep hearing this phrase and I wonder is it the boogeyman of your failed dreams or do you really go around saying the royals and elites are tyrants with blood of children on their hands.  Whose children?  I am pretty sure you have imagined other atrocities.  This coded phrase just astounds me right now. Just read it outloud and you will see how bizarrely ridiculous it is.

       The objective is to convince normies that NYTimes and WaPo and other big names are not as trustworthy as they think.  It's not an easy task.  Some people have been submitted to mainstream so long that it's like a religion.  They will condemn the writer, but not the entity as a whole.

       I cringe every time I see someone use the term "fake news" unironically. That term was obviously created by the MSM to quickly dismiss anything they don't like.  I don't know how no one else in gen pop doesn't see that, it's so frustrating.

       Yep this is very strange especially if you think about all of "alleged" accusations in the past within the scope of the news/alt news. Why didn't they go with fake news when the media made a big fuss about Obama not being a citizen. That should be easy to fact check yet it some how became a big fuss.

       I'm not entirely convinced they do child trafficking out their basemant or run a paedophile ring from it... but there is definitely something going on that isn't right with that place and surrounding places. If it wasn't a paedophile ring and was say.. money laundering/drugs instead then they'd still push back hard because they don't want anyone to look too closely at their business. But really if it was a pedo get together place where they exchange contacts or arrange deals say.. it's just the tip of the iceberg. When you think of all the football places, or places set up for vulnerable kids.. or  hollywood.. It's just huge. It seems to me that groups of rich men/women + money = paedophilia in some degree. Not accusing ALL rich men of being pedos like but you get me..

       happen regardless if pizzagate is on the money or not, and that's why it is being taken so seriously by the media. The media who have been proven to be connected and told what to do by politician's and their influencers.

       Interesting that the Wikipedia page for pizzagate declares it "false" and "debunked". If it has not been debunked, genuinely, then shouldn't there be grounds to strike that type of phrasing from the page?

       The issue I take with the msm and this type of reddit post is, they both do the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You critise the msm for not investigating and just saying something generic like "fake news". Then you put in bold "if this was really fake, why would it be exploding so much?"
      </p>
      <p>
       What you've said doesn't mean anything. And  the next comment you say, the censorship is proof claims are legitimate. Which it isn't, you shouldn't need to use hyperbole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to be clear, I'm not against investigating this and I'm not saying the msm are right in there actions. I just feel this all or nothing approach does away with the innocent until proven guilty and anyone who disagrees is a shill is a really bad thing.

       I don't believe it is fake but other than the huge negative reaction by the msm I don't see much more than weak circumstantial evidence. 
I'm sure there is more but what is currently available isn't enough to prove anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep after the Clinton foundation and get more concrete evidence. I'm not defending pedos but there's more to it than is currently know at this point and it will take more to make the msm shut the fuck up about it being fake. I hope the msm gets torn down with the pedos.

       There is only circumstantial evidence, but it's not that weak. At this point it CANNOT be just brushed under the rug. It deserves investigation. What the MSM does is calling it fake without looking at it, without talking about the facts, and just blatantly lying about the ongoing investigation. It should be a big red flag in any normal person's mind.

       It certainly was for me. I had seen the pizzagate stuff, done some reading, and had more or less dismissed it as, at the very least, a lot of reaching with not much substance, and another Reddit Boston bomber investigation at worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I heard it come up on NPR, who consistently reinforced the 'fake news' angle every time it was referenced. It sounded
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       forced and a little bizarre. I had never heard anything so dismissive and NPR has never seemed like an organization to shame investigation of corruption. It made me think "Holy shit, am I being propagandized
       <em>
        right now?
       </em>

       I agree with the OP, I always say Pizzagate is a REAL scandal that could actually bring these people down once and for all. We have to keep focusing and digging and bringing new discoveries to light, but most importantly we CANT let up on the momentum. If this fizzles out, it would be a real crime.

       The most convincing thing in my estimation is the amount of CTR action going on here and elsewhere.  You'd think we were still in the middle of a tight presidential race.  They are going to enormous lengths to discredit this.  There's fire beneath this smoke.

       I'm Irish so I know all about Child abuse conspiracies, or "the catholic church" as we call it.  I also remember that Jimmy Saville in the UK was abusing children all over the place and the entire thing was brushed under the carpet by those high up in charities, hospitals and the police because he was good for fund raising. My mind is very open to a large conspiracy like this in the US.

       It's definitely getting the treatment of crazy conspiracy by many. I must say that any person with half a brain should see that something strange is happening. This needs to be investigated. Elite circles and pedophilia isn't a new thing though.

       Guys. This talk is going to result in somebody getting hurt. Potentially somebody innocent. If you want your hands to be clean then you need to find better "proof" than the assumptions that have been made about emails that "don't read right" and a weird Instagram page. The blood will be on your hands.

       Honestly, and hear me out, I think we should comply, to a degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I DO NOT think we should stop investigating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, I think people should be really careful with what they post on public forums.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself this: If there
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       any evidence of pedophila at Comet Ping Pong, say a hard drive, torture chamber, anything, do you really think it's still there, after all this publicity? The answer is no. They already changed the logo. Any evidence they may have had hidden at any locations exposed by this forum or anything, have since been covered up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The angle of everyone here is that the FBI, CPS, etc., are all complicit. We HAVE to admit to ourselves that that is an assumption, just a theory. We can't continue to assume that it is true. Even if there are people in the FBI who
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       complicit, I can guarantee you that it isn't 100%. There is bound to be a sort of Fox Mulder or Dale Cooper type figure who isn't part of the conspiracy and wants the truth. If that's the case, by publicly exposing the evidence we find, we are only helping the criminals cover it up. We are hurting any real investigation that might be taking place. Like it or not, this whole thing will go NOWHERE without the help of people in official positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I think we should take discussions more underground. There should be closed forums and IRC channels to discuss the real evidence being discovered. These people should find ways to channel that information to proper, trusted authority contacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should limit discussion of it in this subreddit to whatever won't get this subreddit shut down, and won't compromise any investigations. If you really care about this investigation, you'd be more than willing to move to more private, effective channels for investigating it. If all you want to do is witch hunt, you're a slacktivist fool.

       The sub with the most "insane" userbase end up being the ones who are trying to save the most innocent part of our population: children.

       Meanwhile, the people (our government) who are the "do-gooders" are the ones taking advantage of these children in the most sinister way possible.

       I won't be convinced until someone can tell me where the "Pedo Code" that forms the bedrock of the conspiracy, outlined
       <a href="https://i.sli.mg/eoWIeB.jpg">
        here
       </a>
       (words such as "chicken lover" meaning boy lover and ""ice cream" meaning male prostitute) was sourced from, and produce verifiable evidence that the phrases outlined in that document have been used since before last month and have direct ties to pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I am concerned, there is no conspiracy if there were no code words in Podesta's emails, as from what I gather those email code words from the fundamental basis of this conspiracy.

       I am 80% to believing the pizzagate thing. I have to address one point though:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If this was really fake, why would it be exploding so much?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Could be Russian Propaganda. Think about it, if the Russians wanted to dissolve the US government and many other western governments, this would be a great way to do it. If they feel like they got a toehold on this story, they could be pushing it very hard to try and destabilize the united states. I'm 80% sure it's real, but 20% of me still thinks this could be a very elaborate plan by a foreign government to destabilize several western nations' governments. After all, the saudis own the entire block that comet pizza is on...

       Pasting this courtesy of ZH user Tarzan,  IMO should not be missed:
      </p>
      <p>
       The real story, being buried, is the Clinton Foundation.  If justice were blind, it would land them both in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just six days after Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server was first revealed in a story on the front page of the New York Times on March 2, 2015, Benioff invited Powell to a small dinner he was hosting at his home for Clinton. He excitedly told Powell, "I'm sure she would be thrilled to say hello to you!" Benioff intended to raise about $500,000 for the Clinton Foundation, which he thinks "does very good work in the world." Powell immediately forwarded the invite to his personal assistant with a laughing emoji.
      </p>
      <p>
       Powell’s response to Benioff was blunt: "We can shake hands if we pass each other, but no real need. Don't want to generate another 'emailgate' story and don't want to be at a Foundation fundraiser. Don't push to make it happen." He also explained that though he and Hillary "are very close and have been for years," he is annoyed at her team for linking his private email use with her situation. He also snapped that Hillary "once said she voted for the 2003 war because of my U.N. speech. I had to remind her that she voted for it three months before my speech. :)"
      </p>
      <p>
       Powell knew, Just six days after emailgate broke, to steer clear of the Clinton Foundation. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       don't want to be at a Foundation fundraiser
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the meat of why Hillary lost, it's the one story they want buried most.  Their contributors are running for the exit, Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       These foundations play cover for all sorts of nefarious crap.

        The charity foundation founded by former Penn State coach and convicted child molester, Jerry Sandusky is going out of business. The Board of Directors of The Second Mile foundation filed last Friday, January 8 in Centre County Court

       Just like Jimmy Savile, Jerry used his foundation to traffic kids for sex

        EXCLUSIVE: Slush funds to pay 'personal consultant' Huma Abedin, a $34,000 a night Caribbean holiday for daughter Chelsea and payoffs to silence Bill's sex accusers - How Hillary has used donations to the Clinton Foundation as her ‘personal piggy bank’
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Jerome Corsi claims in his book, Partners in Crime, that the Clinton Foundation is 'a vast, criminal conspiracy' and 'a slush fund for grifters'
        The money that was donated to help earthquake victims in India and Haiti and HIV/AIDs sufferers has mostly enriched the Clintons, Corsi claims
        The Clinton family also schemed to monetize the White House 
        Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to leverage lucrative deals for the Foundation as well as six-figure speaking fees for Bill Clinton
        The scheme engineered through the Foundation has the Clintons by hundreds of millions of dollars.  It also added $2billion to the Clinton Foundation and raised $1billion for Hillary's second run for the presidency
Corsi claims that the Clinton Foundation is 'a philanthropic foundation the Clintons appear to use as a personal piggy bank'

       No, you purposely came here to shit on the opinions that people in this sub hold. That's no "just making a comment" that's brigading. Just like you did with the mensrights sub. You're a troll, you don't deserve to be taken seriously so you aren't. Get over it.

       You are not allowed to have a dissenting opinion, because if you ever have an opinion that disagrees with the subreddit you happen to be commenting on that's called brigading.

       If you have a past history of being a trolling douche who goes into other subs strictly to shit on their beliefs, and then go back to EnoughTrumpSpam to tell them how cool you are for getting banned, you will be known as a trolling douche.

       For someone who has stalked me so thoroughly you sure do have some fundamental misunderstandings about me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I rarely ever comment on ETS. If you count my comments, I literally probably have commented more frequently on adviceanimals or funny more, and I
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       have commented more on blackpeopletwitter, me_irl, and askreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ dude. If you're going to stalk me, at least do it right.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the only time I even talked about getting banned from a sub was when I talked about how
       <a href="/r/The_Deplorables">
        /r/The_Deplorables
       </a>
       banned me solely, and only, because I commented that a post that blatantly disparaged black people went against the no racism rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not "bragging about how cool I am for getting banned". That's pointing out how fucktarded and totalitarian their moderation team is.

       Hahaha oh jeez. Okay, let me get this straight. So you went in and basically called them racist, and then were surprised you were banned. And then went back to ETS to brag about how you stood up for black people. And you don't think you're a huge troll douche?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are honestly making my argument for me. Called thedonald racist, got banned, than went back to ets to virture signal about standing up to racism? You're a caricature and you don't even realize it.

       It's actually genuinely amazing how you're able to fabricate this radically different scenario from the words I said, entirely in your head, in a vain attempt to try to make me look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment is only rational if it is
       <strong>
        literally impossible
       </strong>
       for a post on the Donald to violate their no racism rule, or if it is
       <strong>
        literally impossible
       </strong>
       for their mods to ban someone who pointed this out if it happened. Otherwise, your assumptions are nonsensical and irrational, and you could only possibly have made them because of your biases beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you have exhibited this exact same behavior before, so it's not really surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest I'm kinda grateful that you exist and that you have taken an interest in stalking me because I matter so much to you. You are a reminder that some people are simply incapable of exhibiting even the most basic critical thinking skills. Which is important to remember when dealing with your kind.

       Really? All the major news outlets are covering it. That's pretty serious. A sub dedicated to it got to 25k users in a week or so. There's constantly 1-3k online on the voat sub.

       You found proof beyond a shadow of a doubt?  Well, if so, it is your personal duty to take that evidence of yours to the nearest police station or fbi office and press charges.  Think of the children!

       I cringe every time I see someone use the term "fake news" unironically. That term was obviously created by the MSM to quickly dismiss anything they don't like.  I don't know how no one else in gen pop doesn't see that, it's so frustrating.

       9/11 alone killed, what, around 3500 people? How many of those were children?
      </p>
      <p>
       We then went to war because of 9/11 where I've seen numbers of 100,000 up to over 1,000,000 civilians were killed in Iraq alone from the war. How many of those were children?
      </p>
      <p>
       How many children has the US bombed and drone striked as part of their war on terror which is a direct result of 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's asinine of you to even argue against it, especially when we can actually see it happen almost on a weekly basis where the US kills some civilians with a drone strike. They've killed many, many children, injured more, and displaced more from their homes.
